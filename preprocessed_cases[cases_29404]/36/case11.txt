after the abbotts,a married couple,moved to chile and separated,the chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their minor son,while awarding petitioner husband visitation rights.abbott also had a ne exeat right to consent before abbott could take out of the country under chile minors law minors law.when abbott brought to texas without permission from abbott or the chilean family court,abbott filed this suit in the federal district court,seeking an order requiring his son return to chile under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction convention and the implementing statute,the international child abduction remedies act icara,et.among its provisions,the convention seeks to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained in any contracting state,provides that such removal or retention is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was theretofore habitually resident,a,and where those rights had been actually exercised or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention,b and defines rights of custody to include the right to determine the child place of residence,a.the district court denied relief,holding that the father ne exeat right did not constitute a righ t of custody under the convention and,thus,that the return remedy was not authorized.the fifth circuit affirmed.
held a parent has a right of custody under the convention by reason of that parent ne exeat right.
a the convention applies because is under he was a habitual resident of chile and both chile and the united states are contracting states.the icara instructs the state or federal court in which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed to decide the case in accordance with the convention.b,d.
b that was wrongfully removed from chile in violation of a righ t of custody is shown by the convention text,by the state department views,by contracting states court decisions,and by the convention purposes.
chilean law determines the content of abbott right,while the convention text and structure resolve whether that right is a righ t of custody.minors law,provides that o nce the court has decreed that one of the parents has visitation rights,that parent authorization generally shall also be required before the child may be taken out of the country.because abbott has direct and regular visitation rights,it follows that he has a ne exeat right under article.the convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone,see a,and abbott ne exeat right is best classified as a joint right of custody,which the convention defines to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence,a.abbott right to decide country of residence allows him to determine the child place of residence,especially given the convention purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.it also gives him rights relating to the care of the person of the child,in that choosing residence country can determine the shape of his early and adolescent years and his language,identity,and culture and traditions.that a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional notions is beside the point because the convention definition of rights of custody controls.this uniform,approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the convention,foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under other legal traditions.in any case,this country has adopted modern conceptions of custody,joint legal custody,that accord with the convention broad definition.abbott mistakenly claims that a ne exeat right can not qualify as a right of custody because the convention requires that any such right be capable of exercis e.when one parent removes a child without seeking the ne exeat holder consent,it is an instance where the right would have been exercised but for the removal or retention,b.the fifth circuit conclusion that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a right of access is atexual,as a ne exeat right is not even arguably a right to take a child for a limited period of time.b.abbott argument that the ne exeat order in this case can not create a right of custody is not dispositive because abbott asserts rights under minors law,which do not derive from the order.
this court conclusion is strongly supported and informed by the longstanding view of the state department office of children issues,this country convention enforcement entity,that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.the court owes deference to the executive branch treaty interpretations.see sumitomo shoji america,avagliano.there is no reason to doubt this canon here.the executive,when dealing with delicate foreign relations matters like international child abductions,possesses a great store of information on practical realities such as the reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpretation and the impact that interpretation may have on the state department ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.
the court view is also substantially informed by the views of sister contracting states on the issue,see el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,particularly because the icara directs that uniform international interpretation of the convention is part of its framework,see b b.while the supreme court of canada has reached an arguably contrary view,and french courts are divided,a review of the international law confirms that courts and other legal authorities in england,israel,austria,south africa,germany,australia,and scotland have accepted the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the convention meaning.scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus on the matter.and the convention history is fully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights are just one of the many ways in which custody of children can be exercised.
the court holding also accords with the convention objects and purposes.there is no reason to doubt the ability of other contracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best interests of the children.to interpret the convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy,even when the other parent holds a ne exeat right,runs counter to the convention purpose of deterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier forum.denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action,removal of the child,that the convention was designed to prevent,while requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter abductions and respects the convention purpose to prevent harms to the child resulting from abductions.
c while a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy,return will not automatically be ordered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a convention exception,such as a grave risk that return would expose the child to harm or an otherwise intolerable situation,or the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient age and degree of maturity to state a preference,b.the proper interpretation and application of exceptions may be addressed on remand.
reversed and remanded.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents,as it has from its inception in the united states district court,a question of interpretation under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction convention,treaty doc.the united states is a contracting state to the convention and congress has implemented its provisions through the international child abduction remedies act icara,stat,et.the convention provides that a child abducted in violation of rights of custody must be returned to the child country of habitual residence,unless certain exceptions apply,treaty doc,at treaty doc.the question is whether a parent has a righ t of custody by reason of that parent ne exeat right the authority to consent before the other parent may take the child to another country.
timothy abbott and jacquelyn vaye abbott married in england in.he is a british citizen,and she is a citizen of the united states.abbott astronomy profession took the couple to hawaii,where their son was born in.the abbotts moved to la serena,chile,in.there was marital discord,and the parents separated in march.the chilean courts granted the mother daily care and control of the child,while awarding the father direct and regular visitation rights,including visitation every other weekend and for the whole month of february each year.app.
chilean law conferred upon abbott what is commonly known as a ne exeat right a right to consent before abbott could take out of chile.see minors law,chile,app.to pet.for cert.granting a ne exeat right to any parent with visitation rights.in effect a ne exeat right imposes a duty on one parent that is a right in the other.after abbott obtained a british passport for,abbott grew concerned that abbott would take the boy to britain.she sought and obtained a ne exeat of the minor order from the chilean family court,prohibiting the boy from being taken out of chile.
in august,while proceedings before the chilean court were pending,the mother removed the boy from chile without permission from either the father or the court.a private investigator located the mother and the child in texas.in february,the mother filed for divorce in texas state court.part of the relief she sought was a modification of the father rights,including full power in her to determine the boy place of residence and an order limiting the father to supervised visitation in texas.this litigation remains pending.
abbott brought an action in texas state court,asking for visitation rights and an order requiring abbott to show cause why the court should not allow abbott to return to chile with a.in february,the court denied abbott requested relief but granted him liberal periods of possession of throughout february,provided abbott remained in texas.app.
in may,abbott filed the instant action in the united states district court for the western district of texas.he sought an order requiring his son return to chile pursuant to the convention and enforcement provisions of the icara.in july,after holding a bench trial during which only abbott testified,the district court denied relief.the court held that the father ne exeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the convention and,as a result,that the return remedy was not authorized.supp.
the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed on the same rationale.the court held the father possessed no rights of custody under the convention because his ne exeat right was only a veto right over his son departure from chile.the court expressed substantial agreement with the court of appeals for the second circuit in croll croll.relying on american dictionary definitions of custody and noting that ne exeat rights can not be actually exercised within the meaning of the convention,croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of custody,at quoting b,treaty,at.a dissenting opinion in croll was filed by sotomayor.the dissent maintained that a ne exeat right is a right of custody because it provides a parent with decisionmaking authority regarding a child international relocation.at.
the courts of appeals for the fourth and ninth circuits adopted the conclusion of the croll majority.see fawcett mcroberts,gonzalez gutierrez.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has followed the reasoning of the croll dissent.furnes reeves.certiorari was granted to resolve the conflict.
the convention was adopted in in response to the problem of international child abductions during domestic disputes.the convention seeks to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.treaty,at.
the provisions of the convention of most relevance at the outset of this discussion are as follows 
article the removal or the retention of the child is to be considered wrongful where a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
article for the purposes of this convention a rights of custody shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence b rights of access shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.
article where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of article the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.at.
the convention central operating feature is the return remedy.when a child under the age of has been wrongfully removed or retained,the country to which the child has been brought must order the return of the child forthwith,unless certain exceptions apply.see,ibid.a removal is wrongful where the child was removed in violation of rights of custody.the convention defines rights of custody to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.a,at.a return remedy does not alter the allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial decisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence,at.the convention also recognizes rights of access,but offers no return remedy for a breach of those rights.b,at.
the united states has implemented the convention through the icara.the statute authorizes a person who seeks a child return to file a petition in state or federal court and instructs that the court shall decide the case in accordance with the convention.a,b,d.if the child in question has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention,the child shall be promptly returned,unless an exception is applicable.a.
as the parties agree,the convention applies to this dispute.is under years old he was a habitual resident of chile and both chile and the united states are contracting states.the question is whether was wrongfully removed from chile,in other words,whether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.this court inquiry is shaped by the text of the convention the views of the united states department of state decisions addressing the meaning of rights of custody in courts of other contracting states and the purposes of the convention.after considering these sources,the court determines that abbott ne exeat right is a right of custody under the convention.
the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.medellín texas.this court consults chilean law to determine the content of abbott right,while following the convention text and structure to decide whether the right at issue is a righ t of custody.
chilean law granted abbott a joint right to decide his child country of residence,otherwise known as a ne exeat right.minors law,chile,app.to pet.for cert,provides that o nce the court has decreed that one of the parents has visitation rights,that parent authorization shall also be required before the child may be taken out of the country,subject to court override only where authorization can not be granted or is denied without good reason.abbott has direct and regular visitation rights and it follows from chilean law,that he has a shared right to determine his son country of residence under this provision.app.to support the conclusion that abbott right under chilean law gives him a joint right to decide his son country of residence,it is notable that a chilean agency has explained that minors law is a right to authorize the minors exit from chile and that this provision means that neither parent can unilaterally establish the child place of residence.letter from paula strap camus,director general,corporation of judicial assistance of the region metropolitana,to national center for missing and exploited children,app.to pet.for cert.in villegas duran arribada beaumont,cert.pending.
the convention recognizes that custody rights can be decreed jointly or alone,see a,treaty,at and abbott joint right to determine his son country of residence is best classified as a joint right of custody,as the convention defines that term.the convention defines rights of custody to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.a,ibid.abbott ne exeat right gives him both the joint right to determine the child place of residence and joint rights relating to the care of the person of the child.
abbott joint right to decide country of residence allows him to determine the child place of residence.the phrase place of residence encompasses the child country of residence,especially in light of the convention explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.see convention preamble,treaty,at.and even if place of residence refers only to the child street address within a country,a ne exeat right still entitles abbott to determine that place.d etermine can mean t o fix conclusively or authoritatively,webster new international dictionary ed.definition,but it can also mean t o set bounds or limits to,ibid.definition,which is what abbott ne exeat right allows by ensuring that can not live at any street addresses outside of chile.it follows that the convention protection of a parent custodial right to determine the child place of residence includes a ne exeat right.
abbott joint right to determine country of residence also gives him rights relating to the care of the person of the child.a,treaty,at.few decisions are as significant as the language the child speaks,the identity he finds,or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.these factors,so essential to,are linked in an inextricable way to the child country of residence.one need only consider the different childhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows up in the united states,chile,germany,or north korea,to understand how choosing a child country of residence is a right relating to the care of the person of the child.the court of appeals described abbott right to take part in making this decision as a mere veto,at but even by that truncated description,the father has an essential role in deciding the boy country of residence.for example,abbott could condition his consent to a change in country on moving to a city outside chile where abbott could obtain an astronomy position,thus allowing the father to have continued contact with the boy.
that a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional notions of physical custody is beside the point.the convention defines rights of custody,and it is that definition that a court must consult.this uniform,approach ensures international consistency in interpreting the convention.it forecloses courts from relying on definitions of custody confined by local law usage,definitions that may undermine recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries or in different legal traditions,including the tradition.and,in any case,our own legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that accord with the convention broad definition.joint legal custody,in which one parent cares for the child while the other has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the child welfare,has become increasingly common.see singer,dispute resolution and the postdivorce family implications of a paradigm shift,family,a recent study of child custody outcomes in north carolina indicated that almost of all custody resolutions included joint legal custody,as did over of all mediated custody agreements maccoby mnookin,dividing the child social and legal dilemmas of custody f or of our entire sample,the california divorce decree provided for joint legal custody see generally elrod,reforming the system to protect children in high conflict custody cases,mitchell.
abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that a ne exeat right is not a right of custody because the convention requires that any right of custody must be capable of exercise.the convention protects rights of custody when at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.b,treaty,at.in cases like this one,a ne exeat right is by its nature inchoate and so has no operative force except when the other parent seeks to remove the child from the country.if that occurs,the parent can exercise the ne exeat right by declining consent to the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be in the child best interests.when one parent removes the child without seeking the ne exeat holder consent,it is an instance where the right would have been exercised but for the removal or retention.ibid.
the court of appeals conclusion that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would render the convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.the convention provides a return remedy when a parent takes a child across international borders in violation of a right of custody.the convention provides no return remedy when a parent removes a child in violation of a right of access but requires contracting states to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights.at.for example,a court may force the custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation,see,viragh foldes,or make other provisions for the noncustodial parent to visit his or her child,see b authorizing petitions to secur e the effective exercise of rights of access to a child but unlike rights of access,ne exeat rights can only be honored with a return remedy because these rights depend on the child location being the country of habitual residence.
any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a righ t of access is illogical and atextual.the convention defines rights of access as includ ing the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence,b,treaty,at,and icara defines that same term as visitation rights,the joint right to decide a child country of residence is not even arguably a right to take a child for a limited period of time or a visitation righ t.reaching the commonsense conclusion that a ne exeat right does not fit these definitions of rights of access honors the convention distinction between rights of access and rights of custody.
abbott argues that the ne exeat order in this case can not create a right of custody because it merely protects a court jurisdiction over the child.even if this argument were correct,it would not be dispositive.abbott contends the chilean court ne exeat order contains no parental consent provision and so awards the father no rights,custodial or otherwise.see brief for respondent but see supp,at,the district court treating the order as containing a consent provision,at same for the court of appeals.even a ne exeat order issued to protect a court jurisdiction pending issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing a parent to object to the child removal from the country.this court need not decide the status of ne exeat orders lacking parental consent provisions,however for here the father relies on his rights under minors law.abbott rights derive not from the order but from minors law.that law requires the father consent before the mother can remove the boy from chile,subject only to the equitable power family courts retain to override any joint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement.minors law see atkinson,modern child custody practice ed.t he court remains the final arbiter and may resolve the dispute between joint custodians itself or designate one parent as having final authority on certain issues affecting the child lombardo lombardo.app,w here the parents as joint custodians can not agree on important matters such as education,it is the court duty to determine the issue in the best interests of the child the consent provision in minors law confers upon the father the joint right to determine his child country of residence.this is a right of custody under the convention.
this court conclusion that abbott possesses a right of custody under the convention is supported and informed by the state department view on the issue.the united states has endorsed the view that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.in its brief before this court the united states advises that the department of state,whose office of children issues serves as the central authority for the united states under the convention,has long understood the convention as including ne exeat rights among the protected rights of custody.brief for united states as amicus curiae see sumitomo shoji america,avagliano,deferring to the executive interpretation of a treaty as memorialized in a brief before this court.it is well settled that the executive branch interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight.at.there is no reason to doubt that this canon of deference is appropriate here.the executive is well informed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting from this court interpretation of rights of custody,including the likely reaction of other contracting states and the impact on the state department ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.
this court conclusion that ne exeat rights are rights of custody is further informed by the views of other contracting states.in interpreting any treaty,t he opinions of our sister signatories are entitled to considerable weight.el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,quoting air france saks.the principle applies with special force here,for congress has directed that uniform international interpretation of the convention is part of the convention framework.see b b.
a review of the international case law confirms broad acceptance of the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.in an early decision,the english high court of justice explained that a father right to ensure that the child remain ed in australia or live d anywhere outside australia only with his approval is a right of custody requiring return of the child to australia.lords of the house of lords have agreed,noting that conclusion is settled,so far as the united kingdom is concerned and appears to be the majority view of the common law world.see in re d a child.
the supreme court of israel follows the same rule,concluding that the term custody should be interpreted in an expansive way,so that it will apply i n every case in which there is a need for the consent of one of the parents to remove the children from one country to another.ca foxman foxman,d,chagall transl.the high courts of austria,south africa,and germany are in accord.see oberster gerichtshof supreme court,ob austria since the english custody court had ordered that the children must not be removed from england and wales without the father written consent,both parents had,in effect,been granted joint custody concerning the children place of residence sonderup tondelli,sa,constitutional of south africa the mother failure to return to british columbia with the child was a breach of the conditions upon which she was entitled to exercise her rights of custody and therefore constituted a wrongful retention as contemplated by article of the convention bundesverfassungsgericht bverfg federal constitutional court of germany july,bvr,the convention requires a return remedy for a violation of the right to have a say in the child place of residence appellate courts in australia and scotland agree.see in the marriage of resina famca,may,csih.
it is true that some courts have stated a contrary view,or at least a more restrictive one.the canadian supreme court has said ne exeat orders are usually intended to protect access rights.thomson thomson,see.but the canadian cases are not precisely on point here.thomson ordered a return remedy based on an interim ne exeat order,and only noted in dicta that it may not order such a remedy pursuant to a permanent ne exeat order.see,at,at.involved a parent claim based on an implicit ne exeat right and,in any event,the court ordered a return remedy on a different basis.see,at,at.
french courts are divided.a french court of appeals held that the right to accept or refuse the removal of the children residence outside of a region was a joint exercise of rights of custody.public ministry,ca,crit.internat.privé.a trial court in a different region of france rejected this view,relying on the mother fundamental liberty to establish her domicil.see attorney for the republic at périgueux,périgueux,cr.internat.privé,note bertrand ancel,note 
scholars agree that there is an emerging international consensus that ne exeat rights are rights of custody,even if that view was not generally formulated when the convention was drafted in.at that time,joint custodial arrangements were unknown in many of the contracting states,and the status of ne exeat rights was not yet well understood.see conférence de la haye de droit international privé,enlèvement,morning meeting of,discussion by leal van boeschoten,in actes et documents de la quatorzième session,canadian and dutch delegates disagreeing whether the convention protected ne exeat rights,while agreeing that it should protect such rights.since,however,joint custodial arrangements have become more common.see supra,at.and,within this framework,most contracting states and scholars now recognize that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.see,hague conference on private international law transfrontier contact concerning children general principles and guide to good practice,p reponderance of the case law supports the view that ne exeat rights are rights of custody footnote omitted hague conference on private international law overall conclusions of the special commission of on the operation of the hague convention of on the civil aspects of international child abduction,reprinted in,hague conference on private international law report of the second special commission meeting to review the operation of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,reprinted in silberman,the hague child abduction convention turns twenty gender politics and other issues,int l pol,and whitman,croll croll the second circuit limits custody rights under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,tulane int l comp.
a history of the convention,known as the report,has been cited both by the parties and by courts of appeals that have considered this issue.see conférence de la haye de droit international privé,enlèvement,explanatory report report or report,in actes et documents de la quatorzième session.we need not decide whether this report should be given greater weight than a scholarly commentary.compare hague international child abduction convention text and legal analysis,fed.reg.identifying the report as the official history of the convention and a source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the convention with report,at the report has not been approved by the conference,and it is possible that,despite the rapporter sic efforts to remain objective,certain passages reflect a viewpoint which is in part subjective it suffices to note that the report supports the conclusion that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.the report explains that rather than defining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws of different nations pertaining to parental rights,the convention uses the unadorned term rights of custody to recognize all the ways in which custody of children can be exercised through a flexible interpretation of the terms used,which allows the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.at.thus the report rejects the notion that because ne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medical or some other important decisions about a child life they can not be rights of custody.indeed,the report is fully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights are just one of the many ways in which custody of children can be exercised.at.
adopting the view that the convention provides a return remedy for violations of ne exeat rights accords with its objects and purposes.the convention is based on the principle that the best interests of the child are well served when decisions regarding custody rights are made in the country of habitual residence.see convention preamble,treaty,at.ordering a return remedy does not alter the existing allocation of custody rights,at,but does allow the courts of the home country to decide what is in the child best interests.it is the convention premise that courts in contracting states will make this determination in a responsible manner.
custody decisions are often difficult.judges must strive always to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own society and culture,a tendency that ought not interfere with objective consideration of all the factors that should be weighed in determining the best interests of the child.this judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of the convention,which affirms that the contracting states are f irmly convinced that the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody.convention preamble,treaty,at.international law serves a high purpose when it underwrites the determination by nations to rely upon their domestic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair proceedings.
to interpret the convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy,even when the other parent holds a ne exeat right,would run counter to the convention purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes.abbott removed from chile while abbott request to enhance his relationship with his son was still pending before chilean courts.after she landed in texas,the mother asked the state court to diminish or eliminate the father custodial and visitation rights.the convention should not be interpreted to permit a parent to select which country will adjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a different country,in violation of a ne exeat right.denying a return remedy for the violation of such rights would legitimize the very action removal of the child that the home country,through its custody order or other provision of law,sought to prevent and would allow parents to undermine the very purpose of the convention.croll,at sotomayor,dissenting.this court should be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that gives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to avoid a return remedy that is granted,for instance,in the united kingdom,israel,germany,and south africa.see supra,at.
requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps deter child abductions and respects the convention purpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions.an abduction can have devastating consequences for a child.some child psychologists believe that the trauma children suffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of child abuse.a child abducted by one parent is separated from the second parent and the child support system.studies have shown that separation by abduction can cause psychological problems ranging from depression and acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and issues.see faulkner,parental child abduction is child abuse,as visited may,and available in clerk of court case file.a child abducted at an early age can experience loss of community and stability,leading to loneliness,anger,and fear of abandonment.see huntington,parental kidnapping a new form of child abuse,in american prosecutors research institute national center for prosecution of child abuse,parental abduction project,investigation and prosecution of parental abduction app.a.abductions may prevent the child from forming a relationship with the parent,impairing the child ability to mature.see faulkner,supra,at.
while a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy,a return order is not automatic.return is not required if the abducting parent can establish that a convention exception applies.one exception states return of the child is not required when there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.b,treaty,at.if,for example,abbott could demonstrate that returning to chile would put her own safety at grave risk,the court could consider whether this is sufficient to show that the child too would suffer psychological harm or be placed in an intolerable situation.see,baran beaty,walsh walsh.the convention also allows courts to decline to order removal if the child objects,if the child has reached a sufficient age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.b,treaty,at.the proper interpretation and application of these and other exceptions are not before this court.these matters may be addressed on remand.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
timothy mark cameron abbott,petitioner jacquelyn vaye abbott 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice stevens,with whom justice thomas and justice breyer join,dissenting.
petitioner timothy abbott,the father of,has no authority to decide whether his son undergoes a particular medical procedure whether his son attends a school field trip whether and in what manner his son has a religious upbringing or whether his son can play a videogame before he completes his homework.these are all rights and responsibilities of mother,respondent jacquelyn abbott.it is she who received sole custody,or daily care and control,of when the expatriate couple divorced while living in chile in.supp,and wd.abbott possesses only visitation rights.
on abbott custodial rights,chilean law placed a restriction she was not to travel with her son outside of chile without either abbott or the court consent.put differently,abbott had the opportunity to veto abbott decision to remove from chile unless a chilean court overrode that veto.the restriction on and abbott travel was an automatic,default provision of chilean law operative upon the award of visitation rights under article of chile minors law.it is this travel restriction also known as a ne exeat clause that the court today declares is a righ t of custody within the meaning of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction convention,treaty doc.ante,at.
because the court concludes that this travel restriction constitutes a right of custody,and because abbott indisputably violated the restriction when she took from chile without either abbott or the court permission,abbott is now entitled to the return of to chile under the terms of the convention.thus,absent a finding of an exception to the convention powerful return remedy,see ante,at,and even if the return is contrary to the child best interests,an american court must now order the return of to abbott,who has no legal authority over,based solely on his possessing a limited veto power over abbott ability to take from chile.as i shall explain,use of the convention return remedy under these circumstances is contrary to the convention text and purpose.
when the drafters of the convention gathered in,they sought an international solution to an emerging problem transborder child abductions perpetrated by noncustodial parents to establish artificial jurisdictional links with a view to obtaining custody of a child.conférence de la haye de droit international privé,enlèvement,explanatory report report,in actes et documents de la quatorzième session,see also convention analysis f undamental purpose of the convention is to protect children from wrongful international removals or retention by persons bent on obtaining their physical legal custody the drafters primary concern was to remedy abuses by noncustodial parents who attempt to circumvent adverse custody decrees,those granting sole custodial rights to the other parent by seeking a more favorable judgment in a second nation family court system.report,at.
the drafters determined that when a noncustodial parent abducts a child across international borders,the best remedy is return of that child to his or her country of habitual residence or,in other words,the best remedy is return of the child to his or her custodial parent,at.the drafters concluded that the same remedy should not follow,however,when a custodial parent takes a child from his or her country of habitual residence in breach of the other parent visitation rights,or rights of access in the convention parlance,at.the distinction between rights of custody and rights of access,therefore,is critically important to the convention scheme and purpose.it defines the scope of the available convention remedies.
article defines these rights as follows 
for the purposes of this convention a rights of custody shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence b rights of access shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.treaty doc,at hereinafter treaty doc.
article of the convention provides that the removal or retention of a child is wrongful,and thus in violation of the convention,only when the removal is in breach of the rights of custody.a,ibid.the fact that a removal may be wrongful in the sense that it violates domestic law or violates only rights of access does not make it wrongful within the meaning of the convention.
only when a removal is wrongful under article may the parent who possesses custody rights force the child return to the country of habitual residence under the convention remedial procedures,pursuant to articles through.for those removals that frustrate a noncustodial parent rights of access,the convention provides that the noncustodial parent may file an application to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access but he may not force the child return,at.a parent without rights of custody,therefore,does not have the power granted by article to compel the child return to his or her country of habitual residence.his rights are limited to those set forth in article.
abbott,claiming rights of custody by virtue of the travel restriction chilean law places on abbott,seeks the return of to chile.such relief is warranted only if removal was wrongful within the meaning of the convention as such,it must have been in breach of abbott rights of custody.at.putting aside the effect of the travel restriction,it is undisputed that abbott possesses rights of custody over while abbott would possess rights of access,as those terms are used in the convention.brief for petitioner brief for respondent.the only issue in this case,therefore,is whether abbott also possesses rights of custody within the meaning of the convention by virtue of the travel restriction,or ne exeat clause that chilean law imposes on abbott.in other words,the question is whether the right of one parent to veto the other parent decision to remove a child from the country,subject to judicial override,belongs in the category of rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.a,treaty,at.in my judgment,it clearly does not,and i need look no further than to the convention text to explain why.see medellín texas,the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text 
rights relating to the care of the child.the court concludes that the veto power abbott has over abbott travel plans is equivalent to those rights relating to the care of the person of the child.ante,at.this is so,the court tells us,because abbott has a limited power to keep within chile bounds and,therefore,indirectly to influence the language the child speaks,the identity he finds,or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.ante,at.it is not nearly as as the court assumes that abbott veto power carries with it any ability to decide the language speaks or the cultural experiences he will have,ante,at.mere presence in chile does not determine any number of issues,including whether learns spanish while there whether he attends an american school or a british school or a local school whether he participates in sports whether he is raised catholic or jewish or buddhist or atheist whether he eats a vegetarian diet and on and on.the travel restriction does not confer upon abbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions that are vital to physical,psychological,and cultural development.to say that a limited power to veto a child travel plans confers,also,a right relating to the care of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a custodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a child needs and development.
the court interpretation depends entirely on a broad reading of the phrase relating to in the convention definition of rights of custody.it is,undeniably,broad language.but,as the court reads the term,it is so broad as to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what rights of custody means.we can not forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term rights of custody in this case,and we should not lose sight of the import of this term in construing the broad words that follow in its wake.leocal ashcroft.i suppose it could be said that abbott ability to decide whether spends the night with one of his friends during a saturday visit is also a right relating to the care of the child.taken in the abstract and to its most absurd any decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a right relating to the care of a child.
such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction the drafters drew between the rights of custody and the rights of access.undoubtedly,they were aware of the concept of joint custody.see report,at c ustody rights may have been awarded to that person in his own right or jointly.it can not be otherwise in an era when types of joint custody,regarded as best suited to the general principle of sexual,are gradually being introduced into internal law but just because rights of custody can be shared by two parents,it does not follow that the drafters intended this limited veto power to be a right of custody.and yet this,it seems,is how the court understands the case because the drafters intended to account for joint custodial arrangements,they intended for this travel restriction to be joint custody because it could be said,in some abstract sense,to relate to care of the child.i fail to understand how the court reading is faithful to the convention text and purpose,given that the text expressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental rights.today decision converts every noncustodial parent with access rights at least in chile into a custodial parent for purposes of the convention.
on this point,it is important to observe the effect of the court decision to classify the travel restriction as a right relating to care.abbott possesses no legal authority presently to exercise care or control of,or to make decisions on his behalf.the court would nevertheless read the convention to require return to a parent without such rights merely because the travel restriction,in an abstract sense,could be said to relate to care.the court fails to explain how a parent who otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise charge,supervision,or management over a child,see webster third new international dictionary hereinafter webster definition of care can become a joint custodian of a child merely because he can attempt to veto one of the countless decisions the child other parent has sole legal authority to make on the child behalf.
the right to determine the child place of residence.the court also concludes that abbott veto power satisfies the convention definition of custodial rights because it is,in the court view,a right to determine the child place of residence.a,treaty,at.i disagree with the court assessment of the significance and meaning of this phrase,both on its face and within the context of the convention other provisions.
as an initial matter,the court reading of the convention depends on isolating the phrase and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence to refer to a freestanding right separate and apart from the rights related to the care of the child.i do not agree with this view of the text,nor did the convention drafters 
the convention seeks to be more precise by emphasizing,as an example of the care referred to in the rights of custody clause,a,the right to determine the child place of residence.however,if the child,although still a minor at law,has the right itself to determine its own place of residence,the substance of the custody rights will have to be determined in the context of other rights concerning the person of the child.report,at emphasis added.
the drafters thus intended the right to determine the child place of residence to be an example of what the convention means by care of the person of the child.it is indicative of the substance of what it means to be a custodial parent.the definition is not,as the court would have it,one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a singular righ t of custody,ante,at rather,it is a shorthand method to assess what types of rights a parent may have.the parent responsible for determining where and with whom a child resides,the drafters assumed,would likely also be the parent who has the responsibility to care for the child.
yet even assuming,as the court does,that the right to determine the child place of residence,a,treaty,at,is divisible from the care of the child,i still fail to understand how a travel restriction on one parent exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an affirmative right to determine the child place of residence.analyzing its text,in the context of the convention focus on distinguishing custodial parents from noncustodial ones,leads me to conclude that the right to determine the child place of residence means the power to set or fix the location of the child home.it does not refer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one nation borders.
to determine means to fix conclusively or authoritatively or to settle a question or controversy.webster.a place is a physical environment or a building or locality used for a special purpose.at.residence,even standing alone,refers to a particular location and not,more generally,to a nation or country.in the law,residence can mean t he act or fact of living in a given place for some time t he place where one actually lives or,a house or other fixed abode a dwelling.black law dictionary ed.lay definitions of residence similarly describe a specific location the act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some time the place where one actually lives or has his home or,a temporary or permanent dwelling place,abode,or habitation.webster.it follows that a place of residence describes a physical location in which a child actually lives.
the court reading of this text depends on its substitution of the word country for the word place.such a substitution is not illogical,of course,in light of the convention international focus.see croll croll,sotomayor,dissenting reading place of residence to mean authority over the child more specific living arrangements ignores the basic international character of the hague convention but it is inconsistent with the convention text and purpose.
when the drafters wanted to refer to country,they did.for example,in article,the drafters explained that rights of custody should be defined by looking to the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident.a,treaty,at.had the drafters intended the definition of the child place of residence in article to refer to his or her state or country of residence,they could have defined the right at issue as the right to determine the child state of habitual residence.but they did not,even though they used the phrase state of habitual residence no fewer than four other times elsewhere within the convention text moreover,the drafters also explained that reference s to habitual residence in a state shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a territorial unit of that state.a,at emphasis added.the point is when the drafters wanted to refer to a particular geographic unit,they did so.
instead,the drafters elected the formulation place of residence,which is also utilized similarly in the definition of rights of access.see b,at defining rights of access to include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence emphasis added.and they utilized this phrase only within one particular article,as opposed to their more frequent use of state of habitual residence throughout the convention.in interpreting statutory text,we ordinarily presume that the use of different words is purposeful and evinces an intention to convey a different meaning.see,russello united states,we refrain from concluding here that the differing language in the two subsections has the same meaning in each.we would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship there is no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of treaties.
accordingly,i would give place of residence the meaning its plain text connotes,irrespective of the fact that this convention concerns international abduction.the right described by the convention is the right to decide,conclusively,where a child home will be.and this makes a good deal of sense.the child lives with the parent who has custodial rights or,in the language of the convention,care of the person of the child,a,treaty,at.the child home his or her place of residence is fixed by the custody arrangement this comports too with the convention decision to privilege the rights of custodians over the rights of those parents with only visitation rights.
understanding the effect of a travel restriction.so,the question we confront is whether a travel restriction on one parent right to embark on international travel with his or her child creates in the other parent a right to determine the child place of residence or the ability to fix conclusively the child physical home.before answering this question,it is important to understand the nature of the travel restriction we must classify.
the departure of a minor from chile including when that child lives in a married,household is governed by article of of that country minors law.under chilean law,no minor is allowed outside of the country without his or her parents authorization,minors law,app.to pet.for cert.ordinarily,if the judge has entrusted custody of a child to only one parent,the child may not leave without that parent the custodial parent permission.see see also,at if the judge has entrusted custody to one of the parents or to a third party,the legitimate child may not leave except under authorization of the person to whom he has been entrusted but the statute further provides that if the noncustodial parent has been granted visitation rights,the authorization of the parent with visitation rights shall also be required once the court has decreed the obligation to allow visits pursuant to the preceding article,authorization of the father or mother who has the right to visit a child shall also be required.ibid.footnote added.the statute provides,also,an important backstop in the event a noncustodial parent denies authorization without good reason a chilean court may grant the minor or his parent permission to leave the country,at.finally,if the custodial parent does not return the child to chile within the time authorized,the judge may decree the suspension of alimony that may have been decreed.ibid.
returning,then,to the question at hand by virtue of the restriction chilean law places on abbott movement,abbott has no right to determine place of residence.he can not conclusively fix,settle,or determine the place where actually lives or has his home.see supra,at.true,the travel restriction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited power to prevent his child from leaving the country without his permission,but it does not grant an affirmative power to fix or set the location of the child home.abbott has no power whatever to determine where actually lives within the nearly square miles that compose chile.even more important,abbott has no power whatever to select another country in which would live,were abbott work to take him to another country altogether.in sum,a right to object to a proposed departure gives a parent far less authority than a right to determine where the child shall reside.moreover,the right to determine where to live within a country,as well as what country to live in,is far broader than the limited right to object to a child travel abroad.
in my view,the right abbott has by virtue of the travel restriction is therefore best understood as relating to his rights of access,as the convention defines that term and not as a standalone righ t of custody,as the court defines it,ante,at.chile statutory travel restriction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights the chilean family court granted to him as the noncustodial parent.by its terms,the obligation on the custodial parent to seek the other parent permission before removing the child from chile only operates upon the award of visitation rights it has nothing to do with custody rights.and it operates automatically to facilitate the noncustodial parent ability to access the child and to exercise his visitation rights.in the best of all possible circumstances,abbott limited veto power assures him relatively easy access to so that he may continue a meaningful relationship with his son.but this power,standing alone,does not transform him into a custodian for purposes of the convention return remedy.instead,it authorizes him,pursuant to article,to seek assistance from this country in carrying out the chilean family court visitation order.
although the court recognizes,as it must,that t he interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text,ante,at quoting medellín,at,the court analysis is atextual at least as far as the convention text goes.the court first relies on the text of the chilean law at issue and a single chilean administrator alleged interpretation thereof see ante,at.while it is true that the meaning of chile statute matters to our determining whether a parent has taken a child in breach of rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention,a,treaty,at,it does not and should not inform what the convention definition of rights of custody means in the first place.
the court also reminds us that the convention terms are to be broadly construed.see ante,at.to be sure,the convention leading interpretive authority informs us that the convention understanding of what constitutes rights of custody is broad and flexible.see report,at.and we are to apply its terms to allo w the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.at.but such breadth should not circumvent the convention text in order to sweep a travel restriction under the umbrella of rights of custody.
a reading as broad and flexible as the court eviscerates the distinction the convention draws between rights of custody and rights of access.indeed,the court reading essentially voids the convention article,which provides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of access.if a violation of this type of provision were not a breach of the rights of access,i find it quite difficult to imagine what the convention drafters had in mind when they created a second,lesser remedy for the breach of access rights.the drafters obviously contemplated that some removals might be in violation of the law of the child home nation,but not wrongful within the meaning of the convention,not in breach of rights of custody.this is precisely why article carefully delineates between the two types of parental rights in the first place.and this is precisely why article exists.
nevertheless,the court has now decreed that whenever an award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default travel restriction provision,or is accompanied by a travel restriction by judicial order,a parent possess a right of custody within the meaning of the convention.such a rule surely will not serve the best interests of the child in many cases.see report,at.it will also have surprising results.in chile,for example,as a result of this court decision,all parents so long as they have the barest of visitation rights now also have joint custody within the meaning of the convention and the right to utilize the return remedy 
it bears emphasis that such a result treating the type of travel restriction at issue in this case as part of rights of custody will undermine the convention careful balance between the rights of custody and the rights of access 
although the problems which can arise from a breach of access rights,especially where the child is taken abroad by its custodian,were raised during the fourteenth session,the majority view was that such situations could not be put in the same category as the wrongful removals which it is sought to prevent.this example,and others like it where breach of access rights profoundly upsets the equilibrium established by a judicial or administrative decision,certainly demonstrate that decisions concerning the custody of children should always be open to review.this problem however defied all efforts the hague conference to coordinate views thereon.a questionable result would have been attained had the application of the convention,by granting the same degree of protection to custody and access rights,led ultimately to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by those who held the other.at emphasis added footnote omitted.
it seems the very same authority on which the court relies to support its broad,flexible reading of the convention terms also tell us that the drafters expressly rejected the very outcome the court reaches today.far from render ing the convention meaningless,ante,at,a faithful reading of the convention text avoids the very questionable result its drafters foresaw and attempted to preclude were they to extend the same degree of protection to custody and access rights.report,at.
hence,in my view,the convention language is plain and that language precludes the result the court reaches.see sumitomo shoji america,avagliano.in these circumstances,the clear import of treaty language controls the decision.ibid.to support its reading of the text,however,the court turns to authority we utilize to aid us in interpreting ambiguous treaty text the position of the executive branch and authorities from foreign jurisdictions that have confronted the question before the court ante,at.were i to agree with the court that it is necessary turn to these sources to resolve the question before us,i would not afford them the weight the court does in this case.
views of the department of state.without discussing precisely why,we have afforded great weight to the meaning given treaties by the departments of government particularly charged with their negotiation and enforcement.kolovrat oregon,see also sumitomo,at factor laubenheimer.we have awarded great weight to the views of a particular government department even when the views expressed by the department are newly memorialized,see sumitomo,at,and even when the views appear contrary to those expressed by the department at the time of the treaty signing and negotiation,ibid.in this case,it appears that both are true the department of state position,which supports the court conclusion,is newly memorialized,see brief for united states as amicus curiae,and is possibly inconsistent with the department earlier position,see convention analysis 
putting aside any concerns arising from the fact that the department views are newly memorialized and changing,i would not in this case abdicate our responsibility to interpret the convention language.this does not seem to be a matter in which deference to the executive on matters of foreign policy would avoid international conflict,itel containers int l huddleston,acknowledging that the nuances of foreign policy are much more the province of the executive branch and congress than of this court quoting container of america franchise tax,the state department has made no such argument.nor is this a case in which the executive understanding of the treaty drafting history is particularly rich or illuminating see factor,at observing that diplomatic history negotiations and diplomatic correspondence of the contracting parties relating to the is entitled to weight.finally,and significantly,the state department,as the central authority for administering the convention in the united states,has failed to disclose to the court whether it has facilitated the return of children to america when the shoe is on the other foot see brief for united states as amicus curiae,describing responsibilities of the central authority.thus,we have no informed basis to assess the executive postratification conduct,or the conduct of other signatories,to aid us in understanding the accepted meaning of potentially ambiguous terms.see zicherman korean air lines,considering postratification conduct of the contracting parties charlton kelly,affording much weight to the fact that the united states has always construed its obligation under a treaty in a particular way and had acted in accord.
instead,the department offers us little more than its own reading of the treaty text.its view is informed by no unique vantage it has,whether as the entity responsible for enforcing the convention in this country or as a participating drafter.the court perfunctory,treatment of the department judgment of this matter only underscores this point.ante,at.i see no reason,therefore,to replace our understanding of the convention text with that of the executive branch.
views of foreign jurisdictions.the court believes that the views of our sister signatories to the convention deserve special attention when,in a case like this,congress has directed that uniform international interpretation of the convention is part of the convention framework.ante,at quoting b b.this may well be correct,but we should not substitute the judgment of other courts for our own.see olympic airways husain.and the handful of foreign decisions the court cites,see ante,at,provide insufficient reason to depart from my understanding of the meaning of the convention,an understanding shared by many courts of appeals.see,case below gonzalez gutierrez,parent right to refuse permission for his children to leave mexico hardly amounts to a right of custody,in the plainest sense of the term croll,at if we were to enforce rights held pursuant to a ne exeat clause by the remedy of mandatory return,the convention would become unworkable.it does not contemplate return of a child to a parent whose sole right to visit or veto impose no duty to give care fawcett mcroberts.indeed,the interest in having our courts correctly interpret the convention may outweigh the interest in having the ne exeat clause issue resolved in the same way that it is resolved in other countries.breard greene,per curiam w hile we should give respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such,it has been recognized in international law that,absent a clear and express statement to the contrary,the procedural rules of the forum state govern the implementation of the treaty in that state 
i also fail to see the international consensus let alone the broad acceptance,ante,at that the court finds among those varied decisions from foreign courts that have considered the effect of a similar travel restriction within the convention remedial scheme.the various decisions of the international courts are,at best,in equipoise.indeed,the court recognizes that courts in canada and france have concluded that travel restrictions are not rights of custody within the meaning of the convention.ante,at.
and those decisions supportive of the court position do not offer nearly as much support as first meets the eye.for example,the english high court of justice decision on which the court primarily relies,ante,at,appears to have decided a different issue.true,that court considered the effect of a similar travel restriction on both parents following the award of custody to the child mother.but the family court had also decreed,at the time it awarded custody to the mother,that both parents would remain joint guardians of the child.ibid.moreover,in the time between the mother removal of the child and the father petitioning for his return,the father had returned to the family court in sydney,obtained an order for the child return,and received immediate custody of the child.ibid.comparable facts do not exist in this case.olympic airways,at,noting that we are hesitant to follow decisions of sister signatory courts when there are substantial factual distinctions between the cases.similar factual distinctions involving,typically,joint guardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights are present in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the court and abbott 
those foreign courts that have reached a position consistent with my own,the court is right to point out,have also done so in slightly different factual scenarios.ante,at.the supreme court of canada,for example,first encountered a ne exeat provision as part of an interim custody order in thomson thomson.although the canadian high court concluded that a removal in breach of the temporary travel restriction was wrongful,it emphasized the interim nature of the provision,see,supra,and explained that the case would be different with a permanent order.see thomson,at,at such a permanent clause raises quite different issues.it is usually intended to ensure permanent access to the parent.the right of access is,of course,important but,as we have seen,it was not intended to be given the same level of protection by the convention as custody the canadian supreme court later affirmed this important distinction in,rejecting argument that any removal of a child without the consent of the parent having access rights should authorize return remedy because such a reading of the convention would indirectly afford the same protection to access rights as is afforded to custody rights 
in sum,the decisions relied upon by the court and abbott from our sister signatories do not convince me that we should refrain from a straightforward textual analysis in this case in order to make way for a uniform international interpretation of the convention.b b.there is no present uniformity sufficiently substantial to justify departing from our independent judgment on the convention text and purpose and the drafters intent.
at bottom,the convention aims to protect the best interests of the child.report,at.recognizing that not all removals in violation of the laws of the country of habitual residence are contrary to a child best interests,the convention provides a powerful but limited return remedy.the judgment of the convention drafters was that breaches of access rights,while significant and thus expressly protected by article,are secondary to protecting the child interest in maintaining an existing custodial relationship.
today,the court has upended the considered judgment of the convention drafters in favor of protecting the rights of noncustodial parents.in my view,the rule the court adopts today is particularly unwise in the context of a treaty intended to govern disputes affecting the welfare of children.
i,therefore,respectfully dissent.
as the court recognizes,see ante,at,the executive branch considers the report the official history for the convention and a source of background on the meaning of the provisions of the convention available to all states becoming parties to it.legal analysis of hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,fed.reg.hereinafter convention analysis.
indisputably,abbott removal of from chile was wrongful in the generic sense of the word.she violated chilean law when she took to texas because she sought neither abbott permission nor the court authorization before doing so.she violated both the existing ne exeat order imposed by judicial decree in the couple custody dispute,see ante,at,as well as chilean statutory law defining the access rights of noncustodial parents,see,minors law,app.to pet.for cert.the removal was illegal,then,but it was only wrongful within the meaning of the convention if it was in breach of abbott rights of custody.unfortunately,i fear the court preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct even,potentially,at the sake of the best interests of the child has caused it to minimize this important distinction.
the court repeatedly refers to ne exeat rights,ante,at,and,as if the single travel restriction at issue in this case were on a par with the multiple rights commonly exercised by custodial parents.chile statutory ne exeat provision is better characterized as a restriction on the travel of both the minor and the custodial parent than as a bundle of rights possessed by the noncustodial parent.
to determine can also mean,as the court observes,to set bounds or limits to,ante,at quoting webster new international dictionary ed.definition hereinafter webster.however,this definition of to determine makes little functional sense as applied to this treaty.in the context of understanding the meaning of rights of custody,the phrase to determine can not be so indeterminate as to merely set limits to a child place of residence.
although the court emphasizes that the definition of to determine on which it relies is the first such entry in webster,ante,at,it is worth noting that surely the court would not rely on the first such definition of the word care in that source suffering of mind grief sorrow to understand the convention use of that word.see webster,at.instead,the fifth definition of that word charge,supervision,management is clearly the relevant one.the point is only that context,as well as common sense,matters when selecting among possible definitions.
residence can also refer to t he place where a corporation or other enterprise does business or is registered to do business.black law dictionary.earlier this term,we recognized the principle that a corporation principal place of business for diversity jurisdiction purposes is a single location within a state and not the state itself.hertz friend,slip,at.

i do not mean to suggest by my view of the significance of a travel restriction that there could not be a custody arrangement in which both parents have the right to determine the child place of residence.a,at.my view is only that the type of ne exeat provision at issue in this case does not,by itself,confer such an affirmative right.
the preceding article referred to,article,simply provides each time a minor is entrusted to one of the parents or a third person,such decision must include the obligation to allow the parent to exercise his or her right to visit.the decision should also specify the way in which this right will be exercised.the judge may order ex officio,upon the parties petition or in special cases,that the same authorization be extended,to the minor ascendants or siblings,through the means and under the conditions set by the judge.ascendants and siblings should be identified.memorandum from graciela,senior legal specialist,law library of congress,to supreme court library,available in clerk of court case file containing english translation of,minors law.
because differences in statutory provisions,as well as cultural differences and personal predilections,may affect the opinions of local officials,i would attach no weight to the letter from paula strap camus,describing article of chile minors law as establishing a shared right to determine the place of residence of a child.moreover,we have no obligation to defer,on questions of treaty interpretation,to the nonjudicial decisions of another signatory state,let alone a return request a piece of advocacy filed on behalf of chile in another case.
in any event,the letter cited offers much less support for the court position than meets the eye.unlike in this case,in which a chilean court has already decreed abbott to be sole custodian,in villegas duran beaumont,no judge of the republic of chile has granted the custody of the child to her mother.letter from paula strap camus,director general,corporation of judicial assistance of the region metropolitana to national center for missing and exploited children,app.to pet.for cert.in villegas duran beaumont.in other words,camus letter request for the child return in that case depends on a provision of article not at issue in this case if the custody of a legitimate child has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a third party,the child may not leave without authorization of both parents.app.to pet.for cert.the travel restriction that bound abbott in this case,however,arose o nce the court decreed the obligation to allow visits by abbott.ibid.although not before us,there may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and significance of a travel restriction in effect prior to an award of custody to either or both parents,from one that occurs ancillary to the award of visitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights.moreover,the department of state,at the time the convention was ratified,believed that the convention would require return in these circumstances children who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the entry of a custody order are protected by the convention.there need not be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the convention return provisions.convention analysis.
in,the latest year for which statistics appear available,chile central authority,which is the entity responsible for administering its obligations under the hague convention,made five outgoing access applications under article.hague conference on private international law,international child abduction,lowe,a statistical analysis of applications made in under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,part reports,prelim.doc,hereinafter lowe analysis.were the court correct and were the view the court ascribes to chile interpretation of its own law also correct,see ante,at all of chile outgoing applications under the convention almost certainly should have been return applications because any person with rights of access under chilean law,also has a right of custody by virtue of the statutory ne exeat provision.it is plain that even chilean officials have not thought correct the court interpretation of the intersection of the travel restriction in article of its minors law and the convention.
see,vienna convention on the law of treaties,may,recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation when the interpretation a leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or b leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable
