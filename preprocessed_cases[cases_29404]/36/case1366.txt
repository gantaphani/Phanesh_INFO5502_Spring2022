after years of bouncing from foster home to foster home,elizabeth has a chance at a normal life as the adopted child of her present caregivers.the only thing standing between elizabeth and the pot of gold at the end of her rainbow is her father challenge to the department of children and family services failure to comply with the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act.because we must,we hold that elizabeth chance at stability will be we publish this opinion with the hope that other children will fare better in the future,and that the department and its lawyers will at some point learn to give the proper notices at the proper times,and to file the required documents with the dependency court,keeping in mind that childhood is brief and fleeting,as is a foster child hope of finding and keeping a stable home.
jennifer and jackson have five children,at least four of whom have at one time or another been dependents of the juvenile court.our immediate concern is elizabeth,the youngest child,who came to the attention of the department when she tested positive for cocaine at the time of her birth in august.the other children are danny,now years old jackie,who was adopted years ago and is now lena,now and living in a residential treatment center and latanya,now and placed with a legal guardian.lena and latanya were sexually abused by jackson,their father.
the usual services were ordered for jennifer and jackson,including sexual abuse counseling for jackson,and drug testing and counseling for jackson and jennifer.after two years in foster care,elizabeth was returned to jennifer in may,on condition that jackson not reside with them.in july,the department learned that jackson was living with jennifer and elizabeth,a new petition was filed,elizabeth was placed in foster care,and more reunification services were ordered for the parents.
elizabeth behavior deteriorated and she became so aggressive that her foster mother was unable to care for her.a new foster home was found in the fall of.in april,jennifer entered a residential drug program.jackson attended counseling sessions,but refused to acknowledge his molestation of lena and latanya,which his therapist said thwarted his treatment and was.by that time,elizabeth violent tantrums and aggressive behavior at school and with her foster families had resulted in two more failed placements.a psychological evaluation was completed,and showed elizabeth intelligence as but her emotional difficulties as severe.
jennifer and jackson showed no progress during the remaining months of,and elizabeth condition deteriorated.she reported that she had been molested by jackson who continued to live with jennifer,and she became overtly by compulsive.she was removed from yet another foster home and placed in several more homes.in october,elizabeth was hospitalized due to increasingly aggressive behavior she broke a mirror and used a shard of glass in an attempt to cut her tongue.the department recommended placement in a residential treatment center.in november,reunification services were terminated for both jennifer and jackson,neither having made any progress,neither having complied with the case plan.
following her discharge from the hospital,elizabeth was placed in a group home.in april,the department reported that her condition had stabilized,although her aggressive behavior had continued and she was again hospitalized after she kicked and hit a teacher.elizabeth was discharged to the group home,then moved to bienvenidos,a sheltered home where she attended a mental health day treatment program in lieu of school.by that time,elizabeth had been diagnosed with depressive disorder,attention deficit disorder,and hyperactivity,and she was classified as an alleged victim of sexual abuse.
medication and therapy stabilized elizabeth condition,and her bienvenidos therapist reported that elizabeth response to the intensive day treatment idt program and to p harmacological intervention has been nothing short of remarkable.at the present time,virtually all of her presenting symptoms are in remission.her present level of functioning has improved to such a degree that it is tentatively determined that she no longer needs the specialized services of the idt program.among other things,the therapist recommended immediate reassessment for adoptability,a trial visit with her sister jackie adoptive family joe and debbie,curtailment of elizabeth visits with her parents,placement in a residential treatment center,and testing for appropriate placement in a traditional academic setting.in november,elizabeth was placed at five acres.
by april,elizabeth,by then identified as a special needs child,had adjusted well to five acres,and her condition had significantly stabilized.she was ready to return to public school,but she remained at five acres because and had decided to pursue her adoption and the dependency court wanted to avoid multiple school changes.in june,elizabeth was placed with and,where she quickly made a very positive adjustment to her new life.jennifer and jackson visits were limited to once every other week,and the required evaluations were ordered for elizabeth,her parents,and her prospective adoptive parents.by august,elizabeth therapist,and,and the department all favored a further reduction in parental visits to once per month.
by october,the therapists and elizabeth were in agreement that,in preparation for her anticipated adoption,parental visits should be reduced to once every days.the department recommended termination of jennifer and jackson parental rights,termination of all parental visits,and adoption by and whose home study had been completed and approved.
in december,jackson filed a petition welf,in which he asked the court to return elizabeth to him,or to give him more visits,or to remove elizabeth from the first stable home she had ever had in order to place her with a paternal cousin.he said he had participated in counseling,complained that and wanted no contact with claimed that lena had disclosed that he never molested her.jackson petition was summarily denied,and a contested termination hearing was held over several days in december welf,at the conclusion of which the court found elizabeth was adoptable and terminated jackson and jennifer parental rights.jackson appeals from the orders denying his welfare and institutions code section petition and terminating his parental rights.
discussion 
jackson contends the department failed to comply with the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act the icwa,and that all of the dependency court orders,from detention to termination,must be reversed.the department claims there was substantial compliance but asks,should we find otherwise,that we conditionally reverse only the final order and not the others.we find there was no substantial compliance but conclude that,on the facts of this case,the appropriate remedy is a conditional reversal of only the final order of termination.
at a hearing held on september,when elizabeth was only four years old and living in a foster home,the court asked jennifer,is there any american indian heritage that elizabeth may have,jennifer answered,she black.the court acknowledged the obvious elizabeth picture is in the record,then asked again,but does she have any american indian heritage jennifer answered,no.the court then posed the same question to jackson,who first said no,but then added this well,my mother is indian,but i do know exactly,i think it blackfoot.i believe it is.as a result of this exchange,the court ordered the department to give notice to the blackfoot tribe.
in a report filed on october,the department provided this information to the court blackfeet tribe social services,pigean,mainstream building,po box,browning,montana,was noticed sic on.the tribe has not provided any information as to possible native american status of elizabeth.although the department submitted a copy of the notice,it did not submit a return receipt or any evidence to show the notice was sent by certified or registered mail,return receipt requested.the notice has jackson name and birthdate,but states that his birthplace is unknown
