we are asked to decide the appropriate appellate standard to review the factual sufficiency of the evidence in parental termination cases,in which the burden of proof at trial is by clear and convincing evidence.we granted review to resolve the conflict among the courts of appeals about whether the traditional factual sufficiency standard is adequate to review the findings in a termination proceeding,and if not,what the appropriate standard should be.we hold that termination findings must be upheld against a factual sufficiency challenge if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could form a firm belief or conviction that grounds exist for termination under texas family code sections and a.when reversing on insufficiency grounds,the reviewing court must detail the evidence relevant to the issue of parental termination and clearly state why the evidence is insufficient to support a termination finding by clear and convincing evidence.because the court of appeals did not correctly apply this standard,we reverse its judgment and remand to that court for further proceedings.
the texas department of protective and regulatory services filed an action to terminate the relationship between the parents,susan and robert,and the minor child,under the procedures provided in texas family code chapter.the trial court charge asked the jury to make any affirmative findings about termination on clear and convincing evidence.the jury found that the parents had engaged in conduct warranting termination and that terminating the rights of both parents would be in the best interest of the child.the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict.
on appeal,the parents challenged the jury findings on both legal and factual sufficiency grounds.the court of appeals rejected the parents legal sufficiency challenges.in its factual sufficiency review,the court of appeals first noted that the burden of proof is intermediate between reasonable doubt and.the court of appeals applied what it termed a higher standard of factual sufficiency review 
in reviewing factual sufficiency challenges in termination cases,again where the burden of proof at trial is by clear and convincing evidence,we apply a higher standard of factual sufficiency review.after considering all of the evidence,we must determine not whether the trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the existence of a fact is more probable than not,as in cases where the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence,but whether the trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the existence of the fact is highly probable.under this standard,we must consider whether the evidence was sufficient to produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence will only be sustained if the jury could not have reasonably found the facts to be established by clear and convincing evidence.
at citations omitted.the court held that the evidence was factually sufficient to support the jury findings that both parents had endangered and abandoned the child.id.at.the court also concluded that there was some evidence to support the jury findings that parental termination was in the best interest of the child.id.at.however,focusing primarily on the lack of evidence about needs and prospects beyond foster care,the court of appeals concluded that the record did not adequately support the conclusion that it was highly probable that termination of the parents rights would be in the child best interest.id.at.
we review the record and the court of appeals analysis with respect to robert only,because susan relinquished her parental rights and is not a party to this appeal.the trial court instructed the jury to determine if there was clear and convincing evidence 
a that robert g engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangered the physical or emotional of the child,or,
b that robert g voluntarily and with knowledge of the pregnancy,abandoned the mother of the child beginning at a time during the pregnancy with the child and continuing through birth,failed to provide adequate support or medical care for the mother during the period of abandonment before the birth of the child,and remained apart from the child or failed to support the child since the birth.
see.e,h.we will recount the evidence the jury heard relevant to this charge.
when susan began living with robert,she was eighteen years old and had a history of drug abuse.she had run away from home at age fifteen and had given birth to a daughter at age sixteen.robert was years old at the time and married to bertha,a woman with whom he had fathered a son.he had an extensive criminal record,including convictions for drug offenses,theft,and assault.robert sold drugs for a living and was an addict.in,while living together,susan told robert she was pregnant with.at about the same time,susan relinquished parental rights to her daughter and consented to her daughter adoption.
susan was pregnant with when both she and robert were arrested in for possession of cocaine and heroin.after her release,susan voluntarily entered a program,but left the center in a matter of days.shortly after his release,robert was again arrested on other drug charges.robert was sentenced to ten years imprisonment,a sentence he was serving at the time of trial.
susan was incarcerated for the last five months of her pregnancy with.she was released on probation ten days after his birth.susan and resided in her mother home for a few months,then they moved into an apartment with susan new boyfriend,michael russey.following his drug conviction,robert had minimal contact with either susan or their son.
in march,about a month after susan and moved in with michael russey,russey flagged down a passing police car,reported that he had a physical confrontation with susan and that narcotics were being used in his apartment.when the officers entered the apartment,they found susan in the bedroom with another man whom she knew only as two other couples were also in the apartment.was asleep in a playpen.the police found a spoon containing cocaine residue,matches,a plastic baggie,and empty balloons associated with heroin use near the child bed.other drug paraphernalia littered the bedroom and bathroom.witnesses testified that the apartment was filthy,with mounds of clothes strewn about,grease spattered on the walls,and broken windows throughout the unit.
susan testified that she and russey had been smoking crack cocaine that night and had a violent argument.the police arrested susan and charged her with cocaine possession.emergency worker david abogado from the texas department of protective and regulatory services took custody of.since that time,has remained in a foster family care.
robert testified about his extensive criminal history at the termination hearing.over the course of five years,he had been arrested for theft,possession of narcotics,aggravated assault of a police officer,and repeated violations of probation.robert conceded that he continued his criminal activities even after he learned of susan pregnancy.he acknowledged that,as a result of his criminal proclivities,he was unable to be present for the child birth or formative years.robert testified that after he and bertha divorced,he did not provide child support to or know the whereabouts of his son.
robert had seen only twice since his birth,once when susan visited robert in the county jail and once when robert visited susan in her mother home.robert had never lived with,did not contact the department about,and never paid child support nor arranged medical care for susan or robert testified that the only time he attempted to provide financial support for was when he gave money to an acquaintance,who purportedly promised to deliver it to susan.robert claimed that the friend absconded with the money.robert testified he was currently unable to provide financial support to 
evidence contrary to the verdict was comprised primarily of robert testimony.robert testified that he loved and wished to remain his parent.robert and susan both stated that robert encouraged susan to obtain medical treatment while she was pregnant with robert also testified that he intended to seek employment when released from prison so that he could provide for finally,robert testified that he was auditing classes on chemical dependency while incarcerated.
richard park conducted a evaluation on robert in march.park recommended that robert parental rights be terminated.he testified that,while robert was likeable,his prison sentence would impede his ability to be a parent to park noted robert illicit livelihood,his criminal record,and his refusal to take personal responsibility for his criminal background.park also noted that robert had abandoned his only other son.
the department visited foster family on a monthly basis.park and court appointed special advocate casa volunteers observed that was developing normally and that he was an emotionally stable,happy boy.the department initiated proceedings to terminate susan and robert parental rights so that could be placed with adoptive parents.on a submission,the jury found that susan and robert relationships with should be terminated,and the trial court rendered judgment accordingly.both susan and robert appealed.
the court of appeals determined that there was legally sufficient evidence that both susan and robert engaged in specific conduct under texas family code section warranting termination,and that termination would be in best interest.see.the court of appeals also concluded the evidence was factually sufficient to support the finding that the parents had engaged in section conduct.with respect to robert in particular,the court found that the series of arrests on drug offenses from april until november,with full knowledge of susan pregnancy and possible consequences of his course of conduct,implies that robert had a conscious disregard and indifference to his parental responsibilities.at.the court concluded that robert had abnegated all personal responsibility for susan,thus consigning her fate,and their unborn son,to chance or other people.id.at.
the court next addressed the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury finding that termination was in best interest.while purporting to analyze that issue in a light most favorable to the jury finding,the actual analysis left critical facts unstated and faulted the department for not producing specific evidence about who would care for the child in the event robert parental rights were terminated.the court of appeals concluded 
t he nature of his criminal record,at least what is in the record,establishes little.it does not appear to show that he is an abusive or violent person,nor does it appear that he has psychological problems,apart from his drug addiction,that potentially puts his son at risk.the department suggests that robert imprisonment conclusively establishes a potential adverse psychological impact on,but there is no evidence as to the significance of impact on an infant as opposed to an older child.there is no evidence,expert,medical,or otherwise,about present and future emotional and physical needs in the time periods relevant to this case.
as we decided in the case of susan,we must conclude that the record before us does not contain clear and convincing evidence that termination of the relationship is in interest.the record does not adequately support the conclusion that it is highly probable that termination of robert parental rights was in the best interest of 
the department,relying on meadows green,per curiam,contends that the court of appeals erred in applying heightened appellate review because texas jurisprudence recognizes only two levels of appellate evidentiary sufficiency and factual sufficiency.but meadows has limited application in termination proceedings.in meadows,we sought to reconcile decades of confusing and contradictory decisions using a standard,or some standard,in a variety of contexts.those standards had been applied to issues as diverse as resulting trusts,probate,and parol evidence.see grasty wood,writ ref simpson neely,writ ref farr moreland,no writ.see generally vance,the clear and convincing evidence standard in texas a critique,baylor.we held that civil cases should be subjected to only two appellate standards of review,legal and factual sufficiency.meadows,at.but meadows predates application of a burden of proof as a standard at trial.
in addington texas,d,rev g,the united states supreme court concluded that due process demands clear and convincing proof before the state may involuntarily confine a person in a mental institution.the supreme court instructed 
the function of a standard of proof,as that concept is embodied in the due process clause and in the realm of factfinding,is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusion for a particular type of adjudication.

on remand,we adopted the burden of proof and defined it as that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.state addington.the following year,we extended the standard to termination proceedings because we determined that the constitutional interests at stake are no less compelling than the liberty interest in an involuntary commitment proceeding.in re.citing addington,we held that t ermination is a drastic remedy and is of such weight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify termination of the relationship by proof more substantial than a preponderance of the evidence.id.
the texas legislature has now codified the standard in family code,which provides a court may order termination of the relationship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has engaged in certain listed conduct and termination is in the best interest of the child.after this court decided in re,the united states supreme court held that b efore a state may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child,due process requires that the state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.santosky kramer,d.
while and santosky established that the burden of proof in termination proceedings is clear and convincing evidence,neither decision indicated how appellate courts are to review findings based on that burden of proof.our courts of appeals have wrestled with the standard for reviewing the factual sufficiency of findings that must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.see in re,dist.acknowledging the courts of appeals disagreement about the proper standard of appellate review of an involuntary termination of parental rights,rev on other grounds,cert.denied,d.
relying on authority from other jurisdictions,the fifth court of appeals was the first to require an intermediate standard of appellate review.see neiswander bailey,no writ citing beeler american trust,cal d,and comment,evidence clear and convincing proof appellate review.the court reasoned that,because the standard of proof was an intermediate one,the standard of appellate review should likewise be an intermediate one.neiswander,at.the resulting appellate standard of review required the court of appeals to determine whether the trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the fact existence is highly probable.id.at.
other courts of appeals have disagreed about whether termination proceedings require a third level of appellate review in addition to legal and factual sufficiency.the fourth,eighth,ninth,and tenth courts of appeals state that they employ a heightened level of appellate review.see in re,no pet.in re,no pet.in re,paso,no writ in re,antonio,no writ.in,for example,the court reasoned that it made sense to reject a third intermediate appellate standard of review when there were only two standards of proof allowed at trial in texas.at.but because this court had subsequently required a third standard of proof at trial for involuntary termination of parental rights,the court in thought it appropriate for appellate courts to also employ a third standard of review.see id.determining it incongruous to require trial courts to require an enhanced burden of proof while appellate courts applied the same appellate review accorded to issues.
this intermediate standard of appellate review has been described in slightly different ways by the various courts of appeals.several courts have concluded the requirement that the existence of the fact be highly probable is merely another way of requiring that the existence of the fact be clear and convincing.see spangler texas dep t of protective regulatory,no pet.in re,at in re,worth,no writ neiswander,at.
the eighth court of appeals has examined factual sufficiency questions to determine if the evidence was sufficient to produce in the mind of the fact finder a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.in re,at.this meant sustaining the point of error only if the fact finder could not have reasonably found the fact was established by clear and convincing evidence.id.quoting mezick state,dist,no writ.the ninth court of appeals has held that to withstand a factual sufficiency challenge in parental termination cases,the evidence must permit a rational trier of fact to hold a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.in re,at.the tenth court of appeals declared that it will sustain a factual insufficiency challenge when the evidence is factually insufficient to support a finding by clear and convincing evidence or a finding is so contrary to the weight of contradicting evidence that no trier of fact could reasonably find the evidence to be clear and convincing.in re,no pet.see also spangler,at.the fourth court of appeals reviewed a jury findings based on clear and convincing evidence to determine whether sufficient evidence was presented to produce in the mind of a rational factfinder a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.in re,antonio,no writ.
some courts of appeals that initially applied an intermediate standard of appellate review have more recently retreated to the traditional standard of appellate review for factual sufficiency challenges.see in re,dist,no writ expressly overruling former opinions in re,writ denied in re,worth,no writ in re,christi,no writ texas dep t of human,no writ.these courts have maintained the traditional appellate standard of review in factual sufficiency challenges even when a heightened standard of proof was required at trial,holding that a court should sustain a factual sufficiency challenge only if the court concludes that the finding is so weak or so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.in re,dist,no pet.see also in re,dist,no pet.in re,at in re,no writ,at.
the department argues that the courts of appeals various formulations of a heightened standard blur the distinction between legal and factual sufficiency review.robert responds that federal constitutional concerns mandate a higher appellate standard we conclude that the burden of proof at trial necessarily affects appellate review of the evidence.under traditional factual sufficiency standards,a court determines if a finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is manifestly unjust,shocks the conscience,or clearly demonstrates bias.pool ford motor.but that standard is inadequate when evidence is more than a preponderance more likely than not but is not clear and convincing.as a matter of logic,a finding that must be based on clear and convincing evidence can not be viewed on appeal the same as one that may be sustained on a mere preponderance.see in re,dist,no pet.in re,at wittig,concurring.
we hold that the appellate standard for reviewing termination findings is whether the evidence is such that a factfinder could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction about the truth of the state allegations.that standard best comports with the supreme court holding in santosky,with the definition of clear and convincing evidence we first adopted in addington,and with the legislature definition in the family code.see santosky kramer,d holding that the standard adequately conveys to the factfinder the level of subjective certainty about his factual conclusions necessary to satisfy due process.addington,at holding that clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.clear and convincing evidence means the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.a standard that focuses on whether a reasonable jury could form a firm conviction or belief retains the deference an appellate court must have for the factfinder role.
accordingly,we disapprove of holdings that termination findings should be upheld if those findings are not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.see,in re king,pet.denied in re,dist,pet.denied in re,at in re,dist,no pet.in re,pet.denied spurlock texas dep t of protective regulatory,writ denied.
there have been other opinions that,while attempting to account for the clear and convincing burden of proof,nevertheless stated standards that diverge perceptibly from the standard we announce today.we are not persuaded that these standards would necessarily have produced a different disposition had those courts reviewed the evidence under today standard,because the opinions reflect that the courts undertook an exacting review of the entire record with a healthy regard for the constitutional interests at stake.despite differences in articulated standards,the courts have often employed similar analyses in reaching their decisions.see in re leal,department of protective regulatory,no pet.but in the interest of uniform,we reject any articulation of the standard that varies from the standard we announce today.accordingly,we reject standards that retain the traditional factual sufficiency standard while attempting to accommodate the burden of proof.see,in re,at leal,at.
we also disapprove of the test neiswander announced,that a court of appeals must determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the existence of a disputed fact is highly probable.see,in re,worth,pet.denied in re,pet.denied in re,paso,no writ neiswander,at.because some could argue that evidence that makes the existence of a fact highly probable is not necessarily the same as evidence that produces a firm conviction in the existence of the fact,we reject the highly probable formulation.in re,worth,no writ stating that highly probable inquiry needlessly complicates the standard of review.
we emphasize that,as appellate courts apply the standard we announce today,they must maintain the respective constitutional roles of juries and appellate courts.an appellate court review must not be so rigorous that the only factfindings that could withstand review are those established beyond a reasonable doubt.see santosky,at.holding that beyond reasonable doubt standard not required in termination cases.while parental rights are of constitutional magnitude,they are not absolute.just as it is imperative for courts to recognize the constitutional underpinnings of the relationship,it is also essential that emotional and physical interests of the child not be sacrificed merely to preserve that right.
while the court of appeals recited the highly probable standard that we disavow,we do not view the recitation of an erroneous standard as harmful error in and of itself.the department argues,however,that the court of appeals application of the standard failed to give due deference to the jury function.we agree.the court of appeals properly stated that appellate courts should not reverse the judgment unless the jury could not reasonably have formed a firm conviction or belief that terminating robert parent
