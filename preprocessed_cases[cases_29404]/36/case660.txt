introduction 
family law is not getting any easier.consider this scenario a couple live together and have two children.they do not marry.then they separate.the couple agree to a paternity action judgment which establishes the father paternity,his right to visitation,and fixes a monthly monetary child support payment to be made to the mother who will have primary physical custody of the children.later the couple attempt a reconciliation the father moves into the residence of the children and the mother.after about nine months,the reconciliation fails,and the father moves out.issue can the father obtain any credit for actual,child support he afforded the children during the nine months he lived with them and the mother 
the question is one of first impression in california.see wright,right to credit on child support arrearages for time parties resided together after separation or divorce,absence of california cases hereinafter alr,credit for time resided.had the original order been made in a marital as distinct from paternity action,and had the couple simply switched custody so that the children went to live with the father instead of attempting reconciliation,there seems to be no question that a line of california cases beginning with jackson jackson d would allow such credit.in fact,family law has developed a shorthand term for credits.they called jackson credits,after the first case to allow for them.but whether the same rules obtain in a paternity action as in a dissolution action has not previously been addressed.
the trial court concluded the father here,appellant george vargas,was not eligible for any such jackson credits,because this case did not fit the jackson pattern of a child support order which originated in a divorce proceeding,and also because there was a total reversal of custody,but rather a period of cohabitation shared custody in the context of an attempted reconciliation.we reverse because we believe the same equitable considerations that apply to support orders arising out of marital cases should also apply to support orders arising out of paternity cases.we see no reason to differentiate total changes of custody from periods of living together in the same household actual support is actual support.
the orange county superior court no longer is able to provide court reporters without charge,forcing these parties of limited means to resort to an agreed statement rather than a reporter transcript to have meaningful access to appellate review.the record on appeal may consist wholly or partly of an agreed statement.cal.rules of court,rule a.fortunately the parties were able to agree on one,probably because the essential facts are simple allyson and george lived together from to october.during that period they had two children.allyson and george separated in october.the next month allyson filed this paternity action.in may,the parties agreed to a judgment under which george would pay a certain amount in child support commencing june,and george would be entitled to specified visitation.the judgment was signed by a court commissioner on may,and filed that day.
but sometime between december and january,george moved back in with allyson and the children in her residence.during this time he paid rent to allyson father,who owned the building she had not been paying any rent previously.george,allyson and the children all lived together in a family relationship from at least january until.george then moved out again.george asked the court for a determination of his arrearages in may.the order on that motion was made in july and included a determination george was ineligible for any credit for the period of eight or nine months of attempted reconciliation spanning the first two thirds of.george has timely appealed from that order.
iii.discussion 
in denying george credit for any actual child support he might have provided for the couple two children during the period of reconciliation and living together as a family in,the trial court proffered four reasons.three of those reasons apply categorically in such a way as to preclude even the possibility of credit for a payor parent who had moved back in with the children.the three categorical reasons were george was not entitled to jackson credits because the jackson line of cases all involved total of custody where the previously noncustodial parent became the sole custodial parent george should have brought a formal order to show cause osc based on changed circumstances when he moved back in with allyson and the children.and as a matter of statute,the only relief allowed for support during reconciliation is when the support order is pendente lite,and this was not.the trial court also gave one reason george had to have a roof over his own head anyway,so the fact he moved in with allyson and the children and paid rent to her father merited no credit.
we address each of these considerations below.but before those reasons can be addressed adequately,a canvass of the relevant case law is required.no less than three distinct lines of california case law shed light on the problem of whether jackson credits may be available in paternity cases involving reconciliations.there is also a small body of litigation bearing on the issue.see alr,credit for time resided,supra.while none of these are determinative,they inform our decision.
a.the jackson equitable credit line 
we begin with jackson itself.jackson addressed the basic pattern a married couple divorced,and custody of their teenage daughter was awarded to the mother.then,seven months later,the mother agreed to let the daughter live with her father.when,roughly two years after the change,the father sought to formally modify the decree to eliminate the support payments,the mother retaliated by trying to execute on the father assets based on support arrearages accumulated during the period the daughter had been living with him.the trial court refused to quash the writ of execution obtained by the mother,ruling the father modification effort was an attempt to retroactively modify child support.the appellate court reversed.see jackson,supra,d.the jackson court reasoned that all child support orders are an exercise of the trial court equitable power and are designed to compel satisfaction of the child support obligation which exists apart from the marriage status.id.at.after first briefly referencing a series of five previous opinions that had indicated trial courts have the equitable power to deny enforcement of a support order when equity requires it see id.at the word equitable appears in the jackson court treatment of each of the five cases the court arrived at the essence of the case it was undisputed that the father had provided a home and support for the daughter after she had commenced living with him,and in doing so had expended amounts in excess of the formal order,so the trial court did,indeed,have the discretion to either quash the writ entirely,or permit only partial enforcement of it.id.at.
next came in re marriage of matthews,supra,d,a case which briefly dealt with the issue of a father who provided a home for his children during summer vacation.the trial court reduced the normal child support payments by percent during those months.id.at.without extended analysis,or any reference to the jackson opinion,the matthews court simply concluded it is equitable to reduce or terminate child support payments for those full months in which the children reside with the parent.ibid.
in re marriage of okum,supra,d was,like jackson,another case based on the payor parent having de facto sole physical custody of two children,a boy and a girl.see id.at.this time,however,since jackson had been on the books for years,the trial court quashed the writ of execution as to the arrearage based on the girl support.there was a factual issue as to whether the boy also lived with the father.explicitly relying on jackson,the okum court observed that the trial court order the girl was correct the father was entitled to equitable relief as to her.id.at.as to the boy,the father lost.the court noted the mother kept a bedroom in her own home for him when he stayed with her,she paid for much of his support when he was in her care,and,overall,the mother substantially complied with the custody agreement and therefore,the father was obligated to pay support.id.at.
the most recent case in the jackson line is in re marriage of trainotti,supra,d.like okum,this case was essentially a replay of jackson,but the opinion provided more doctrinal development.three years after a child support judgment the minor child began living with his previously noncustodial father the father provided a home but made no more support payments,and about three years after the change of residence the father sought a formal modification of the initial custody and support arrangements.as in jackson,the mother responded by bringing enforcement proceedings based on support arrearages which included the period when the father was the de facto custodial parent.the trial court,just as in the original jackson case,reasoned from the absence of a modification of the initial support order,and so allowed the father no credit.id.at.and,just as in jackson,the appellate court reversed.
in trainotti,however,the court expanded on the statutory foundation underpinning its reversal of the trial court.trainotti first took issue with the trial court having equated giving a payor parent credit for actual support provided to a child during a period when the child is living with that parent with an improper attempt at retroactive modification of support.see trainotti,supra,d at,quoting former,subd.a.the trainotti court then segued to the now year old jackson opinion,with a quote from one of jackson equitable power passages see trainotti,supra,d at,quoting jackson,supra,d at.noting that the only difference between jackson and the case at hand was that jackson involved a writ of execution while the case at hand involved a modification proceeding,the trainotti court reasoned the trial court power to enforce an original support order was implicated.accordingly,trainotti invoked the language in former civil code section giving a trial court discretion to enforce support orders as it from time to time deems necessary 
b.the gregory mccann death of the payor parent cases 
there is another line of cases that bears on this issue.two published opinions,in re marriage of gregory d and in re marriage of mccann th stand for the proposition that a child support order is not automatically expunged upon the death of the payee parent.an explanation of this application is in order.gregory involved a true deadbeat dad.there was a permanent child support order made in,the noncustodial father paid almost nothing on it,the children were on welfare during that time,and then in the custodial mother died.the children went to live with the mother parents,still received welfare,and in the county went after the father for arrearages.gregory,supra,d at.the trial court determined the original support order terminated as a matter of law when the custodial parent died.the gregory opinion reversed on the theory that the payor parent had to look for assistance from the courts in order to modify or terminate a support order and held the order survived the custodial parent death.id.at.
mccann followed three years later.mccann is easy to misread.if you do look closely at the court statement of facts,you might think that after the payee parent death the payor father took his daughters into his own home.he did.ever.the discussion section of the opinion recites that the trial court found that upon leslie mccann death,frank assumed custody of his daughters mccann,supra,th at,but when one reads the entire opinion it is clear that in mccann custody did not mean actual physical custody.the opinion statement of facts reveals that the died about two years after a permanent child support order was made,at which point the couple two daughters lived with their maternal grandmother they were already there because of the mother last illness.during this time the made his regular support payments,first to the mother,and then,after her death,to the grandmother.however,he cut his payment in half for an period during which one of the daughters lived outside the home of the grandmother.mccann,supra,th at.the reduction resulted in an arrearage which the district attorney support division tried to collect,but the trial court determined the had assumed custody and therefore the original order terminated.on appeal,the mccann court reasoned the could not unilaterally terminate the order that had to be done by an impartial third party,a court.id.at.
since the clearly never really had physical custody of either daughter,the mccann opinion had no occasion to consider any request for credit,and,in fact,it is pretty obvious from the facts that the father never provided the sort of support which precipitated the jackson cases.while the mccann court cited jackson,it was only for the negative implication that assumption of custody does not automatically terminate a support order.mccann,supra,th at.
but it is critical to understanding the application of mccann to realize that the never really assumed physical custody in any way.as this court has observed,while custody can have a specialized meaning under the family law act citation omitted it is not the ordinary meaning of the word.the ordinary meaning of custody in the context of a child of divorced parents is physical custody the parent with whom the child actually lives.inter valley health plan blue shield th.and clearly neither mccann nor gregory involved the payor parent living with the children or providing support because they shared the same household that is the ordinary meaning of custody under inter valley.and so,by the same token,neither case had occasion to confront the equities of enforcing an order against a parent who had discharged,fully or partially,a child support obligation by providing support in the home in which the children lived.that said,both cases do stand for the proposition of the continuing formal existence of a child support order if the payor parent does not take steps to formally modify or terminate it.
c.the davis and wilson bodine reconciliation cases 
and finally there are the reconciliation cases.as early as,our supreme court had occasion,in davis davis cal d,to consider the effect of a marital reconciliation reconciliation to the point of an actual remarriage to each other on an existing child support order.the essential sequence in davis was marriage,divorce,child support order,then remarriage,second divorce.in the context of the second divorce action the sought payments for a month period from the time of the remarriage to the second support order via a writ of execution based on the first support order.id.at.but the trial court ruled the remarriage terminated the first support order and our supreme court agreed.it reasoned that the termination of the order on remarriage was consistent with the objective of reestablishment of the family for the benefit of both the children and the parties.id.at.
years after davis,this court,in in re marriage of wilson bodine th,had occasion to apply davis in a setting where the first support order was not the product of a marital dissolution action,but a paternity action.a couple had a child born in,the mother obtained a child support order in a paternity action in,another child was born to them in,they actually married in,but they separated again in.the mother initiated a dissolution action in,but by,the local department of child support services was asserting a very large arrearage based on the original paternity support order that arrearage included the time during which the couple were married to each other and living together.id.at.the trial court determined not to follow davis because the original order was not the product of a marriage but a paternity action,so the order continued even after the actual marriage of the parents.id at.this court,however,reversed.we concluded davis did apply,and relied on a decision from the north dakota supreme court,schaff schaff,which had concluded no distinction should be drawn between the effect marriage has on a paternity decree versus a divorce decree of child support.wilson bodine,supra,th at,summarizing,but not quoting,schaff.the schaff court had pointed out that the marriage of parents of a child born out of wedlock necessarily nullifies the separate rights and responsibilities toward the child ascertained in a paternity action and replaces those separate rights with joint rights and responsibilities.wilson bodine,supra,at.the wilson bodine court added that even though the marriage had terminated the earlier paternity support order,on remand the trial court still had to evaluate whether the actually satisfied his parental obligation in the period after the separation.id.at.that certainly supports our analysis here.
out of state cases 
while the issue before us is a new one in california,it has come to the attention of more than two score state courts around the country,as reflected in an annotation in the american law reports.see alr,credit for time resided supra,annotation.if there is one general conclusion to be distilled from the alr annotation,it is that the majority of cases that have dealt with the question of credit for child support during periods of reconciliation have allowed it on the basis of one rationale or another,even when those courts otherwise recognize a state rule against retroactive modification of child support.see id.at.
however,identifying the strands of rationales offered in these cases is not always easy.we conclude the cases may be sorted into one of three theories general equity or trial court discretion some sort of voiding,nullification or suspension of the legal effectiveness of the prior decree that took place upon cohabitation,or equitable estoppel based on the payor parent having in some way reasonably relied on the payee parent representations or conduct.
general equity cases include child support enforcement admin.shehan,father allowed on remand to show he discharged his support obligation during the period of cohabition,and was thus eligible for support credits and dalton dalton,any monetary contribution made by the obligor former spouse to the obligee former spouse for the support of the obligee former spouse the parties child ren constitutes a credit toward the fulfillment of the obligor former spouse support obligations.
the cases that take the view cohabitation somehow voids or suspends the ongoing support order take a different tack.in substance,they say that cohabitation has the legal effect of depriving an ongoing child support order of legal force during such a period.a good example of this group is thomas thomas,which noted that while there was no ceremonial remarriage,the couple cohabitation after divorce constituted a common law marriage,which had the effect of nullifying the previous support decree from the divorce action 
the estoppel cases find their bases in the inconsistency of the payee parent,in effect,accepting support from the payor parent in the context of maintaining a household and then turning around and seeking the same support by way of enforcing a formal order to pay money.as good an example of the estoppel rationale as we have found is ramsey ramsey.after first reciting the general rule that a child support payment is a vested debt due the payee parent id.at,the ramsey court nevertheless affirmed a decision excusing past due child support based on equitable estoppel,emphasizing classic estoppel doctrines such as reasonable reliance and being misled to one detriment id.at.
these cases are relatively easy to dissect and classify.the cases,however,present harder problems of legal taxonomy.finding a pure case one where,like the trial court here,the court categorically precluded even the possibility of credit for the period of cohabitation turns out to be quite difficult.any number of cases that did allow credit,for example,explicitly recognized the possibility of credit,but concluded the payor parent had failed factuallyin the attempt to show actual support was provided to the children during the period of cohabitation but we have found only two that appear to have categorically ruled out any possibility of credit.both arrived at the same conclusion a child support order creates a vested debt to the payee parent,and any equitable credit is the substantive equivalent of an improper retroactive modification of child support.
the two cases are houser houser and cummings cummings so d.in houser,the trial court had actually allowed credit it called it an abatement on an estoppel theory because there was evidence the payee mother had agreed that any of the payor father child support obligations would be by his expenditures on behalf of the children,especially transportation costs during visitations.id.at.the state high court reversed,flat out saying the trial court had no authority to modify the child support provisions of the parties divorce decree by eliminating father past due support obligations through recognition of his request for a.id.at.
cummings likewise was a reversal of a judgment not affording the payee mother arrearages in the wake of a reconciliation.the court simply asserted that the arrearages were property rights vested in the mother,and therefore equity could not vary them.cummings,supra,so d at to the extent the trial court may have been acting equitably in reducing the amount of arrearages,we note equity will not nullify or reduce accumulated child support because child support is a vested property right until the judgment is altered or amended by a subsequent judgment or is terminated by operation of law.
application 
struggling through this thicket is largely a matter of process of elimination.we first dispense with two of the three rationales as inconsistent with established california doctrine.the theory is inconsistent with gregory mccann.if a support order survives the death of the payee spouse,it should certainly survive a period of cohabitation.accord,in re marriage of tavares th,support order survived mother concealment of the children.moreover,the underpinning of the theory is a equivalency of cohabitation with marriage.that might work in a state that recognizes common law marriages as shown in oklahoma thomas case,but california does not.see norman norman cal.
we may also dispense with the estoppel theory.as both trainotti and jackson note,a parent child support obligation runs to the child,not the payee parent.see trainotti,supra,d at jackson,supra,d at see also williams williams d,quoting estate of goulart d,if it be considered a debt it is,in essence,a debt owing to the child since a father duty to support his minor children is a continuing obligation during the minority of the children of the marriage.an estoppel rationale at least to the degree it would actually excuse an existing support obligation spelled out in an ongoing order based on the conduct of the payee parent independent of the actual support provided the children would have the effect of subordinating the children interest to the representations or conduct of that payee parent.
nor do we accept the main idea behind the categorical cases that allowing credit effects an improper retroactive modification of support.the essential underpinning of this idea is that child support is a vested debt owed to the payee parent and accumulates automatically with time,independent of whether a parent discharges the duty of child support that exists anyway.but,like the estoppel cases,that analysis focuses on the payee parent and not the children who are the recipients of support.the main point of the gregory and mccann cases is that the duty continues independent of the death of the payee parent because the focus should be on the actual support provided,not the mechanics of the order.see also tavares,supra,th at.
moreover,mechanical application of the rule seems to us inconsistent with the entire jackson line.the trial court may determine that nothing is owed for child support amounts that accrued during the period the supported child was living with the obligor parent.this does not effect an improper retroactive modification because the arrearages are deemed satisfied by the obligor direct provision for the child needs during the applicable period
