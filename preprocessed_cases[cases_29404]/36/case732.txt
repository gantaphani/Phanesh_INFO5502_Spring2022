introduction 
stephen father,the adoptive father of the minor,appeals from the trial court order granting the petition of the adoptive mother of the minor,mother,to terminate father parental rights to the minor under family code section mental disability.according to father,the trial court committed per se reversible error when it failed to order and consider an investigation by a licensed clinical social worker under section and a report by that social worker under section.father also contends that because it is only in rare and exceptional cases that a trial court should terminate parental rights when no adoption is pending,the trial court erred by terminating parental rights here as no adoption was pending.father further argues that the trial court erred by failing to consider less drastic alternatives to terminating his parental rights.
we hold that father forfeited on appeal his contentions concerning the application of sections and by failing to raise the issue in the trial court there is an insufficient showing of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with such forfeiture in any event,father failed to demonstrate that sections and applied to mother petition and if they did apply,father failed to show that he suffered prejudice from the trial court failure to order and consider the investigation and report required under those sections.we further hold that substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that terminating father parental rights was in the best interests of the minor,as well as the trial court implicit conclusion that no less drastic alternatives to termination were reasonably available.we therefore affirm the order terminating father parental rights.
factual and procedural background 
mother and father married and adopted the minor.prior to the marriage,father suffered from mental illness,but had taken medication that allowed him to function normally.shortly after they adopted the minor,father stopped taking his medication.as he failed to take medication,his mental condition deteriorated to the point where it seriously impacted his relationship with mother and the minor and resulted in restraining orders being issued.on one occasion,father appeared unannounced at mother home and tried to force her and the minor into his vehicle in the resulting struggle,the minor fell from mother arms and fractured his skull.mother ultimately filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage and was awarded sole custody of the minor.
mother also filed an initial petition to terminate father parental rights pursuant to section in response to the petition,the trial court appointed a psychologist and a psychiatrist to examine father and prepare reports with their diagnoses and prognoses.according to mother,after she and the minor moved out of state,father suffered a criminal conviction for the attempted murder of his mother.nevertheless,mother later stipulated with father to dismiss her petition to terminate father parental rights in exchange for father agreement to undergo treatment and take medication for his mental illness.mother then allowed father to reestablish a relationship with the minor,who was in therapy.
shortly after entering into the stipulation,father again refused to take his medication and his mental condition began to deteriorate,leading mother to reinstate her petition to terminate father parental rights.after the filing of the reinstated petition to terminate parental rights,the trial court appointed a psychologist and two psychiatrists to evaluate father mental condition.all of the experts reported that father was mentally disabled within the meaning of section,and that if he continued to refuse to comply with medical treatment recommendations,he would remain disabled for the foreseeable future.at trial on the reinstated petition,the testimony of the experts was consistent with their reports.the trial court concluded that section applies to father.all experts agree that the best interest of the minor is that the parental rights of father be terminated therefore,the court finds that section of the family code applies to father and father parental rights are terminated.
discussiona.standard of review 
in an analogous case in which parental rights were terminated under,inter alia,former civil code section,subdivision a the court stated,the right of parents to raise their own children is so fundamental that termination of that right by the courts must be viewed as a drastic remedy to be applied only in extreme cases.citation.accordingly,there must be clear and convincing evidence of the facts necessary to declare minors free from the custody and control of their parents under civil code section.citation.in re victoria,supra,d at.
the clear and convincing standard,however,applies in the trial court and is not a standard for appellate review.crail blakely cal d.the sufficiency of evidence to establish a given fact,where the law requires proof of the fact to be clear and convincing,is primarily a question for the trial court to determine,and if there is substantial evidence to support its conclusion,the determination is not open to review on appeal.citations.citation.thus,on appeal from a judgment required to be based upon clear and convincing evidence,the clear and convincing test disappears and the usual rule of conflicting evidence is applied,giving full effect to the respondent evidence,however slight,and disregarding the appellant evidence,however strong.citation.in re angelique th,d.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court judgment,and when there is a conflict in the evidence,we draw all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court finding.in re brison th,d.when drawing inferences,we do so only as to those that uphold the decision of the trial court.paine san bernardino valley traction cal,see lake reed cal th,d.we review de novo the legal issues concerning statutory construction.see regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.
failure to order and consider investigation and report under sections and 
father contends that sections and applied to mother petition to terminate parental rights and that those sections required the trial court to order a licensed clinical social worker to conduct an investigation and prepare a report for the trial court consideration.because the trial court failed to order an investigation and a report by a licensed clinical social worker as required by sections and,father maintains that the court committed error that was reversible per se.
forfeiture 
because father failed to raise any issue in the trial court concerning either a section investigation or a section report,we asked the parties to submit letter briefs on whether father forfeited on appeal his contentions premised on those sections.we conclude that father forfeited on appeal his contentions under sections and.
the supreme court in keener jeld wen,cal th,d,explained the basis for the forfeiture rule as follows the forfeiture rule generally applies in all civil and criminal proceedings.citations.the rule is designed to advance efficiency and deter gamesmanship.as we explained in people simon cal th,d,the purpose of the general doctrine of waiver or forfeiture is to encourage a defendant to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected or avoided and a fair trial had citation.no procedural principle is more familiar to this court than that a constitutional right,or a right of any other sort,may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.citation.the rationale for this rule was aptly explained in sommer martin.at page,in the hurry of the trial many things may be,and are,overlooked which would readily have been rectified had attention been called to them.the law casts upon the party the duty of looking after his legal rights and of calling the judge attention to any infringement of them.if any other rule were to obtain,the party would in most cases be careful to be silent as to his objections until it would be too late to obviate them,and the result would be that few judgments would stand the test of an appeal.citation.fn.omitted citations.citation.
father contends that the social worker investigation and report under sections and are not subject to waiver because they are jurisdictional,a trial court is not empowered to terminate parental rights under the family code unless it complies with the mandates of those sections.we disagree.
the supreme court in in re marriage of goddard cal th,d,goddard noted,inter alia,that most procedural errors are not jurisdictional.the court said,j urisdictional errors can be of two types.a court can lack fundamental authority over the subject matter,question presented,or party,making its judgment void,or it can merely act in excess of its jurisdiction or defined power,rendering the judgment voidable.citations.m ost procedural errors are not jurisdictional.citations.once a court has established its power to hear a case,it may make errors with respect to areas of procedure,pleading,evidence,and substantive law.citations.italics added.in goddard,the supreme court held that code of civil procedure section,subdivision b requiring a party who serves the requisite notice of trial to introduce competent evidence of that service at a default prove up trial was not jurisdictional and therefore was subject to a harmless error analysis.id.at,d.
the investigation and report under sections and are procedural and evidentiary requirements,much like the evidentiary statute at issue in goddard,supra,cal th,d.therefore,those provisions are not jurisdictional in either sense described above,and,as a result,we conclude that they are subject to forfeiture.
in this case,the trial court ordered examinations by and considered reports from two psychiatrists and a psychologist.it also appointed separate counsel for the minor and father,as well as a guardian ad litem for father.at no point,however,did father counsel suggest or imply that an additional investigation and a report from a licensed clinical social worker be ordered,much less suggest that such an investigation and a report were mandatory under sections and.had father counsel requested an investigation and a report,both the trial court and mother counsel would have had an opportunity to consider and respond to father request.because father failed to afford the trial court and mother counsel that opportunity,he forfeited any issue under sections and on appeal.
in his letter brief,father also contends that if we conclude that he forfeited his contentions under sections and,then he received ineffective assistance of counsel.but father concedes that such a claim is not cognizable on appeal unless the record affirmatively establishes the elements of that claim,citing in re daisy th,d to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance,appellant must show both that counsel representation fell below prevailing professional norms and that in the absence of counsel failings,a more favorable result was reasonably probable unless record affirmatively establishes ineffective assistance,appellate court must affirm judgment.the record on appeal does not establish that counsel conduct fell below prevailing professional norms.the record does not evidence whether there was a satisfactory explanation for counsel failure to raise the investigation and report issue under sections and.perhaps father counsel concluded that the reports and testimony of the three medical experts were sufficient and that an additional report from a licensed clinical social worker would be cumulative or otherwise not helpful.moreover,as we hold post,sections and were not applicable to mother petition in any event.
applicability of sections and to mother petition under section 
even if father had not forfeited his contentions under sections and,those sections do not apply to mother petition,which was brought under section section empowers a trial court to terminate parental rights when the parent mental disability renders him or her unable to care for and control his or her child and the disability is likely to remain so in the foreseeable future.unlike the other sections of the family code that provide for termination of parental rights under various circumstances,section is the only provision that specifies that a trial court must take expert evidence from two psychiatrists or psychologists and that the trial court may,in its sound discretion,take testimony from,inter alia,a licensed clinical social worker.section does not mention sections or,which make an investigation and a report by a licensed clinical social worker mandatory generally in ruling on a petition to terminate parental rights under the family code.those sections focus on the child circumstances and the child feelings and attitudes,while section focuses instead on the mental condition of the parent and his or her capacity to care for the child.this suggests that the social worker requirement applies to proceedings under the provisions other than section.
in addition,although section allows a trial court to consider testimony from a licensed clinical social worker,it expressly provides that such testimony is a matter of discretion,thereby indicating that section creates an exception to the general rule mandating a report from a licensed clinical social worker if the ground for terminating parental rights is the mental disability of the parent.when a mental disability is the focus of the trial court inquiry,the legislature required testimony from two psychiatrists or psychologists,but made testimony from a licensed clinical social worker discretionary.in view of the distinguishing features of section,we conclude that the mandatory requirements of an investigation and a report by a licensed clinical social worker under sections and were not applicable to mother petition.if we were to read those mandatory requirements into section,the language in section concerning the discretionary testimony of a licensed clinical social worker would be either conflicting or superfluous.
even if sections and applied to mother petition,father has failed to demonstrate how the absence of a licensed clinical social worker investigation and report prejudiced him in this case.instead,he argues that the trial court failure to order such an investigation and report was legal error that is reversible per se.but the two cases upon which father relies in re linda d.and neumann melgar th,d do not support his reversible per se contention.linda makes no mention of whether the error in that case was reversible per se,and the court in neumann expressly concluded that the failure to consider the evaluator section report in that case was prejudicial error.neumann melgar,supra,th at,d,italics added.thus,the procedural and evidentiary errors of which father complains failing to order and consider a section investigation and a section report are subject to a harmless error analysis.
t he presumption in the california constitution is that the improper admission or rejection of evidence or any error as to any matter of procedure,is subject to harmless error analysis and must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice in order for the judgment to be set aside.cal,art.vi.code of civil procedure section contains similar language the court must,in every stage of an action,disregard any error,improper ruling,instruction,or defect,in the pleadings or proceedings which,in the opinion of the court,does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.goddard,supra,cal th at,d.thus,for a nonjurisdictional error to result in reversal,there must be a reasonable probability of a different result had the error not occurred.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,d,soule general motors cal th,d.
because father has failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the trial court failure to order and consider a section investigation and a section report,he has not shown reversible error.moreover,based on the evidence of father mental condition,including mother testimony and the reports and testimony of the experts,there was no reasonable probability that father would have obtained a different result if the trial court had also consider
