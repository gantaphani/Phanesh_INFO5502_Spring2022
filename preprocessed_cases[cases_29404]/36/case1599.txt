irene conlin drapeau appeals from the trial court ruling that louis claude drapeau early retirement benefit erb was his separate property she contends the erb was derived from a contractual right acquired during the parties marriage,and must therefore be characterized as community property.we agree,and reverse and remand on that issue.jennifer also contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order sufficient spousal support to allow her to save at the same rate as during the parties marriage,and in setting a prospective termination date to coincide with louis mandatory retirement.we remand the spousal support order to permit the trial court to consider the parties marital savings history as an element in their marital standard of living,as explained below.
factual and procedural background 
louis and jennifer were married in,and separated in.both were years old at the time of trial.their minor child was years old their year old son also lived at home.jennifer,who had not worked outside the home during most of the marriage,was employed at the time of trial as chief of staff to the mayor of berkeley,earning a salary of.

the third benefit is the contested erb,which is available to units partners who have years of partner service and retire between the ages of and the erb is calculated based on the partner units earned and per unit earnings,resulting in an amount approximately equal to two times the partner average annual salary during his last three years of employment it is payable either in a lump sum or over a period of up to years.the total value of the erb declines each month after the partner birthday,reaching a value of zero at the partner birthday,when the other aa retirement benefits become available.following trial,the court ruled that the erb was louis separate property akin to a severance benefit,and awarded jennifer in monthly spousal support in response to jennifer request,the court issued a detailed statement of decision after a further hearing.jennifer filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
early retirement benefit 
louis concedes that the most pertinent supreme court authority concerning the proper characterization of early retirement payments such as the erb is in re marriage of lehman cal th,d,lehman.in that case,the court held that a nonemployee spouse had a community property interest in the employee spouse enhanced retirement benefit,even though the enhancement was offered after the parties separation,because the underlying retirement benefit derived,in part,from employment during the marriage id.at,d.the supreme court observed that the right to retirement benefits accrued by the employee spouse represent s a property interest to the extent that such a right derive s from employment during marriage before separation,it comprise s a community asset id.at,d,quoting in re marriage of brown cal d,brown.the court also recognized that the employee spouse actions may affect the nature of the retirement benefits owned by the community,but held that the nonemployee spouse owns an interest in the asset.lehman,supra,at,d.
in analyzing the applicable law,the lehman court reviewed in some detail two appellate cases which dealt with the characterization of retirement benefits in re marriage of gram th,d gram and in re marriage of frahm th,d frahm.both cases had properly recognized that the issue of characterization of property does not turn on the motive of the employer.in any context,motive is,at best,hard to discern.citation.in this context,it is also irrelevant.citations.that is because the employer acts for its own business reasons,and not for reasons bearing on the characterization of property for employee spouses and nonemployee spouses.citations.lehman,supra,cal th at,d.in other respects,however,gram and frahm differed in their analytical approaches.
in gram,years after the dissolution of the parties marriage,the employer offered early retirement incentives,including the crediting of additional years of service and age,in an attempt to avoid discharging certain employees.the employee spouse elected to retire early,and received enhanced retirement benefits each month.supra,th at,d.the superior court characterized the enhancement as the employee spouse separate property,but the appellate court disagreed.id.at,d.it applied a test derived from cases involving severance payments,which looks to whether the benefit in question constitutes deferred compensation for services during marriage before separation or present compensation for loss of earnings thereafter,and held that the nonemployee spouse owned a community property interest in the employee spouse retirement benefits as enhanced because it was a part of,and intended to be,the realization of the employee spouse retirement expectation and thus a form of deferred compensation for services rendered citation.lehman,supra,cal th at,d.
in frahm,the employer offered a different incentive for early retirement,which included both a severance payment and retirement benefits.lehman,supra,cal th at,d.the employee spouse admitted the retirement benefits were a community asset,but contended the severance payment was his separate property.the appellate court agreed,relying on what it characterized as the very simple message of the supreme court decision in brown,supra,cal d,that a n employment benefit,whether or not vested,is community property to the extent a right to it accrues during marriage.frahm,supra,th at,d.the frahm court concluded the employee spouse had not accrued a right to the severance payment during marriage,and the nonemployee spouse therefore had no community property in the severance payment frahm,at,d.
the frahm court found little guidance in gram and the severance payment decisions on which gram had relied,noting that the results were inconsistent,and concluding that a pplying the reasoning of these cases to our facts works as well as trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.frahm,supra,th at,d.the frahm court also rejected t he past services or future compensation test as inapt for determining the character of the benefit,noting that it focused on the wrong question,the motivation of the employer.ibid.
in lehman,the supreme court concluded that both gram and frahm were correct in their results,but that frahm is sounder in its reasoning as to characterization because it cleaves closely to brown,and gram is weaker because it wanders away in the direction of ad hoc decisionmaking.as we held in brown,what is determinative is the single concrete fact of time.to the only to the an employee spouse accrues a right to property during marriage before separation,the property in question is a community asset.lehman,supra,cal th at,d.
as has been observed while the disputed asset in lehman was an enhanced retirement benefit,the court distinguished the results in several other types of employee benefit cases involving severance payments and stock options solely on the basis of when the right to the benefit accrued.citation.in so doing,the court seems to have sent a strong message that the brown time approach focusing on whether the right to the benefit accrued during marriage and before separation should apply to the characterization of any type of employment termination derivative of retirement benefits or an entirely separate payment.the line of cases distinguishing between past services and future compensation may have reached a correct result,but the continuing validity of the approach they took to get at that result is now open to question.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
here the erb was considered louis separate property because it provided present compensation for lost future earnings,rather than deferred compensation for past services rendered during the marriage.that analytical approach,however,which also underlies respondents argument on appeal,was disapproved by the supreme court in lehman,supra.instead,the relevant question is whether the right to the erb accrued during marriage before separation if so,it is a community asset.cal th at,d.
the record here indicates that the erb was payable pursuant to a contract entered into during the parties marriage.see in re marriage of skaden cal d,skaden in re marriage of horn d.furthermore,all years of qualifying employment also took place before the parties separation.thus the erb was derived from a contractual right acquired during the parties marriage,and must be characterized as community property.see lehman,supra,cal th at,d.
other aspects of the erb itself also support its characterization as a community asset.first,its designation as an early retirement benefit strongly suggests its character as an element in the employee planning for retirement in addition,the parties personal financial statements,prepared before separation,confirm that they viewed the erb in such a manner,and that it was an important part of their financial planning for retirement.see gram,supra,th at,d enhanced early retirement plan constituted part of the realization of the employee retirement expectation.the substantial financial value of the erb is a further indication of its significant role in the context of the aa retirement program as a whole 
all these aspects of the erb are in contrast to the nature of the severance payments held to be separate property in the cases on which louis relies.see,in re marriage of lawson d.in re marriage of deshurley d.in those cases,the payments received by the employee spouse resulted from unexpected and ad hoc incentives offered by an employer attempting to reduce its workforce in response to changing business conditions,not from retirement benefits to which the employee spouse was contractually entitled by virtue of his employment during the marriage.the erb was not a new benefit created after the parties separation,but constituted a significant part of louis compensation package,which was earned with marital labor it was not a severance payment either in name or in nature.see lehman,supra,cal th at,d.jennifer was therefore entitled to her share of the community proportionate interest in the erb and we reverse and remand on this issue.
while louis contends that payments made after separation pursuant to a contract signed during marriage do not necessarily constitute community property,the cases on which he relies preceded lehman,supra,and are also otherwise distinguishable.in garfein garfein d,the employee spouse was an actress who signed a contract under which a motion picture studio agreed to pay her a fixed amount regardless of whether she appeared in any of their movies.she agreed,however,not to accept other potentially conflicting engagements during that time.id.at.because her conduct was essential to her right to earn compensation under the contract,the court concluded the payments were earned after separation and constituted the employee spouse separate property.id.at.here,however,louis right to receive the erb was based on his years of qualifying employment during the marriage and before separation.in re marriage of roesch d.is also distinguishable.although the contract in that case was signed during the marriage,the employment began only after the parties separated.id.at.
louis also argues that the erb can not be viewed as compensation for past services because the amount of the benefit declines the longer the employee works after reaching age,and disappears entirely when the employee reaches the age of.this argument misses the point the erb was earned by louis marital labor,and is therefore a community asset the declining value of the benefit could also be seen as further proof of its status as a retirement benefit,providing a bridge to the other retirement benefits available at the age of mandatory retirement.louis also points out that he will not be entitled to an erb unless he stops working for aa the same is true,however,of any retirement benefit nor is it determinative that the retirement benefit at issue in lehman was an enhancement of the employer regular retirement benefits,rather than a separate retirement benefit.whether or not the erb is independent of other retirement benefits offered by aa,under the analytical approach mandated in lehman,it is the time of the benefit accrual that is crucial the formula which generates the erb benefit depends on the employee number of partnership units jennifer concedes that units earned after the date of separation are louis separate property.we therefore remand for the superior court to apportion the erb accordingly.see lehman,supra,cal th at,d.
spousal support 
family code section lists a number of circumstances to be considered by the trial court in awarding spousal support these include t he needs of each party based on the standard of living established during the marriage,subd.d.case law has described the marital standard of living msl as reasonable needs commensurate with the parties general station in life.citation.in re marriage of smith d.in evaluating the relevant statutory factors to determine permanent spousal support,the actual marital standard of living is not an absolute measure of reasonable need,but merely a basis or reference point for determining need and support.id.at.while the trial court must consider the statutory guidelines,the ultimate decision rests within its broad discretion.the purposes of spousal support inevitably vary from case to case,depending upon the parties and the facts and circumstances of the case.id.at.weighing the factors specified by statute and by appellate case law,the trial court,in exercising its discretion on the issue of spousal support,must endeavor to make an order which will achieve a just and reasonable result in each case.id.at.because trial courts have such broad discretion,appellate courts must act with cautious judicial restraint in reviewing these orders.citation.in re marriage of kerr th,d.
jennifer main argument is that the parties history of consistently saving significant portions of their income constituted an important part of their msl,and the spousal support order should therefore have provided an amount sufficient to enable her to continue to save as she did during the marriage,given louis ability to pay we agree that a rule prohibiting consideration of the parties marital savings history would penalize those who are prudent enough to save during marriage,and would conflict with sound public policy to encourage such savings.
while jennifer concedes that she has received the benefit of her community share in the parties past savings,she points out that the goal of their ongoing savings plan was to enable them to retire early while continuing their present standard of living,a goal which louis can continue to pursue under the existing spousal support order,but she can not.in in re marriage of winter th,d,husband argued that an award of temporary spousal support should be reduced from the guideline amount because the parties had a frugal lifestyle during marriage.the trial court concluded that the parties practice of investing a portion of their income was part of the standard of living that should be included in a temporary support order.ibid.division four of this court noted that the parties in winter had allocated substantial funds for saving and investment concluding that we fail to see why wife should be deprived of her accustomed just because it involved the purchase of stocks and bonds rather than fur coats.id.at,d.we recognize that temporary support is designed to maintain the parties positions pending trial,while the need for permanent spousal support is determined by their financial circumstances after dissolution and division of their property.based on the appli
