in this family law matter keith smith keith appeals from a postjudgment order dividing his military retirement benefits.he argues that the trial court erred by requiring him to pay his former wife kum smith a percentage of any veterans disability payments he may receive during his retirement and by requiring that he participate in the military survivor benefit plan sbp and name as his sole beneficiary.finding no error,we shall affirm.
keith and were married in.the marital status was dissolved on june.marital property was divided by agreement contained in a judgment filed october.at the time,keith was a colonel in the united states army.his service in the army had begun eight years prior to his marriage to and he was still on active duty when he and separated.keith expected to retire around september.if keith retired as planned,roughly percent of the military retirement would have been community property,giving about a percent interest in the retirement asset.the precise percentage would depend upon the date keith actually retired and his rank at the time of retirement.
the stipulated judgment dividing the marital property contains the following paragraph the army retirement shall be divided.petitioner will be given credit for his separate interest for the period of time that he was in the armed services prior to marriage and the period of time subsequent to marriage.the community interest shall be equally divided.the parties agree to use edwin shilling to prepare necessary documents.the parties to share the costs equally.no appeal was taken from the judgment.
the parties had expected edwin shilling,an expert in military retirement benefits,to prepare the necessary documents to insure that the military pay center would have what it needed to give effect to the portion of the judgment pertaining to keith retirement pay.after judgment was entered learned that shilling did not accept joint representations.retained shilling herself and shilling prepared a proposed order for her.keith opposed the proposed order on the grounds that it was inconsistent with the judgment and with federal law.
a hearing was held at which shilling testified as an expert to assist the court in understanding the requirements of the pertinent federal law.no other evidence was taken.keith had wanted to testify about his understanding of the meaning of the stipulated judgment but the trial court refused to accept the evidence,holding that the stipulated judgment speaks for itself.the trial court adopted the proposed order.keith appeals from that order.
ii.discussion 
a.the disability pay issue.introduction 
veterans who became disabled as a result of military service are eligible for disability benefits.with exceptions not pertinent here,a military retiree may receive disability benefits only to the extent that he or she waives a corresponding amount of retired pay.there are several advantages to taking disability rather than retirement pay so that retirement pay waivers are quite common.mansell mansell,d mansell.although federal law permits courts in community property states to treat military disposable retired pay as community property,retirement pay that has been waived in favor of disability may not be treated as community.id.at.
there is no evidence that keith was receiving or was eligible for disability pay at the time the court entered the order he challenges here.nevertheless,the court postjudgment order requires that,if keith later elects to receive disability in lieu of retirement,he must pay the amount of the retirement pay she would lose as a result of his waiver keith contends that this provision was not contemplated by the judgment and that it is impermissible under federal law.
keith argument requires interpretation of the parties stipulated judgment.the interpretation of a written instrument is essentially a judicial function to be exercised according to the generally accepted canons of interpretation so that the purposes of the instrument may be given effect.parsons bristol development cal d.unless interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence,an appellate court is not bound by the trial court construction but makes an independent determination of the meaning of the writing.and see lucas elliott th,d.
legal framework 
members of the armed forces who serve for a specified period of time may retire and receive retired pay.see.in,the united states supreme court held that federal law prohibited state courts from treating military retired pay as community property.mccarty mccarty,d.in response,congress passed the uniformed services former spouses protection act usfspa,which authorizes courts in community property states to treat disposable retired pay as community property.c.the usfspa defines disposable retired pay as the total monthly retired pay to which a member is entitled less,among other things,amounts deducted as a result of the waiver required to receive disability benefits.a.in mansell,supra,the united states supreme court held that since the usfspa expressly excluded disability benefits from the definition of disposable retired pay,retired pay that has been waived to receive disability benefits may not be treated as community property.mansell,supra,at.thus,where a military spouse had been receiving both disability benefits and retired pay at the time of dissolution,the state court could divide the retired pay but could not divide the disability payments.ibid.
the mansell holding led many state courts to look for creative solutions to prevent a former spouse from losing his or her interest in the military retirement as the result of unilateral action on the part of the military spouse.in re marriage of krempin th,d krempin held that a postjudgment waiver of retired pay could not,in proper circumstances,reduce the former spouse monthly benefit.in krempin,the judgment gave wife a percent interest in husband air force retirement with monthly payments to commence when husband retired.the marital settlement agreement incorporated into the judgment added the court in the parties dissolution action will reserve jurisdiction to make such orders relating to these retirement benefits as are necessary to carry out this agreement.id.at,d.after judgment was entered,husband retired and the parties filed another stipulation,which stated that the defense accounting and finance center would begin direct payment to wife of her monthly share of the pension in july,and that husband would pay that sum to wife until those direct payments started.husband was soon determined to be completely disabled and he waived all his retirement benefits in order to receive disability.retirement pay ceased and wife payments were reduced to nothing.ibid.
krempin distinguished mansell,noting that the challenged judgment in mansell had given the nonmilitary spouse a community property interest in retirement pay that the military spouse had already waived to obtain disability benefits and,therefore,the award directly conflicted with the usfspa.krempin,supra,th at,d.there is no such direct conflict when the waiver of retirement pay occurs after the judgment and new payments are ordered to enforce what had been a proper division of marital property,even if the payments account for the military spouse receipt of new benefits or pay which could not have been divided in the first instance.ibid.krempin reviewed the cases from out of state that had confronted similar issues and found that a majority of state courts take equitable action,on one theory or another,to compensate a former spouse when his or her share of retirement pay is reduced by the other postjudgment waiver.ibid.krempin concluded that the issue hinged on the scope of the judgment reservation of jurisdiction and the agreements in the judgment and the postjudgment stipulation with respect to appellant payments.if the reservation of jurisdiction and the payment provisions can be interpreted to apply in the event of a waiver of retirement pay,the court has the power to grant the relief appellant seeks.id.at,d.
in krempin,the provisions of the judgment and the parties stipulation were reasonably susceptible to the construction urged by both parties.language referring to payment by the defense accounting and finance center could be read to mean that wife would take only retired pay because disability benefits are paid by the veterans administration,not the defense accounting and finance center.krempin,supra,th at,d.on the other hand,the stipulation identified the wife interest as a specific dollar amount and provided that husband would pay that amount until direct payments began,which suggests that the parties had presumed the wife interest to be her share of the total retirement pay.id.at,d.this interpretation,the court observed,was strengthened by the reservation of jurisdiction,which suggested that the parties may have anticipated future contingencies such as waivers of retirement pay which might call for new arrangements to preserve the original bargain.this interpretation would be consistent with commentaries which advise including a reservation of jurisdiction in the marital settlement agreement as a way of protecting the nonmilitary spouse from future waivers of retirement pay.id.at,d.
the court remanded the case to the trial court to allow the parties to offer extrinsic evidence to support their respective positions.krempin,supra,th at,d.if the trial court were to conclude that the parties intended for appellant to continue to receive her original share of respondent retirement pay even if he waived all or a portion of that pay to obtain disability benefits,the mansell case would not prevent the court from giving appellant the benefit of her bargain by imposing a resulting trust.id.at,d.under krempin,therefore,the question is whether the stipulated judgment contemplated the division of the retirement asset as it existed at the time of judgment or whether the parties had agreed that keith could waive all or part of the retirement benefit and thereby unilaterally reduce the value of the asset to be divided.
the marital property was divided by the stipulated judgment.the only reference to the military retirement is the single paragraph stating the army retirement shall be divided.petitioner will be given credit for his separate interest for the period of time that he was in the armed services prior to marriage and the period of time subsequent to marriage.the community interest shall be equally divided.the parties agree to use edwin shilling to prepare necessary documents.the parties to share the costs equally.
keith argues that the trial court should have admitted extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of this paragraph.we disagree.extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret the instrument,but not to give it a meaning to which it is not reasonably susceptible.parsons bristol development,supra,cal d at.this portion of the stipulated judgment admits of no ambiguity.it does not purport to divide disposable retired pay,it divides the community interest in the army retirement.there is no mention of keith receiving disability pay or of his eligibility for it and,unlike the judgment in krempin,it does not specify that is to collect her interest from the defense accounting and finance center.the reference that shilling would prepare necessary documents reflects an understanding that postjudgment proceedings would be needed to implement the division set forth in the judgment.
keith points to the provision in the judgment that states that the community interest shall be divided.he maintains that since disability benefits can not be community property,the judgment does not expect that disability benefits would be divided.but the reference to the community interest follows the explanation that the retirement is not wholly community since part of keith service occurred before and after the marriage.the judgment merely confirms that only the community interest,and not keith separate interest,is to be divided.the judgment plainly indicates that would receive half of the retirement benefit remaining after taking account of the portion keith earned before and after the marriage.there is nothing in the language of the judgment that would make it reasonably susceptible of the interpretation keith urges,that the parties had agreed that keith could reduce or eliminate the retirement asset by his voluntary waiver sometime in the future.
the plain meaning of the agreement is consistent with the general rule in this state,which is if a spouse elects to receive a disability pension when he or she is qualified for a retirement benefit based on longevity of service,the pension is a community asset except for that portion which is attributable to service before marriage,and that portion which,by virtue of its disability status,exceeds the amount of the longevity benefit.in re marriage of higinbotham d,citing in re marriage of stenquist cal d.it is not,as keith argues,inconsistent with federal law as interpreted by mansell.it is important to recall that mansell held merely that the federal law does not grant state courts the power to divide military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans disability benefits.mansell,supra,at,italics added.in this case,so far as we can tell from the record,keith was not receiving any disability payments when judgment was entered so the court did not divide retirement pay that has been waived.the postjudgment order merely provides that,if keith does elect to receive disability in lieu of retirement in the future,he will indemnify for his unilateral reduction of the retirement asset,thereby insuring that will receive the benefit of the bargain she made at dissolution.see,in re marriage of gaddis.
b.the survivor benefit plan 
introduction 
the trial court ordered keith to participate in the sbp and to name as the beneficiary.the order also requires keith to pay part of the premium.keith argues that the judgment did not contemplate division of the sbp so that it should not be part of the postjudgment order at all.in the alternative,keith contends that he should not be required to pay any part of the premium and that the order wastes a large portion of the benefit so that he can not make it available to his new wife.
to the extent keith argument requires interpretation of the judgment,we apply our independent review.lucas elliott,supra,th at,d.the remainder of keith argument concerns the manner in which the court divided the community interest in the united states army retirement.the method in which community pension rights are divided is a matter within the trial court sound discretion,considering the particular circumstances of the case.in re marriage of carnall d,quoting in re marriage of verlinde d.as a general rule,in selecting a method to effect distribution of the community interest in retirement rights the court acts in the exercise of judicial discretion and its determination respecting such will not be interfered with on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.the criterion governing judicial action is reasonableness under the circumstances.the method adopted may vary with the facts in each case.in re marriage of freiberg d,disapproved on other grounds by in re marriage of gillmore cal d.
legal framework 
under california law,retirement benefits earned by a spouse during a marriage are community property,subject to equal division upon the dissolution of that marriage.in re marriage of gillmore,supra,cal d at,citing in re marriage of brown cal d.the trial court may make that division by whatever method or formula it determines,in its discretion,will achieve substantial justice between the parties.in re marriage of steinberger th,d.
family code section,subdivision a provides that the family court shall make whatever orders are necessary or appropriate to ensure that each party receives the party full community property share in any retirement plan,whether public or private,including all survivor and death benefits.listed among the types of orders the court is authorized to make is an order requiring a party to elect a survivor benefit annuity or other similar election for the benefit of the other party,as specified by the court,in any case in which a retirement plan provides for such an election,subd.a.
