introduction 
mandy mother and ezequiel father,the parents of harmony born in march,appeal from an order of the juvenile court terminating their parental rights under welfare and institutions code section.ruth grandmother,the paternal grandmother of harmony,also appeals from the order.
father argues that the juvenile court failed to inform him of his right to file a writ petition challenging the findings and orders at the referral hearing,and that failure was a violation of due process allowing the court to review those findings and orders in the instant appeal erred in denying reunification services and abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance of the section hearing.mother joins father contentions.grandmother argues that the juvenile court abused its discretion by refusing to continue the section hearing and in ordering that the foster parents adoption application be given preference over all other applications.
we conclude that because the juvenile court failed to give father notice of his right to file a writ petition to challenge the findings and orders at the referral hearing,father may raise those challenges in this appeal.however,we find no merit in father challenges to those findings and orders the juvenile court did not err in denying reunification services.we further conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to continue the section hearing and in ordering preference for the foster parents adoption application.
ii.facts and procedural background 
in may,the riverside county department of public social services dpss filed a petition in the juvenile court alleging that harmony,then one month old,came within section,subdivisions b and g.the petition alleged that mother had been arrested on an active warrant and for being a parolee at large parents had been receiving reunification services for approximately months regarding their other children,ezequiel,born in,and desiree born in,due to substantiated allegations of general neglect and substance abuse,and parents had failed to complete their case plan and had not reunified with those two children and mother was incarcerated and her whereabouts were unknown.the application for the petition also stated that father suffered from schizophrenia and could not care for harmony without assistance.
when harmony was detained,the parents were questioned about her placement.both parents stated that they wanted grandmother,who lived in washington state,to take legal guardianship of harmony,and they wanted their two older children placed with grandmother.the detention report indicated that an interstate compact on placement of children icpc evaluation of grandmother home had already been requested.
father and grandmother appeared at the detention hearing on may.the court found that a prima facie case for an detention had been established and ordered harmony detained in foster care or with an appropriate relative.the court ordered the dpss to assess relatives for placement and to commence an icpc with the state of washington.the court also ordered frequent and liberal supervised visitation for parents and grandmother.
in the report,the dpss requested that no reunification services be offered to parents because they had failed to complete their service plan with respect to their older children.the report noted that the icpc proceedings could not commence with respect to harmony until there had been a finding of jurisdiction,but that such proceedings were underway with respect to the two older siblings.meanwhile,harmony was doing well in foster placement,and father and grandmother had visited her.mother remained incarcerated.
on july,the court held a review hearing with respect to the two older children at which the court terminated reunification services and set their matter for a permanent plan hearing.immediately thereafter,the court conducted the hearing for harmony.the court sustained the allegations of the petition,declared harmony a dependent,and removed her from her parents custody.the court ordered that an expedited icpc be commenced with the state of washington.the court denied reunification services to parents based on the orders terminating reunification services as to the older siblings and set the matter for a permanent plan hearing.
on december,the date scheduled for the section hearing,county counsel requested that the matter be put over for four months pending completion of the icpc.counsel for father joined the request,observing,the paternal grandmother is here,very frustrated in the fact it is taking so long for the icpc to be completed.it would facilitate placement of all three together.i not sure if the court can make further orders or requests of the department regarding expediting the matter.the court stated that it trusted the dpss was making all reasonable efforts,and the court continued the hearing until march.
at the rescheduled hearing on march,county counsel informed the court that the icpc still had not been completed and asked the court to order another expedited icpc.the court agreed to do so and set the hearing for may.
in the dpss report for the section hearing,the dpss recommended that parental rights be terminated so harmony could be adopted by her foster parents.the dpss explained that the icpc with washington state had not been finalized,and harmony had bonded with her foster parents,who wished to adopt her.
washington state closed the icpc request for a home study of grandmother home,stating that grandmother fbi fingerprint check had not been completed.although grandmother had submitted fingerprints,the card was rejected because the tips of her fingers had not been correctly printed.however,other aspects of the icpc had been completed,and a home study had been tentatively approved.
the section hearing was held on may,attended by father and grandmother.father requested that the matter again be continued so the icpc on grandmother home could be completed,but the trial court denied the request.the court found that harmony was adoptable and that adoption was in her best interests.the court terminated parents parental rights and referred the matter for adoptive planning.the court ordered that the foster parents adoption application be given preference over any other application.
iii.discussion 
grandmother standing 
in juvenile dependency proceedings,as in civil actions generally citation,only a party aggrieved by the judgment has standing to appeal.citations.in re lauren th,d.standing to appeal is jurisdictional.in re frank th,d.whether one has standing in a particular case generally revolves around the question whether that person has rights that may suffer some injury,actual or threatened.citation.cesar superior court th,d.
in cesar,the court held that a grandmother,although not a party,has standing to seek appellate review of the denial of her request for placement under section.cesar superior court,supra,th at,d.the court explained that the grandmother separate interest in her relationship with her grandchild,is legally protected in section,which confers upon a grandparent the right to preferential consideration for placement.cesar,at,d.
section provides a in any case in which a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section,preferential consideration shall be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative.in this context,preferential consideration means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated,subd.c.here,however,grandmother does not appeal from the denial of a request for placement under section,but from the termination of parental rights following the section hearing.we therefore conclude that grandmother lacks standing in this appeal,and her appeal must be dismissed.
