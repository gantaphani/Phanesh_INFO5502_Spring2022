manwah ho,the mother of kathryn punsly,appeals an order granting visitation to kathryn paternal grandparents,marilyn and bernard punsly under family code section manwah contends section is unconstitutional,as applied to her,in light of the recent united states supreme court case of troxel granville,d troxel,a case concerning the constitutionality of a nonparental visitation statute,and troxel appellate progeny.manwah also contends the court ancillary orders attached to the visitation order,independently,violated her constitutional due process rights.we conclude section,as applied in this case,unconstitutionally infringed on manwah fundamental rights.accordingly,we reverse the order in its entirety.
statement of facts 
manwah married the punslys son,richard,and they had one child,kathryn,born in.in,manwah and richard divorced and while they shared joint legal and physical custody of kathryn,manwah assumed primary physical custody.richard was diagnosed with bone cancer after the divorce and died in.
following richard death,the punslys continued to regularly see kathryn about every two months.generally,manwah drove kathryn to los angeles for these visits or the punslys met them at a newport beach restaurant.marilyn often spoke with kathryn by telephone.
for a period of time in,the punslys did not see kathryn.consequently,the punslys sought legal counsel to arrange a visitation schedule.manwah objected to the nature and frequency of the punslys proposed schedule and offered a more limited one.the punslys rejected this offer and petitioned the court under section to order manwah to comply with their visitation schedule.in the meantime,the court compelled limited visitation with the punslys and appointed independent counsel to represent kathryn.
in may,the court entered its order on the punslys petition,compelling visitation in san diego on the third sunday of alternate months.if kathryn became ill and missed a visit,the order required manwah to reschedule.it further ordered a telephone visit every tuesday at.the court required that any modifications to this visitation schedule appear in writing.additionally,the court entered ancillary orders.it compelled manwah to regularly inform the punslys about kathryn school schedule,teachers and counselors and to authorize the school to communicate directly with the punslys about kathryn.the order also mandated manwah to encourage kathryn to visit with the punslys and enjoined all parties from making disparaging remarks about another party within kathryn hearing.
discussion 
idiscretion to address the constitutionality of section 
preliminarily,we must address the punslys argument that we not exercise our discretion to hear manwah section constitutionality claim that she raises for the first time on appeal.california courts have,in their discretion,addressed constitutional issues for the first time on appeal,particularly when justice so requires.see people norwood d,citing silber united states,d hale morgan cal d,people vera cal th,d.
we disagree with the punslys assertion that circumstances of this case mitigate against exercising our discretion to hear this issue.first,the punslys argue manwah agreed to accept the recommendations of minor counsel for visitation that the court adopted in its order.it seems a stretch of logic to say manwah agreed,in a voluntary sense,to the court interference with her fundamental parental rights.rather,section and the court offered manwah little choice but to comply,by accepting either the recommendations of minor counsel,the punslys own proposed schedule,or further mediation.
second,the punslys contend manwah should have raised the constitutionality issue of section in the trial court,as troxel,supra.did not establish new law or challenge any controlling california case law.the supreme court decision to even hear troxel indicates the importance of the public policy issues at stake in interpreting statutes granting visitation rights to nonparental parties.until the court issued its decision on june,almost a month after the court entered its order in this case,it remained unclear as to how its ruling would affect,if at all,related statutes in other states.the effect of troxel is now evident,and as the courts of other states properly exercised their discretion to examine their own visitation statutes in the light of troxel,so shall we.
constitutionality of section 
the beginning premise of any determination regarding the constitutionality of a statute is an assumption of its validity.w e resolve all doubts in favor of its constitutionality,and we uphold it unless it is in clear and unquestionable conflict with the state or federal constitutions.citation.clare state bd.of accountancy th,d clare,quoting mounts uyeda d.a facial challenge to a statute constitutionality requires a demonstration the provisions of the statute,despite careful interpretation,fatally collide with the constitution.clare,supra,th at,d.
nevertheless,a court may apply a facially sufficient statute in an unconstitutional manner.the practical effect of holding a statute unconstitutional as applied is to prevent its future application in a similar context,but not to render it utterly inoperative.people rodriguez th,d.we read manwah appeal to challenge the constitutionality of section as applied,and therefore,we only address that challenge.
troxel granville 
in troxel,supra,the united states supreme court,in a plurality opinion,held a washington statute that authorized nonparental visitation with a child unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of the case before it.
the circumstances of troxel bear a resemblance to those before us.a father died,leaving behind two children under the care and custody of their mother.the mother wished to limit the frequency of her children visits with their paternal grandparents.the grandparents petitioned the court for increased visitation under section,subdivision of the revised code of washington.the court found more extensive visitation with the grandparents was in the best interests of the children and issued an order to enforce that visitation.troxel,supra,at.at.
the import of the troxel opinion is captured in a brief summary of its holding.the court prefaced its analysis of the washington statute with its recognition that all states have enacted grandparent visitation statutes in some form in an attempt to protect the vital role grandparents often play in children lives.however,it noted the state recognition of an independent interest in a child can place a substantial burden on the traditional relationship.troxel,supra,at.at.
with these competing interests in mind,the court directed its attention to the sweeping breadth of the washington statute,focusing on the effect of the statute language it stated,t hus,in practical effect a court can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition,based solely on the judge determination of the child best interests.emphasis in original.troxel,supra,at.at.
the court then addressed the facts of the case and made three important determinations.first,the court noted the grandparents did not allege,nor did the trial court find,that the mother was an unfit parent.this fact ran contrary to the presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.troxel,supra,at.at,citing parham,d.
second,the trial court in the case gave no special weight to the mother determination of her children best interests.rather,the findings of the trial court indicated it effectively placed the burden on the mother to disprove a presumption that visitation with the grandparents was in her children best interests.troxel,supra,at.at.
third,the court emphasized the trial court failure to give any weight to the fact the mother voluntarily agreed to allow visitation with her children grandparents.the dispute at hand arose because the grandparents wanted more than the mother willingly offered.troxel,supra,at.at.
based on these factors,the court determined the washington statute,as applied,was unconstitutional.the court concluded
