at issue in this case is whether wickham byrne,which declared illinois grandparent visitation statute to be unconstitutional,invalidated a preexisting agreement approved by the circuit court of peoria county granting visitation rights to a child grandparents.the circuit court held that it did not.on a permissive interlocutory appeal brought under supreme court rule,the appellate court reached the same conclusion and affirmed.d.one justice dissented.we granted leave to appeal from the appellate court judgment.for the reasons that follow,we now affirm.
the facts are not in dispute.roxanna duncan died on september,while giving birth to her daughter,survived.roxanna parents,christopher and sue duncan the duncans subsequently petitioned the circuit court of peoria county to be appointed guardians.while the guardianship proceedings were pending,the circuit court entered an interim order pursuant to section of the probate act of ilcs west,granting the duncans temporary guardianship of and giving them temporary custody of her.
several months after birth,christopher johnson brought an action in the circuit court of peoria county under the illinois parentage act of ilcs et west to establish that he was her father.in april of,when was approximately years old,the circuit court entered an agreed order declaring that johnson was father.with consent of the parties,johnson parentage action was then consolidated with the duncans guardianship proceedings,which remained pending.johnson requested and received the right to visit.at the same time,he was ordered to pay of his income to the duncans for child support.
is not johnson only child.according to the record,johnson is also the father of,born three months after,born march,born july,born march,and nakeitha tyler,born may.was likewise not roxanna only child.roxanna also had a son,by a man named gaylord ford.following roxanna death,the court granted temporary guardianship of to ford.
and all resided with johnson and his wife,roshawn.the family financial circumstances were strained.according to a financial affidavit filed by johnson in this matter,his monthly income was less than.his monthly expenses,including health insurance,housing,food,and other costs,and payments stemming from bankruptcy exceeded.
faced with this imbalance,johnson failed to make the child support payments to the duncans ordered by the circuit court.on christopher duncan motion,the court ordered johnson to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.johnson attorneys then sought and obtained leave to withdraw from the case.the reason for their withdrawal was that johnson had not paid them.
johnson retained replacement counsel.in april of,johnson new lawyer filed a petition on his behalf asking that he be awarded custody of and that the duncans guardianship of her be terminated.johnson motion was opposed by the duncans,who argued that permanent custody of should be awarded to them.
the litigation continued for over a year.finally,on july,johnson and the duncans reached an agreement under which the duncans temporary guardianship of was to terminate and johnson was to obtain permanent custody of the child.the agreement further provided that the duncans were to receive specific and detailed visitation rights,telephone access to the child,information about the child education and medical care,and authorization to speak with the child teachers,school personnel,counselors and physicians regarding her progress and circumstances.this agreement was executed by the parties,their attorneys and the child guardian ad litem,and incorporated into an order filed by the court.
in october of,the circuit court found that johnson owed christopher duncan in arrearages and ordered him to pay that sum in installments of per month.less than two months after that,christopher duncan petitioned for a rule to show cause why johnson should not be held in contempt for violating the terms of the july,visitation agreement incorporated into the order filed by the circuit court.
an order to show cause was entered by the circuit court on december.on april,this court filed its opinion in wickham byrne.wickham involved two consolidated cases in which a child had lost a parent and the deceased parent parents the child grandparents were granted visitation by the court,over the objection of the surviving parent,pursuant to the grandparent visitation statute set forth in section b of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act ilcs b west.
section b stated,in pertinent part 
b the court may grant reasonable visitation privileges to a grandparent,or sibling of any minor child upon petition to the court by the grandparents or or on behalf of the sibling,with notice to the parties required to be notified under section of this act,if the court determines that it is in the best interests and welfare of the child,and may issue any necessary orders to enforce such visitation privileges.except as provided in paragraph of this subsection b,a petition for visitation privileges may be filed under this paragraph if one or more of the following circumstances exist 
a the parents are not currently cohabiting on a permanent or an indefinite basis 
b one of the parents has been absent from the marital abode for more than one month without the spouse knowing his or her whereabouts 
c one of the parents is deceased 
d one of the parents joins in the petition with the grandparents,or sibling or 
e a sibling is in state custody.
when one parent is deceased,the surviving parent shall not interfere with the visitation rights of the grandparents.ilcs b west.
the surviving parents in the two consolidated cases in wickham challenged the constitutionality of the foregoing provisions,arguing that they impermissibly infringed on a parent fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody and control of his or her children.after considering relevant authority from the united states supreme court and from this court,we found the surviving parents arguments to be meritorious.we wrote 
section b exposes the decision of a fit parent to the unfettered value judgment of a judge and the intrusive micromanaging of the state.because we can conceive of no set of circumstances under which section b of the act would be valid,we hold that it is unconstitutional on its face.for the same reasons,we hold that section b is facially unconstitutional.wickham,at.
four months after we decided wickham,johnson petitioned the circuit court to modify the grandparent visitation agreement reached by the parties on july,and incorporated into the court order.johnson predicated his petition on section c of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act ilcs c west,which authorizes a court to modify an order granting or denying visitation rights of a parent whenever modification would serve the best interest of the child.
as grounds for seeking modification of the visitation agreement,johnson claimed that after the agreement was reached,the duncans continually and repeatedly interfere d with his ability to establish and maintain a parent child relationship.fourteen specific examples were alleged.among these were an insistence by the duncans that refer to them as mom and dad calling the principal of school in an attempt to obtain her school records coming to johnson house when missed school to inquire as to the reason for her absences constantly questioning regarding the johnson household procedures and repeatedly and continually questioning johnson and regarding clothing.johnson motion asked that the duncans be restrained from referring to themselves as parents that they be prohibited from calling and harassing johnson,his family and schools that they not be allowed to take without his express permission and that their visitation be curtailed to one weekend per month.
in addition to seeking modification of the visitation agreement,johnson petition argued,in the alternative,that the visitation agreement should be terminated.johnson based that argument on this court decision in wickham.although the visitation agreement between johnson and the duncans did not invoke the provisions of the grandpa
