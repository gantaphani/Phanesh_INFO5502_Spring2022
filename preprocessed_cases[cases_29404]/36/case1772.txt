in this habeas corpus proceeding,we hold that both the court of appeals and the trial court had authority to enforce a final judgment awarding spousal maintenance while that judgment was pending on appeal and was not superseded.accordingly,the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the commitment order.however,in the appeal of the underlying divorce decree,the court of appeals has since reversed the award of spousal maintenance which precludes further enforcement of the civil contempt provisions in the commitment order.the criminal provisions of the commitment order allow the party held in contempt to obtain probation by paying the spousal maintenance ordered by the trial,and therefore,the criminal sentence is affected by the reversal of the spousal maintenance award.accordingly,we vacate the commitment order,and we grant habeas corpus relief.the trial court,however,retains discretion to impose criminal contempt for violation of its unsuperseded order pending appeal.
a final judgment granting a divorce between adel and amal sheshtawy directed adel to pay amal per month for months as spousal maintenance pursuant to section of the texas family code the trial court found that adel sheshtawy had been convicted of a criminal offense that also constituted an act of family violence.the criminal conviction was upheld on appeal 
adel sheshtawy did not make the first three monthly payments,and amal sheshtawy instituted proceedings to enforce the judgment in the trial court while that court still had plenary power the motion to enforce had not been ruled upon by the trial court when adel sheshtawy filed a notice of appeal.adel sheshtawy did not supersede the final judgment.amal sheshtawy moved for temporary orders pending appeal,seeking legal fees for defending the appeal.she did not seek temporary spousal support pending appeal,as she could have done pursuant to section of the family code the trial court judgment already provided for spousal maintenance and that judgment had not been superseded.
on appeal,adel sheshtawy challenged several aspects of the divorce decree,including the award of spousal maintenance.while the appeal was proceeding,the motion for contempt remained pending in the trial court,and the trial court set a hearing.adel sheshtawy sought writs of prohibition and mandamus to compel the trial court to stay enforcement of the divorce decree pending appeal,asserting that only a court of appeals has jurisdiction to enforce a divorce decree once an appeal has been perfected.the court of appeals denied relief,holding that the trial court retained jurisdiction to enforce the spousal maintenance order while the appeal was pending the trial court proceeded to hear amal sheshtawy motion for enforcement.adel sheshtawy had made no spousal maintenance payments,and the trial court found him in contempt for failing to make nine monthly payments,totaling.the trial court ordered liquidation of a cash bond that adel sheshtawy had posted when a capias had previously been issued and credited the bond against the arrearage.
the trial court ordered that adel sheshtawy be punished for two counts of criminal contempt and ordered him confined for days for each count,with those sentences to be served concurrently.the trial court also ordered confinement for civil contempt,ordering that sheshtawy be incarcerated upon completion of the criminal contempt sentence from day to day until he paid the spousal maintenance arrearage.the commitment order further provided that the criminal and civil contempt confinements could be suspended and probated if adel sheshtawy paid all outstanding spousal maintenance and the attorney fees amal sheshtawy incurred prosecuting the enforcement action.
adel sheshtawy was taken into custody and had spent two months confined in jail when he sought a writ of habeas corpus from the court of appeals.that request for relief was denied adel sheshtawy then sought habeas corpus relief from this court,and we released him on bond pending consideration of the merits.
while the habeas corpus petition has been pending in this court,the court of appeals has decided the issues presented in adel sheshtawy appeal from the divorce decree among other holdings,the court of appeals reversed and rendered the award of spousal maintenance based on section of the family code,which provides that it is presumed that maintenance is not warranted unless the spouse seeking maintenance has exercised diligence in seeking suitable employment or developing the necessary skills to become during a period of separation and during the time the suit for dissolution of the marriage is pending.the court of appeals concluded that amal sheshtawy had not presented any evidence to rebut this presumption both adel and amal sheshtawy filed petitions for review in this court,challenging the court of appeals decision in the divorce case,and today,in a separate order,we have denied those petitions the court of appeals judgment in the divorce proceeding is now final.
for the reasons considered below,habeas corpus relief is granted.
as a general proposition,a writ of habeas corpus will issue if the commitment order is void because it was beyond the court power to issue it adel sheshtawy contends that the trial court contempt order is void because the court of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the divorce decree by contempt once he perfected his appeal.adel sheshtawy relies on this court decisions in ex parte and schultz fifth judicial district court of appeals at in support of his position.
in denying adel sheshtawy petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus,the court of appeals concluded that the trial court retained jurisdiction to enforce its spousal maintenance award pending appeal citing section of the family code sullivan sullivan and bivins bivins among other authorities.in sullivan and bivins,the courts of appeals concluded that trial courts retain the authority to enforce child support payments by contempt during an appeal,although no provision in the family code expressly addresses that question in denying sheshtawy petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus,the court of appeals concluded that boniface and schultz have been abrogated by amendments to the texas family code,at least in part,with respect to family law enforcement proceedings involving such matters as spousal and child support.
the family code provides in section that a court may enforce a spousal maintenance order by contempt but it is silent as to what court may do so while an appeal is pending unless the spousal support has been granted under section,which allows a trial court to grant temporary spousal support during an appeal section expressly provides that temporary support awarded for the duration of an appeal may be enforced by a trial court pending appeal the code does not contain a similar provision in section,which deals with spousal support generally and is entitled enforcement of maintenance order.
but nothing in the family code suggests that a final judgment awarding spousal maintenance,other than temporary support pending appeal,should be accorded any different effect than any other final judgment that has not been superseded pending appeal.this court recently held in in re air park,that when a final judgment is not superseded,not only does a trial court have jurisdiction to hear the motion to enforce its final judgment,despite the fact that the judgment ha s been appealed,but a trial court has an affirmative duty to enforce its judgment.in that case a trial court had signed a final judgment ordering a zoning committee to hold an election.a motion to enforce that judgment was filed,but before the trial court heard the motion,the final judgment was appealed.the trial court dismissed the enforcement proceeding,concluding it had no jurisdiction to proceed pending appeal,even though the judgment had not been superseded we granted mandamus relief,concluding that a party is entitled to mandamus relief to vacate an order that wrongly denies a prevailing party attempt to enforce an unsuperseded judgment.
more than forty years ago,in ex parte preston,this court similarly held that a trial court could proceed to enforce its unsuperseded contempt order that was part of a final judgment while that judgment was on appeal preston was a divorce case in which the trial court found the husband in contempt and in the final judgment,ordered him confined for three days and thereafter until he paid to the clerk of the court for the use and benefit of his wife.in denying habeas corpus relief,this court held t he fact that the case is on appeal without any showing of a supersedeas bond would,if anything,make it more imperative that the rights of preston be protected in this manner.the court did say,however,that preston would hardly be entitled to possession of the money until the appeal was decided 
the conclusion in and preston that a trial court retains authority during an appeal to enforce a final judgment that has not been superseded is consistent with earlier decisions of this court in ex parte and ex parte lohmuller both of which held that a trial court could award temporary alimony pending final disposition and could enforce that award by contempt notwithstanding a pending appeal of the final divorce decree.similarly,this court held in ex parte scott that a trial court could enforce an order awarding temporary alimony by contempt during the pendency of an interlocutory appeal in scott and lohmuller this court relied on statutes that empowered the trial court to award a wife income during the pendency of a divorce suit former articles and respectively.notably,neither statute expressly mentioned appeals,the trial court jurisdiction pending appeal,nor the power of a trial court to hold a noncompliant husband in contempt but this court concluded that because the statutes allowed the trial court to award support to a spouse during the pendency of the suit,the nature of the power to award interim support included the power to issue and enforce contempt orders another decision of this court went so far as to say that when a trial court awarded temporary alimony pending an appeal under former article,that award not only could be enforced by contempt,it was not superseded by a supersedeas bond 
but our decisions have not been uniform regarding a trial court authority to enforce a judgment or order while an appeal is pending.most notably,in this court held in ex parte boniface that while a final judgment directing a husband to make monthly retirement benefit payments to the wife was on appeal,the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enforce that award,even though the judgment had not been superseded boniface held that only the court of appeals had jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and to punish by contempt 
boniface recited that it was following decisions regarding temporary injunctions,concluding t here is no rational basis for applying a different rule to appeals from temporary injunctions and appeals from final judgments,as here.boniface cited ex parte travis ex parte werblud ex parte duncan and ex parte kimbrough but none of these decisions stands for the propositions set forth in boniface.
in travis the trial court had entered a temporary injunction regarding the transportation and handling of crude oil while that injunction was on interlocutory appeal,the trial court held the parties in contempt for violating the temporary injunction.this court expressly declined to grant habeas corpus relief.the court reasoned that a habeas corpus proceeding is a collateral remedy,and its function is not to supersede a prompt and adequate and more direct remedy by appeal.travis did not hold that a trial court lacks authority to enforce an order or judgment pending appeal by contempt.it held only that an appellate court is fully armed with authority in a direct appeal to protect its own jurisdiction and the subject matter of the appeal.this is a familiar principle 
however,some of the discourse in travis seems to have been misconstrued in later decisions,including boniface.travis noted that as a general proposition,the perfection of an appeal terminates the authority of the lower court pending the appeal it also said that when a temporary injunction is on appeal,the appellate court has the exclusive power to determine the validity or invalidity of the temporary injunction and to compel obedience pending appeal 
after the jurisdiction of the appellate court attached,it alone was clothed with the power to adjudicate the validity or invalidity of the temporary injunction and to exercise the discretion involved in compelling obedience to the injunction pending the appeal,as well as to enforce its own final judgment,unless or until such judgment was subjected to review by a higher court.the district court could exercise no such authority while power to consider and determine these very matters lay exclusively in a higher court 
this paragraph appeared in a lengthy discussion of an appellate court authority to protect and enforce its own jurisdiction,which included a reference to former article that statute,similar to current government code section a provided said courts and the judges thereof may issue writs of mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of said courts.the discussion in travis of an appellate court authority to protect its own jurisdiction was immediately followed by a lengthy discussion of habeas corpus.among the principles considered was that if a trial court had no jurisdiction to enter a temporary injunction that was to remain in force pending an appeal,a court of appeals could order that no further proceedings occur in the trial court if those proceedings conflicted with the appellate court jurisdiction accordingly,travis held only that a court of appeals has adequate authority in the direct appeal of a temporary injunction to protect its jurisdiction.it did not hold that the trial court order of contempt was void for want of jurisdiction because an appeal was pending.to the contrary,as already indicated,this court expressly declined to grant habeas corpus relief in travis.
we note that our current rules of appellate procedure provide that during an interlocutory appeal,only the appellate court in which the appeal is pending may enforce the order.but the appellate court may refer any enforcement proceeding to the trial court to hear evidence and make recommendations there are no similar restrictions on a trial court authority pending appeal of a final judgment.instead,we have detailed rules for superseding a final judgment 
in duncan also cited in boniface the motion for contempt was filed,heard,and granted in the court of civil appeals.in the subsequent habeas corpus proceeding in this court,we held only that the court of appeals had jurisdiction to issue all writs necessary to enforce its jurisdiction,including contempt orders duncan did not hold that the trial court was ousted of jurisdiction to enforce an unsuperseded final judgment.
quoted the passage from travis that said,after the jurisdiction of the appellate court attached,it alone was clothed with the power to adjudicate the validity or invalidity of the temporary injunction and to exercise the discretion involved in compelling obedience to the injunction pending appeal.as discussed above,the context of this passage in travis does not support the proposition that a trial court has no authority to hold a party in contempt while a final judgment that has not been superseded is pending on appeal,and werblud did not hold that a trial court authority is so restricted.as in duncan,the contempt proceedings in werblud were filed and conducted in the court of civil appeals,and this court held that the appellate court had contempt powers the werblud opinion also said that when there is a factual dispute regarding an alleged contempt of court,a court of appeals may conduct its own hearing but that the preferable course was to refer the evidentiary hearing to the trial court it did not hold that only an appellate court may issue a contempt order when a judgment is not superseded pending appeal.
kimbrough cited in boniface did say that even if the judgment had not been superseded,the contempt,if any,committed after the appeal had been perfected wou
