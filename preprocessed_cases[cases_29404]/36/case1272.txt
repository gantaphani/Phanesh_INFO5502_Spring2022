a parent fundamental right to adequate notice and the opportunity to be heard in dependency matters involving potential deprivation of the parental interest citation has little,if any,value unless the parent is advised of the nature of the hearing giving rise to that opportunity,including what will be decided therein.only with adequate advisement can one choose to appear or not,to prepare or not,and to defend or not.in re stacy th,d.
in accordance with the general practice followed by many dependency bench officers in the los angeles superior court,at the conclusion of the detention hearing held for wilford,three children,the juvenile court scheduled a pretrial resolution conference prc a settlement and status ordered the los angeles department of children and family services department to prepare a social study.wilford,who did not appear at the detention hearing,was sent a generic notice of hearing on petition,advising him that a petition had been filed on behalf of his three sons and that a hearing would be held on april,at although the notice also informed wilford that he had the right to be present at the hearing,to present evidence and to be represented by an attorney,as well as that the court may proceed with this hearing whether or not he was present,it did not advise him that the scheduled hearing was a prc and omitted entirely any description of the nature of the proceedings that would take place on the date scheduled.
when wilford,who was not represented at that time by either retained or appointed counsel,did not appear at the prc,the juvenile court proceeded immediately to conduct a jurisdictional hearing,finding the allegations in the dependency petition true based on the information contained in the social study and attachments filed by the department on the morning of the prc.on appeal from the disposition order entered at a subsequent hearing,wilford contends the juvenile court violated his fundamental right to adequate notice in dependency proceedings by conducting a jurisdictional hearing that had not been scheduled or properly noticed.we agree converting a noticed prc into an unscheduled jurisdictional hearing,absent appropriate waivers from the parties or their counsel,deprives parents of vitally important procedural protections that are essential to ensure the fairness of dependency proceedings.nonetheless,because in this case wilford participated with counsel in a number of hearings after the improperly noticed jurisdictional hearing without raising the issue,we affirm the juvenile court orders.
factual and procedural background 
the petition 
on march,the department filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section to declare wilford three children,wilford,years old,rashad years old and christopher years old dependent children of the court and requested the juvenile court issue protective custody warrants for the children,who were described as being at large with father.the petition alleged the children had failed to attend school regularly and,when they did attend,were often filthy,smelling of urine and feces.the petition further alleged the children had been exposed to violent physical confrontations between their father and their mother,who no longer lived with them,and that wilford had rebuffed the department previous attempts to assist the family.
the detention hearing 
although wilford was sent notice of the detention hearing via telegram,neither he nor his children appeared in court.at the hearing,after finding wilford to be the children presumed father,the court held that a prima facie case for detention had been established pursuant to section and issued protective custody warrants for the children.the court set a prc for april,directed the department to prepare a social study and issued a minute order reflecting its rulings.the children were found two days later at wilford home and taken into protective custody.
notice of the prc 
on april,the department sent wilford,via certified mail to his last known address,a notice of hearing on petition.the notice,a standard preprinted department form,advised wilford that a a petition had been filed on behalf of his children b a hearing was to take place on april,c he had the right to be present at the hearing,to be represented by counsel or have counsel appointed and to present evidence and d the court could proceed in his absence the notice did not identify either the formal name of the hearing that would occur on april,a pretrial resolution conference or contain an explanation of the nature of the proceeding scheduled for that date a settlement conference.on the certified mail receipt kept by the department,a handwritten notation reads prc.the report prepared by the department for the april,hearing,although entitled a report,also identified the hearing type as a conference.
adjudication of the petition immediately following the prc 
on april,the children appeared in court,and counsel was appointed to represent them.the children mother and her counsel,appointed for her when she attended the detention hearing,were also present.wilford did not appear and was not represented.
the court noted at the outset of the hearing that t he matter is here for what we call a pretrial resolution conference on a petition which was filed march of.after the children mother stated she did not dispute any of the allegations contained in the petition,the court found wilford had been given notice as required by law and proceeded to adjudicate the petition the court sustained each of the allegations in the petition based on the department april,report and its attachments and set a disposition hearing for may.
the disposition hearing 
wilford appeared at the original disposition hearing on may,and counsel was appointed for him at that time.following several continuances and a contested hearing,the court declared all three children dependents of the court and ordered a their placement with their maternal grandmother b monitored visitation for wilford and unmonitored visitation for the children mother c domestic violence counseling for both parents and d family reunification services.neither wilford nor his counsel raised the issue of improper notice for the jurisdictional hearing at any of these disposition hearings.rather,his objections were directed solely to the department recommendation that the children be placed with their maternal grandmother and to the court counseling orders.
discussion 
jurisdictional hearings must be scheduled and properly noticed 
after a petition is filed seeking to have a child declared a dependent of the court,the juvenile court must set a jurisdictional hearing within a specified period.jurisdictional hearing must be set within days of filing of petition if children are not detained if detained,within court days of the date of the judicial order directing the children be detained cal.rules of court,rule f.once the jurisdictional hearing has been set,notice must be given to the appropriate parties,subd.a and must include,among other things,the date,time and place of the proceeding and a statement of the nature of the hearing,subd.d.
