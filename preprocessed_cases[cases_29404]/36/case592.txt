background 
prior proceedings 
father married mother in.minor was born in.in,mother filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage.father default was entered,and an interlocutory judgment of dissolution was entered later that year the family court granted custody of minor to mother and ordered father to pay per month in child support.a final judgment of dissolution was entered in.
in,the alameda county district attorney filed a declaration alleging that father owed in unpaid child support.father appeared,in person and with counsel,at a june,hearing at which,by stipulation,the family court ordered him to make payments of per month through withholdings from his wages.after an evidentiary hearing in july,at which father was again present and represented by counsel,the family court adjudged him in child support arrears from november through june and ordered him to pay per month in arrears,to be withheld from his wages.
in,father sought to have the child support payments made to grandparents during the time they cared for minor.by stipulation,the parties agreed that support would be reduced to a month while minor was living with grandparents,payable to them,and in october,the court so ordered.the order also provided that if minor returned to mother,ongoing child support would once again be a month,and that upon that increase in child support payments,the arrearages payments would be reduced to a month.it appears that this order was never modified and minor lived with grandparents for the rest of her childhood.
in,upon father motion,the parties entered into a stipulation that father should receive credit against the arrearages for the child support payments he made to grandparents from october onward.it appears that the reason for the motion was that grandparents had been forwarding to mother the child support payments father had been making to them.
current proceedings 
on september,father filed a request for an order,seeking,as relevant here,stay of enforcement of the child support arrears on the ground he had overpaid mother equitable of the child support arrearages on the ground minor had lived with grandparents since she was two years old credit for child support charged during the time minor lived with grandparents and of interest on arrearages.the family court ordered the alameda county department of child support services the department to prepare an account history reflecting the prior credits that were ordered and set a long cause hearing 
at the hearing on the matter,father testified that between the time the child support order took effect in october and the date minor turned,minor lived with mother for two periods and lived with grandparents the rest of the time.father testified he moved to carson city,nevada,in and lived with grandparents and minor for about two years.between and,father made payments to grandparents,here,there.mother did not provide any money to grandparents.father also testified that when he was paying child support to grandparents,they would give the money to mother because they were afraid mother would remove minor from their care if they did not do so.
father testified that he did not recall being served with the divorce papers.
deborah wilson wilson,who was married to father after his divorce from mother and remained married to him until sometime in the,testified that with the exception of one period and one period,minor lived with grandparents between and.the periods minor lived with mother were from september to june,and from september and january during the time minor lived with grandparents,mother did not provide any financial support for minor.father contributed about a month from to,and about a month between january and september.until,grandparents gave mother all of their child support checks because they were afraid mother would remove minor from their care.
wilson testified that she and father began living together in carson city in,and that they lived with grandparents for about a month before they got their own apartment in the same complex.minor remained with grandparents rather than living with father and wilson because grandparents were afraid mother would take minor if she lived with wilson and her children.father and wilson moved away from carson city in or.
the trial court denied father request for equitable or stay of enforcement of the child support arrearages for the period minor lived with grandparents,based upon its conclusion that father did not support minor in his home and there was insufficient evidence of the extent to which he supported her in grandparents home.the court also denied the request for credit for the times that minor lived with grandparents.the court ordered that,pursuant to section,interest would accrue against the child support arrears from the time each original support payment was due,rather than from the time father failed to make the payments required under the and orders that he repay arrearages.
the court entered its findings and order after hearing on august.on september,father filed a motion for reconsideration based on the assertedly new or different facts that father had additional evidence to support his contention that minor lived with grandparents during most of her childhood and father was never served with the petition for dissolution and request for child support.code civ,subd.a.the family court denied the motion,concluding both that it was untimely and that there was no new information or other basis for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
father contends he was never properly served with the petition for dissolution and request for child support and did not become aware of the child support order until,and therefore all orders in this case were void ab initio.
the first time father contended he was not served with the petition and request for child support was in september,when he filed his motion for reconsideration.the first time he argued that this lack of service rendered all subsequent orders void was in his opening brief on appeal.while we have discretion to consider questions of law on undisputed facts for the first time on appeal ocm principal opportunities fund,cibc world markets th,fn,this is not such a case.
this record does not provide undisputed evidence that father was not served with the original papers.as we have noted,the record contains a proof of personal service on july,of the petition and related papers at an address in oakland.father contends that the record shows he had moved to carson city to live with grandparents and minor by june,and it was therefore physically impossible for him to have been personally served in oakland in july.the evidence he relies on is his own testimony that he m oved to carson city in and lived there for about two years,and that he did not recall being served with the papers.he also relies on somewhat inconclusive statements in declarations submitted in connection with his motion for reconsideration.grandparents each declared,in june of father resided with minor at my residence in carson city,nevada.no notice of dissolution of marriage of child support papers were ever received or served to that address.father declared,when i moved to carson city,nevada,with wilson and two children,it was known and seen from june through that minor was in the care and custody of my parents.wilson made a similarly worded declaration.this evidence does not show unambiguously that the proof of service was false or that father did not receive or could not have received personal service of process in oakland in july.
in any case,even if father was not properly served with the petition and initial support order,his subsequent participation in this case amounted to consent to the court jurisdiction.as recently explained in in re marriage of obrecht th,a general appearance occurs when the defendant takes part in the action or in some manner recognizes the authority of the court to proceed.citation.such participation operates as consent to the court exercise of jurisdiction in the proceeding.unlike jurisdiction of the subject matter jurisdiction of the person may be conferred by consent of the person,manifested in various ways including a general appearance.citations.by generally appearing,a defendant relinquishes all objections based on lack of personal jurisdiction or defective process or service of process.citations.a general appearance has these effects even if the defendant is unaware that a jurisdictional objection is available.citation.such an appearance is equivalent to personal service within this state of the summons and a copy of the petition upon the defendant.citation.and see code civ,subd.a cal.rules of court,rule c see also county of san diego gorham th,a judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction of the person where there is no proper service of process on or appearance by a party to the proceedings italics added california overseas bank french american banking d,if the defendant asks for any relief which can only be granted upon the hypothesis that the court has jurisdiction of his person,his appearance is general.
as we have explained,father appeared in this matter,in person and through counsel,at a june hearing at which he was ordered to make child support payments and at a july hearing at which the court adjudged him in child support arrears.in,he sought to have his child support payments made to grandparents rather than mother and to have the amount of his child support and arrearages payments modified,and the court entered a stipulated order to that effect.in,he again entered into a stipulation,which the court approved,regarding credit against his arrearages.in each of these matters beginning almost years before he first raised his objection father recognized the authority of the court to proceed without protesting that he had not been properly served,and indeed,in and,father affirmatively sought the assistance of the court.father has consequently relinquished his objections based on defective service of process.
extrinsic fraud 
father contends the support order was void because mother obtained it by extrinsic fraud when she falsely claimed she had custody of minor.the term extrinsic fraud is given a broad meaning and tend s to encompass almost any set of extrinsic circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.in contrast,mistake is intrinsic and not a valid ground for setting aside a judgment if a party has been given notice of an action and has not been prevented from participating therein.citation.in this circumstance,the mistake goes to the merits of the prior proceeding which the moving party should have guarded against at the time.citation.in re marriage of thorne and raccina th.w here the aggrieved party had a reasonable opportunity to appear and litigate that party claim or defense,fraud occurring in the course of the proceeding is not a ground for equitable relief.the theory is that these matters will ordinarily be exposed during the trial by diligence of the party and his or her counsel,and that the occasional unfortunate results of undiscovered perjury or other intrinsic fraud must be endured in the interest of stability of final judgments.citation.singh lipworth th.here,the misrepresentation father alleges mother committed is at most intrinsic fraud,going to the merits of the action rather then to father ability to have a fair adversary hearing,and while it may have the unfortunate effect of creating a windfall for mother,who allegedly also did not support minor is not a ground upon which we can set aside the child support order.
in any case,as we have explained,father knew minor lived with his parents and he had multiple opportunities to draw the matter to the family court attention from at least onward and failed to do so.under section,subdivision a,a motion to set aside a support order on the ground of fraud must be brought within six months after the date on which the complaining party discovered or reasonably should have discovered the fraud.see in re marriage of zimmerman th,time limits of section apply even in cases of extrinsic fraud.it is too late now for father to attempt to set aside the support order on this ground.
equitable stay of enforcement 
father contends the family court misunderstood the scope of its discretion and erred in declining to use its equitable powers to stay enforcement of the child support arrears that accrued during the periods that minor lived with grandparents.
section provides that,with exceptions not relevant here,a support order may not be modified or terminated as to an amount that accrued before the date of the filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or terminate.however,as father points out,it is within the court equitable power to deny enforcement of the arrears on equitable grounds under certain circumstances.jackson jackson d,jackson.
in the cases the parties cite,in which the jackson rule has been applied to deny enforcement of child support arrears,the parent who was obligated to pay child support had actually cared for the child in his or her own home.in jackson,the father had been ordered to pay child support to the mother.after the child began living with the father,with the mother consent,the father ceased paying child support.jackson,supra,d at.the mother later obtained a writ of execution on child support arrears for the time the child was living with the father,and the father sought an order quashing the writ of execution.ibid.the trial court concluded the father request was an attempt to modify a prior child support order and denied it.id.at.the appellate court vacated the order and remanded the matter to the trial court for reconsideration it noted that the father had provided a home for the child and in doing so had expended amounts well in excess of the a month.the court concluded that in the circumstances,the trial court would have been well within its discretion in quashing the writ of execution or permitting only partial enforcement on the basis that the father had directly discharged his obligation or on the basis of equitable considerations.id.at,italics added.in in re marriage of trainotti d,on similar facts,the appellate court concluded the trial court should have considered whether the debtor father had satisfied or otherwise discharged the obligation imposed by the original order.citations.such consideration does not violate the prohibition against retroactive modification of the support award.citation.italics added.the court went on,we think it clear that the trial court erred by refusing to consider whether appellant had satisfied his obligation by furnishing the child,with the approval of his former wife,a home and support that was equal to or in excess of the amount.id.at and see in re marriage of okum d,trial court had discretion to permit only partial enforcement of child support arrears against parent who had sole physical custody during per
