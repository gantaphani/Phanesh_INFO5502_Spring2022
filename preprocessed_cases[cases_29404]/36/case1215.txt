introduction 
appellant irwin pearlstein irwin appeals from the family law court decision to include,as part of his gross income for child support purposes,both cash and the value of stock he received for selling his business.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court erred by including the value of marketable,but unliquidated,stock in the calculation of irwin income.in doing so,we reject respondents contention that the stock irwin received for the equity in his business is analogous to a stock option commonly used as a form of executive compensation,which generally is considered gross income for support purposes.in re marriage of cheriton th,d cheriton.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude the family law judge also erred in making other calculations pertaining to a determination of irwin income in directing irwin to pay a portion of guideline support for into a chandler trust for his minor daughter benefit and in imposing in sanctions against irwin.accordingly,we reverse.
facts and procedural background 
appellant irwin pearlstein and respondent julie pearlstein were married in october.their only child,alexandra,was born on july.irwin and julie separated in november,when alexandra was still an infant.no formal visitation order was entered until much later instead,for many years the parties handled alexandra custody schedule by informal agreement between themselves.
three years after the parties separated,in november,irwin was ordered to pay child support in the amount of per month,including childcare costs to be paid directly to the childcare provider,with the balance going directly to julie.at the time,irwin was apparently experiencing financial difficulties he owed a considerable sum in back taxes,and had been the victim of embezzlement perpetrated by his accountant.by the time the november order was entered,irwin was admittedly in arrears on his child support.the court permitted him to defer paying it for a year in order to clear up his obligation for back taxes first.
within a couple of months after the entry of the november child support order,irwin business failed,and in january,he began working as a consultant for a new business,professional resource screening,prsi,which his adult children from a former marriage were in the process of establishing.irwin initially received no compensation from prsi,but later earned a salary of per month.during,irwin filed for bankruptcy,and moved to modify his child support,which was reduced to a total of per month effective as of june.
during the period between june and june,irwin continued to work for prsi.in,he remarried and moved into a home owned by his new wife.in late,irwin children made him a gift of percent of the stock of prsi.meanwhile,alexandra entered middle school,and irwin began picking her up regularly after school and taking responsibility for helping her with her homework.he also paid directly for at least some of the expenses of her health care and extracurricular activities,including religious school to prepare alexandra for her bat mitzvah.
during the period from to,it appears that irwin paid some of his child support,but not all,and by,a significant arrears had accumulated.in may or june,julie opened a child support collection case with the contra costa county department of child support services dcss.in august,dcss wrote to irwin to inquire about why his employer was not garnishing funds from his paycheck for child support.irwin responded by explaining that he was the majority shareholder of his employer,and his salary was so low that the maximum allowable wage garnishment would not cover his support obligation.he indicated that he could and would pay more from his own funds than could be obtained by garnishing his paycheck.by the end of,although irwin had started paying down his arrears,he still had a remaining unpaid balance of,including interest 
on december,prsi was sold to,and merged with,a company called search screening services,ussi.as the majority shareholder of prsi,irwin received compensation for the sale of his stock in the form of stock in ussi,as well as a significant sum of cash to be paid over time.under securities and exchange commission sec rules,the stock that irwin received in the transaction was subject to stringent restrictions on transfer he could not sell it at all for one year,until january,and thereafter could only sell it in quantities determined by the volume of stock traded on the open market.
as part of the merger transaction,irwin also entered into an employment contract with ussi under which he received a salary of per month per year the terms of the merger transaction also included a covenant under which irwin was prohibited from competing with ussi or its successor until after december,which was after irwin birthday.he also paid in legal fees in connection with the merger.
on january,irwin received a lump sum payment of as part of his consideration from the merger of prsi and ussi.one week later,on january,irwin met with julie at the dcss office and paid the entire amount of child support arrears that dcss indicated he owed as of that date the next day,dcss informed irwin that julie had requested that her child support collection case be closed.
starting in february,irwin paid directly to julie the per month in child support that he owed under the order then in effect.except for a deduction in february on account of alexandra uninsured dental or orthodontic expenses that month a type of offset to which julie had historically consented,he paid in full every month.in march,dcss filed a motion to modify the amount of support on the ground that irwin income had increased,but the motion was dropped from the calendar on april,after irwin counsel contacted dcss.
on april,julie asked dcss to reopen its case,contending that she had received only partial payment of the child support due for february,and none in april.dcss promptly notified irwin that it was reopening its case.on may,dcss filed a second motion to modify child support the modification motion,which ultimately led to the order at issue in the present appeal from the time dcss reopened its case until over a year later,in july,neither julie nor irwin reported to dcss that irwin was regularly making child support payments directly to julie,and had been doing so since february.as a result,by august,dcss records irwin was in arrears on his child support payments.accordingly,on august,dcss automated procedures generated a notice to a federal government agency reflecting the amount due.
irwin acknowledged at the hearing that,during,dcss regularly sent him statements regarding the child support amounts it believed he owed,and that he did not contact dcss to inform it that its records were in error.for example,on october,dcss notified irwin that,according to its records,as of october,he would owe a total of in accrued child support arrears and interest.in late october,irwin counsel wrote to dcss asking for the first time for an accounting of the child support arrears dcss contended irwin owed.around the same time,the modification motion,which had originally been noticed for hearing on july,and later continued to november,was continued again,and set for a long cause hearing on february.
on november,alexandra celebrated her bat mitzvah,at a cost to irwin of some.after the bat mitzvah,irwin continued to pay for alexandra to attend further religious training in teen school,as well as for her extracurricular activities in dance and cheerleading.
on november,as a consequence of dcss notice to the federal agency regarding irwin supposed child support arrears,dcss received from the internal revenue service the sum of,which had been intercepted from irwin income tax refund and sent to dcss,rather than applied to irwin estimated tax payment as he had requested.dcss forwarded the entire amount to julie,believing that irwin was in arrears in an amount in excess of the intercepted sum.julie took no action to inform dcss of its error in this regard,and retained the entire payment.irwin received notice of the tax intercept on november,and promptly forwarded it to his counsel.on december,and then again on january,dcss provided irwin and julie counsel with spreadsheets detailing its understanding of the status of irwin child support payments and the amount of his arrears.
on february,the parties stipulated to continue the hearing on the modification motion from february,to may.during this interval,on march,irwin filed an order to show cause the overpayment osc,seeking a refund of the child support overpayment resulting from the tax refund intercept,as well as sanctions against julie and dcss.on may,by separate minute orders,the court continued both the hearing on the modification motion and the hearing on the overpayment osc from may,to august.
by may,dcss records irwin had paid no child support since the beginning of,and was in arrears by some.on july,however,irwin trial counsel met with dcss and provided it with documentation of the child support payments that irwin had made directly to julie since february.this was the first time dcss had been made aware that irwin had been paying child support directly to julie on a regular basis during.once the documentation was provided,dcss revised its position regarding irwin arrears under the existing child support order.by that time,however,the modification motion had been pending for over a year,and dcss believed it was likely that irwin support obligation would be increased retroactively,generating a new arrears in an amount greater than the amount of the intercept.accordingly,dcss did not take any steps to refund the intercepted sum to irwin.
sometime in or around june of,ussi was acquired by and merged into a new company called first advantage corporation first advantage.irwin shares of ussi were converted into shares of first advantage,but his first advantage shares remained subject to the same sec restrictions on sale as his ussi shares.after the acquisition,irwin continued to work for first advantage at the same salary he had earned at ussi.
on august,the trial court began holding a consolidated hearing on both the modification motion and the overpayment osc.the hearing was not completed,and a further hearing date was set for october.one of the issues in sharp dispute between the parties was the percentage of custody time to be attributed to irwin for child support purposes.julie had estimated that her share was as high as percent,whereas irwin contended that each party had custody of alexandra percent of the time.in support of his position,irwin produced at the august,hearing a diary he had kept starting in march,detailing the time he spent with alexandra.he later testified that,during this period,he customarily picked his daughter up at school each weekday,helped her with her homework and gave her dinner,and delivered her to her mother house around,except one or two nights a week when she slept at his house,and that she visited with him as much as she wanted on weekends and holidays.
the day after the hearing on august,julie informed irwin that he could no longer see alexandra without her permission,and that he could no longer telephone julie,thus effectively cutting off irwin access to his daughter.due to alexandra protests,julie modified her position somewhat,but she persisted in her refusal to allow irwin any overnight visitation.
on october,the second session of the consolidated hearing on the modification motion and the overpayment osc was held.by the end of that day,the hearing had lasted a total of eight hours.julie counsel estimated that she needed about three more hours,and irwin counsel estimated one hour,so the court set an additional hearing for december.
on october,irwin filed an order to show cause regarding visitation the visitation osc,prompted by julie change of position regarding visitation in the wake of the first session of the hearing.during october,irwin and julie attended a custody mediation with the trial court family court services staff.they reached a tentative agreement,which julie later calculated would have put her custody timeshare at percent,but irwin declined to sign it without talking to his counsel and alexandra.according to irwin,alexandra was very unhappy with the mediated arrangement,and irwin therefore declined to sign the agreement.on october,the hearing on the visitation osc was continued to december,later,it was continued to december,to be heard concurrently with the third session of the hearing on the modification motion and the overpayment osc.
the third and fourth sessions of the hearing took place on december and.on december,the day before his birthday,irwin retired,and in january he began receiving severance pay of per month,to end in february.
on january,irwin and julie participated in a second session of custody mediation.as a result,they agreed that a custody evaluation would be conducted,and that pending its completion,irwin would have custody of alexandra in the late afternoon on weekdays,and later into the evening on wednesdays,plus alternate weekends.irwin later testified that he agreed to this schedule only because he was anxious to ensure that he would be in a position to help alexandra with her studies during her final exams,and that he did not anticipate that the schedule would continue on a basis.
on january,irwin sold shares of his first advantage stock for the sum of about.on january,he attempted to sell another shares,but was only able to sell at the per share price that was the minimum he was prepared to accept.meanwhile,on january,irwin received the first installment of the remaining cash that was due to him in connection with the sale of prsi,which was scheduled to be paid out at per month for months.
on january,the trial court held the fifth and final session of the hearing.after final briefing,the court took the matter under submission on february.the trial court initial statement of decision which the court later recharacterized as a tentative decision was filed on march.the decision solicited comments from the parties on certain issues,particularly the question whether guideline support for would exceed alexandra reasonable needs and if so,whether the parties would agree that the excess would be deposited into an account designated for alexandra college education.the court scheduled a further hearing on may,to deal with these unresolved issues.on may,irwin filed comments and objections regarding the tentative decision,in the form of a trial brief for the may,hearing.
at the hearing on may,the parties and the trial court discussed the court proposal to establish a trust for alexandra benefit,into which irwin could pay the amount of guideline child support for that exceeded alexandra needs.on june,the trial court filed an amended statement of decision.irwin filed further objections styled,in the alternative,as a motion for reconsideration,and a hearing on those objections was held august.
the trial court final order,filed august,increased irwin child support for the period from june,through december,to per month,based on a finding that irwin average gross monthly income during was.for the period from january,through december,the order found that irwin average gross monthly income was,and accordingly set his child support at per month.subject to comment by the parties,and to any credits irwin might establish by motion,the court tentatively found that irwin child support arrearage resulting from its order covering the period from june,through december,was irwin was ordered to pay per month towards these arrearages,starting september.
effective january,the court found that irwin average gross monthly income for would be per month,resulting in a guideline child support amount of per month.the court found,however,that this amount of child support would be unjust inappropriate due to the special circumstances of this case since the calendar year income of irwin represents a one time anomaly based on this finding,the court ordered irwin to pay temporary child support of per month for,and to pay the difference between the guideline support amount and the temporary support amount into a chandler trust in re marriage of chandler,supra,th,d to be established to pay for alexandra college education.due to the uncertainty caused by the fact that the chandler trust had not yet been established,and that the physical custody timeshare for might change after the completion of the custody evaluation,the court reserved jurisdiction to modify the amount of child support retroactively to january,and to make a final determination of any resulting arrearages.the court declined to make an order with regard to the amount of child support to be paid effective january,
regarding the tax intercept,the court awarded irwin judgment against julie in the amount of,plus interest,which it set off against the attorney fees it awarded to julie.it also sanctioned both julie and irwin,each in the amount of,setting those amounts off against each other.however,the court declined to award irwin further damages or to sanction dcss.
discussiona.overview of applicable law when reviewing child support orders 
in reviewing the trial court order,we are mindful of california strong public policy favoring adequate child support.see,county of kern castle th,d stewart gomez th,d.that policy is expressed in statutes embodying the statewide uniform child support guideline.see,the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.in setting guideline support,the courts are required to adhere to certain principles,including these a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a.each parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.children should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children,subd.f.cheriton,supra,th at,d.as an overarching concern,c hild support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support reflecting the state high standard of living and high costs of raising children compared to other states,subd.l.in re marriage of leonard th,d.
a trial court determination to grant or deny a request for modification of a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found from examining the record below.in re marriage of drake th,d.we observe,however,that the trial court has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation citation.furthermore,in reviewing child support orders we must also recognize that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule citation.in short,the trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the law regarding child support citation.cheriton,supra,th at,d.moreover,to the extent that the trial court decisions reflect an interpretation of the statutory definition of income for child support purposes,this is a question of law that we review de novo.see in re marriage of scheppers th,d in re marriage of dacumos th,d.
treatment of stock and cash from sale of business as income 
in the proceedings below,irwin urged the court to adopt the analysis of his gross monthly income that was presented by his executive compensation expert,martin wertleib.wertleib analysis included the cash from the sale of irwin interest in prsi.wertleib also assumed that the stock irwin had received from the sale of prsi once it became available for sale under sec rules,would produce a reasonable rate of return.he then added the assumed anticipated return on that investment to irwin salary or,after his retirement,his severance pay in order to determine his gross income.based on this analysis,wertleib opined that irwin average gross monthly income was in in and in.
the trial court rejected this analysis in its entirety.in computing irwin monthly gross income for the period from june onward,the trial court treated all of the proceeds that irwin received from the sale of prsi as income,including both the cash installments when received,and the market value of the stock as it became available for sale,regardless of whether it was actually sold.accordingly,the court found that irwin average gross monthly income was in in and in.
irwin primary contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in treating the proceeds from his sale of his equity interest in prsi as income rather than capital gain.we note initially that,while the definition of income in section is broad,it is not limitless.in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d.generally,the types of income specified in the statute consist of money that the support obligor actually receives,and do not include unrealized increases in the value of assets.in re marriage of henry th,d if the legislature had intended that the unrealized increase in the value of an asset should be considered income,it would have said so.this is consistent with t he traditional understanding of income as the gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,or property citation,or from any other investment of capital citation.in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d.put another way,s upport payments usually are paid from present earnings,not liquidation of preexisting assets.mejia reed cal th,d,in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d income is the key factor in our system,not capital or net worth.in re marriage of reynolds th,d only investment income,not investment principal,should be available to pay spousal support.
thus,for example,an increase in the equity value of a support obligor primary residence has been held not to constitute income for support purposes.in re marriage of henry,supra,th at,d see also in re marriage of kuppinger d.abuse of discretion to reduce spousal support based on value of supported spouse accumulated equity in principal residence.the principal amount of life insurance benefits received as a gift upon the death of the insured also is not income for child support purposes.in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d.similarly,the principal amount of a gift,inheritance,or lump sum personal injury award need not be treated as income for child support purposes,at least where,as here,the child is not receiving public assistance.county of kern castle,supra,th at,d where support obligor actual income was sufficient to cover minimum basic needs of child,trial court did not err in declining to consider entire lump sum inherited by support obligor as income in re marriage of schulze th,d inter vivos gift not income for support purposes in re marriage of heiner th,d affirming trial court order declining to include entirety,or allocated portion,of lump sum personal injury settlement in child support obligor income county of contra costa lemon d.where supported child was benefiting from public assistance,lottery winnings that were income for public assistance eligibility purposes should also have been considered income for child support purposes.
this is not to say that a child support obligor assets are entirely irrelevant to determining his or her income for support purposes.for example,where the supporting party has chosen to invest his or her funds in assets,the trial court has discretion to impute income to those assets based on an assumed reasonable rate of return in re marriage of de guigne th,d in re marriage of destein th,d in re marriage of dacumos,supra,th at,d.this is essentially the approach that irwin expert,wertleib,took in his analysis,and that irwin urged the court to adopt in determining his gross income.
in rejecting irwin position,the trial court explained its decision to treat the unrealized gain inherent in irwin stock as income by analogizing his shares to stock options,which have been held to constitute income for support purposes where they represent an element of a supporting party compensation package for past,present,or anticipated future services.see,cheriton,supra,th at,d in re marriage of kerr th,d.in our view,this reflects a fundament
