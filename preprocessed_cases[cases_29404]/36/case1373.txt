gerardo,appeals from an order terminating his parental rights welf,as to his five children the children he contends the court erroneously found at an earlier hearing that the indian child welfare act icwa et did not apply to the children dependency.on review,we agree and will reverse.
in in re th,d,this court required a department or agency which seeks foster care placement of or parental rights termination to a child who may be eligible for indian child status to make a documentary record of its compliance with icwa notice requirements or face the strong likelihood of appellate reversal.the department in this case made the requisite documentary showing.nevertheless,the appellate record also reveals the department possessed identifying indian heritage information that it did not share with one or more tribes of which the dependent child could be a member.because one of the purposes of icwa notice is to enable a tribe to investigate whether a child is eligible for tribal membership,that opportunity means little if a department does not provide the available indian heritage information it possesses.thus,we hold that a department compliance with the express icwa notice requirements will not suffice if the appellate record also reveals the department possessed identifying indian heritage information that it did not share with one or more tribes of which the dependent child could be a member.
procedural history 
in october,law enforcement officers discovered two clandestine methamphetamine meth labs on property upon which the children lived with their mother and father,the appellant.not only were the children exposed to the toxic chemicals used in making meth,but the children also had access to meth in their residence.these circumstances led the fresno county superior court to exercise jurisdiction over the children and,as of january,adjudge them dependent children of the court and remove them from parental custody.
appellant whereabouts were unknown to the court and respondent fresno county department of children and family welfare the department until after reunification efforts between the mother and the children failed.the record shows appellant was first properly noticed in august,when he was personally served in state prison with notice of the termination hearing.although the court had appointed counsel for appellant,appellant never personally appeared in these proceedings,no transportation order having apparently been issued.eventually in december,the court terminated parental rights to all of the children.
discussion 
facts relevant to icwa 
at the outset of these dependency proceedings,the children mother reported to the department that she and her children were waksachi,an indian tribe which was not federally recognized.she added that her mother the children maternal grandmother might know more information.the mother sister confirmed the children maternal grandmother was waksachi indian.she further stated that the children maternal grandfather was chukchansi,choinumni,and navajo indian.
in subsequent interviews with the mother,the department learned neither she nor any one of her children was registered with a tribe,federally recognized or not.nonetheless,the mother reported,she had an enrollment number with the federal bureau of indian affairs bia and received,along with the children maternal grandmother,ongoing bia food distribution services.the entire family also received health services through the central valley indian health association.further,the children maternal aunt once attended an indian school.
the department received additional information that the children mother also had wukchumni indian heritage on her mother side and tachi indian heritage on her father side.in addition,nephews of the maternal grandfather were allegedly enrolled tachi at the santa rosa rancheria.
consequently,the department had information that the children might be entitled to the benefits of icwa by virtue of waksachi and wukchumni indian heritage through their maternal grandmother and chukchansi,choinummi,tachi and navajo indian heritage through their maternal grandfather.
in november,before the jurisdictional hearing,the department served,by certified mail with return receipt requested,a notice of the children dependency proceedings also known as soc,a copy of the dependency petition,and a completed form request for confirmation of child status as indian form also known as soc upon several entities.they were the bia regional offices in sacramento,california and gallup,new mexico,the santa rosa rancheria in lemoore,california,the colorado river indian tribe in parker,arizona,and the santa rosa band of mission indians in anza,california relevant to this appeal,the completed form included all of the information summarized above regarding the mother indian heritage.in spaces provided for the birthplaces of all the maternal relatives named as well as for some birthdates the letters unk were inserted.
two months later and before the dispositional hearing,the department served,again by certified mail with return receipt requested,notice of the dispositional hearing date along with a completed notice form soc upon the picayune rancheria in coarsegold,california,and the navajo nation in window rock,arizona as well as each of the tribes and the bia regional offices previously served 
the department received only one response to its notices.the colorado river indian tribe informed the department it did not recognize the children as members of its tribe.in turn at the january dispositional hearing,the superior court specifically found that icwa did not apply to the children dependency proceedings.
appellant has two specific criticisms of the department efforts to provide proper icwa notice.as a consequence,appellant contends,the superior court erred in january by determining that icwa did not apply to his children.one,he questions the absence of certain information on the form the department completed and served in november on some of the tribes and bia.two,he contends the department improperly failed to serve its completed form,along with icwa notice,on the picayune rancheria and the navajo nation.having reviewed the record and applicable law,we agree with appellant second contention and will reverse.
on a procedural note,the department contends appellant has forfeited the issue of icwa compliance by failing to preserve the issue in the superior court in re richard th,d and not appealing the superior court january finding in a timely fashion in re pedro th,d.we find no forfeiture on this record.
the department did not perfect notice on appellant until august and there is no showing in the record that prior to the termination hearing,he or his counsel received discovery or other notice regarding the mother claims of indian heritage or the court january ruling.under these circumstances,this appeal represents the first opportunity for appellant to raise the issue of icwa compliance.to accept respondent argument would be to violate appellant due process rights.in re meranda th,d.therefore,we find his challenge to be timely and will review it on the merits.
icwa protects the interests of indian children and promotes the stability and security of indian tribes and families by establishing certain minimum federal standards,distinct from state court standards,in juvenile dependency actions involving an indian child.in re kahlen d.when a state court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved in a juvenile dependency proceeding,a duty to give notice under icwa arises.a in re kahlen,supra,d at.under icwa,an indian child means any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.the indian status of the child need not be certain in order to trigger notice.in re kahlen,supra,d at.the requisite notice enables the tribe bia,in part,to investigate and determine whether the minor is an indian child.in re junious d.
to ensure compliance with icwa notice requirements,this court held in in re th,d that a depart
