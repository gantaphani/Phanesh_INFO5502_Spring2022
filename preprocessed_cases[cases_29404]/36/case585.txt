introduction 
father and mother appeal from the juvenile court order terminating parental rights to daughter,grace,son,marco,and son,michael,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.father argues that the court erred in finding the beneficial relationship exception to termination did not apply and in denying him a contested hearing on that issue.mother did not request a hearing to assess her relationship with the children and does not have an independent basis for preventing termination of her parental rights.mother adopts father arguments on appeal,asserting that the court erred in denying father a contested hearing.
in a matter of first impression,we reverse because the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying father a contested selection and implementation hearing under section.when,as here,a parent has consistently and regularly visited his or her children and at the selection and implementation hearing,offers testimony regarding the quality of their relationship and possible resulting detriment that would be caused by its termination,a juvenile court abuses its discretion if it denies a contested hearing on the beneficial relationship exception.we reverse and remand for the juvenile court to conduct the contested hearing and determine,in the context of all of the evidence before it,whether a beneficial relationship exists and prevents the termination of parental rights pursuant to section c b i.
facts and procedural background 
in september,the court granted the department of children and family services dcfs request to detain grace and marco after concluding they were at high risk of abuse due to the parents ongoing domestic violence,father abuse of marijuana,their exposure to father drugs,and father activities father is a member of the mara salvatrucha gang.because mother continued to associate with father,the court detained michael in february,shortly after his birth.in april,the children in this case were adjudged dependents of the juvenile court as a result of father and mother domestic violence and father abuse of marijuana.
upon detention,dcfs assessed that the two older children had serious mental health,emotional,and developmental issues.the eldest,grace,was with her parents for the first two years and months of her life.all three children were placed in the same foster home and were enrolled in therapy and services to address their mental health,behavioral,and developmental needs.over the course of this nearly long dependency case,the children issues were largely corrected via participation in services and the nurturing environment created by the foster family.unfortunately,the children never reunited with their parents.
throughout the dependency case,father was in and out of jail as a result of his gang activities.although he completed a substance abuse program,he did not complete the domestic violence counseling or drug testing.his weekly visitation with all three children remained monitored throughout the case,but was consistent.early on,the visits were three hours per week.the foster parent,who monitored the visits,repeatedly reported that father was always on time,interacted well with the three children and that he was attuned to their needs.the foster parent reported to dcfs that father dedicated himself to all three children during the visits and the children were bonded with him.during visitation,he played with them,fed them,and changed michael diapers.father also maintained daily and,then later,weekly phone contact with the children and the children stated that they missed their parents.
at the section hearing,father counsel requested a contested section hearing to determine the applicability of the beneficial relationship exception to termination of parental rights counsel asserted that father has consistently and regularly visited all three children,those visits were positive,he actively engaged each child during visits,and he has been attuned to their individual needs.counsel stated that father 
would testify that during his regular visits with the kids,he talks to them about school.he has on occasion redirected them with regards to behavioral issues.he brings food for the children.he also does play with them.he tells them he loves them and they do articulate that they love him as well and that the children call him papa and that they do not call anyone else papa,so he does believe that the exception applies.the children do perceive him in a parental role,and he has demonstrated parental capacity during these visits.he also believes that grace would testify that she enjoys the visits,that she would like them to continue,and that she does see him as a father figure and would be sad if he were not her father.
mother counsel joined in father request for father to have a contested hearing.
after the court ascertained from counsel that father visits the children weekly and that the visits are monitored,the court indicated that the offer of proof was insufficient.the court stated,
accepting your offer of proof at full value,i would have to find that what father has described is a stronger bond and more important bond than they have with their caregivers,and i do believe based on the evidence that you have suggested,i would obviously make that finding.i specifically referring to the statement in that the father would need to prove that the child has developed such a substantial positive relationship with the father that the child would be greatly harmed or there would be substantial detriment to the child if parental rights were terminated,and that the court in expressly directs the court to consider the strength of the relationship with the children in determining what would be the most appropriate life for the children.
so,i believe,that your offer of proof is inadequate and i denying the request for a contest.
the court then admitted dcfs reports into evidence,and found by clear and convincing evidence that the children were adoptable and that there were no impediments to adoption.the court found that no exception to adoption applied and terminated the parental rights of father and mother to the children.
discussion 
father appeals the termination of his parental rights arguing that the court erred in denying him a contested selection and implementation hearing to present evidence on the applicability of an exception to termination of parental rights.mother also appeals,joining in father arguments but not asserting any other basis for our review.we review the court denial of a contested hearing for an abuse of discretion.in re th,ingrid superior court th.
a parent right to present evidence at the selection and implementation hearing 
the selection and implementation hearing under section takes place after the juvenile court finds that the parents are unfit and the child can not be returned to them.in re josue th.section governs termination of parental rights.subdivision b of this section states at the hearing,the court shall review the report required by statute,shall indicate that the court has read and considered it,shall receive other evidence that the parties may present,and then shall make findings and orders,subd.b,italics added.
if the parents have failed to reunify and the court has found the child likely to be adopted,the burden shifts to the parent to show exceptional circumstances exist such that termination would be detrimental to the child.in re autumn th,autumn.parents can request a contested hearing on this issue to present evidence supporting their claim that an exception to termination of parental rights exists.
here,the parents contend that the juvenile court violated their due process rights when it denied father request for a contested hearing on the application of the beneficial relationship exception to the termination of parental rights under section c b i.see,subd.c b i the juvenile court shall not terminate parental rights where it finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child because i the parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.
