this is a marital dissolution action brought by real party in interest david manela father against petitioner mira manela mother.one of the principle issues in the case is whether father should be granted joint custody over the couple son,jacob.in connection with that issue,father and mother became embroiled in a discovery dispute that is the subject of our opinion.
mother contends that father has a seizure disorder that affects his ability to care for jacob.father denies mother allegations and contends that he merely has a tic that is controlled by medication.mother subpoenaed the medical records of two of father physicians,hart cohen and andrea morrison,claiming that the records will support her allegations regarding father seizures.the trial court,however,granted father motion to quash the subpoenas on the ground that the documents were protected by the privilege.mother filed a petition for a writ of mandate requiring the trial court to vacate its order quashing the subpoenas.
we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by quashing the subpoena to cohen because father waived the privilege with respect to certain records of cohen.we also reject father claim that his medical records are protected by his constitutional right to privacy.as we will explain,that right is not absolute and,in this case,father privacy interests are outweighed by the state compelling interest in protecting jacob best interests.we further hold,however,that the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to quashing the subpoena to morrison because the documents mother sought from morrison were privileged.
background 
father alleged medical condition

father divorce petition and application for an osc re custody and visitation 
on june,father filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.in his petition,father requested that custody of jacob be awarded consistent with the best interest of the minor child.in her response to father petition,mother requested that the court award custody of jacob to her alone.
on august,father filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause osc regarding child custody and child visitation.in that application,father requested that he and mother be given joint physical custody.father application did not directly raise the issue of his alleged seizure disorder.father,however,did state that mother counsel advised him that if he sought custody of jacob,mother would disclose certain information regarding father and his parents that would damage father reputation in the orthodox jewish community and his professional reputation as a cardiologist.on august,in response to father application for an osc,mother filed a declaration regarding,inter alia,father alleged seizure disorder.
on the same day,august,the court issued a nonprejudicial order regarding father visitation rights.the court temporarily prohibited father from driving jacob until it obtained more information regarding father alleged seizure disorder.the court also scheduled a hearing on the osc and a briefing schedule for the parties.
on august,mother filed another declaration which discussed father alleged seizure disorder,as well as documents purportedly showing that father received prescriptions for tegretol,which mother claimed is prescribed for seizures.mother requested that father be allowed to visit jacob three days a week,but not be allowed overnight visits and not be allowed to drive a vehicle with jacob in it.
on august,father filed declarations in support of the osc,including the declaration of benjamin gross,a neurologist.gross stated in his declaration that he had treated father for the past nine years for hypnagogic movements,also known as a tic disorder.gross further stated that father condition has been controlled by tegretol and that there was no neurological reason to restrict father ability to drive an automobile or to prevent father from caring for jacob.
on august,the court issued an order granting father and mother joint legal custody over jacob.the court granted mother primary physical custody over jacob and father secondary physical custody,specifying the days and nights on which jacob would be with father.the court did not place any limitations on father right to drive jacob.
at the august,hearing,the court stated that the evidence was quite clear that father does not suffer from seizures as the term is generally recognized to me the court further stated that father tics only occurred when he ready to go to bed.presumably he not about to go to sleep before he put the child to bed.and even under anybody characterization,the most it the alleged seizure lasts is about two and a half minutes,generally quite less.i do see that it in any way impairs his father ability to be involved,to have the child overnight the court also found that there was no evidence that father alleged disorder impairs his ability to drive a car.
father motion to quash subpoenas 
on august,mother issued subpoenas to cohen and morrison.the subpoenas demanded that cohen and morrison produce a ll medical records pertaining to david manela.
on august,father filed a motion to quash the subpoenas and for a protective order and monetary sanctions.father argued that the subpoenas should be quashed because the documents mother sought were protected by the privilege.
in response to father motion,mother alleged that the medical records she sought would support her allegations regarding father alleged seizure disorder.mother claimed that morrison treated father for seizures when father was years old and for several years thereafter.mother also alleged that on august,cohen examined father regarding his neurological condition and that she was present during the exam.mother further alleged that at that exam,father stated to cohen in her presence a detailed account of father seizures.the trial court granted father motion to quash the subpoenas.
mother petition for writ of mandate

contentions 
mother claims that father waived the privilege by filing the declaration of gross and by speaking about his medical condition to cohen in the presence of mother.this waiver,mother argues,extends to father privilege relating to morrison.mother also contends that the exception to the privilege applies because father tendered the issue of his alleged seizure condition.
father contends that the privilege protects all of the documents mother seeks.alternatively,father argues that the documents are protected by his right to privacy under the united states and california constitutions.
