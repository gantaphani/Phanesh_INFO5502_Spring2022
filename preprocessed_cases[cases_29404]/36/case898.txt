background 
on december,morgan hill police officers noticed father outside a motel smoking what appeared to be marijuana.at the time,father was out on bail for a prior incident of resisting arrest.when the officers asked father to extinguish his joint,father rushed into a motel room and locked it.the officers saw the children,age and,inside the room,but father would not allow the officers inside.the officers broke down the door and found the room filled with marijuana smoke and the children hiding by the bed,crying.the children reported that father had flushed green stuff that smells really bad down the toilet while the officers were trying to enter the room.the officers found marijuana on a low shelf that also held the children toys,and on the floor of the bathroom.father attempted to fight two officers and was eventually arrested.the officers contacted an emergency social worker who took custody of the children.
the children were ordered detained on december.they were placed with their paternal grandparents at the grandparents request on or around february.
on april,the department of family and children services the department filed second amended petitions under section,subdivisions b failure to protect and g no provision for support as to both children.the petitions alleged that father was arrested,convicted,and incarcerated for child endangerment,evading a peace officer,battery on a peace officer with personal injury,resisting arrest,and destruction of evidence.father prior criminal history includes several felony convictions going back to,including for domestic violence,and the children have witnessed their parents engaging in physical altercations.the mother was convicted of felony child endangerment,driving under the influence,and hit and run,in,after crashing a vehicle in which one of the children was a passenger.the mother prior criminal history includes a conviction for driving under the influence,and mother is on probation until december.however,mother current whereabouts were unknown.
the social worker report and amendments for the jurisdiction hearing recommended that the petitions be sustained,that the children remain in care,and that both parents receive family reunification services.the mother was released from jail in early december.the mother probation officer had a warrant issued for mother arrest on january,because the mother was in violation of probation for not complying and her whereabouts were unknown.the mother calls the children periodically,but they are frustrated and disappointed because they do not hear from her on a regular basis.the social worker had telephone contact with the mother on march,and the mother stated that she was aware that the children were with their paternal grandparents and that father was in jail,but that she did not have any information on how to contact the social worker.the mother stated that she was living near her family in sacramento,that she did not know her address,and that she was not on probation.the social worker informed the mother of the address and time of a court hearing scheduled for march,but mother did not attend the hearing.prior to their removal,the children had been residing with the paternal grandparents at the grandparents home since september,and father had also lived with them when he was not incarcerated.since their removal,the children have had regular weekly contact visits with father at elmwood.father expected to be released from elmwood in august,but he has an outstanding warrant from san benito county.the paternal grandparents reported that they would seek legal guardianship or adoption if the parents do not reunite with the children.
father was present with counsel at the jurisdiction hearing on april.counsel for the department submitted its report and addendums and asked the court to sustain the second amended petitions.counsel for the department then stated that,after discussions out of court with counsel for the father,he is going to submit on the petition,and he is going to waive service and we going to propose a legal guardianship with the grandparents and i will submit an order after hearing on that.father counsel stated,father understands that he has reunification as his option and right.and he is aware of the case planning recommendation but i do believe we did a formal waiver of reunification service in order to.father informed the court that he had reviewed the petition and discussed it with counsel,and that he waived his trial rights.the court found the allegations in the second amended petitions to be true,and that the children come within the provisions and description of section,subdivisions b and g.it then continued the matter for two weeks for disposition.
father was not present at the scheduled disposition hearing on may,but was represented by counsel.counsel stated that what is unknown to me at this point is the extent to which service has or has been accomplished according to the requirements of section t he mother is out there somewhere but we not exactly sure where,and i not sure what the status of the notice is,and so that certainly would think that if notice is still a problem,then it would be inappropriate to go forward with the section subdivision a guardianship that has been proposed.what the other question is,though,in terms of if notice has been proper,there is another whole legal question to be answered,and that is whether or not the court can order a section subdivision a guardianship without the consent of the absent parent.counsel for the department stated,the section guardianship is a fast track to legal guardianship,but even if that was not available to us there is another way to go to the legal guardianship,it would just take longer.the court continued the matter to may,so that the parties could brief the issues.
on may,father filed a brief contending that if notice and due diligence to contact the mother have been made,her presence in order to advise the court of her lack of desire to receive family reunification or maintenance services is not necessary for the court to issue letters of guardianship pursuant to section,subdivision a and father need not fill out a formal waiver of reunification services form in order for the court to have authority to order a guardianship under section,subdivision a.a blank waiver of reunification services form was attached to the brief.the department filed a brief contending that both parents must waive their right to services in order for the court to order a legal guardianship under section,subdivision a.counsel for the minors supports this position.in the brief,the department stated that on march,mother had left a message for the social worker stating that she was not able to arrange transportation to the march,hearing,and that she was returning to the bay area soon and would get in touch with her.
father was present with counsel at the continued may,hearing.the court thanked the parties for their briefs and stated that it was going to follow the department recommendation.it found that section,subdivision a seems to require the participation of the parent.and we do have that here because mom is not here.father argued that mother was not entitled to get reunification services under the law,because she is not here she has not come forward.counsel for the department noted that the mother was not noticed by the court clerk.the court gave,the clerk gave notice to the father,he was in jail but the mother whereabouts were unknown so she has not had formal notice.father acknowledged that the court could not make the required finding that mother had been properly noticed if she had not been.if that has happened i do think we can do anything today.i think that she has to be noticed.counsel for the children agreed that the issues of whether we can proceed on a section,subdivision a guardianship are moot until we provide notice of this.counsel for the department stated that they would try to find the mother,and the court continued the matter.
on may,the department filed a brief contending that the court could take jurisdiction over the children and make dispositional orders as long as reasonable efforts have been made to give the mother notice of the proceedings,and that reasonable efforts have been made to give the mother notice of these proceedings.attached to the brief was a declaration of diligence prepared and signed by a department investigating social worker,outlining her attempts between december,and april,to contact the mother.the attempts included the use of mother former mailing address in san jose and the cell phone numbers and the email address that the paternal grandparents had for her.
father was present with counsel at the continued hearing on may.counsel for the department stated that its recommendation was for family reunification services for both parents,as both parents must waive their right to receive services before the court can order a legal guardianship.counsel for the child agreed with the department that the court could proceed to disposition,but that it could not order a guardianship under section without having mother waiver of her right to services.father argued that mother has had the opportunity to participate in and exercise her constitutional rights,and that h er absence from here indicate s her unwillingness to participate.and we believe that the court therefore has the power,has the ability to go forth with an order of legal guardianship.
the court ruled as follows a fter considering the arguments both in court and in the cases cited in the briefs the court is going to find that welfare and institutions code section does in this case require mom to waive and we need her.at least that is how the court reads the statute.she is not here unfortunately.and so the court is going to follow the recommendation in the social worker report.the court then set the review hearing for november.
discussion 
father contends that the court erred in finding that the mother explicit waiver of reunification services and consent for a guardianship is needed prior to ordering a legal guardianship under section,subdivision a,as mother was a noncustodial and disinterested parent who had been properly noticed of all hearings but who had never appeared.he argues that written notification to mother of the hearings was impossible because she refused to give her mailing address,her probation officer did not know her whereabouts,and the department was not able to locate her.the department email notification of the may,disposition hearing informed the mother that legal guardianship for the children was an issue and that it was important that the court hear her position.however,mother did not respond.as a result,she waived any reunification services to which she may have been entitled because she did not appear in court and specifically request them as a parent is required to do therefore,since mother had no right to such services,the court erred in denying a guardianship on the grounds that mother had not formally waived them.
the department contends that the court properly determined that both parents were required to waive reunification services in order for the court to order a legal guardianship under section,subdivision a.the department argues that the mother was statutorily entitled to reunification services,so that a waiver of services by both her and father was an absolute prerequisite for the court to order a legal guardianship for the children under section a.counsel for the children has not filed a brief.
the overarching goal of dependency proceedings is to safeguard the welfare of california children.citation.family preservation,with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services,is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced.citation.reunification services implement the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationships if at all possible.citation.citation.reunification services are typically understood as a benefit provided to parents,because services enable them to demonstrate parental fitness and so regain custody of their dependent children.citation.
the legislative scheme reflects this reunification goal.with some limited exceptions section requires the juvenile court to order child welfare services for both parent and child when a minor is removed from parental custody.unless an exception applies,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.citations.this requirement implements the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationship if at all possible.citation.citation.in re nolan cal th,d,nolan.
of course reunification services need not be provided to a parent who does not wish to maintain the family unit,and who makes an informed decision to reject them s ection,subdivision b allows the parent to waive such services,where the waiver is expressed in writing,executed while the parent is represented by counsel,and accompanied by an advisement of the possible consequences,including the termination of parental rights and placement of the dependent child for adoption.citation see also,subd.a parental decision to forgo reunification may lead to establishment of legal guardianship.nothing in the statutory scheme suggests there are any limits on the time for waiving reunification services and relinquishing the parental role.see,subd.b parent may voluntarily relinquish dependent child to state welfare or county adoption agency at any time.the legislature has thus ensured that the most deficient and reluctant parents are not forced to undergo or continue reunification against their will.nolan,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter,see also in re jonathan d.
