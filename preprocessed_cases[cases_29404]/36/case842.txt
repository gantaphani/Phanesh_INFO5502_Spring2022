consistent with first amendment principles,california has a tradition of open civil proceedings.this applies with equal force to family law cases,although trial courts may redact or seal particular documents to protect private information concerning an overriding privacy interest,including matters pertaining to the custody and visitation of minor children.nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th nbc subsidiary in re marriage of burkle th burkle.
the trial judge initially assigned to the family law case now before us issued several different orders sealing the court record and establishing a procedure blocking public access.later,a newly assigned trial judge issued a revised sealing order to provide a procedure for public access in compliance with the nbc subsidiary and burkle decisions,as implemented by california rules of court,rules and.
appellant henry nicholas nicholas contends the family law court lacked jurisdiction to issue the revised sealing order because it was bound by the initial family law judge ruling,which he deems binding and unalterable by a successor trial judge.we do not find the contention persuasive.
we reject nicholas efforts to transform one of the initial trial judge prior sealing orders into a juridical black hole from which no light can ever escape.sealing orders,by their nature,turn on particular circumstances,which may change or evolve over time.erecting a jurisdictional barrier would effectively prevent the court from exercising custody and control over its own files.we therefore follow constitutional,case,and statutory authority subjecting sealing orders to continuing review and modification by the trial judge who sits in the same judicial proceeding.
factual and procedural backgrounda.prior sealing orders 
nicholas is involved in a highly contested marital dissolution proceeding with his spouse stacey nicholas,who filed the petition in.the couple has three minor children.nicholas cofounded broadcom corporation,which he describes as a successful and company.both the underlying action and a separate federal criminal indictment for securities fraud and narcotics crimes have drawn,in his words,intense media scrutiny and interest see nicholas d.
the nicholas divorce case initially was assigned to judge nancy pollard.in january,judge pollard filed the first sealing order in this case,based upon the parties stipulation,which provided that a ny document filed with the court that contains any confidential information shall be filed under seal and labeled as set forth the order defined confidential information to include information relating to family investments,holdings,and matters pertaining to family life,private life,personal characteristics,lifestyle,proclivities,customs,conduct,fitness,habits,sexual or other behavior,health and any other personal information 
the nicholas case subsequently was reassigned to judge salvador sarmiento,who determined the prominence of the nicholas family in the orange county community gives rise to such filings being newsworthy 
in december,judge sarmiento issued a second sealing order,based on the parties stipulation,requiring that any pleading or other document that relates to the custody of the minor children shall be sealed from public view.the second sealing order further required the court to seal all previously filed documents and to remove them from the court computer system s ince all filings in this matter heretofore have been documents relating to custody 
in january,judge sarmiento filed a third sealing order that restricted access to the court files to the attorneys of record.no other person could access the court files without a prior court order.
in february,judge sarmiento,acting on his own motion,filed a fourth sealing order.this order sealed all documents in the court file,including documents relating to family finances and holdings in broadcom.the fourth sealing order did not contain any new findings.instead,judge sarmiento incorporated by reference the blanket findings contained in the second sealing order of december.the fourth sealing order itself was sealed,as was the docket sheet,and the entire court file.
in august,respondent los angeles times communications llc the times filed a motion to intervene and to unseal the court records.the times argued,while the parties may be able to meet their burden of establishing that the court should redact certain information about the nicholases children,or information such as bank or brokerage account numbers,social security numbers,telephone numbers,or home that the times does not can not come close to justifying the blanket sealing order that shields the entire court file from public view.
in december,judge sarmiento issued a fifth sealing order the fifth sealing order vacated the fourth sealing order,but did not unseal any documents.instead,acting pursuant to code of civil procedure section,judge sarmiento used the fifth sealing order to appoint a special master to determine which court records,previously filed records and future filings,should be sealed or redacted.
the fifth sealing order provided the special master with general guidelines in recommending which records to seal.the order directed the special master to consider sealing pleadings,declarations,and exhibits that mention the children.conversely,the special master should unseal income and expense forms,notices of hearing,as well as pleadings,declarations,and exhibits that did not mention the children 
the fifth sealing order did not contain any findings of fact relating to the particularized standards and procedures in rule of the california rules of court.instead,the fifth sealing order incorporated by reference the findings made one year earlier in the second sealing order.
in february,nicholas and his wife each filed motions seeking further redaction and sealing of court records.judge sarmiento transferred the matter to the special master,but the record provides no further information concerning this reference.
reassignment to judge waltz and subsequent sealing orders 
in april,nicholas and his wife stipulated to have their matter referred to a retired judge judge thomas murphy associated with judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams to conduct hearings in the dissolution proceeding,including trial.the supervising judge of the orange county superior court family law panel judge francisco firmat approved the appointment of judge murphy as a temporary judge for all matters except for a ll issues relating to the sealing or unsealing of the contents of the court file which remain with the orange county superior court judge firmat specifically referred to a pending motion to unseal the file.
in june,judge firmat reassigned the nicholas case to judge waltz to determine all issues pertaining to the family court files.
judge waltz described the extraordinary situation he encountered upon assuming responsibility of the case.the voluminous record consisted of banker boxes filled with sealed,but unlabeled,envelopes.a ny physical inspection of any banker box yields a sea of large brown envelopes usually without any labeling.the entire file is under lock and key and very hard to access,even to the judge.even the court register of actions,some pages long,contained page after page of filings,with no clue about what had been filed.italics omitted.to preserve confidentiality,the court docket listed each document in a generalized manner that prevented its identification.
judge waltz was troubled by the fact that virtually the entire court file was to the public,notwithstanding the holdings in nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th and burkle,supra,th,regarding a presumptive right for the public access to records in divorce cases.
in july,judge waltz,acting sua sponte,ordered the special master to prepare a privilege log of all pleadings and documents filed under seal,and all pleadings and documents that had been redacted.once reviewed and approved by the court,judge waltz expressed his intent to make these logs available to the public.
in august,judge waltz issued a sixth sealing order.the court suspended the special master appointment and unsealed his prior reports.on its own motion,the court expressed its intention to modify the earlier sealing orders to establish that all future court filings would be presumptively open for public inspection,except by prior court order,under the procedure established in california rules of court rules and.judge waltz set a briefing schedule and calendared a hearing for early september.
shortly before the scheduled hearing,nicholas filed a peremptory challenge to judge waltz.code civ.in march,the los angeles superior court denied the peremptory challenge.we denied nicholas petition for writ of mandate.judge waltz thereupon reset the hearing on a proposed sealing order,and invited comments.
in the meantime,in april,the temporary judge judge murphy filed a judgment under seal pertaining to custody and visitation of the minor children.
on july,following a hearing,judge waltz issued,by our count,the seventh sealing order in this proceeding.this order detailed the procedural history of the case and the court legal authority.the court vacated judge sarmiento fifth sealing order because b oth the court and the parties have treated the seal order as a dynamic order,changing the sealing orders according to the needs and circumstances and seeking clarifying orders along the way.
the seventh sealing order specifically unsealed two sets of documents.first,it unsealed all pleadings previously filed under seal pertaining to the hearing on unsealing.second,it opened for public inspection a redacted copy of the judgment filed under seal by the temporary judge judge murphy pertaining to the children custody and visitation.judge waltz noted this redacted judgment had been submitted by nicholas trial counsel.
the seventh sealing order did not unseal any other document.instead,judge waltz ordered the clerk office,under the court direction,to prepare a list of documents that may have been filed under seal erroneously,and to submit this list for review by the parties.judge waltz prohibited the removal of any document from the confidential envelope before the parties had an opportunity to comment and object.the court directed the clerk to prepare a log of the entire file and to categorize the contents of each document,including whether it pertained to custody or visitation issues.
effective august,judge waltz directed that all future filings were presumptively open for public inspection unless the filing party adhered to the motion and application procedures of california rules of court,rules and for filing such documents under seal.the court reminded the parties,however,to redact references to social security numbers or financial account numbers.
in july,nicholas filed a notice of appeal from the seventh sealing order.the order,which directed the unsealing of two particularized and detailed sets of documents,is appealable as a final order on a collateral matter.mercury interactive klein th,mercury interactive.
nicholas concurrently filed a petition for writ of supersedeas,and we granted his request for a temporary stay of the seventh sealing order.after receiving opposition from the times and considering the merits,we denied the petition and dissolved the stay 
on september,during the pendency of this appeal,judge waltz issued an eighth sealing order attaching a list of documents that appear,at a glance,to be erroneously filed under seal.the court requested the parties to review the list and file any objections before the court determined whether to unseal any documents.the record does not contain any subsequent court orders 
discussiona.judge waltz had continuing jurisdiction to modify the interim sealing orders and to control the court records in compliance with the law 
nicholas brings this appeal to make sealing orders permanent and unalterable.because no one appealed from the fifth sealing order,entered in december,by judge sarmiento,nicholas believes it to be frozen in time leaving judge waltz without jurisdiction to modify it.he argues,given the lapse of the jurisdictional time period for appeal,the trial court now lacks jurisdiction and authority to reconsider the final sealing order,or to otherwise modify or alter that order,whether upon request of the times or its own motion.accordingly,judge waltz unsealing order is in excess of the trial court jurisdiction.
we reject nicholas efforts to treat sealing orders as if they sealed caskets rather than presumptively open court records,stamp ing upon our jurisprudence the unchangeableness attributed to the laws of the medes and persians.hurtado state of california.
nicholas arguments fail for three reasons.first,nicholas jurisdictional box runs afoul of constitutional principles,california supreme court decisions,and judicial rules concerning the sealing and unsealing of court records.
a strong presumption exists in favor of public access to court records in ordinary civil trials.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at.that is because the public has an interest,in all civil cases,in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system,and that interest strongly supports a general right of access in ordinary civil cases.id.at.since the first amendment guarantee of public access to the courts is at stake,family law departments may close their courtrooms and seal their court records only in limited circumstances,and only when they expressly identify the particular facts that support the existence of nbc subsidiary constitutional standards.burkle,supra,th at see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at cal.rules of court,rules d,e.
open court records safeguard against unbridled judicial power,thereby fostering community respect for the rule of law.if public court business is conducted in private,it becomes impossible to expose corruption,incompetence,inefficiency,prejudice,and favoritism.for this reason traditional jurisprudence distrusts secrecy in judicial proceedings and favors a policy of maximum public access to proceedings and records of judicial tribunals.estate of hearst d,estate of hearst.
since orders to seal court records implicate the public right of access under the first amendment,they inherently are subject to ongoing judicial scrutiny,including at the trial court level.due to its temporary nature and its infringement upon the public right to know,a sealing order in a civil case is always subject to continuing review and modification,if not termination,upon changed circumstances.copley press,superior court th,copley press issuing writ of mandate to compel trial court to grant newspaper motion to unseal court file relating to settlement of school sexual assault case.
in estate of hearst,supra,d,a probate court struggled over public access to periodic accountings and other material dealing with the testamentary trust of publishing magnate william randolph hearst,given terrorist threats to family members,including the kidnapping of granddaughter patricia hearst.on appeal,the estate of hearst court stressed the public legitimate interest in access to public records,such as court documents id.at,an interest that was best served by temporary limits on access,with a continuing burden on the party seeking to seal court records to periodically show the need for restricted access id.at.
in this regard,sealing orders are akin to interim provisional orders like temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions,which are appealable.code civ,subd.a,subd.g.nonetheless,unless the action is stayed pending appeal,trial judges retain the inherent power to modify a preliminary injunction which is of a continuing or executory nature.city of san marcos coast waste management,th.the fact that a preventive injunction purports to be permanent or preliminary in form is not significant.unforeseeable circumstances necessitating modification or dissolution of the injunction may occur in either case.when the decree is continuing in nature,directed at future events,it must be subject to adaptation as events may shape the need.union interchange,savage cal d.
thus,the fifth sealing order was a way station,not a final destination.acting in response to the times intervention,judge sarmiento set in place a process which would essentially outsource determinatio
