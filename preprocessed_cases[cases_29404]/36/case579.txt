factual and procedural background 
the dependency petition and review hearings 
the juvenile court sustained an amended dependency petition on behalf of breanna and david on july,pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b,finding that lydia and jesse had a history of engaging in violent confrontations in the presence of the children,the children were frightened of jesse due to those encounters,jesse had violated a criminal court restraining order,and lydia had failed to protect the children by remaining in the relationship despite multiple episodes of domestic violence.in addition,the court found that jesse had a history of illicit drug abuse and was a current abuser of marijuana and alcohol,which rendered him incapable of providing regular care and supervision of the children.the court removed the children from lydia and jesse custody,placed them with their maternal grandmother and ordered family reunification services for both parents.
between the children detention on may,and the july,hearing,lydia visited the children only twice.
prior to the review hearing,subd.e originally scheduled for,breanna and david were placed with their maternal great cousins.lydia and jesse informed the department they remained in a romantic relationship notwithstanding the past incidents of violence and wanted to reunify with their children as a family unit.lydia visitation remained infrequent.
at the continued hearing on april,the court found lydia and jesse in partial compliance with their case plans and ordered the department to continue to provide them with reunification services.lydia visited with the children twice in february and not at all in march.she had three visits with them by.
at the review hearing in july,subd.f the court again found lydia in partial compliance and ordered reunification services continued for her.lydia failed to attend her scheduled visits with the children in june and july.according to the relative caregivers call log,lydia had failed to call the children for scheduled telephone visits more than half the time.
following a contested hearing in september the court terminated jesse services.he had failed to reenroll in a substance abuse class,as ordered,and had been discharged from his domestic violence program due to poor attendance.
on november,the court issued a temporary restraining order against jesse at lydia request following a physical attack earlier that month.as reflected in the sustained petition and the department detention and jurisdiction reports,this was not the first restraining order lydia had obtained against jesse a restraining order had previously been granted in may protecting lydia and both children jesse had been arrested in february for violating that order,which prompted the referral of the family to the department.
after a contested permanency review hearing on january,the court terminated lydia reunification services and set a selection and implementation hearing for may.although lydia had completed a parenting education class and a domestic violence program,she was not in compliance with the substance abuse component of her case plan.in addition,although lydia had previously identified depression and stress disorder as the reasons for her failure to consistently visit with the children,she was not obtaining any mental health treatment.lydia reported she had resumed her relationship with jesse and was again pregnant.the caregivers reported lydia visits with the children remained sporadic.
the selection and implementation hearing and termination of parental rights 
in its report for the selection and implementation hearing,dated may,the department advised the court that breanna and david remained suitably placed with their maternal cousins,who continued to provide them with a stable home environment,meeting their physical,emotional and medical needs.the department also reported the maternal cousins were committed to provide the children permanency through adoption in the event reunification for the parents failed and indicated the home study for the maternal cousins was nearly complete.in addition,according to the department social worker the children appeared happy and bonded with these caregivers,referring to them as mom and dad.
lydia visits remained monitored and her contact with the children was only sporadic.the caregivers reported lydia often scheduled a visit and then failed to follow through.jesse visits were characterized as inconsistent,occurring on average only twice a month.
at the request of counsel for the children,the hearing was continued and the department was directed to again interview breanna,who was experiencing some conflict about the options for a permanent plan.in a report submitted may,the social worker stated breanna was clear she wanted to be adopted by her current caregivers her conflict had to do with her concern about appearing disloyal to lydia and jesse.
the court denied lydia and jesse request for breanna to testify at the continued hearing,explaining her ambivalence was not in dispute and,given her age eight years old at this point in the proceedings,her wishes with regard to the question of bonding were of minimal significance.lydia testified her visits with the children had become more frequent during the preceding six months and blamed the caregivers for her previous infrequent visitation,but acknowledged she had not spent any holidays with breanna and david,attended any of their medical appointments or otherwise spent any significant time in their home.jesse also testified concerning his even more limited visitation with the children.
at the conclusion of the contested hearing the court found by clear and convincing evidence that it would be detrimental to the children to be returned to their parents,that breanna and david were likely to be adopted in a reasonable time and that lydia and jesse had failed to establish the statutory relationship exception to termination of parental rights,subd.c b i.the court acknowledged that breanna had a relationship with lydia and jesse,that she will always see you as her mother and her father,but that is not enough.
the court reviewed the parents visitation history and ruled,i ca find that there has been a consistent and regular pattern of visitation.your visitation has not changed from monitored from the time of the initial hearing on this case in may of.it has yet to change to unmonitored because you failed to do what the court ordered you to do,and you get into another physical altercation with each other.the court additionally ruled there was insufficient evidence to show the children would benefit from continuing the relationship,noting that breanna did not want to return to lydia because she was afraid jesse was going to be around.accordingly,the court terminated lydia and jesse parental rights and reconfirmed adoption as the children permanent plan.
investigation of indian ancestry and icwa notice 
on her judicial council form,parental notification of indian status,filed on may,the date of the initial detention hearing,lydia indicated she may have indian ancestry,identifying the apache and yaqui tribes.similarly,the detention report filed by the department stated t he indian child welfare act may apply,explaining that lydia had disclosed she may have american indian ancestry,naming the yaqui and apache tribes but stating she had no further information the juvenile court ordered the department to investigate lydia possible indian ancestry,to give notice to the proper tribe or tribes and the bureau of indian affairs bia,if appropriate,and to include the information concerning her ancestry in its next report to the court.
in its report dated june,the department advised the court it had interviewed lydia regarding her indian ancestry and lydia had stated she has possibly yaqui indian heritage from her great sic grandmother.the relative discussed was actually lydia maternal grandmother and the children maternal.lydia did not know her grandmother name but indicated her mother,esperanza,might have more information.a dependency investigator then met with esperanza,who stated there was possible indian ancestry in the yaqui tribe through the children maternal.esperanza provided the maternal name matilde,date of birth,state of birth new mexico and date of death and state where she died california.esperanza also reported that,although matilde was not registered,she would always say we were yaqui.esperanza also gave the investigator the name of her father the maternal,his date of birth and the year and state in which he died.
based on the information provided,the department reported,icwa notices had been processed and sent by registered mail to the yaqui tribe,the federal bia and the united states secretary of the interior.no return receipts or response from the tribe had been received by the date of the report.nonetheless,the department recommended that the court make icwa findings as to both lydia and jesse.
by the date of the continued hearing on july,the department had received a letter from the pascua yaqui tribe,dated july,which stated its enrollment department had indicated breanna,david,lydia and jesse were not members of the tribe and did not have applications for membership pending.the letter continued,based upon the family information provided and the current enrollment records,the children are not eligible for membership and the tribe will not intervene in this matter.
at the combined hearing the juvenile court found there was no reason to know either breanna or david was an indian child within the meaning of icwa.the court ordered the parents to keep the department and the court aware of any new information relating to possible icwa status.
discussion 
the juvenile court did not err in ruling lydia had failed to establish the relationship exception to termination of parental rightsa.governing law and standard of review 
the express purpose of a section hearing is to provide stable,permanent homes for dependent children,subd.b.once the court has decided to end reunification services,the legislative preference is for adoption,subd.b in re cal th,i f adoption is likely,the court is required to terminate parental rights,unless specified circumstances compel a finding that termination would be detrimental to the child in re celine cal th,i f the child is adoptable adoption is the norm.indeed,the court must order adoption and its necessary consequence,termination of parental rights,unless one of the specified circumstances provides a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.see in re marilyn cal th,once reunification efforts have been found unsuccessful,the state has a compelling interest in providing stable,permanent homes for children who have been removed from parental custody,and the court then must concentrate its efforts on the child placement and,rather than on a parent challenge to a custody order see also in re noah th,in re th.
section requires the juvenile court to conduct a inquiry at the selection and implementation hearing.first,the court determines whether there is clear and convincing evidence the child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.cynthia superior court cal th,in re th.then,if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence the child is likely to be adopted,the statute mandates judicial termination of parental rights unless the parent opposing termination can demonstrate one of the enumerated statutory exceptions applies,subd.c a b see cynthia,at,when the child is adoptable and declining to apply one of the statutory exceptions would not cause detriment to the child,the decision to terminate parental rights is relatively automatic.
one of the statutory exceptions to termination is contained in section,subdivision c b i,which permits the court to order some other permanent plan if t he parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.the exception requires the parent to prove both that he or she has maintained regular visitation and that his or her relationship with the child promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the the child would gain in a permanent home with new,adoptive parents.in re marcelo th,accord,in re amber th,see in re autumn th,the court balances the strength and quality of the natural relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and the sense of belonging a new family would confer.
a showing the child derives some benefit from the relationship is not a sufficient ground to depart from the statutory preference for adoption.see in re angel th,a biological parent who has failed to reunify with an adoptable child may not derail an adoption merely by showing the child would derive some benefit from continuing a relationship maintained during periods of visitation with the parent.no matter how loving and frequent the contact,and notwithstanding the existence of an emotional bond with the child,the parents must show that they occupy a parental role in the child life.in re th,in re th.factors to consider include t he age of the child,the portion of the child life spent in the parent custody,the positive or negative effect of interaction between parent and child,and the child particular needs.in re marcelo,supra,th at.moreover b ecause a section hearing occurs only after the court has repeatedly found the parent unable to meet the child needs,it is only in an extraordinary case that preservation of the parent rights will prevail over the legislature preference for adoptive placement.in re jasmine th.
the parent has the burden of proving the statutory exception applies.in re,supra,th at in re derek th.the court decision a parent has not satisfied this burden may be based on any or all of the component determinations whether the parent has maintained regular visitation,whether a beneficial parental relationship exists,and whether the existence of that relationship constitutes a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child,subd.c b see in re,supra,th at in re bailey th.when the juvenile court finds the parent has not maintained regular visitation or established the existence of the requisite beneficial relationship,our review is limited to determining whether the evidence compels a finding in favor of the parent on this issue as a matter of law.in re,at where the issue on appeal turns on a failure of proof at trial,the question for a reviewing court becomes whether the evidence compels a finding in favor of the appellant as a matter of law see in re aurora th.when the juvenile court concludes the benefit to the child derived from preserving parental rights is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh the benefit achieved by the permanency of adoption,we review that determination for abuse of discretion.in re,at in re bailey,at.
lydia failed to establish the c b i exception to termination of parental rights 
lydia contends she established the existence of a beneficial parental relationship with the children within the meaning of section,subdivision c b i,because,contrary to the juvenile court finding,she maintained regular visitation and had a strong bond with both children however,the record does not compel a finding that regular visitation occurred or demonstrate the juvenile court abused its discretion in concluding lydia relationship with the children did not outweigh the they would gain in a permanent home with adoptive parents.
as discussed,there was ample evidence in the record that lydia visited with breanna and david only sporadically during the first months of the dependency proceedings,often cancelling visits that had been arranged.while her visits apparently became more regular during the final six months before the section hearing,even then they occurred only once a week for two hours per visit.lydia testimony did not compel a finding,as a matter of law,that she had maintained regular visitation and contact with the children,as required for the relationship exception to termination of parental rights to apply.see in re anthony th,sporadic visitation is insufficient to satisfy the first prong of the relationship exception to adoption.citation.the type of relationship sufficient to derail the statutory preference for adoption is one in which regular visits and contact have continued or developed a significant,positive,emotional attachment from parent to child.citation.such relationship arises from interaction,companionship and shared experiences.
in addition,the juvenile court determination the benefits of adoption for the children far outweighed those from continuing their relationship with lydia and jesse was well within its discretion.to be sure,lydia acted appropriately when she saw the children during her monitored visits playing with them and helping breanna with her arithmetic and spelling and david with his abc and breanna expressed mixed feelings about the prospect of adoption.but this evidence falls far short of demonstrating a substantial emotional attachment that would cause the children to suffer great harm if severed.see in re anthony,supra,th at relationship exception requires parent to demonstrate relationship remained so significant and compelling in the child life that the benefit of preserving it outweighed the stability and benefits of adoption in re bailey,supra,th at juvenile court determines the importance of the relationship in terms of the detrimental impact that its severance can be expected to have on the child and to weigh that against the benefit to the child of adoption in re autumn,supra,th at exception applies only if the severance of the relationship would deprive the child of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed.it was the adoptive parents,not lydia,who ensured breanna and david ongoing needs,both physical and emotional,were being met.lydia simply failed to show she occupied a parental role in her children life.see in re,supra,th at.furthermore,in balancing the benefit to breanna and david of adoption and the possible detriment from terminating their relationship with their mother,the juvenile court properly expressed concern over the continuing violence that characterized lydia relationship with jesse,the very reason that dependency jurisdiction was exercised in the first place.see in re noah,supra,th at in considering the relationship exception to termination of parental rights,the juvenile court could properly focus on the mother unresolved substance addiction issues because the children became dependents of the court due to her drug abuse.for all these reasons,the juvenile court properly found the relationship exception did not apply in this case.
the department failed to satisfy its notice obligation under icwa 
a.the icwa notice requirements 
congress enacted icwa in to address an indian child welfare crisis of massive proportions an estimated to percent of all indian children had been separated from their families and placed in adoptive homes,foster care or institutions,reprinted in code cong.admin.news.although this crisis was the product of several related causes,congress expressly found that state agencies and courts had often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in indian communities and families.to address this failure,protect indian children and promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families,icwa establishes minimum federal standards a state court must follow before removing an indian child from his or her family.in re isaiah cal th,in re cal th.
as the california supreme court recently explained,notice to indian tribes is central to effectuating icwa purpose,enabling a tribe to determine whether the child involved in a dependency proceeding is an indian child and,if so,whether to intervene in or exercise jurisdiction over the matter.in re isaiah,supra,cal th at.icwa provides,in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe of the pending proceedings and its right to intervene.a.similarly,california law requires notice to the indian custodian and the indian child tribe in accordance with section,subdivision a,if the department or court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved in the proceedings,subd.d see cal.rules of court,rule b notice is required i f it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved in a proceeding listed in rule,which includes all dependency cases filed under welfare and institutions code section.
icwa itself does not define reason to know,nor did the implementing federal regulations in effect while this case was pending in the dependency court.see former in re th,fn.in re th.however,california statutory law,which incorporates and enhances icwa requirements see in re,supra,cal th at discussing passage of senate bill reg.sess,provides the circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child include,without limitation,when a member of the child extended family provides information suggesting the child is a member of a tribe or eligible for membership in a tribe or one or more of the child parents,grandparents or are or were a member of a tribe,subd.b see in re isaiah,supra,cal th at section,subdivision b sets forth a nonexhaustive list of circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child see also in re kadence th,fn.because only the tribe may make the determination whether the child is a member or eligible for membership,there is no general blood quantum requirement or remoteness exception to icwa notice requirements in re th,a person need not be a registered member of a tribe to be a member of a tribe parents may be unsure or unknowledgeable of their own status as a member of a tribe.
under the implementing federal regulations,icwa notices,when required,had to include a ll names known,and current and former addresses of the indian child biological mother,biological father,maternal and paternal grandparents and great grandparents or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates places of birth and death tribal enrollment numbers,other identifying information.former a,d.in nearly identical language california law requires that icwa notices include all names known of the indian child biological parents,grandparents,and,or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases,as well as their current and former addresses,birthdates,places of birth and death,tribal enrollment numbers,and any other identifying information,if known,subd.a c.the judicial council mandatory form,notice of child custody proceeding for indian child indian child welfare act,adopted effective january,and used by the department in this case,includes boxes for the required information,including birth date and place,for each parent,each parent biological mother and father the child maternal and paternal grandparents and each parent four biological grandparents the child maternal and paternal.
b.the department has conceded it omitted required information from the icwa notice 
jesse,joined by lydia,argues the notices sent to the yaqui tribe by the department omitted information required by federal
