penal code section provides in subdivision a that it is a crime when a person takes,entices away,keeps,withholds,or conceals a child and maliciously deprives a lawful custodian of a right to custody,or a person of a right to visitation section,subdivision a section a,provides,however,that section does not apply to a person who has a right to custody of the child and acts with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child,if left with the other person,will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm this case requires us to examine the relationship between these two provisions.we conclude that the defendant bears the burden of raising a reasonable doubt regarding whether section a applies.because the trial court instructed the jury that defendant had to prove section a facts by a preponderance of the evidence,and because the error was prejudicial,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which had reversed the trial judgment.
facts and procedural history 
we take these facts largely from the court of appeal opinion.defendant,william neidinger,and olga neidinger olga were married in.they have two children,a son born in october,and a daughter born in november.as the court of appeal describes it,the relationship between defendant and olga was tumultuous they had many arguments that escalated to physical altercations.olga and defendant each claimed the other was the aggressor.olga testified defendant was physically abusive defendant testified that olga became quite angry after the birth of their daughter,and would take out her aggressions by hitting him or damaging his personal property.eventually,after one altercation,olga and the children moved into an apartment in west sacramento.on september,at olga request,the sacramento county superior court issued an order restraining defendant from contacting olga or the children.
in december,olga filed a petition for legal separation.later,the court granted olga and defendant joint legal and physical custody of the children and gave defendant supervised and then unsupervised visitation rights.pursuant to stipulation,the custody order was modified on february.the new order granted olga and defendant joint legal custody with primary physical custody to olga defendant was granted visitation with the children on each saturday and sunday from to 
defendant testified that after he began to see the children more frequently,he became concerned about their,as they had regressed into a state of near autism.they were lethargic,detached,and almost catatonic.he said he made over complaints to child protective service agencies about the children without receiving a satisfactory response.defendant concern culminated in an incident on march,that,he testified,caused him to decide to take the children from olga care for their own safety.during this time,defendant was trying to conclude all court proceedings in california and to initiate a new proceeding in nevada because,he testified,n obody was living in sacramento whatsoever,and he had maintained his residency in nevada even after he had moved to sacramento to complete a job.on march,defendant filed an application in a nevada court for an order for protection against domestic violence.
defendant picked up his children for his regular visitation on saturday,march.he testified he drove to the police station in west sacramento to inform them of his plans to remove the children,but the station was closed.a woman in civilian clothes told him that the police did not get into such matters and did not care.through third parties,he communicated to olga that he would not return the children because he had moved to nevada,which would be a better place for them.olga called the police.while a police officer was interviewing her,defendant telephoned her.he told her that he had an order granting custody issued by a nevada court on march,but he declined to fax a copy of the order to the officer.
officer ricky gore,the investigating officer,left a message on defendant cellular telephone the evening of march,to which defendant replied with a lengthy message of his own.officer gore testified that defendant said he was fed up with the california court system he had gotten rid of all actions in california he had tried,unsuccessfully,to serve olga with court papers and the children were safe.officer gore returned defendant call the next morning,and defendant reiterated the concerns he had stated in his earlier message.the day after that,monday,march,officer gore again spoke with defendant by telephone,who reiterated his frustration with the california courts and said he was concerned about his children welfare.defendant said he would not return the children to california,but he agreed to fax the nevada court order to officer gore.officer gore obtained an arrest warrant for defendant,and nevada police arrested him later that same day while he was faxing the nevada order to officer gore.
defendant was charged with two counts of maliciously depriving a lawful custodian of the right to custody of a child in violation of section,subdivision a,one count for each of the two children at trial,defendant claimed that he had a reasonable and good faith belief that removal of the children from olga care was necessary for their physical and emotional under section a.the court instructed the jury on this defense.as part of this instruction,the court told the jury that defendant had the burden of proving the facts necessary to establish this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
the jury found defendant guilty on both counts.the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for four years on the condition that he serve days in jail and have no contact with olga and the children.
defendant appealed.he argued that the trial court erred in imposing on him the burden of proving section a factual requirements by a preponderance of the evidence.the court of appeal held that the instruction was proper.but it also held that the trial court erred by not additionally giving an instruction which clarified the relationship between the good faith defense and the element of malice,so that it was clear to the jury that,to the extent the evidence regarding the good faith defense also showed that defendant acted without malice,he need raise only a reasonable doubt as to that element of the offense.it found the error prejudicial and reversed the judgment.
we granted the attorney general petition for review.
ii.discussion 
in criminal cases,it is well settled,indeed,virtually axiomatic,that the prosecution has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,in re winship,d.accordingly,in this case,the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime stated in section,subdivision a.no one questions this basic proposition.but it is constitutionally permissible to place on the defendant the burden of proving affirmative defenses by a preponderance of the evidence,as long as the defendant is not required to negate an element of the offense.dixon,d interpreting federal statutes as requiring defendant to prove duress by a preponderance of the evidence martin ohio,d ohio law may permissibly require defendants charged with murder to prove by a preponderance of the evidence moss superior court cal th,d,person charged with criminal contempt for failure to comply with a child support order must prove inability to comply with the order by a preponderance of the evidence.
in this case,defendant was convicted of violating section,subdivision a,which provides every person who takes,entices away,keeps,withholds,or conceals a child and maliciously deprives a lawful custodian of a right to custody,or a person of a right to visitation,is guilty of a crime.at trial,he relied on section a,which provides section does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who,with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child,if left with the other person,will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm,takes,entices away,keeps,withholds,or conceals that child.
we must decide how section a belief defense interacts with section.specifically,we must decide who has the burden of proof regarding this belief,and what that burden is.within limits,this is a question of state law.d efining the elements of an offense and the procedures,including the burdens of producing evidence and of persuasion,are matters committed to the state.moss superior court,supra,cal th at,d,citing martin ohio,supra,at,and patterson new york,d see also dixon,supra,at.at.there are,of course,limits on what the state may do in this regard.t he state may not label as an affirmative defense a traditional element of an offense and thereby make a defendant presumptively guilty of that offense unless the defendant disproves the existence of that element.moss superior court,supra,at,d.due process does not require that the state prove the nonexistence of a constitutionally permissible affirmative defense,however.ibid.defendant does not argue that section good faith belief is a traditional element of an offense that can not be made an affirmative defense.accordingly,we turn to state law to decide these questions.
we recently decided similar questions regarding a different offense.people mower cal th,d,mower.mower was charged with possessing and cultivating marijuana in violation of health and safety code sections and.he relied on the defense established by proposition,approved in,entitled medical use of marijuana.specifically,health and safety code section,subdivision d,provides section,relating to the possession of marijuana,and section,relating to the cultivation of marijuana,shall not apply to a patient,or to a patient primary caregiver,who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.as here,we had to decide who had the burden of proving the facts underlying this medical use provision and what that burden was.also as in this case,the trial court instructed that defendant bore the burden of proof as to the facts underlying this defense,and that he was required to prove those facts by a preponderance of the evidence.mower,supra,at,d.
we began by explaining that two related but distinct issues are involved.the first issue is which party,the prosecution or the defendant,bears the burden of proof regarding the facts underlying the defense.the second issue is exactly what that burden is.mower,supra,cal th at,d.as to the first issue,we placed the burden on the defendant.our reasoning applies equally to this case.we relied primarily on the rule of convenience and necessity,which declares that,unless it is unduly harsh or unfair,the burden of proving an exonerating fact may be imposed on a defendant if its existence is peculiarly within his personal knowledge and proof of its nonexistence by the prosecution would be relatively difficult or inconvenient.mower,supra,cal th at,d.this rule supports placing the burden on defendant in this case,just as it did in mower.the facts underlying section a belief requirement are peculiarly within defendant personal knowledge,and it would be relatively difficult or inconvenient for the prosecution to prove their nonexistence.it would not be unduly harsh or unfair to place the burden of proving those facts on the defendant.
additionally,we explained that the medical marijuana statute,health and safety code section,subdivision d,constitutes an exception to the criminal statutes because it provides that the criminal statutes shall not apply when the medical requirements are met.mower,supra,cal th at,d.the same is true here.section a uses the phrase does not apply rather than shall not apply,but we see no difference in meaning.it is well established that where a statute first defines an offense in unconditional terms and then specifies an exception to its operation,the exception is an affirmative defense to be raised and proved by the defendant.people george th,d,quoting in re andre d.here,section a is an exception to section,which supports the conclusion it is an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise.
both of the reasons we cited in mower,supra,cal th at page,d,for placing on defendant the initial burden regarding the medical marijuana defense apply equally here.accordingly,we conclude that defendant has the initial burden regarding the facts underlying section a.
our conclusion that defendant bears this burden raises the second question,which is how heavy that burden is.here we come to the main contested issue.the attorney general argues that the defendant must prove the facts underlying section a by a preponderance of the evidence.defendant argues he need only raise a reasonable doubt regarding these facts.
we noted in mower,supra,cal th at page,d,that the rule of convenience and necessity is equally consistent with requiring the defendant merely to raise a reasonable doubt as it is with requiring the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.moreover,the fact that section a states an affirmative defense does not decide this question.for example,over a century ago,in a murder case,we considered a statute that casts upon the defendant the burden of proving circumstances of mitigation,or that justify or excuse the commission of the homicide.people bushton cal.we held that this statute only required the defendant to produce such evidence as will create in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt of his guilt of the offense charged.ibid.accordingly,to resolve the second question,we must look elsewhere.mower,supra,at,d.
in mower,we began with evidence code section which,we explained,provides that,when a statute allocates the burden of proof to a defendant on any fact relating to his or her guilt,the defendant is required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to that fact.mower,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.we noted that with respect to many defenses,the defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt.see also,at,fn,d,giving several examples.these defenses,we explained,relate to the defendant guilt or innocence because they relate to an element of the crime in question.id.at,d.we also noted that w hen a statute allocates the burden of proof to a defendant as to a fact collateral to his or her guilt,however,the defendant may be required to prove that fact by a preponderance of the evidence.ibid.we said that s uch defenses are collateral to the defendant guilt or innocence because they are collateral to any element of the crime in question.ibid.
applying this test,we concluded that the defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt as to the facts underlying the medical marijuana defense.this defense plainly relates to the defendant guilt or innocence.mower,supra,cal th at,d.as a result of the enactment of health and safety code section,subdivision d,the possession and cultivation of marijuana is no more long as its conditions are the possession and acquisition of any prescription drug with a physician prescription.id.at,d.in sum,the defense provided by health and safety code section,subdivision d relates to the defendant guilt or innocence,because it relates to an element of the crime of possession or cultivation of marijuana.thus,this defense negates the element of the possession or cultivation of marijuana to the extent that the element requires that such possession or cultivation be unlawful.ibid.
as we explain,we reach the same conclusion in this case that we did in need only raise a reasonable doubt regarding the facts underlying the section a defense.two courts of appeal interpreting two predecessor versions of crimes similar to,but in some ways different than,the crime involved here reached differing results.
in people beach d,the court construed former section,subdivision a,which provided in pertinent part every person who in violation of a custody decree takes,retains after the expiration of a visitation period,or conceals the child from his legal custodian is guilty of a crime.former,as added by stats,ch,see people beach,supra,at.at that time section a did not exist.the trial court had instructed the jury on the general,nonstatutory defense of necessity.the court of appeal rejected the contention that the court should have instructed the jury that
