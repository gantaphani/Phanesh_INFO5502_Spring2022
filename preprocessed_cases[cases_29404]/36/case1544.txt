this case raised the issues of whether a fraud or false swearing defense to an insurance claim can be established without proof that the insurer relied on the misrepresentation to its prejudice and whether an innocent who holds property jointly with an insured who has committed fraud is automatically excluded from coverage.we hold that the false swearing defense can be raised in the absence of reliance,and that under the wording of the policy in question and the california standard form fire insurance policy,an innocent may recover for his or her percentage share of the losses despite the transgressions of the other insured.we,therefore,reverse the summary judgment granted by the trial court in part and affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
appellants bobby watts and mae watts brought suit against their insurer,respondent farmers insurance exchange,claiming that farmers wrongfully failed to pay for damage to their home resulting from a fire.farmers obtained summary judgment by establishing that watts violated the policy fraud provision by untruthfully answering questions posed by farmers investigators concerning previous fires and by submitting a claim for personal property which included numerous items damaged or destroyed in a fire and which conflicted with a written claim she had made in connection with the fire.watts presented evidence that he was innocent of knowledge of any fraud,but farmers persuaded the court that watts misrepresentations freed it from its obligations to both parties because the property was held jointly as community property.
on appeal,watts contends that farmers failed to show that the misrepresentations were material or that she had the necessary intent to defraud.watts contends that he should not be precluded from recovery for his share of the damaged property merely because of his wife actions.we agree with the trial court that materiality and intent were adequately shown with regard to watts.we disagree,however,that watts is automatically precluded from all recovery due to the manner in which the property was held.we hold that under the language of the policy,watts rights were severable from his wife and he may recover for his proportionate share of the damaged property as long as he was innocent of fraud.
in its brief,farmers contends that the judgment against watts can be affirmed on alternate grounds,pointing to evidence in the record to refute watts status as an innocent spouse.but we can not decide a factual question of this nature as a matter of first impression on appeal when the evidence is conflicting.we,therefore,reverse the judgment entered against watts and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
appellants were owners of a house in compton,which was insured by farmers under a fire policy.the residence was damaged by fire in january.at the time of the january fire,the house was vacant appellants had moved out in,after their daughter became a witness to a murder and the house became the object of shootings.a few days later,an incendiary device was thrown into the house.a claim based on the incident had been paid by the prior insurer,american security insurance company.
in response to their claim,watts was interviewed by a farmers investigator on february.her statement under oath was taken on december.appellants submitted a proof of loss form on september,in april,farmers rejected their claim,stating in a letter as you are aware,the subject policy of insurance contains the following relevant language.concealment or fraud.we do not provide coverage if you have intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance.it has been determined that the insured has violated the above policy language by concealing misrepresenting material facts circumstances.farmers set forth the following specific instances of concealment or misrepresentation on the part of watts farmers discovered that watts had pled guilty to arson in connection with a fire at the house,yet during the examination under oath,answered i think so when asked whether there had been only two fires at the property since during questioning by the investigator,watts answered no,ai nobody did nothing to my house when asked if there had been any fires at the property other than the january fire and the incident where someone threw an incendiary device at the house a number of items of personal property listed on the proof of loss form appeared to be identical to items previously identified as damaged or destroyed in connection with the incident.
appellants complaint and farmers motion to strike 
in september,appellants brought suit against farmers for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unfair business practices.the complaint alleged that appellants had paid premiums and performed all obligations due under the insurance policy,and that farmers had breached by refusing to pay for the fire damage.in paragraph d,appellants alleged that farmers committed an unfair business practice by fail ing to consider the interests of each of its insureds separately and by failure to follow rules established by california and common law that apply to an innocent.
farmers moved to strike various allegations of the complaint,including the allegations of paragraph d.farmers cited enterprises,fire ins.exch.d,for the proposition that it did not need to consider the interests of each insured separately.the trial court granted that portion of the motion,ruling that farmers was not required to consider the interests of the insureds separately if the insured property was community property.
appellants filed an amended complaint,and farmers answered,asserting as an affirmative defense that appellants intentionally concealed or misrepresented material facts circumstances relating to the insurance,including material circumstances relating to the subject claim,barring their recovery from farmers.
farmers motion for summary judgment 
farmers moved for summary judgment.it established as a matter of undisputed fact that there was an insurance policy in effect from december,to november,that the policy contained the provision precluding coverage if the insured had intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact relating to the insurance and that appellants made a claim under the policy as a result of the january fire.farmers sought to establish that appellants violated the concealment misrepresentation provision,and thereby justified its refusal to pay the claim.it showed that watts had made the statements referenced in its april letter.it established that a criminal complaint was filed against watts in for willfully,unlawfully and maliciously set ting fire to and burn ing and caus ing to be burned an inhabited structure and inhabited property referencing the house in compton,which ultimately led to a sentence of probation being imposed on watts.
farmers also sought to show misrepresentation with reference to specific items in appellants damage claim.it did this by submitting a letter written by watts in which she listed the damage to the house and personal property,which resulted from the incident.the letter,which is undated but was apparently written in,lists items damaged,destroyed,taken,or toreup as a result of that incident.it includes the following language m y white organ they toreup,couch love seat,coffee tables,lamp,mirrors,tv,and vcr,stero sic record player,picturs sic everything they took kitchen destroyed my refrigerator,and stove.all my carpet in the house was destroyed all my cloths sic they took and the damages you can see for yourself all my belonging sic was destroyed,they through sic all my clothes on the floor and destroyed all of my property.watts testified at her deposition that she had sent the letter sometime after the incident to her mortgage company.
farmers further established that appellants submitted a proof of loss form in september in which they sought for the loss of the house and for loss of personal property,including a coach sic chair set purchased in the late a musical organ purchased in a stove purchased in the late a refrigerator purchased around three television sets purchased in,and and clothes.the proof of loss was signed by both appellants.
in the interrogation under oath conducted by farmers counsel in december,watts testified that part of the carpet in the front room was damaged in the incident,but the carpet in the two bedrooms was not and that it was in pretty good shape prior to the fire.she testified that she did not think the couch was damaged in the incident.she testified that she was positive the organ had not been damaged in the incident she testified that the refrigerator and stove were in the kitchen in september,but was unclear about whether they were operable.
in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,appellants submitted portions of watts interrogation under oath and deposition testimony in which she testified that she and her family left the house on september,after a shooting.the house was attacked by a firebomb or other type of incendiary device sometime thereafter.she wrote the letter herself from memory after a brief visit to the house to inspect the damage.watts did not have any input into writing the letter as of the time of the statement under oath,watts did not believe that everything in the letter was accurate.she said the washer,dryer,stove,and refrigerator were damaged,but not destroyed,in the fire.
when asked about the arson conviction at her deposition taken in january and february,watts denied setting fire to the house.she stated that she was angry with her husband and set his chair on fire.the fire spread and caused damage to the front room and curtains of the house.she called the fire department when she could not put the fire out herself,and admitted what she had done.this led to a criminal charge to which she pled guilty,but she did not understand that the charge was arson.
appellants set forth additional facts,establishing that american security had not paid the full amount of the claim.appellants also submitted evidence indicating that farmers suspected there had been previous fires at the residence from statements obtained from the fire department and other witnesses in february and march.appellants claim was referred by farmers to the department of insurance as a potential fraudulent claim in february or march.
appellants argued in opposition to the summary judgment motion that farmers had not shown an actual intent to defraud or materiality and presented no evidence of fraud on the part of watts.
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.it stated that the misrepresentation regarding the fire and the submission of duplicate claims to american security and farmers were material as a matter of law.the court further ruled that the misrepresentations were made with knowledge of falsity,were a proper and necessary part of farmers reasonable investigation,and were relied on by farmers.concerning intent,the court ruled that it was necessarily implied where the misrepresentation was material and willfully made with knowledge of falsity.it concluded that there was no need to consider the interests of watts separately based on its earlier ruling on the motion to strike concerning community property,and stated that t here is no evidence that the house is anything other than community property.judgment was subsequently entered in favor of farmers.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the next issue is whether watts is automatically precluded from obtaining any recovery because of his wife misdeeds.relying on enterprises,fire ins,supra,d,farmers argues that his interest did not need to be considered separately.this is incorrect.
did not involve jointly held marital property.in,property belonging to a closely held corporation was destroyed in a fire and an officer and shareholder,along with an and,were convicted of arson.the corporation sued the insurer to recover policy benefits.the trial court entered judgment in favor of the insurer based on the corporation being the alter ego of the two arsonists.on appeal,the corporation pointed out that the shareholder arsonist owned only percent of the shares.the other percent were owned by his and the other arsonist as their separate property.the two women were officers and at least one of them took an active,role in the operation of the corporation business.neither had any role in the arson.finding no dispositive california law on the issue of whether a corporation could recover from its insurer under these circumstances,the appellate court conducted a lengthy review of the law in other jurisdictions and concluded there could be no rule from the cases decided in the other jurisdictions,the following basic rule may be deduced the arsonist status as an officer,stockholder,employee or agent of an insured corporation does not necessarily preclude the corporation from recovering upon the policy of insurance.the basic function of the court is to see that no one takes advantage of his own wrong an analysis must be made in each case to see if the arsonist will benefit by the recovery on the policy,either directly or indirectly.enterprises,fire ins,supra,d at.the court reversed the defense judgment and remanded the matter for findings on various factual matters such as whether the arsonist shareholder was in dominant control of the corporation,whether the cash used to set up the corporation came from separate property of the wives,whether the couples separated before or after the fire.id.at.
in its discussion of the relevant authority,the court summarized its understanding of the rules governing recoverability by an innocent in other types of situations and relationships as follows mere family relationship of the arsonist which does not bestow a property right or other direct financial benefit in the proceeds of insurance does not bar a recovery.citations.but if the property insured is community property,an innocent wife can not recover if her husband wilfully burned the property.california ins.allen cir.even a divorce prior to the fire without a division of the community property does not alter this rule as to property presumptively community.bridges commercial standard ins.even an innocent joint tenant has been denied recovery where the fire is set by the other joint tenant.klemens badger mut.ins.enterprises,fire ins,supra,d at.
farmers contends that the above language represented an accurate statement of the law in california at the time and is still the law in california as it relates to who hold property jointly or as a community.but,as can be seen,the court in cited no california authority for the propositions set forth.appellants accurately point out that the statements constituted dicta since the issue in involved misfeasance by a corporate officer and shareholder and recovery for damage to corporate property.the statements concerning community property and joint tenancy merely represented a recitation of then recent authority in those areas from other jurisdictions.
our research indicates that the trend noted in has been reversed and currently favors permitting recovery by the innocent insured party up to his or her percentage share of the value of the property unless the policy contains language which clearly excludes this possibility.of the three cases cited by the court in,all have been overruled explicitly or implicitly by the highest courts in the relevant jurisdictions.klemens badger mutual ins,supra,was explicitly overruled by the wisconsin supreme court in hedtcke sentry ins.the issue in hedtcke was whether an innocent wife could recover under a fire insurance policy if her husband,a named insured,intentionally caused the fire.citing klemens and other similar cases,the insurance company argued she could not recover because the property was jointly owned and jointly insured,although the couple was separated and in the process of divorce at the time of the fire.comparing earlier wisconsin decisions with more modern decisions from other jurisdictions such as michigan illinois and new york the court concluded that imputing the incendiary actions of an insured to the innocent insured and creating an absolute bar to recovery by the innocent insured,produces inequitable results hedtcke,supra,at,whereas the modern rule adopted by courts in other jurisdictions permitting recovery by innocent insureds preserves the essence of the legal principles recognized in the contrary wisconsin cases and produces an equitable result id.at.
the court in hedtcke noted that klemens and other similar cases were based on the principle of fortuitousness,that is,that insurance covers fortuitous losses and that losses are not fortuitous if the damage is intentionally caused by the insured.hedtcke sentry ins,supra,at.courts adopting the modern rule,on the other hand,focus on the contract of insurance rather than the interests and obligations arising from the nature of the property ownership.in klemens this court concluded without analysis that if there are several insureds,the joint nature of the insurance contract gives rise to joint interests and obligations on the part of each policyholder.the courts following the modern rule discard this conclusory maxim and turn instead to the language of the policy to determine whether the rights of the insureds are joint or several.hedtcke,at,fn.omitted.the wisconsin supreme court cited an indiana case which noted that the legal fiction of the entireties estate in real estate is designed for the protection of the spouses and the marriage and found it a perversion of this legal fiction to use it to destroy the property rights of an innocent spouse.id.at,fn,quoting american economy ins.liggett.it also relied on a new hampshire case which justified its conclusion by noting that one who owns an undivided interest in property may insure his or her interest under a separate insurance policy or under a joint policy with the other and that arson perpetrated by one owner would not influence the right of the innocent owner to recover under his or her own separate policy hedtcke,at,citing hoyt new hampshire fire ins.
the court in hedtcke was persuaded that nothing in the language of the policy before it precluded treating the two insureds as if they had separately insured their respective interests in the property even though the property was jointly held as a single unit.the policy contained a standard provision absolving the insurer of liability for damage if it was caused,directly or indirectly,by neglect of the insured to use all reasonable means to save and preserve the property at and after a loss or if the hazard is increased by any means within the control or knowledge of the insured.hedtcke sentry ins,supra,at,fns.omitted.this language did not make clear whether the obligations of the insured are joint or several.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded the language was ambiguous and interpreted the policy as not barring an innocent insured from recovering under the policy merely by virtue of the fact that another insured intentionally caused the damage to the insured property.ibid.
the other two cases cited in ins.allen,supra,and bridges commercial standard ins,supra,decided under texas law.in,in kulubis texas farm bureau underwriters,the texas supreme court overruled jones fidelity guaranty ins,the case which formed the basis for the two texas cases cited.kulubis involved a woman who had filed for divorce and whose mobile home and personal property,jointly owned with her husband,were lost when her husband spitefully set fire to the home,destroying it and all its contents.kulubis asked the texas supreme court to reconsider jones and its progeny,and the court agreed to do so.as the court explained the jones decision was based upon a holding that under an insurance policy covering jointly owned property acquire joint rights and obligations under the policy.therefore,the illegal acts of one of the prevent recovery by the other.at the time this court adopted the jones rule it was the traditional rule in the united states in,the new hampshire supreme court first permitted recovery by a in betty kulubis position.hoyt new hampshire fire insurance.that court reasoned that the proper test to be applied was what a reasonable person would have understood the fire insurance policy to mean.the court then held that an innocent victim of a illegal act in destroying the jointly owned property would reasonably expect to be covered by the policy.between and,sixteen other states adopted the test set out in hoyt.we note that of the four jurisdictions relied on in jones,two of them have adopted the test in hoyt,and a third,pennsylvania,has questioned the rule.kulubis texas farm bureau underwriters,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the texas court looked at the policies behind the different approaches.the basis for the traditional rule was that fraudulent losses are generally excepted from coverage of fire insurance contacts upon the ground of public policy and morals.citation.put another way,public policy dictates that a wrongdoer should not benefit from his wrongdoing.kulubis texas farm bureau underwriters,supra,at.the policy behind the modern trend requires that an innocent be permitted to recover based upon the insured reasonable expectations.ibid.the modern rule benefits the public good by not punishing the innocent victim for the wrongs of another and prevent ing unjust enrichment by the insurance company ibid.after consideration of the competing policies,the court held that the more enlightened reasoning dictates that the illegal destruction of jointly owned property by one shall not bar recovery under an insurance policy by an innocent.ibid.
because the kulubis property was not community property,the court left for another day the problem of how to compensate the innocent spouse and yet not permit benefit to the wrongdoing spouse where the damage occurred to community property.kulubis texas farm bureau underwriters,supra,at.that day came in,in texas farmers ins.murphy.the factual situation in murphy was similar to the situation in kulubis murphy set fire to the house owned by him and his wife,burning it and all its contents.murphy was found to be innocent of prior knowledge or complicity.the significant differences were that the destroyed property was held as community property,and no petition for divorce had been filed until after the lawsuit against the insurer was instituted.the court recognized that a rule permitting the innocent spouse to recover as long as there was a divorce proceeding going forward or a partition agreement in effect would make sense,but was troubled by the prospect that this could encourage married couples to divorce.murphy,at.equally troubling was the prospect that such actions would be undertaken in bad faith where the couple planned to get back together after recouping their losses.ibid.
in the end,the court concluded that a rule conditioning an innocent spouse recovery on partition or divorce is neither practical nor satisfactory it is not the courts business to superintend what innocent may do with any insurance proceeds they are contractually entitled to recover.nor,under these circumstances,is it the courts province to regulate an innocent spouse marital relationship with the culpable spouse.the preferable rule is to allow innocent spouses to recover according to their contracts,regardless of partition or divorce.we reaffirm our longstanding public policy preventing an arsonist from benefitting from fraud by denying recovery of his or her own interest in the claim against the insurer.we conclude,however,that such public policy does not overcome an innocent spouse contractual right to recover her or his interest in the policy benefits.texas farmers ins.murphy,supra,at.
our research indicates that nearly every court which has looked at this issue in recent years has agreed with the texas and wisconsin supreme courts that the manner in which the property is held should have no significance and that,instead,the language of the policy is determinative of whether the innocent spouse will be allowed recovery.see,atlas assur.of america mistic alaska,following rule that allows an innocent or divorced spouse to recover even though the spouse is at fault under the reasoning that policy language excluding coverage must be explicit that what is in question is the spouse intere
