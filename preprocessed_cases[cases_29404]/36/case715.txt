a father appeals from a california court order finding illinois to be a more convenient forum to resolve certain child custody issues father contends the trial court made the order without providing the parties an opportunity to present evidence as required under family code section we hold that before a court determines that california is an inconvenient forum to resolve custody issues,the court must provide the parties with an opportunity to present evidence on the issue.due to the lack of evidence in this case,we can not presume the trial court considered and applied the statutory factors set forth in section.therefore,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
appellant barry vincent brewer,and kymar carter have a son,born in april,who shares brewer name.they lived together as a family in los angeles.in june,carter took their month old son to chicago,illinois,to visit carter family.when she did not return,brewer filed a petition in pro.per.on august,to establish a parental relationship,seeking joint custody and visitation.brewer requested and received a waiver of court fees based on his financial condition.
carter attempted to file responsive documents,but the paperwork was rejected due to a filing fee error.on september,brewer requested entry of carter default.his request was initially rejected for failure to complete the proof of service properly.
on december,having resided in illinois for six months,carter filed a paternity action in illinois.she did not tell brewer about the action in illinois.she received erroneous legal advice that because there was an action pending in illinois,she did not need to respond in the california action.
carter default was ultimately entered in the california proceeding and a default hearing scheduled for june.on the day of the hearing,carter filed a motion to have her default set aside based on mistake and excusable neglect specifically,her attempt to file responsive documents and the erroneous legal advice about the effect of the illinois action.she also served brewer with the illinois action.the court noted at the hearing that carter had filed a motion to set aside her default and there was a paternity action pending in illinois involving the same parties.the court continued the hearing to august.
carter filed a response to brewer petition to establish a parental relationship.she acknowledged the child was conceived in california and declared she currently lives in illinois.she declared there was a case pending in illinois.carter sought sole custody of the child with reasonable visitation rights.she provided the same address on her pleadings that brewer had used for her.
carter informed the trial court that she could not afford the cost of the telephone service to appear at the hearing on august.at the hearing,the court found carter had established grounds for relief from default.the court had spoken by telephone with the illinois court where carter family law case had been filed.the california court found that california was not the child home state when brewer filed his petition,because the child had not lived in california for six continuous months immediately prior to the filing date.the court also found that illinois was the child home state when carter filed her action in illinois,and therefore,the custody determination should be made in illinois.the court continued the hearing to october,to allow carter to file a response to the petition and to discuss the matter further with the illinois court.the california court spoke with the illinois court later that day,and the illinois court agreed that illinois should exercise jurisdiction.
on august,brewer filed a motion for reconsideration in the california proceedings.a hearing was held on october.the california court denied the motion for reconsideration,because it was not based on new law or facts.however,the court provided a different analysis for its conclusions.the court acknowledged that california had acquired jurisdiction to determine the custody matter prior to illinois.however,the court declined to exercise jurisdiction under section and stayed any further action in light of the pending proceedings in illinois.the court noted it was likely that relevant information about the child was located in illinois where the mother lived,including information from medical providers and so forth.the court concluded the illinois court was in a better position to determine the best interests of the child.
brewer filed a timely notice of appeal from the order under section and code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.we note the most recent documents sent to carter by this appellate court have been returned with the notation that she moved without providing a forwarding address.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court ruling to stay custody proceedings on the basis that another forum is more convenient is purely discretionary,and we will not reverse the ruling on appeal unless there was a clear abuse of discretion.in re marriage of nurie th,d nurie.the trial court exercise of discretion will be upheld as long as it reflects reasoned judgment and follows correct legal principles and policies.ibid.
general principles governing jurisdiction 
in california,subject matter jurisdiction in custody cases is determined under section of the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea et.nurie,supra,th at,d.subject matter jurisdiction either exists or does not exist at the time an action is commenced.citation.there is no provision in the uccjea for jurisdiction by reason of the presence of the parties or by stipulation,consent,waiver,or estoppel.citations.id.at,d.
under the uccjea,a california court has jurisdictional priority to issue an initial child custody determination if california was the child home state when the proceeding was commenced,or california was the child home state within six months of the commencement of the proceeding and although the child is absent from the state,a parent continues to live in california,subd.a see nurie,supra,th at,d.
home state means the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.in the case of a child less than six months of age,the term means the state in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned.a period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period,subd.g.
in this case,when brewer filed his custody petition in california,california clearly had jurisdiction over custody proceedings pursuant to section,subdivision a.california was the child home state within six months of the commencement of the proceeding and although the child was absent from the state,brewer continued to live in california.at the time of the filing,brewer son had been out of california for no more than days.compare in re marriage of torres th,d under the former provisions of the uccja,california was the home state of a child absent from the state for days.
the conclusion would be the same under illinois law.illinois has adopted the same provisions of the uccjea governing subject matter jurisdiction.see people hollis in re.the committee comments to section of the uccjea state that its purposes are to avoid interstate jurisdictional competition and conflict in child custody matters,promote interstate cooperation to render a custody decree in the state which can best decide the matter in the interest of the child,discourage use of the interstate system to continue custody controversies,deter abductions of children,avoid relitigation of another state custody decisions,and facilitate enforcement of other state custody decrees.west law ann.uccjea.
when carter filed a competing action in illinois,the uccjea required the illinois court to decline jurisdiction,because at the time of the filing,a proceeding concerning the custody of the child had been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with the uccjea,and that proceeding had not been terminated or stayed based on
