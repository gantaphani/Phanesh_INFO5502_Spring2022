opinion of the court 
pro se appellant emmanuel lazaridis filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware raising various constitutional and statutory claims relating to child custody proceedings and the registration of foreign custody orders in the state of delaware against his,her attorneys,and the delaware attorney general.lazaridis now appeals from the district court october,and january,orders dismissing his complaint and denying his motion for reconsideration.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court orders.
background 
at issue in this appeal is the custody of,lazaridis and defendant wehmer daughter in june,a french court granted wehmer and lazaridis joint custody of but ordered that the child primary residence be with wehmer.wehmer thereafter sought to register the french custody order in delaware family court pursuant to the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,as adopted by the state of delaware see.ann.a.as permitted by delaware law,lazaridis challenged the registration of the order.see.ann.d.in march,the family court held a hearing at which lazaridis attorney argued that delaware lacked jurisdiction to enforce or to register the french order.although the family court ordered briefing on whether there were any valid grounds for challenging the registration,it ultimately denied lazaridis motion.
lazaridis appealed to the delaware supreme court,claiming,among other things,that the uccjea violates the delaware constitution the uccjea,as applied,violated his right to due process and the family court abused its discretion by ordering the registration of the french order.in june,the delaware supreme court affirmed the family court order and declined to consider lazaridis constitutional claims because he had not raised them before the family court.see letsos warren.
in august,lazaridis filed a motion in family court seeking relief from the registration and enforcement of the french custody order on the basis that greece was exercising jurisdiction over.he claims that the family court never ruled on this motion.
meanwhile,in august,a french court issued another custody order giving wehmer the right to exclusively exercise parental authority over.in october,wehmer requested that the family court register the order,and on december,lazaridis filed a motion challenging the registration of that order.
on december,lazaridis filed the instant complaint against wehmer,her attorneys,and the delaware attorney general.lazaridis set forth the following three claims the uccjea and uniform interstate family and support act uifsa violated the due process rights guaranteed by the delaware constitution and the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,both generally and as applied to him fundamental rights were violated because the delaware courts applied the uifsa and uccjea rather than greek law,which includes the united nations convention on the rights of the child and wehmer and her attorneys conspired to violate lazaridis and rights under.lazaridis asked the district court to enjoin the delaware courts from enforcing current or future foreign orders registered in delaware family court under the uccjea or uifsa.he also sought to enjoin the defendants from registering or enforcing french orders in delaware courts.finally,lazaridis requested monetary damages pursuant to the claim.
on january,a greek court issued a custody order granting temporary custody of to lazaridis.that order was continued on april.and on july,the delaware family court vacated the registration of the french order,citing the january greek order.
in august,lazaridis filed a motion to reopen in family court seeking to vacate the registration of the french order.the family court,on november,issued a decision denying his request based on the doctrine of res judicata,no,wl.
before the family court issued its november decision,the district court sua sponte dismissed lazaridis complaint under e b based on its determination that lazaridis was barred from filing suit under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.see ortega rodriguez united states,d degen united states,d.on appeal,we vacated the district court order after finding that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine did not apply to lazaridis.
on remand,the district court sua sponte dismissed lazaridis complaint under the following rationales the lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the rooker feldman doctrine,or alternatively by reason of res judicata and collateral estoppel claim no.french order the younger abstention doctrine claim no.french order as frivolous claim and and for failure to state a claim under e b claim and.the district court denied lazaridis outstanding motions for service and for renewed consideration of prior motions as moot.lazaridis subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied on january.
lazaridis timely appealed.our jurisdiction rests on.
ii.analysis 
denial of the motion to reconsider 
lazaridis first appeals from the district court denial of his rule motion.in this case,the appropriate standard of review is for an abuse of discretion.see federal kemper ins.rauscher,cir.
the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.max seafood caf√© quinteros,cir.a proper rule e motion therefore must rely on one of three grounds an intervening change in controlling law the availability of new evidence or the need to correct clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.river ins.cigna reinsurance,cir.lazaridis motion advanced the same arguments that were in his complaint and motions.because this is not a proper basis for reconsideration,the district court appropriately denied the motion.
dismissal of the complaint 
we also have jurisdiction to review the district court october,order dismissing lazaridis complaint because his timely rule e motion tolled the time to file a notice of appeal.see fed.a a iv rauscher,at internal quotation and citation omitted.our standard of review is plenary.see allah seiverling,cir stating standard of review for dismissal under e gwynedd properties,lower gwynedd,cir stating standard of review over legal determination as to whether younger abstention requirements are met turner crawford square apartments iii,cir stating standard of review for dismissal under rooker feldman doctrine.we may,however,affirm the district court judgment on any basis found in the record.see erie telecomms.city of erie,cir.
lazaridis first sets forth constitutional challenges to the registration and enforcement of the and french custody orders.the district court applied the younger abstention doctrine to lazaridis challenges to the registration and enforcement of the french order only.we conclude,however,that younger requires the dismissal of lazaridis first claim in its entirety.see younger harris,
in certain circumstances,district courts must abstain from exercising jurisdiction over a particular claim where resolution of that claim in federal court would offend principles of comity by interfering with an ongoing state proceeding.see middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.however,such abstention is appropriate only when the following three requirements are satisfied there are ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature the state proceedings implicate important state interests and the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise the federal claims.addiction specialists,twp.of hampton,cir.lazaridis first claim satisfies each of these requirements.
the state court actions regarding the registration of the french orders were pending when lazaridis filed his federal court complaint on december,satisfying the test first prong.in august,lazaridis filed a motion with the delaware family court seeking relief from the registration of the order,and on december,he filed a motion challenging the registration of the order.
it is also clear that the delaware state courts presented an adequate forum in which lazaridis could pursue his claims regarding the constitutionality of delaware stat
