we consider whether a public interest organization is entitled to intervene in a suit challenging the constitutionality of proposition,a state ballot initiative restricting the definition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman under california law.the campaign for california families the campaign seeks to intervene in part because it alleges that the official proponents of and to the not adequately represent all the campaign interests in the litigation.the reality is that the campaign and those advocating the constitutionality of have identical is,to uphold.any differences are rooted in style and degree,not the ultimate bottom line.divergence of tactics and litigation strategy is not tantamount to divergence over the ultimate objective of the suit.because the existing parties will adequately represent the campaign interests,we affirm the district court denial of intervention as of right.we also dismiss the appeal in part because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying permissive intervention.
background 
on november,voters approved,a state ballot initiative that amended the california constitution to provide that o nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.cal.const.art.i.on may,kristen perry and several gay and lesbian residents of california who wish to marry together,perry filed suit seeking a declaration that and any other california law that bars marriage are unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution,and an injunction preventing the state from enforcing and any other similar california law.the defendant governor,state administrative officers,and county clerks declined to take any position on the constitutionality of.the defendant california attorney general responded that he agreed that was unconstitutional.the district court granted an unopposed motion to intervene by the official proponents of and ballot committee under california law together,the proponents so that they could defend the constitutionality of.
the campaign unsuccessfully moved to intervene as a defendant as well the district court denied the campaign motion to intervene as of right because the campaign failed to show that it had a significantly protectable interest in the subject matter of the litigation,that the disposition of the action might practically impair or impede its ability to protect its interest,or that its interest was not adequately represented by the existing parties to the action.the campaign motion for permissive intervention failed for similar reasons.finally,the district court noted that the campaign could seek leave to file amicus briefs on specific legal issues that it believe s require elaboration or explication that the parties fail to provide.
intervention as of right 
we have jurisdiction to review the denial of intervention as of right as a final decision under.league of united latin am.citizens wilson lulac,cir.we review such decisions de novo.prete bradbury,cir.an applicant for intervention as of right must satisfy four criteria under federal rule of civil procedure a 
the applicant must timely move to intervene the applicant must have a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the applicant must be situated such that the disposition of the action may impair or impede the party ability to protect that interest and the applicant interest must not be adequately represented by existing parties.

ii.adequacy of representation 
the most important factor to determine whether a proposed intervenor is adequately represented by a present party to the action is how the intervenor interest compares with the interests of existing parties.arakaki,at citations omitted.where the party and the proposed intervenor share the same ultimate objective,a presumption of adequacy of representation applies,and the intervenor can rebut that presumption only with a compelling showing to the contrary.id.citing lulac,at.
a.the campaign and the proponents share the same ultimate objective in the suit 
despite the campaign quibble over fine details,even interpret ing the requirements broadly in favor of intervention,donnelly,at citation omitted,it is apparent to us that the ultimate objective of the campaign and the proponents is the constitutionality of and the principle that the traditional definition of marriage is the union of a man and a woman.in an effort to sidestep this unity of interest,the campaign argues that it bears an interest beyond defending the constitutionality of namely,the constitutionality of defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman,which goes beyond merely the language of proposition.this is so,according to the campaign,because perry suit does not implicate the validity of alone,but rather any california law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman,including numerous statutes and other legislative enactments that refer to marriage,including measures that the campaign sponsored,helped to enact,and worked to preserve.the campaign only example of such a measure is proposition,codified as cal.fam.code,which provided that o nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california and was invalidated by the california supreme court in in re marriage cases,cal th,d.the campaign also cites its lawsuits against california,which granted marriage rights to couples,and against san francisco mayor gavin newsom when he attempted to issue marriage licenses to couples,as well as its work in defense of as evidence of the campaign broader interest in defending the definition of marriage in california.
when pressed at oral argument to put some meat on the bare bones of the claim that its interest is broader than that of the proponents,the campaign was unable to do so.taken together,the campaign statements simply circle back to.indeed,the only measure outside of cited by the campaign,proposition,is verbatim identical to.we agree with the district court that the campaign failed to explain how proposition,if upheld as constitutional,would fail to assure this claimed broader interest in defining marriage as only an union.
as the district court aptly held,the campaign interest in defending the definition of marriage under california law is not meaningfully distinct from the proponents interest in defending the constitutionality of.rather,whether california may constitutionally define marriage as the union of a man and a woman will be wholly determined by the ultimate ruling on the constitutionality of,because any california law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman would be invalidated if were found to be unconstitutional,and affirmed if were held to be constitutional.given the identity of interests,the presumption of adequate representation applies 
b.the campaign has failed to rebut the presumption of adequate representation 
because the proponents and the campaign interests are essentially identical,the campaign may only defeat the presumption of adequate representation with a compelling showing to the contrary.arakaki,at see also prete,at holding that a public interest organization seeking intervention to defend a state constitutional ballot initiative failed to defeat the presumption of adequate representation when the ultimate objective of both the organization and the defendant party was to uphold the measure validity.we assess the campaign rebuttal argument in terms of the three arakaki factors 
whether the interest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly make all of a proposed intervenor arguments whether the present party
