in this tort action against the county of los angeles,the minor plaintiff alleged that he was molested by another child for several years while living in a foster home,and that his foster parent saw the alleged molestation but failed to stop it.the trial court sustained the county demurrer without leave to amend due to the minor plaintiff failure to file a claim within six months of the accrual of his cause of action,as measured from the date the alleged molestation ended.
plaintiff has appealed from the order of dismissal,contending his claim was timely filed within six months of the accrual of his cause of action,as measured from the date of his mother discovery of the alleged molestation.according to the complaint,plaintiff mother did not discover the molestation until plaintiff was questioned about having molested his sister.
we reject the county contention that under john oakland unified school dist.cal d,john,plaintiff cause of action accrued,as a matter of law,on the date of the alleged molestation.in our view,while the supreme court in john refrained from applying the theory of accrual to the facts of that case,john ultimately expressed no rule and imposed no prohibition against equitably applying the theory of accrual in an appropriate child sexual molestation case.in particular,john said nothing about whether the theory applies to a much younger plaintiff who was living in foster care when the alleged abuse occurred,and whose foster parent saw the abuse but did nothing to stop it.
we reverse the order of dismissal and direct the trial court to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend.we hold that plaintiff must be given leave to amend to allege,if he is able to do so his youth,ignorance,and inexperience,as well as his foster parent alleged complicity in the he lacked a real awareness,until his mother discovery of the alleged molestation,that what happened to him between the ages of five and eight was wrong.such truthful allegations would be sufficient,in our view,to invoke the equitable delayed discovery rule of accrual,under which plaintiff claim would be deemed timely for pleading purposes.
background 
defendant county of los angeles successfully demurred to a tort complaint which alleged that plaintiff curtis,a minor,was sexually molested by another child between march,and february,while living in a foster home operated under the auspices of the county.the foster parent allegedly saw the other child molesting plaintiff but failed to take any appropriate steps to protect plaintiff or otherwise to prevent further molestation.
the trial court sustained the county demurrer without leave to amend due to plaintiff failure to file a timely claim as required by the california tort claims act,et hereinafter,the act.government code section requires that personal injury claims be filed not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.
the sole theory of accrual under which plaintiff claim would be judged to be timely is the delayed discovery theory of accrual.if that theory applies to this case,then the act claims filing period did not start until plaintiff mother had knowledge of the alleged molestation.plaintiff contends his claim was timely filed on march,which was within six months of his mother discovery of the alleged molestation on september.
the county responds that plaintiff claim was not timely because his cause of action accrued,at the latest,in february,when the alleged abuse ended.
believing the allegation of abuse while in foster care to be a significant factor in determining whether the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend,we requested supplemental briefing.two points were critical in our request for briefing county of los angeles superior court th,d county of los angeles,and recent amendments to government code section.
in county of los angeles,the minor plaintiffs allegedly sustained personal injuries from physical and psychological abuse while in foster care between and.division three of this appellate district held that the minors application,which was filed in,was timely because the period within which to file a application excludes the time during which the claimant does not have a guardian or conservator of his or her person,subd.c.division three found the application was timely filed because until the minors had a parent or guardian legally able to represent their interests,the period was tolled.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d therefore,the time within which minors had to present their application to file a late claim did not begin to run until they had a parent or guardian legally able to represent their interests that did not occur until january,when the dependency case terminated.
in october,the legislature amended government code section by adding former subdivision d renumbered as subdivision c in,which excluded,from the period for applications,the time during which the minor is a dependent child,if both of the following conditions exist a the person is in the custody and control of an agency of the public entity to which a claim is to be presented.b the public entity or its agency having custody and control of the minor is required by statute or other law to make a report of injury,abuse,or neglect to either the juvenile court or the minor attorney,and that entity or its agency fails to make this report within the time required by the statute or other enactment,with this time period to commence on the date on which the public entity or its agency becomes aware of the injury,neglect,or abuse.in circumstances where the public entity or its agency makes a late report,the claim period shall be tolled for the period of the delay caused by the failure to make a timely report,subd.c a,b.
in this case,given the complaint failure to state if or when plaintiff dependency case was terminated,we requested additional briefing to determine whether county of los angeles and the recent amendments to government code section were potentially applicable to this case.
the county supplemental brief included a request to take judicial notice,which we granted,of juvenile court records showing that plaintiff dependency case was terminated on october.this new information allowed us to reach the following conclusions 
under county of los angeles,in the absence of a delayed accrual,plaintiff had only one year from the termination of his dependency case on october,in which to file an application for leave to file a late claim.county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.given plaintiff failure to comply with this deadline,we distinguish county of los angeles,which is of no assistance to plaintiff.
similarly,the amendment to government code section,which added the tolling provisions presently numbered as subdivision c,is of no assistance to plaintiff because as of october,he was no longer in the custody and control of an agency of the public entity to which a claim is to be presented,subd.c a.
we therefore are left with the issues as they were originally framed by plaintiff in his opening brief was the accrual of his cause of action delayed until either his mother discovered the alleged molestation on september,citing whitfield roth cal d,whitfield accrual of a minor medical malpractice claim is delayed until the minor parent discovers or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the child injury and its negligent cause,or his mother was appointed as his guardian ad litem in this litigation on june,
allegations procedural history 
plaintiff was born in july.on a date not stated in the complaint,a dependency proceeding was initiated under welfare and institutions code section and plaintiff was placed through the los angeles county children protective services into the foster home run by defendant charlie daniels daniels operated the foster home under the auspices of the county.during the period sometime between march and february when plaintiff was between five and eight years old,plaintiff was allegedly sexually molested by another child,horatio,who also lived in the foster home.d efendant daniels in fact walked in and saw horatio molesting plaintiff but failed to take any appropriate steps to protect plaintiff or otherwise to prevent further molestation.
on october,plaintiff dependency case was terminated and his mother regained custody over him.
on march,plaintiff,who was then,filed a claim with the county for sexual molestation occurring between march,and february,in the foster home.the claim indicated that the molestation was discovered by plaintiff mother on september.the county denied plaintiff claim as untimely on march.plaintiff did not seek leave to file a late claim.
on june,plaintiff,by and through his mother and guardian ad litem olga,filed the present complaint for damages against the county,daniels,and the foster family home and small family home insurance fund the complaint alleged the claim was timely because it was in fact filed within six month s of the date of the discovery by plaintiff parent.plaintiff mother allegedly discovered the abuse on september,when plaintiff was questioned regarding allegations of having molested his sister.at that time,the information regarding the prior molestation was revealed.in support of the delayed discovery rule of accrual,plaintiff cited whitfield,supra,cal d at page,which held that accrual of a minor cause of action for medical malpractice is delayed until the parent discovers,or through the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered the injury and its negligent cause.
the county demurred to the complaint,contending that plaintiff action was barred due to his failure to file a timely claim or obtain leave to file a late claim.the county contended whitfield theory of accrual for minors medical malpractice claims was superceded by code of civil procedure section,which shortened the limitations statute for medical malpractice claims by minors without providing them with the same delayed discovery rule that adults were given.the county argued that the accrual of a minor claim for molestation begins on the date of molestation.ortega pajaro valley unified school district th,d.there is no delayed discovery rule with respect to such government claims.therefore,plaintiff had until,at the latest,august to file his claim pursuant to government code section,and until february,at the latest,to file a late claim application pursuant to government code section.plaintiff concedes he never filed a late claim application,and that his claim was only filed on march,over four years after the latest molestation.since plaintiff did not file a late claim application within one year of accrual of his cause of action,it would be a futile act to allow plaintiff to seek relief from government code section,since he can not cure this failure.a late claim application is a prerequisite to obtaining relief from government code section.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered an order of dismissal.this appeal followed.

governmental immunity 
the starting point of our analysis is that governmental entities are immune from being sued unless the legislature has specifically provided otherwise.the act sets forth the limited circumstances under which the state and other political subdivisions may be sued and the applicable procedural requirements.
the act claim filing requirement applies to minors and is based on the following principles that neither the state nor any of its political subdivisions may be sued in the absence of specific statutory permission that where a right of action against the state or any of its political subdivisions is created by statute,such right may be circumscribed by any conditions that the legislature may see fit to impose and that when the legislature enacts a mandatory provision requiring in general terms that all claims must be presented before any action may be brought thereon,compliance with such condition is an indispensable prerequisite to the bringing of any such action by any person,regardless of his age or his physical or mental condition.citation.artukovich astendorf cal d.
under the act,the county may only be sued for personal injury damages by a plaintiff whose timely claim was denied or deemed rejected by the county.
accrual under the tort claims act 
under the act,personal injury claims must be filed within six months of their accrual.government code section requires that personal injury claims be filed not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.
the act provides that the date of the accrual of a cause of action to which a claim relates is the date upon which the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of limitations which would be applicable thereto if there were no requirement that a claim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced thereon.
the california supreme court explained accrual under the act as follows a cause of action accrues for purposes of the filing requirements of the tort claims act on the same date a similar action against a nonpublic entity would be deemed to accrue for purposes of applying the relevant statute of limitations.for minors,however,the time of accrual is generally more significant in the context of the claims statute.with certain exceptions,the statute of limitations does not run during the time a potential plaintiff is a minor,and such a party accordingly has up to a year after attaining the age of majority to bring suit on a cause of action for personal injury.see code civ,subd.a.this respite does not apply to a claim against a public entity under the tort claims act,however code civ,subd.b,and government code section,subdivision b expressly provides that the time during which the person who sustained the alleged injury,damage,or loss is a minor shall be counted in determining whether a application was timely filed within one year of the accrual of the cause of action.john,supra,cal d at,fn,italics added.
c.the delayed discovery rule of accrual 
plaintiff contends his cause of action against the county did not accrue until his mother discovered the alleged molestation,citing the delayed discovery rule applicable to minors medical malpractice causes of action see whitfield,supra,cal d at.the county responds,among other things,that whitfield rule for minors medical malpractice claims has been superseded by statutory amendments to the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims code civ,and that john,supra,cal d at page,rejected the judicial application of the delayed discovery rule to minors child molestation claims.
before discussing whitfield and john,however,we note that the delayed discovery rule of accrual has been judicially applied to claims other than medical malpractice.the rule delaying accrual until the plaintiff has discovered or should have discovered the facts establishing the essential elements of his or her cause of action originated in cases of medical malpractice huysman kirsch cal d,and progressive occupational illness marsh industrial acc.com.cal,but california courts have since recognized its application to other tort actions.these have included attorney malpractice neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,liability for defective drugs jolly eli lilly cal d,invasion of privacy cain state farm mut.auto.ins.d,libel manguso oceanside unified school dist.d,and underground trespass oakes mccarthy d.the rule has been applied as well in certain cases arising from contract,such as breaches committed in secret and without immediately discoverable harm april enterprises,kttv d,negligent breach of contract to ship personal goods allred bekins wide world van services d,and negligent breach of contract to conduct termite inspection seelenfreund terminix of northern,d.evans eckelman d.evans.
in addition to the judicial application of the delayed discovery rule,the legislature has adopted the delayed discovery rule in certain statutes of limitations,such as for medical malpractice and legal malpractice while the medical malpractice statute of limitations code civ,provides a delayed discovery rule for adults but not minors,whose actions must be commenced within three years from the date of the alleged wrongful act except that actions by a minor under the full age of six years shall be commenced within three years or prior to his eighth birthday whichever provides a longer period,we held the statute failure to provide a delayed discovery rule for minors violated their right to equal protection by providing different rules of accrual for adults and minors.photias doerfler th,d see also torres county of los angeles d.accordingly,while the county assertion that the amendments to code of civil procedure section failed to provide a delayed discovery rule of accrual for minors medical malpractice claims is correct,the courts have read the rule into the statute on constitutional grounds.
the fact that the delayed discovery rule of accrual has been applied to minors medical malpractice claims does not necessarily mean,however,that it will be applied to all minors sexual molestation claims.in john,for example,the supreme court did not apply the delayed discovery rule of accrual to the facts of that case.john,supra,cal d at.
while there is no blanket rule for always or never applying the delayed discovery rule to minors molestation cases,we believe the courts may equitably apply the delayed discovery rule in appropriate child molestation cases.whitfield,the case on which plaintiff relies heavily,does not offer much,if any,guidance on when the courts should apply the delayed discovery rule in contexts other than medical malpractice.
whitfield correctly pointed out that in malpractice cases,the statute of limitations commences to run when the plaintiff discovers the injury and its negligent cause or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered it.wozniak peninsula hospital d.where the plaintiff is a minor,it is not the knowledge or lack thereof of the minor,but the knowledge or lack thereof of the minor parents which determines the time of accrual of the cause of action.id.at.whitfield,supra,cal d at,italics added.the last italicized sentence quoted from whitfield does not,in our view,create a blanket delayed discovery rule applicable to all causes of action where a minor is the plaintiff.
john,supra,cal d,upon which the county heavily relies,also is of little assistance because the supreme court declined to reach the question of whether to apply the delayed discovery rule to the facts of that case.the supreme court merely stated,our initial review of this issue raised a serious question in our minds whether the relevant authorities supported application of a theory of accrual on the facts of this case.id.at.john articulated no principles for applying or rejecting the delayed discovery rule of accrual in other child molestation cases.
other than to express its serious reservations about applying the delayed discovery rule to the facts before it,john gave no guidance about applying the rule in other situations.as one court put it the supreme court declined to reach the general question in john,supra,cal d,instead remanding for a determination of whether a teacher threat of retaliation had estopped the school district from asserting plaintiff had not filed a timely claim notice,at.one dissenting opinion suggested that delayed discovery should not be extended to molestation cases,at,conc.and dis.opn.of eagleson.evans,supra,d at.
the county nevertheless cites the supreme court refusal to apply the theory of accrual in john as authority for the proposition that government claims for sexual abuse of a minor accrue on the date of molestation.we do not read john so broadly,however.as noted in john,the issue of timeliness was simply the threshold question john,supra,cal d at,to the principal id.at,and more pressing question id.at,of whether the district may be held vicariously liable for the acts of its employee under the doctrine of respondeat superior.id.at.
apart from the recent amendments to government code section which tolled the period within which to file applications for injuries suffered by dependent children in certain situations that do not exist here,the legislature has adopted no legislation concerning the delayed discovery rule in the context of minors molestation cases.we know of no statute that either mandates or prohibits the application of the delayed discovery rule to a minor molestation claims,filed while he is still a minor,against a public entity.evans,supra,d at.as was pointed out in evans,in the original version of code of civil procedure section,which sets forth the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims brought by adult plaintiffs,former subdivision d provided nothing in this bill is intended to preclude the courts from applying delayed discovery exceptions to the accrual of a cause of action for sexual molestation of a minor.the legislature thus has disavowed any intent to interfere with the judicial determination of whether the delayed discovery rule should apply.evans,supra,d at.similar language can be found in the version of code of civil procedure section,former subdivision l nothing in the amendments specified in subdivision k shall be construed to preclude the courts from applying equitable exceptions to the running of the applicable statute of limitations,including exceptions relating to delayed discovery of injuries,with respect to actions commenced prior to january.
the present version of code of civil procedure section,which applies to adult plaintiffs,contains a partial delayed discovery rule a in an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse,the time for commencement of the action shall be within eight years of the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,whichever period expires later,for any of the following actions an action against any person for committing an act of childhood sexual abuse.an action for liability against any person or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff,where a wrongful or negligent act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.an action for liability against any person or entity where an intentional act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse which resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.b no action described in paragraph or of subdivision a may be commenced on or after the plaintiff birthday 
in this case,however,code of civil procedure section delayed discovery rule does not yet apply,if ever,because it is impossible for plaintiff,while still a minor,to contend that he only recently discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse.code civ,subd.a,italics added.
given that no statutory rule of delayed discovery applies to this case,we must decide whether the complaint has alleged sufficient facts to invoke the equitable doctrine of delayed discovery and,if not,whether the complaint may be amended to cure that defect.
the supreme court reluctance to apply the delayed discovery rule of accrual in john is not persuasive here given the critical factual diffe
