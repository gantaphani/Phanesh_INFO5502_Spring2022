the parties were married on december,separated within the household on july,and divorced on february.the husband and the wife,along with their three children,resided in the same household after their date of separation until november,when the husband was incarcerated 
the wife,years old at the time of the hearing,is in good health and,since june,has worked for the state of delaware insurance department,earning approximately per year her state retirement plan is valued at prior to her employment with the state of delaware,the wife worked for wesley preschool and bank of america,earning approximately per year.the wife premarital assets included a home,car,and a mutual fund 
the husband,years old at the time of the hearing,is in fair to poor health he has a bachelor degree in business administration and is close to earning his master degree.the husband is a former officer of the united states army,who retired on disability due to medical reasons in since retiring from the military,the husband had various jobs,including stints as a financial representative for independent research association ir and united services planning association uspa,first command.the husband also invested in real estate.the husband annual income attributed by the court was his premarital assets included in the pioneer three fund,in the pioneer two fund,in one fidelity destiny account,and in a second fidelity destiny account.in addition,the husband inherited from one aunt and from another aunt during the marriage.
for a good portion of the marriage,both the husband and the wife were parents.the husband was the breadwinner and did the majority of the cooking,shopping,and activities with the children,while wife shouldered most of the childcare responsibilities.after the separation,the husband paid for the wife life insurance and ira until approximately november in addition,he paid the mortgage,and for food,utilities,clothing and other costs while he was still living in the home.
the husband and the wife owned numerous real estate property investments,all but one of which were sold and the proceeds placed in an escrow account by the time of the november hearing these investments were funded by a loan from first command the first command debt and the husband inheritances.in april,the parties agreed that would be paid to the wife from the escrow account as combined alimony and child support.the payment was meant to cover the per month tuition payment for one of the children,as well as other household expenses.the wife income at this time was per year and increased to by may.
on march,in accordance with family court civil rule d,the parties submitted an ancillary stipulation,which was revised on november,subject to the stipulation,the wife waived alimony and the parties agreed to sell the remaining investment property in cape coral,florida.at this time,the husband did not raise the issues of interim alimony,the tax consequences of the sale of the cape coral property,the specific amount of his inherited funds,or that he could trace or account for his premarital assets.
an ancillary hearing was held on november.the court issued its decision on february,dividing the marital property to wife and to the husband the husband appeals,claiming the overall split of the marital estate should have been divided equally.
property division a 
in all property distribution cases,upon request of either party,the family court is required to determine how the marital property shall be apportioned or assigned to each spouse the party making the request has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the reasons why the marital property should be so awarded,to whom,and the value to be assigned after the necessary factual record has been made,the court must make findings as to the value of all marital property,including the identity and value of each significant item of property,and the nature of title thereto,including awarding property as titled if the party fails to meet the burden of proof in making its determination,the court must also consider and apply the relevant statutory factors as outlined in ann.tit,supported by the evidence,particularly when the grant of a request will result in a transfer of title to property from one spouse to another 
standard of review 
the husband contends that the family court erred by failing to consider properly all of the statutory factors set forth in ann.tit,a.as a result,the husband argues the division of marital property ordered by the court was inequitable,was not supported by the record,was an abuse of discretion,and was clearly erroneous.our standard and scope of review of an appeal from the family court extends to a review of the facts and law as well as to a review of the inferences and deductions made by the trial judge.
where the court decision implicates a ruling of law,we review the court determination de novo if the family court applied the law correctly,we review for an abuse of discretion we will not disturb the trial judge findings of fact where those inferences are supported by the record and are the product of an orderly and logical deductive process.we have repeatedly emphasized that the family court has broad discretion under section to divide marital property 
under ann.tit,a,in a proceeding for divorce or annulment,the family court shall,upon request of either party,equitably divide,distribute and assign the marital property between the parties without regard to marital misconduct,in such proportions as the court deems just after considering all relevant factors the statute then lists eleven factors that the court is to consider.when the family court awards marital property on a basis other than a split,the aggrieved party is entitled to have the decision supported by application of the section a factors 
section a tax consequences 
the husband argues that the family court did not properly evaluate section a because it failed to consider the tax consequences of its decision on the parties and the effect of those consequences on the valuation of the marital estate.in the rule d stipulation,the husband raised his concern that the parties would both incur substantial capital gains consequences,and his testimony at trial reflected similar concerns the husband asserts,on appeal,that the family court should have also considered the tax consequences of the sale of the cape coral property and satisfaction of the first command debt.this argument is without merit.
the family court decision expressly addressed the issue of the capital gains consequences raised in the stipulation and at trial.the trial judge found that t he parties each anticipate substantial capital gains from the sale of several marital properties,one consequence of which may be significant state and federal income taxes owed for tax years and.thus,the trial judge considered tax consequences to the extent that such issues were raised through the rule d stipulation and at trial.
the family court was not required,however,to consider tax consequences not raised in the stipulation and at trial in wildey wildey the family court found that the wife claim for a tax credit was not set forth in her d stipulation with sufficient specificity when she claimed merely that there was a dispute regarding the nature and extent of any reimbursement payment owed by one party to the other party.the family court found this was insufficient to put the husband on notice of her tax credit claim and rule
