factual and procedural summary 
thomas and susan married on april.before they separated on may,they had three children together anthony,born in thomas,born in and andrea,born in.
on december,an interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage was entered,awarding susan custody of the three children.among other things,the judgment provided thomas pay to susan the sum of per child per month for a total of per month,commencing forthwith and continuing until each of the children reach majority,becomes emancipated,or until further order of this court and that he pay her as and for her support and maint e nance the sum of per month commencing november,and continuing for a period of three years,or until susan remarries,whichever occurs first.because thomas was in arrears to susan for child support and spousal support under a previous temporary support order,the judgment also ordered him to pay susan such sum at the rate of or more per month,so that combined,thomas would pay the child support,spousal support,and arrearage,in the sum of per month to susan in two equal payments of on the first day and fifteenth day of each month,commencing november.
on february,after a hearing on susan order to show cause osc regarding contempt for alimony and thomas osc regarding modification of alimony,the court recognized the order for support and arrearages was valid found thomas in arrears for support in the total sum of,including in spousal support found him in contempt on consecutive counts but suspended imposition of sentence on the condition that commencing the month of march,thomas pay through the bureau of revenue and recovery of the county of san diego,the total sum of per month.
on november,after the court had considered documentary and oral evidence on county osc regarding contempt for support and wage assignment,the court rendered it modified findings and order re support in which it ordered that the existing order be modified as follows that thomas pay per child for a total sum of per month,effective august,payable by wage assignment,as and for support to the department of revenue and recovery,and continuing each month thereafter and until further order of this court.the order also provided as follows 
support obligation as used herein is that support obligation as referred to and defined in state and federal statutes and regulations.this support obligation is hereby found to be through may,and is the existing support obligation.that thomas shall repay said sum of at the rate of per month,effective august,payable by wage assignment,and continuing each month thereafter until said sum is paid in full or until further order of this court.in applying thomas support payments,the department of revenue and recovery is ordered to apply these payments on the said existing support obligation and the future continuing accruing support obligation as appears necessary under state and federal statutes and regulations.
the wage and earnings assignment order issued by the court in light of this order provided that a total of be deducted a month,with being applied to the current child support obligation and per month being applied toward support obligation,which was noted to be the sum of.
on december,county sent thomas employer notice that it was ordered to deduct per month as to the amount of in arrears.thomas received a letter dated october,from county in response to his request for an audit or payment record of his account,which indicated his balance was,which may not include interest.thomas received a letter from county dated october,advising him that after an audit to include interest on his account of child support debt he owed,which included in interest calculated at seven percent on balances accrued before,and ten percent on balances accrued after.copies of county audit were sent to thomas and his attorney.
on april,thomas filed an osc to set arrearages,complaining he had paid the arrearages as ordered under the order at the rate of per month and had never been advised interest would be accruing even though he had made all the payments.thomas attached copies of his own audit of payments on the arrears as of december,stating he owed in arrears at that time.county responded that interest accrued at the legal rate as each payment was due under the interlocutory judgment,that it had no responsibility to compute the interest for thomas,and that there could be no retroactive modification of arrears.the matter was continued several times to permit county to review the audits.
on october,thomas filed points and authorities,citing county of alameda weatherford th,d weatherford and section,subdivision b for his position the order on the existing support obligation or arrears was a money judgment payable in installments and interest commences to accrue as to each installment on the date the installment becomes due because the judgment did not otherwise provide for a different accrual of interest.thomas reply to the county response that interest was due as a matter of law on the accrued arrearages total from the time of each missed payment under the original support orders in this case and that weatherford was in direct contradiction to other authority on the issue of interest on support arrearages,reiterated his position the support obligation was an installment judgment that does not otherwise provide for interest to commence at some time other than when each installment is due.
at the hearing on the matter the court ruled the support obligation order was a money judgment payable in installments,or an installment judgment,under section,subdivision b,which in turn controlled how interest would be calculated in this case.in reaching this conclusion,the court made several observations.it first noted that contrary to county assertion otherwise,weatherford,supra,th,d was good law and could not be ignored by the court.it also noted county could have sought an increase in the low arrearage payment thomas was allowed to pay,which county argued was unfair,sometime before the year.
county has appealed from the court order finding the support obligation order was an installment judgment subject to interest calculated pursuant to section,subdivision b.
