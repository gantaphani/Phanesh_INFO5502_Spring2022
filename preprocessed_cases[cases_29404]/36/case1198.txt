daniel and shirley,paternal grandparents and de facto parents grandparents of shirley,appeal from the denial of their welfare and institutions code section petition seeking reinstatement of the child placement in their home or,alternatively,liberal visitation.all statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise specified.they contend the court abused its discretion when it found the san diego county health and human services agency the agency acted within its discretion in placing shirley in a nonrelative adoptive placement and limiting grandparents visitation.
we hold that the court findings and orders under section,including section petitions filed after the termination of parental rights,are appealable under section and writ procedures under section do not apply.in addition,we hold the court role in reviewing the agency action for abuse of discretion was not as limited as the trial court concluded.the trial court,in reviewing a child placement after parental rights are terminated,must assess the agency placement within the context of the child best interests.accordingly,we reverse the orders of the court and remand with directions.
factual and procedural background 
shirley was born in july.she was removed from parental custody after postnatal testing showed she was exposed to methamphetamine.her parents submitted to jurisdiction under section,subdivision b.in september,when shirley was six weeks old,she was placed with grandparents.
shirley parents did not participate in reunification services and,in june,the court terminated their parental rights.at that time,the social worker reported grandparents were shirley psychological parents and she was highly attached to them.in january,at the initial review,the social worker reported shirley was a happy baby who looked to grandparents for her basic needs as well as for unconditional love and attention.the social worker noted grandparents were more than cooperative and anticipated the adoption would be final within six months.
at the end of march,grandmother suspected her daughter,was using drugs and reported her to law enforcement.was detained by juvenile authorities and admitted using methamphetamine.grandmother promptly informed the social worker of the family crisis.
on april,the agency removed shirley in order to provide safety from substance abuse in the family.in addition to problems,the social worker believed the placement was no longer viable due to alcohol issues of paternal grandfather.in october,a social worker referred grandparents to alanon and alcoholics anonymous after learning grandfather drank from six to beers a day.
shirley was initially placed in foster care.the foster mother reported shirley was very unhappy the first days after removal.shirley was extremely happy to see grandparents and extremely upset when the supervised visits ended.
on may,shirley was removed from the foster home and placed in a prospective adoptive home.the agency granted grandparents supervised visitation at the discretion of the prospective adoptive parents,however,the visits were discontinued in order to allow shirley time to bond with the new family.grandparents visited shirley for one hour under the agency supervision at the end of june and again on her birthday in july.
on may,over the agency objection,the court granted grandparents application as de facto parents.on june,grandparents filed a section modification petition requesting shirley return to their care or,alternatively,liberal,unsupervised visitation.the hearing on the section petition was delayed to allow time for a bonding study.
in july,the prospective adoptive family informed the agency they were unable to adopt shirley.on august,shirley was moved to a new adoptive home.the social worker reported shirley experienced separation anxiety,which is recurrent excessive distress when separated from her major attachment figures.she recommended grandparents not visit shirley for at least two months to allow her time to attach and bond with the new family.
the section hearing was held on september and and november.the social worker testified the risk to shirley in grandparents home included grandfather alcohol use,his failure to follow through with an alcohol assessment,marital conflict,the presence of an aunt and her children in the home due to domestic violence,use of methamphetamine and grandparents failure to detect her drug use for several months.
grandparents presented evidence they had taken remedial measures to address family substance abuse and other issues.they denied any marital conflict.grandfather substance abuse assessment showed he was not alcohol dependent.was invested in her recovery and was substance free.ellen lacter,the psychologist conducting the bonding study,concluded shirley was significantly attached to her grandparents and would experience a psychologically damaging loss were very significant visitation not maintained.
in its remarks,the court noted both and grandfather had substance abuse issues and reasonable people could differ on what was in shirley best interests.although supporting the placement with grandparents could have been a very good thing because baby shirley was in that home for months,the court found the agency did not patently abuse its discretion when it determined there was not sufficient time to allow grandparents to remedy the problems in their home.the court stated it was irrelevant whether the court agreed or did not agree with the agency decisions.without determining whether grandparents showed changed circumstances,the court denied their section petition.
discussion 
grandparents contend the court erred in denying the section petition because they showed changed circumstances and that the requested placement or visitation was in shirley best interests.they maintain the agency abused its discretion in removing shirley from,or refusing to return her to,their care.minor counsel joins in grandparents briefs and further asserts the record shows the social worker was unable to remain objective and therefore did not make sound decisions concerning shirley best interests.
the agency argues the appeal should be dismissed as taken from an unappealable order under section.on the merits,the agency contends the question before the court was not what was best for the child,but rather whether the agency had clearly abused its discretion in making its adoptive placement.the agency maintains the court did not abuse its discretion when it found the agency did not make an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd determination in choosing shirley placements.
the agency argues the legislature in enacting section intended appellate review of a placement order to be made by petition for extraordinary writ.section provides that a order by the court that a dependent child is to reside in,be retained in,or be removed from a specific placement is not appealable at any time unless a petition for extraordinary writ was timely filed,substantively addressed the specific issues and was summarily denied or decided on the merits,subd.b a c.
the agency concedes section does not apply on its face to appellate review of a court determination the agency did not abuse its discretion in a placement decision or to a review of the court action in a section modification proceeding.the agency argues section should be interpreted to include such orders and asks us to ignore the clear but inartfully drawn language of the statute in favor of a judicial determination of legislative intent.we decline to rewrite the statute.ordinarily,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.citations.hughes bd.of architectural examiners cal th,d.a denial of a section petition is appealable under section.cal.rules of court,rule b see in re aaron th,d.
