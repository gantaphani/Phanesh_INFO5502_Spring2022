when an obligor under a child support order is delinquent in payment,family code section allows the obligee to file and serve a notice of delinquency and provides for a percent monthly penalty to accrue for up to months if the arrearages are not paid.section allows the obligor to request that penalties not be imposed if he or she files a timely motion after service of the notice of delinquency.
rosemary corbin challenges the trial court discretionary reduction of penalties imposed on her former husband,jaime de prieto,pursuant to sections and.corbin contends the trial court erred in granting de prieto relief from a penalty judgment under code of civil procedure section mandatory attorney fault provision finding a section motion was timely and reducing the penalty below the percent monthly statutory amount.we hold these rulings were not in error,and uphold the judgment reducing the penalty.
factual and procedural background 
after dissolution of their marriage,corbin obtained a court order which established child support arrearages of,plus interest and other items.the order included a wage assignment for ongoing child support.in november,corbin filed a section notice of delinquency for arrearages plus interest,and personally served it on de prieto on december.the notice warned that if the arrearages were not paid within days a penalty may be charged.de prieto counsel at the time richard prantil was not served with the notice of delinquency,and no action was taken at that time to respond to the notice.
during and,corbin pursued and obtained several child support modifications,as well as a writ of execution on the arrearages,but did not request the court to enter judgment on the penalty.according to attorney prantil,during his representation of de prieto from january to june corbin attorneys verbally communicated with him,served him pleadings,and sent him correspondence,but they never gave him any type of notification of the delinquency notice.
by letter dated may,de prieto attorney james scott received corbin attorney calculations of the amount owed for arrearages,plus his calculation of a penalty which had accrued in because of de prieto failure to pay the arrearages.
in may,attorney scott filed a motion to appoint a special master to calculate disputed arrearage amounts and to develop a payment schedule for the arrearages.at the july hearing,attorney scott raised the issue of the problem of the penalty requested by corbin,and urged the trial court to make findings as to the penalty after the special master reported on the disputed arrearage issues.in its oral and written rulings,the court stated attorney scott was not precluded from filing some sort of motion to get relief from the penalty,but orally opined it did not think it could make the requisite findings for relief from imposition of the penalty under section.the court also observed it might be difficult for de prieto to prevail,but noted the penalty was pretty stiff.concluding the parties were apart in their arrearage calculations corbin calculations were about and de prieto were about,the trial court appointed a special master,with the caveat that arrearages could not go below.
the special master utilized the arrearage amount which was not subject to challenge,and then calculated arrearages and accrued interest since that time,finding arrearages as of september,totaled.de prieto paid these arrearages shortly after the special master report.
in april,corbin filed a section motion for a judgment on the penalty.in may de prieto filed an opposition to the request for penalty judgment,asserting the may motion to set arrearages was a timely response to the notice of delinquency.at the june hearing on this and other motions,the trial court ordered entry of a penalty judgment under section.in doing so,the court found that although imposition of penalties is discretionary upon a proper motion for relief,de prieto failed to file a section motion to show cause why penalties should not be imposed.the court also found that even if de prieto may motion to establish arrearages could constitute a section motion for relief,it was not timely.at the hearing,the court noted the penalty was very,very harsh,draconian,and drastic,and it would impose a lesser penalty if it could,but it did not have the discretion to do so 
in august,de prieto filed a motion for relief from the penalty judgment under the mandatory attorney fault provision of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.in support of this motion,attorney scott declared his belief that filing opposition papers to corbin april motion for judgment on the penalty adequately complied with the section motion requirement.attorney scott explained that when he became aware of the notice of delinquency two years after its service,he filed the may motion to appoint a special master to set a firm number for the arrearages and to establish a monthly payment schedule on the arrearages.thereafter,de prieto was able to pay the arrearages in full.attorney scott then planned to show the court why no penalty would apply.when corbin filed her april motion for judgment on the penalty,attorney scott thought it prudent to formally oppose the motion,rather than file a second motion as to why the penalty should not be assessed.
the trial court concluded the circumstances of the entry of the penalty judgment resembled a default,and thus granted the request for mandatory relief from the penalty judgment.the court found that although the penalty was mentioned in declarations and correspondence during the litigation,it was never actually adjudicated.likewise,at the june hearing on the motion for penalty judgment,there was no litigation on the merits of de prieto request for relief from imposition of the penalty since no section motion had been brought.the cause of the failure to bring the section motion was attorney misfeasance,attorney scott mistakenly thought that filing an opposition to corbin motion for judgment on the penalties was equivalent to filing a section motion.the court ordered attorney scott to pay corbin counsel attorney fees and costs 
in october,de prieto filed a section motion requesting the penalties not be imposed.the trial court reduced the penalty from to,finding the october motion was filed in a timely fashion after the december service of the notice of delinquency the court earlier untimeliness finding as to the may motion to set arrearages was nonbinding dictum and even though de prieto conduct was an egregious instance of noncompliance,it would not be in the interests of justice to impose the entire penalty.
explaining these findings,the trial court orally stated it took into consideration that attorney scott did everything he could to get the case resolved de prieto went to the special master to get the arrearages established and then paid everything it would have been helpful if the notice of delinquency had been served on counsel and of the requested sanctions was reasonable.
corbin argues the trial court improperly granted relief from the june penalty judgment under code of civil procedure b mandatory provision for attorney fault,and abused its discretion by ruling the section motion requesting penalties not be imposed was timely and then reducing the penalty.first,in the published portion of this opinion,we will evaluate the section penalty statutory scheme and the trial court reduction of the penalty,and then,in the unpublished portion,we will address the court granting of code of civil procedure b relief from the first unreduced penalty judgment.
discussion 
statutory scheme 
corbin contends unless the obligor makes a timely section motion to show cause why penalties should not be imposed,the percent monthly penalty begins accruing days after service of the notice of delinquency,and thereafter imposition of the penalty by the court is merely a ministerial act the trial court abused its discretion in finding the section motion was timely and the trial court had no discretion to reduce the penalty but had to impose all of it.as we shall explain,we agree that under the statutory scheme the penalty is mandatory absent a timely motion r
