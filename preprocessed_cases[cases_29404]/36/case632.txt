appellant father is the biological father of child,who was six years old on may,the date of the challenged order.father appeals from the juvenile court order at the welfare and institutions code,section permanency planning hearing denying him supervised visitation with the child based on a finding of detriment.as discussed below,while substantial evidence does support the court finding of detriment,we wish to clarify that the court was not required to make such a finding because,as a mere biological father,father is not considered a parent for purposes of section,subdivision c c and thus is not presumptively entitled to visits during guardianship.
facts and procedure 
on july,the san bernardino county department of children and family services cfs filed a petition under section after the child mother struck him across the face with her hand and caused him to have two black eyes and bruises on the left side of his face.cfs also alleged the child mother had a substance abuse problem and was incarcerated.cfs alleged that father had allowed the child to be at risk in the mother care,and had an unstable and unsafe lifestyle,and that his whereabouts were unknown.
at the detention hearing held on july,mother told the juvenile court that father was homeless and she had not had contact with him in months.the social worker confirmed that she had spoken to the paternal grandmother,who confirmed that father was homeless in the chino area and that she would have him contact the social worker.the court ordered the child detained in foster care pending approval of and placement with the maternal grandparents.
jurisdiction and disposition 
at the jurisdiction and disposition hearing held on august,the juvenile court struck two of the allegations regarding father and found only that his unstable and unsafe lifestyle placed the child at substantial risk of abuse.the court declared father a biological father,but not a presumed father,and therefore not entitled to reunification services.counsel for father asked for supervised visits,but because father was a registered sex offender on parole,the court declined to order visits until father parole officer changed the conditions of his parole to allow him contact with his own minor children.the court offered reunification services for the child mother and ordered the child placed with the maternal grandparents.
review hearings 
at the review hearing held on february,the juvenile court continued the mother reunification services and authorized weekly visits between the child and his mother once mother was released from custody.
at the month review hearing held on august,the juvenile court continued the mother reunification services and authorized her supervised visits to be changed to unsupervised by approval packet.
at the combined month review hearing held on january,the juvenile court terminated the mother services but determined it would not be in the child best interest to consider terminating parental rights.the court limited the recommendation to guardianship or a planned permanent living arrangement.the court set the section hearing for may.
section petition 
on march,father filed a section petition to modify a court order.specifically,father asked the court to change the order it made at the august,jurisdiction and disposition hearing denying father reunification services because he was a mere biological father and denying visitation because of his parole conditions.father noted as the changed circumstances that he was paroled from prison on february and that his special conditions of parole had been changed to exclude his biological children from the ban on contact with minors.father stated the requested changes would be better for the child because it would allow him to have his biological father in his life.it will also allow us to build a bond.i feel this will be better for both of us because it will give us the chance to get to know each other and be a positive influence in each other lives.
cfs filed an addendum report in response,recommending the court deny the petition.the basis for this recommendation was that father had no relationship with the child since the child was an infant had not visited the child since the removal had made no efforts to participate in services independently had been in and out of custody since the dependency because of parole violations and since filing the section petition,father violated his parole and was incarcerated only one month after his february release because he had used methamphetamine and cut off his gps tracking device.
at the proceedings on the section petition held on april,the court concluded the petition had not stated a prima facie case for relief,and so denied the petition without taking evidence.
section permanency planning hearing 
the section hearing was scheduled for may.at that hearing father argued he was entitled to visits with the child unless the court found the visits would be detrimental,pursuant to section,subdivision c c.that subdivision provides that,when a court sets guardianship as a child permanent plan,the court shall also make an order for visitation with the parents or guardians unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child.cfs argued that no finding of detriment was necessary because father had not been determined to be a presumed father and had been denied reunification services,and thus was not a parent.the court asked the parties to research the issue and set the hearing contested as to father visitation for may.
on may,the parties agreed that a finding of detriment was necessary at the guardianship stage of the proceedings to deny visitation to even a biological father,although they disagreed as to whether the detriment finding should be made by clear and convincing evidence or by a preponderance of the evidence.cfs called father to testify.father testified that he was currently incarcerated,with a parole date of july,for violating his parole days after his most recent february release by cutting off his gps tracking device.father testified i was out late at night because i was out on baseline boulevard with a transsexual lover of mine who happened to be a prostitute.asked why he took off the tracking device,father replied i was out after my curfew,and i did want them to track me.father testified that he had three prior convictions for indecent exposure,and a conviction for annoying and molesting a child father had been in and out of custody for the previous six or seven years,and agreed when asked whether when you get out of jail,you tend to return to jail fairly soon father testified that he had seen the child about six times and that the last time was in or,with several relatives at a pizza restaurant,when the child was about eighteen months old.father also stated that each time he had gotten out of prison since the dependency began in,he would telephone the maternal grandparents to let them know,and that each time he would speak with the child briefly over the telephone,for about two minutes.father stated he had spoken with the child by telephone about or times,including recently when mother was talking with the child and put father on the telephone.when asked whether he would abide by a juvenile court order that he have no contact with the child,father replied i going to try to the best of my ability,but i want to have a relationship with my son.and i ca promise nothing.
father called the social worker to testify.when asked whether she was aware that the child had ever refused to visit with father or had any emotional distress after speaking to father,she replied that she was not aware of any such reactions by the child.
father then called the maternal grandfather to testify.he testified that he was aware of only one telephone call between father and the child,which was when mother was talking to the child and put father on the telephone.the child did not have any particular reaction during or after speaking with father.although the child told father that he loved him,after saying he did not want to talk on the telephone,the
