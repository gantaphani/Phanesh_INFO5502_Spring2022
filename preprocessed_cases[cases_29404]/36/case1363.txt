the inception of the dependencies 
in july,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed dependency petitions for miguel and aaron.the petitions alleged mother used marijuana to excess and had been seen blowing smoke in aaron face and miguel tested presumptively positive for marijuana.miguel and aaron were detained in polinsky children center and then,on july,with grandmother,who had cared for them previously.
in september,the petitions were amended by adding allegations that mother left miguel unattended outside their home on numerous occasions between the hours of and.the juvenile court dismissed the allegations in the original petitions and made true findings on the new allegations.it placed both boys with grandmother on the agency recommendation.
when was born in june,the agency filed a petition alleging mother had a mental illness,including adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood with relational problems,rendering her unable of providing regular care and she had failed to progress in services following the true finding in miguel case.on june,was detained in grandmother approved home.in july,the court dismissed the first allegation of petition and made a true finding on the second.in august,the court placed her with grandmother on the agency recommendation.
the placement with grandmother 
in june,just before the original dependency petitions were filed,psychologist steven sparta evaluated miguel,apparently in conjunction with a family court case.sparta noted in miguel an underlying sense of instability and insecurity with anticipatory anxiety about future disruptions in his ability to maintain an attachment with caretakers.sparta conferred with miguel attorney about the importance for miguel to have a stable and sustained family history.sparta believed it was very important that miguel experience stability and emotional support and a continuing opportunity to not change schools,to form other social and familial attachments.
from the beginning of the case,the agency reports regarding the children placement with grandmother were positive.throughout,the agency described the home as appropriate and noted that grandmother provide d adequate care.in may,however,an agency report referred to mother family background as a factor elevat ing her potential for child abuse,and a july report noted mother reported issues of domestic violence,physical abuse and sexual abuse during her childhood.she stated that she was responsible for the care of her siblings when she was younger and had reported her mother to cps where they were once dependents.
according to the boys march review report,aaron was progressing very well.while miguel school performance had improved,he continued to have difficulty and was working below grade level.grandmother continue d to assist him with his school assignments and was making efforts with getting his work up to par.miguel therapist had diagnosed post traumatic stress disorder ptsd but said miguel was stabilizing in his placement and display ed little acting out.miguel had mild flashbacks,abandonment issues,and occasional nightmares.
according to the boys september review report,they had made very good progress developmentally.miguel therapist said that he was doing very well and was less anxious,although he did experience some difficulty with transitions.the therapist believed that miguel current school was good for him and that the school staff were able to support him.miguel had raised his grades,had been promoted to the next grade level,and had received an outstanding citizenship award.he had improved immensely academically and was excited about attending school.
in miguel and aaron january review report,the agency stated for the past year,miguel and aaron have been able to experience stability,love,care and affection from grandparents who filed a petition in with family court to have miguel in their care.it was the recommendation of the family court that miguel live with grandparents.this order was countered when the juvenile courts became involved with the family and miguel and aaron were taken into custody by the agency.the report noted that the boys had adjusted to grandmother home and described her care of them as excellent.miguel therapist observed that his ptsd symptoms had subsided and he was doing well.miguel continued to attend the same school,was socializing better with his peers,had received good behavior awards,and had shown exceptional improvement with his grades.the agency remarked that he had shown remarkable change while in the care of grandparents.aaron,whose weight gain had been reported as poor before he was taken into custody,had reached all of his developmental milestones,although there was some concern regarding his active behavior.
in a letter filed february,miguel therapist recommended that miguel continue living with grandmother,whose home was a secure and supportive environment that has helped miguel be successful in school and in the community.the therapist said that miguel therapy could conclude over the next few weeks,as he had been largely for the last days.
during a social worker may,visit to grandmother home,miguel followed grandmother around the house and engaged in any activity she suggested.when miguel gave grandmother a craft he had made in sunday school,she doted over the craft and hung it on the wall.
in february,review report,the agency stated she seem ed to be doing very well in grandmother home.it concluded that was in need of a stable and secure environment so that she can continue to be provided with the excellent care that she has been receiving.
at february,review hearing,the court followed the agency recommendations that she continue to be placed in grandmother approved home and a review hearing be set.the court set the hearing for august.at miguel and aaron february review hearing,the court followed the agency recommendations that the boys continue to be placed in grandmother approved home and that a section hearing be set.the court set the hearing for june.
the removal proceedingsa.the detention and petitions 
on may,the agency moved the children from grandmother home to emergency shelter foster homes,with miguel and aaron in one home and in another.on june,the agency filed section supplemental petitions for the children,alleging t he previous disposition has not been effective in the protection or rehabilitation of the child grandmother was no longer able to provide adequate care and supervision in that a prior history of cps child protective services neglect and abuse was discovered together with statements by grandmother that grandfather suffers from a mental illness.the agency recommended foster home placement.at the june detention hearing,the court ordered the children detained in polinsky children center,an approved foster home,or an adjunct.
b.the detention report 
concerning the allegation of a cps history,the agency detention report on the section petition stated in t he previous cps history from,grandmother was granted joint custody of her biological children through a family court order.the reading of this past cps hist or y is complicated by many factors.the reunification services period included substance abuse issues in grandmother and her,a.allegations of sexual abuse existed during the course of reunification.grandmother from whom she was separated allegedly perpetrated the sexual abuse.the case history reveals that mother was not returned to grandmother physical custody by court order.the social worker who had approved grandmother home had not found a child abuse history in the current system.when miguel and aaron cases moved to the permanency planning stage,grandparents requested an adoption home study and a new background check was completed.it was then discovered in the old system that there was a child abuse history in the home of grandmother she had an open case to cps that alleged physical abuse of her daughters,with p rior abuse allegations includ ing domestic violence and physical abuse of her children and the daughters had been removed from grandmother and eventually placed in their father care.the agency concluded there was a risk in the current placement with grandmother in that she had a significant child abuse history including the removal of her biological children.
as to the allegation of grandfather mental illness,the detention report stated as follows.grandfather was the primary caregiver and supervised the children while grandmother worked full time.grandmother said that grandfather had schizophrenia.he was unemployed,on disability due to his mental illness,and took medication for that illness.an agency supervisor had told grandmother that grandfather was not to be left alone with the children.
the detention report also mentioned another concern about the placement.since the original home approval,grandmother two biological daughters,who had been living with their father,had moved in,so that the home had nine occupants including grandmother two other biological children who had been in the home when it was approved.there was clutter and the home cleanliness was marginal.
in a discussion of the above factors with the social worker,grandmother said she believed the cps history was based on false allegations by mother and asked if a letter from mother therapist could clear this up,explaining that mother had accused her of physical abuse and later recanted in therapy.the social worker cast grandmother statements as a minimiz ation of her previous cps history which create d concerns about grandmother denial and minimization of the significant previous reunification issues of physical abuse,domestic violence,substance abuse,sexual abuse.grandmother also said that grandfather never forgot to take his medication,loved the children,and was good with them she was aware of their marginal living standards,recognized that the home was too small and cramped,and planned to mak e improvements such as new paint inside and new flooring to deal with the dirty conditions.
the detention report stated that miguel was strongly attached to grandmother and apparently regarded her as his primary parent.she was highly involved in his school progress and therapeutic treatment.the agency believed that it will be emotionally detrimental to miguel to be separated from grandmother.he said he wanted to remain with her.his school reported that he had recently threatened to kill other children,showed a lack of,and needed behavioral intervention.
the detention report concluded with the current information that there is mental illness,cps history,and marginal living conditions in this home,the previous licensing home approval is not valid.a reapproval process was initiated upon the realization of this new information.due to the seriousness of the child abuse history and the fact that grandfather is a primary caregiver with mental illness,the agency supervisors are unable to approve the home.both aaron and have no ability to protect themselves should an emergency situation arise while under the care of this schizophrenic care provider.although grandmother reports that grandfather is stable and medicated,he is unable to fulfill the requirements of employment.he has been observed to be socially withdrawn and have poor affect.the agency requested the children removal while more information is pursued through evaluations of both caregivers.
c.the june and,section hearings 
the social worker testimony 
on june,social worker lakesha sledge testified as follows.when she was assigned to the case in september,she was aware of grandmother cps history,which grandmother had disclosed to her.the social worker preceding sledge,who had detained the children with grandmother,was also aware of this history.the cps history was documented in contact logs also called the case narrative although the logs did not specify the type of history.thus,sledge did not know the extent of the history or whether it involved physical or sexual abuse.in a contact log,a previous social worker had noted that the cps history had been orally waivered and the home approved by former chief pam fawcett in july.approval meant that the placement was deemed suitable and the caregivers were able to provide the children with the necessary care.there was no concern about grandmother cps history or the children safety.
between the time sledge was assigned to the case and the time the children were removed from grandmother home,sledge visited the home a total of to times,once a month for about to minutes.during the visits,the children always seemed appropriately dressed,appropriately cared for,and appropriately developing.sledge saw no bruises or marks,other than a bruise or mark on aaron leg or arm,but he was very active,and there was nothing that led her to suspect any abuse.the home had been cluttered throughout the period of sledge supervision.there were about seven people living in the home when she received the case,all relatives,and in the month before the june hearing,there had been as many as nine residents.although the two bedroom,one bathroom house was very small,the children sleeping arrangements were appropriate and sledge had no doubt that the home met the minimum standards.the children had always done well in grandmother care.
when sledge received the case,she knew that grandmother was married.grandfather had been present for of sledge visits to the home,she had seen him in court,and she had talked to him.she had no concerns about his behavior and had never heard him say anything that would raise a concern about the children safety.until june when she learned that grandfather was a paranoid schizophrenic,she had observed no indication that he suffered from a mental illness.when sledge asked grandmother if grandfather was taking medication,grandmother said yes.sledge told her supervisor that grandfather was schizophrenic.sledge and her supervisor decided to leave the children in the home after sledge talked to grandmother and apparently decided that the children were not to be left in grandfather care.sledge did nothing to check on grandfather condition in the ensuing year.
in may,grandmother home was assessed by the agency adoptions unit.at that time,sledge supervisor,diana conklin,inquired into grandfather condition.the agency learned,apparently from grandmother,that she was leaving the children alone with him.sledge did not believe it was appropriate for him to be the children primary caretaker.she had asked him to sign a release so that the agency could obtain more information about his mental health status,but he declined.in,sledge and agency supervisors went to grandmother home and instructed grandmother to not leave the children in the care of grandfather considering his mental health status.after this conversation,the children were found in grandfather care as the only adult provider in the home.as of may,however,grandmother was providing the children primary care.
in late april or may,sledge learned the details of grandmother cps history from adoption unit social worker jamie rivas and her supervisor sue chamberlin.sledge then consulted with her supervisor their section chief,lisa johnson chamberlin and rivas,and performed an updated risk assessment.the agency position was that there were too many risk factors to leave the children in grandmother home and the factors could not be waived.it was determined that the children would be removed.sledge agreed to an extent with that determination.since she had been assigned to the case,she had always felt that the children were safe in the home.she believed that it was in their best interests to remain there it would be detrimental to remove them and there were some risk factors that needed to be remedied,but with a remedy,the children could be safe in the home.sledge had asked johnson to sign a waiver,but johnson had refused.sledge concluded that it was a risk for the children to be in the home,considering grandmother cps history including physical abuse,other abuse allegations,supervised visitation with her own children until the family court awarded her joint custody of the children but not physical custody of her older child grandfather schizophrenia and the minimum standards of the home the number of occupants,the clutter,and the lack of a whole lot of room for aaron and to move as far as their development 
further evidence,argument,orders,and findings 
during the children attorney of sledge,the agency counsel objected to the question whether sledge believed that the children could be safe in grandmother home.the agency counsel argued that once a waiver is given by a chief,the court is aware it does matter what the social worker thinks.the court responded,is it your position that i ca override the waiver because if so,then there no need for this trial.the agency counsel then said,the case out of county it does say you are not supposed to put kids in unlicensed homes.the court replied,i think what i am asking you if it is your position that the chief says something,the court ca do anything.i need to know that.if johnson is in charge of the case,and that the court has no jurisdiction,that is fine,if that your legal position.the agency counsel asserted,i f the home is totally unlicenseable,can a court put the children in there and our position is no,they can not.the court overruled the objection,stating,the question that the court has to look at is whether or not the previous disposition was ineffective.and unless it is,per se,answered,because a chief will not grant a waiver,then we have to go on with the trial.
near the end of the june,proceedings,the agency counsel again cited county i.the court and the children attorney said they would have to review that case.the court ordered that all appropriate relatives be evaluated and gave the social worker discretion to detain the children with an appropriate relative,with hours notice to all counsel.it continued the matter to june.
on june,the petitions were amended to allege that the previous disposition has not been effective in the protection or rehabilitation of the child and grandparents were no longer able to provide adequate care and supervision because the home was no longer approved by the agency for placement of the child.the allegations concerning grandmother statement that grandfather suffered from a mental illness and of discovery of a cps neglect and abuse history were stricken.the court accepted a stipulation that agency chief heidi staples would testify that the home was not approved and she would not give a waiver.mother submitted on the petition on the basis of the social worker reports.
the court entered true findings on the petitions it stated,this case is a stinker,then placed the children in a licensed foster home and detained them,pending placement,in polinsky children center,a licensed foster home,or adjunct,and ordered reasonable unsupervised visitation for grandmother on the condition she not leave the children alone in grandfather care.
the court said,the evidence as it stood when we ended the trial was the social worker testifying,essentially,it would be detrimental to remove these children.i do care what anybody says.the court views this case as we supported this.grandfather was schizophrenic for two years and nobody seemed to be that concerned about it.but i know what it is.it is going to interfere with an adoption,and i guess we have to consider that because the most permanent plan is appropriate.but,you know,i mentioned this earlier,i think sometimes we really get hung up on protocols.and you know it sad for these kids.i mean,nine people in the home.there has been nine people in the home,history.there was a history.it did seem to bother anybody until it got on the verge of an adoption.and it is very sad for these kids.i think they are going to suffer because of that.the court also noted the children are going to be in a lot of pain and it commented,i still do quite understand what went on here.
postremoval events 
after the removal,grandmother continued to have visits and telephone contact with miguel and visits with aaron and the removal was very hard on all three children.miguel therapist said that miguel had been somewhat traumatized by the removal and had displayed a moderate symptom upswing consisting primarily of nightmares,but also including some mild aggressive acting out at school.the therapist agreed that miguel identified strongly with his relationship with grandmother.miguel himself told the social worker that he loved grandmother,felt safe in her home,and wanted to live with her.while aaron eventually appeared to stabilize in his foster placement,he showed some aggressive and tantruming behaviors,delays in fine motor skills,and speech and language delays.he cried when separated from grandmother,from mother,and from his foster mother.his verbal attempts were understandable only by his family.miguel said he would be sad not to live with aaron.in spite of the significant sibling relationships among the three children,the agency concluded that there was no reasonable alternative to different permanent plans.
in its assessment filed for miguel and aaron section hearing,the agency recommended permanent plans of another planned permanent living arrangement for miguel,so the agency could focus on uniting him with his father,who lived in florida,had not responded to the social worker offer of information about the permanency planning assessment,and had not followed through with previous agreements to visit and contact miguel.on june,miguel told the social worker that he had had telephone contact with his father and with a paternal aunt he was happy about that contact and,according to his school social worker,very happy with his new foster mother,apparently wondering out loud if she could be his new mother.on june,miguel father came to san diego for a week of visitation.when the social worker asked him where he would like to live,understanding that he was not allowed to live with mother or grandmother,he also said he wanted to live with a maternal aunt and with his father.
for aaron,the agency assessment recommended a permanent plan of adoption.the assessment estimated that homes would be available for him,of which would also accept if her case were in the permanency planning phase.following the removal,was placed in two successive foster homes,but not with aaron.the agency matched aaron and with a concurrent planning foster home and aaron began visits with the family,but this placement did not work out and the two children were not moved from their foster homes.
on july,miguel attorney filed a section modification petition,asking that the petition be dismissed pursuant to section or that miguel be placed with grandparents,who were entitled to custody pursuant to a family court order on july,the court denied the section petition without prejudice,ordered a permanent plan of another planned permanent living arrangement for miguel,and placed him with his paternal aunt and uncle 
discussiona.miguel notice of appeal 
on september,the agency filed a motion requesting that miguel appeal be dismissed because his notice of appeal was filed late,on august.miguel filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus,seeking relief from the purportedly untimely filing.both the agency and miguel also discuss the issue in their briefs.mother and grandparents join in miguel petition.
in the writ proceedings,both miguel counsel and the agency assume,without explanation,that the notice of appeal was due on august.the agency motion to dismiss explains why it believes the appeal is late,and miguel opposition concedes the point.
in its motion,the agency argues that pursuant to california rules of court,rule b,the notice of appeal had to be filed days after the order became final under rule c the referee order did not have to be served on miguel and he was represented by counsel who was present when the order was pronounced therefore,the order became final days after it was pronounced thus,the notice of appeal was due days after june.the statutes the agency cites are not on point and the cases it cites did not involve referees.in re markaus d.mauro superior court d.in re alyssa th,d.the agency does not mention rule b.
generally,in a juvenile dependency case heard by a judge,a notice of appeal must be filed no later than days after the judgment is rendered or the order is made.rules b,f.with exceptions not applicable here,when the matter is heard by a referee,the notice of appeal must be filed within days after the order becomes final under rule c.rules b,f see also.rule c,also with exceptions not applicable here,states that a referee order shall become final calendar days after service of a copy of the order and findings under rule.rule b requires that a copy of the findings and order,with a written explanation of the right to seek review of the order by a juvenile court judge,be served by mail on the child counsel,with service deemed complete at the time of mailing.
here,the june,minute order was served by mail on miguel counsel on june.the referee order therefore became final on june,calendar days after service of a copy of the order and findings under rule.rule c.thus,the notice of appeal was due days after june,that is,on august.because the notice of appeal was filed in a timely manner on august,we deny the petition as moot and deny the motion to dismiss miguel appeal.
grandparents appeal 
the agency september,motion also requests that grandparents appeal of the section order be dismissed for lack of standing.grandparents oppose the motion.the parties also address the issue in their briefs.
in section proceedings,the agency,the child,and the parent or guardian have the right to appeal.rule a.additionally,u pon a sufficient showing the juvenile court may recognize the child present or previous custodians as de facto parents and grant standing to participate as parties in disposition hearings and any hearing thereafter at which the status of the dependent child is at issue.the de facto parent may be present at the hearing be represented by retained counsel or,at the discretion of the court,by appointed counsel present evidence.rule e.the rights of relatives other than parents are delimited as follows upon a sufficient showing the juvenile court may permit the relatives of the child to be present at the hearing address the court.rule f.
grandparents were present in court for the june,detention hearing on the section petition and grandmother was present for the june hearing.they did not ask to address the court.at the time of the june hearing,grandparents had not applied for or achieved de facto parent status thus,they were merely relatives,not parties.o nly parties of record may appeal.citation.a party of record is a person named as a party to the proceedings or one who takes appropriate steps to become a party of record in the proceedings.in re joseph th,d alleged biological father had not become a party and lacked standing.if grandparents had sought de facto parent status in a timely manner,and had been granted that status,they would have standing to appeal.christina superior court d.juvenile court erred by summarily denying foster parent request to participate in the proceedings.they did not do so.
grandparents assert that they have standing as relatives citing charles superior court d.and as de facto parents who had not yet been officially granted that status citing katzoff superior court d.in re cal d,and in re joel th,d.not so.unlike the situations in charles superior court,supra,d at.katzoff superior court,supra,d at.and in re,supra,cal d at,grandparents did not seek to participate in the proceedings below.unlike the situation in in re joel,supra,th at page,d,the de facto issue was disputed and grandparents were not described as de facto parents in the juvenile court.california doctrine of de facto parent status is a judicially created doctrine,but one which is now spelled out in the california rules of court.in re brandon th,d.de facto parent status is a factual matter for the juvenile court to decide the applicant bears the burden of proof.in re michael th,d see also katzoff superior court,supra,d at.rule e.grandparents do not have standing to appeal as de facto parents or as relatives.
grandparents argue that they were not served with the petitions,properly noticed of the hearing,or informed of their rights,including the rights to counsel,to seek de facto parent status,to request that the court subpoena witnesses and order production of documents,and to address the court,depriving them of their statutory and due process rights.grandparents cite in re jonique th,d.in that case,however,the grandmother had sought and received de facto parent status.id.at,d.thus,in re jonique is distinguishable.furthermore,although grandparents appeared at the detention hearing on the section petition and grandmother was present on june,they did not make any of these arguments below.while they should have been served with the petition and notice of hearing rules d e c,b,they waived any right to challenge the lack of notice by failing to do so in the juvenile court.in re,supra,cal d at.we grant the agency motion to dismiss grandparents appeal.
c.the section proceedings 
mother and miguel contend the court erred by removing the three children from grandparents home.mother asserts the true findings on the section petitions and the removal order are unsupported by substantial evidence grandmother cps history and grandfather illness created,at most,a presumption of risk,which was rebutted the agency tacitly approved the conditions in grandparents home it later classified as risks its change of position does not amount to substantial evidence that the placement was ineffective in protecting the children and the court erred by failing to bifurcate the proceedings.miguel asserts the agency refusal to approve the home did not compel removal the juvenile court abdicated its duty to make an independent judgment of the appropriateness of the placement even if the court had considered grandparents histories and the condition of their home as a basis for its findings and orders,those factors did not constitute substantial evidence and the removal violated the children fundamental rights to remain placed with their biological family.
the gist of the agency position on the merits is that the juvenile court is barred from reviewing the agency executive decision not to approve a relative placement and not to grant an exemption from placement criteria.the agency misses the point.its executive role in determining whether or not to approve a relative placement and whether or not to grant an exemption is not at issue here.there was no criminal conviction to be exempted.the agency had already approved the placement although in doing so it apparently did not examine its own records,it was plainly on notice of the alleged deficiencies it later asserted.what is at issue is whether the agency may usurp the juvenile court judicial power under section to determine the propriety of a child removal from a relative placement,and whether the agency has an unfettered right to change that placement no matter how the change affects the children.the answer to these questions is no.cesar superior court th,d the juvenile court must exercise its independent judgment regarding a section relative placement request,not merely review the social service agency decision for an abuse of discretion.for the reasons we discuss below,we determine the agency does not have the absolute authority to change a relative placement already ordered by the court and that the agency withdrawal of its approval of grandparents home did not relieve the juvenile court of its duty to review the appropriateness of that placement.we further determine that the record lacks substantial evidence supporting the removal order.
a supplemental petition shall contain a concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the child or,in the case of a placement with a relative,sufficient to show that the placement is not appropriate in view of the criteria in section,subd.a.the last clause relating to relative placement was added to section in.added by stats,ch.
section,subdivision a,lists criteria for relative placement to be considered by the social worker and the court,including,but not limited to,the child best interest,subd.a the wishes of the parent,relative,and child,subd.a the provisions of division,part of the family code including,preference for placement with relative and prohibited discrimination,subd.a placement of siblings in the same home,if in the children best interests,subd.a t he good moral character of the relative and any other adult living in the home,including whether any individual residing in the home has a prior history of violent criminal acts or has been responsible for acts of child abuse or neglect,subd.a the nature and duration of the relationship and the relative desire to care for the child and provide permanency,subd.a the relative ability to provide a safe,secure,and stable environment,a home,necessities of life,and legal permanence exercise proper and effective care and control protect the child from the parents facilitate reunification,relative visitation,and implementation of the case plan and arrange for appropriate and safe child care,subd.a and the safety of the home,subd.a.
section,subdivision a also states,for a relative to be considered appropriate to receive placement of a child under this section,the relative home shall first be approved pursuant to the process and standards described in subdivision d of section.section,subdivision d concerns the agency assessment and approval of a relative home for temporary placement of the child pending the detention hearing,subd.d.the assessment involves an inspection regarding safety and the relative ability to care for the child,and,for adult household members,checks for criminal records and prior allegations of child abuse or neglect.ibid.the approval is to be based on the standards set forth in regulations for the licensing foster family homes which prescribe standards of safety and sanitation for the physical plant and standards for basic personal care,supervision,and services provided by the caregiver,subd.d.if the home meets all conditions except receipt of federal bureau of investigation criminal history information,the agency may nevertheless approve the home if it obtains signed statements from the adult household members that they have no convictions other than traffic infractions.the agency may terminate its approval if it later determines an adult household member has a criminal record,subd.d.
the hearing on the section petition is conducted by first following the procedures for jurisdictional hearings and making a finding that the factual allegations and the allegation of an ineffective prior disposition are or are not true if there is a true finding,the court then follows the procedures for dispositional hearings to determine whether removal is appropriate.rule d.
we reject mother assertion the juvenile court erred by failing to bifurcate the proceedings.she failed to raise this objection below and has therefore waived the right to do so.in re richard th,d.even if she had not waived her right to raise the issue,she has not shown prejudice,or even asserted it.she cites in re fred d,for the proposition that a failure to bifurcate requires reversal.we disagree with that case.when a rule does not provide any consequence for noncompliance,the language should be considered directory rather than mandatory.citations.the directory and mandatory designations do not refer to whether a particular requirement is permissive or obligatory,but simply denote whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will invalidate the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.in re th,d.here,the rule provides no penalty if the court does not comply with it,making the language directory.
the agency claims that the appellants have waived the right to assert that the juvenile court had the authority to review the agency rescission of its approval of grandparents home.the agency contends that at the june,hearing,after its trial counsel cited county i,and at the june hearing,when the petitions were amended,no one argued that the court could override the agency decision,the amended petitions failed to state causes of action,or the court should order that the children remain in grandparents home.
we reject the agency claim.first,its trial counsel cited county i as part of an objection to a question by the children attorney during his of the social worker whether she believed the children could be safe in grandmother home.the children counsel expressed his disagreement with the agency position that the court could not put the children in a totally unlicenseable home and the court overruled the agency objection.second,although mother counsel said she had no objection to the amendment of the petitions,this is not the same as saying that the petitions stated a cause of action.while mother submitted on the social worker reports,this does not operate as a waiver of her right to contend that the court decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.in re richard,supra,th at,d.notwithstanding a submittal on a particular record,the court must nevertheless weigh evidence,make appropriate evidentiary findings and apply relevant law to determine whether the case has been proved.citation.in other words,the parent acquiesces as to the state of the evidence yet preserves the right to challenge it as insufficient to support a particular legal conclusion.id.at,d.finally,questions of law,such as whether the agency refusal to approve the home compelled removal,are subject to de novo review.see in re steven th,d.
in support of its position that the court lacked the power to review the agency retraction of its approval of grandparents home,the agency relies on county there,after a dependency petition was filed,the children were detained and the juvenile court ordered the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs to investigate the home of the children and his wife for possible placement.county i,supra,th at,d.the investigation revealed that the had a criminal record,apparently including convictions and jail and prison sentences.id.at,d.because of his criminal record,drug use history,and poor health,dcfs recommended against placement.id.at,d.
the juvenile court ordered the children released to the wife and allowed the monitored contact.county i,supra,th at,d.dcfs applied for a rehearing,citing section,subdivision d but the court ordered that the children remain released to the wife.county i,supra,at,d.after the court of appeal issued a palma notice palma industrial fasteners,cal d,directing the court to change the placement order,the juvenile court noted that the wife was caring for the children appropriately,ordered the to move out of her home,and ordered dcfs to verify that he had moved out.county i,supra,th at,d.dcfs verified this,but then a social worker paid a surprise visit to the home and found the there.id.at,d.after the court of appeal issued an alternative writ directing the juvenile court to remove the children from the wife home or bar contact between the children and the,dcfs informed the reviewing court that the juvenile court had granted the wife guardianship over dcfs objection.ibid.
the court of appeal directed the juvenile court to vacate its orders placing the children in a home in which the resided or which afforded him significant contact with the children,enter a new order removing them from the wife home and placing them in a suitable home,and vacate its guardianship order.county i,supra,th at,d.the reviewing court noted that the language of section,subdivision d,the child shall not be placed in the home,was mandatory,applied broadly to anyone involved in placement,and did not confer on the juvenile court any discretion to avoid its prohibition.county i,supra,th at,d.the court observed that the provision in section,subdivision d regarding a waiver of the disqualification did not allow the juvenile court to grant a waiver,but rather allowed only dcfs to request one from the director of the department of social services dss,and only dss to grant or deny the request.county i,supra,th at,d.
county i is not on point.that case concerned placement in the first instance,not removal from an existing placement dcfs had already approved.additionally,county i concerned the mandatory statutory language regarding criminal convictions,inapplicable in this case.
in county ii,the reviewing court confirmed that section referred only to placements,not removals.county ii,supra,th at,d.in that case,three sisters were removed from their parents at birth in,and.they were detained and then placed with their aunt.id.at,d.in,the aunt received probation after pleading guilty to felony infliction of corporal injury on her son.the girls were removed from the aunt care pursuant to a section petition.county ii,supra,th at,d.in may,the court ordered the two younger girls returned.dcfs had recommended against the return on the ground that the aunt recent physical abuse of her son,recent marriage,and recent return of her own children created too many stressors,but it did not argue section and did not seek review of the order.county ii,supra,th at,d.in october,the court ordered the oldest girl be returned.dcfs had recommended against the return because it would have been a violation of its policy to recommend placement in light of the aunt criminal record of child endangerment.dcfs did not seek review of this order.the court ordered a permanent plan of foster care.ibid.
in november,the aunt was arrested for inappropriate physical discipline of her daughter.she was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and placed on probation.in february,dcfs filed a section petition alleging the previous disposition had been ineffective in protecting the children.it requested that the children be detained,arguing that section required the court to do so in light of the aunt penal code section conviction.county ii,supra,th at,d.the court denied the request,noting that section concerned placement,not removal neither the convictions nor dcfs other evidence established a factual basis for removal and removal would be extremely detrimental to the girls.county ii,supra,at,d.after the detention hearing,the aunt penal code section conviction was expunged.county ii,supra,at,d.
dcfs filed a petition for writ of mandate,contending the court had no discretion to deny its detention request because the aunt penal code section conviction made her home ineligible for placement under section.county ii,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal denied the petition id.at,d.it held that despite the expungement,the aunt conviction continue d to operate as a nonexemptible disqualifying criminal offense under health and safety code section,subdivision g,whose definition of such offenses and standards for granting exemptions are incorporated into section,subdivision d.county ii,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,the dependency court had discretion to allow the children to remain in the aunt home because section refers only to placements and does not apply when the issue is whether a child is to be removed from an existing placement if a criminal records check reveals a conviction occurring after the placement.id.at,d,italics added.
the agency properly notes that county ii is distinguishable to the extent it deals with criminal convictions under section.we disagree with the agency,however,in its criticism of county ii for purportedly ignoring sections,and and for failing to recognize the executive authority of dcfs to approve relative homes and decide exemptions.the procedural status of that case was consideration of dcfs request under section to detain the children out of the relative home,where they had been placed,pending a hearing on its section petition.county ii,supra,th at,d.no discussion of section,or was necessary.the agency also asserts that the county ii court failed to recognize the termination of approval provision in section,subdivision d.even if section had been applicable,however,there is no indication that the prerequisites in subdivision d for termination of approval had been met approval based on signed statements that there were no convictions,followed by discovery of a criminal record.
the agency also discusses in re jullian th,d to illustrate its executive function regarding exemptions.that case is not on point.it concerned the social service agency failure to approve the home of an indian relative who had criminal convictions the child had not yet been placed in the home.id.at,d.
as mentioned above,before the court made its true findings,the supplemental petitions were amended by replacing allegations that grandmother said that grandfather had a mental illness,and the agency had discovered a cps neglect and abuse history,with an allegation that grandparents home was no longer approved by the agency for placement.thus,the court findings and orders were based solely on the agency withdrawal of its approval of grandparents home.clearly,the record supports the conclusion that the factual allegation of the petitions was true the agency did,indeed,withdraw its approval of the home.
even though we review the record in the light most favorable to the order in re joel,supra,th at,d the agency withdrawal of its approval does not constitute substantial evidence that the previous disposition was not effective or that the placement was not appropriate under the criteria in section.whether the agency approved grandparents home,subd.a was just one of the factors in section the court could have considered.the evidence,summarized above,showed that the children had been flourishing in grandparents home for about two years miguel and aaron and about one year.when miguel and aaron cases reached the permanency planning stage,the agency suddenly changed its mind about the placement.
there is no evidence in the record that grandmother approximately cps history consisted of anything but allegations.although the agency was aware of this part of its own along,its reports do not clearly state what the history was.what,precisely,were the allegations were any allegations substantiated if so,which ones 
similarly,the agency had been aware of grandfather diagnosis for almost a year.there is no indication in the record that his schizophrenia had any adverse consequences.he was stable and on medication.the only negative comments about him were the social worker statements in the june section detention report that he is unable to fulfill the requirements of employment and h e has been observed to be socially withdrawn and have poor affect.the report does not say who did the observing,nor is there any indication how grandfather inability to be employed might present a problem.the agency also remarks on grandfather refusal to sign a release of his mental health information after consulting with grandmother,but fails to explain why this should lead to an adverse inference.if the agency wanted further information about grandfather,why did it not request it before approving the children placement in the home in any event,although grandmother may have initially failed to follow the agency directive not to leave the children alone with grandfather,she may later have had her own older children help care for the dependent c
