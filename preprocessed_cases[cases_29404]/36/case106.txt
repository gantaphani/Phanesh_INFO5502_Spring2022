the primary question presented by this appeal is whether a biological and parent of a disabled child has standing to sue under the individuals with disabilities education act idea to vindicate rights granted by the idea.critical to this question is whether,under new york law,a biological and parent of a child retains the right to make decisions regarding the child education where the divorce decree and custody order are silent as to the control of educational decisions.because the subsidiary question has not been decided by the new york court of appeals,and because it is dispositive of the case,and because the answer to it will have broad implications for custodial disputes under new york law,we believe that the new york court of appeals should have the opportunity to address it.we therefore certify the question to the new york court of appeals.
background 
shortly after he was born,mathew fuentes mathew was diagnosed with a genetic visual disorder that rendered him legally blind.in,mathew parents,jesus fuentes fuentes and karen fuentes,were divorced.on august,an order directing custody was entered,granting mathew mother exclusive custody of mathew.mathew attended new york city public schools,where he received special education services to accommodate his disability.
in,because fuentes believed that the education accommodations mathew received were inadequate,fuentes requested that mathew be reevaluated for additional services.after the committee on special education for the hearing,handicapped,and visually impaired determined that mathew current services were adequate,fuentes requested a hearing to review the committee determination.on january,the impartial hearing office denied fuentes request for a hearing.its chief administrator,denise washington,based her denial on fuentes custodial status.because fuentes was the parent of mathew,washington determined that he was not the person in parental relation as defined in educ.law.accordingly,washington concluded that fuentes did not have the right to participate in educational decisions affecting mathew and refused to process fuentes requests.fuentes then brought this suit in the district court for the eastern district of new york against the new york city board of education boe under and section f of the idea,f.
fuentes pro se complaint alleged that he was denied his rights under the idea to review the boe written assessment of mathew special education needs and to be granted an impartial hearing to petition for reconsideration of the boe determination that mathew did not need additional special instruction.the boe moved to dismiss the complaint,pursuant to.b and c,on the ground that fuentes,as mathew parent,lacked standing under the idea to exercise those rights.in the alternative,the boe argued that fuentes failure to join a necessary party karen fuentes warranted dismissal.
the district court frederic block,judge,applying taylor.dep t of,cir,held that it was required to look to state law to determine whether a biological and parent retains the power to make special education decisions where the custody order and divorce decree are silent in this respect.although acknowledging that new york law was not definitive on the question,the district court concluded that under new york law a parent has no right to make special education decisions for the child,and,therefore,that fuentes lacked standing to bring the action.
fuentes appealed that ruling to this court.in a summary order,we agreed with the district court that our holding in taylor applied and that new york state law would generally be determinative of whether a parent could exercise the rights granted by the idea.fuentes bd.of educ.of,cir.we did not accept,however,the district court conclusion that new york law denied fuentes,as the parent,the right to participate in decisions with regard to the child education.because we did not readily find controlling new york state authority to guide our review,we stated our inclination to certify the question to the new york court of appeals.id.at.before doing so,however,we remanded the case to the district court so it could address the boe alternative ground for dismissal fuentes failure to join karen fuentes in the suit.
on remand,the district court ruled that karen fuentes absence from the suit did not warrant dismissal,but again dismissed fuentes case for lack of standing.fuentes now appeals that ruling.the parties do not dispute the district court resolution of the joinder issue.thus,we must address whether fuentes has standing to bring this action under the idea.

ii.preliminary issues 
before turning to the question to be certified to the new york court of appeals,we must first address fuentes contention that certification is unnecessary because federal law is dispositive of the case.he makes two arguments on this score.first,fuentes claims that,under taylor,if the divorce decree and custody order do not specifically revoke a parental right,the parent retains that right for purposes of the idea.second,fuentes claims that amendments to the idea create a presumption as a matter of federal law that biological parents retain rights to sue under the idea as long as the custody order and divorce decree do not restrict the biological parent rights with regard to control of education decisions,irrespective of the biological parent status under state law.fuentes is incorrect on both counts.
although neither the idea nor its federal regulatory scheme are models of clarity,we have consistently held that the act does not usurp the state traditional role in setting educational policy.taylor,at.to that end,the statute incorporates state substantive standards as the governing federal rule if they are consistent with the federal scheme and meet the minimum requirements set forth by the idea.id.at internal citation omitted.in taylor,as in this case,the parent wished to assert rights under the idea.however,unlike this case in which the divorce decree is silent on the point,the vermont divorce decree in taylor provided that the custodial parent was allocate d all legal rights and physical rights regarding the choice of schooling for the child.id.at.the only power with regard to schooling that the parent retained under the decree was the right to reasonable information regarding the child progress in school.id.
despite the divorce decree explicit grant of power to the custodial parent,taylor,the parent,argued that she retained the right to sue under the idea to enforce parental rights.id.her ability to do so turned on whether she was considered a parent within the meaning of.id.at.at that time,the statute contained the following provision 
the term parent 
a includes a legal guardian and 
b except as used in sections b and a of this title,includes an individual assigned under either of those sections to be a surrogate parent.
the department of education regulations implementing the idea at that time contained the following,more comprehensive definition 
a general.as used in this part,the term parent means 
a natural or adoptive parent of a child 
a guardian but not the state if the child is a ward of the state 
a person acting in the place of a parent such as a grandparent or stepparent with whom the child lives,or a person who is legally responsible for the child welfare or 
a surrogate parent who has been appointed in accordance with.
we reasoned that did not provide an exhaustive definition of the term parent.taylor,at.we stated that e ven if the use of the expansive term includes did not carry with it the strong implication that the statute definition of parent encompassed more than the two categories specifically referenced,we would find it difficult to credit a reading that excluded natural parents from the list of persons who could exercise parental rights under the statute.id.as to the parent claim that the regulations conveyed
