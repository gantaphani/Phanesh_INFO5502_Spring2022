clifford allen newman appeals his sentence imposed after pleading guilty to one count of violating the international parental kidnapping crime act ipkca.newman argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence under united states sentencing guidelines b and b c.after review and oral argument,we affirm the district court enhancement under b because the offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice,but we conclude the district court clearly erred in finding that the offense was otherwise extensive in scope,planning,or preparation.we therefore reverse and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
clifford and monica newman were married in and she later gave birth to a son.they divorced in,and a florida state court entered a decree awarding primary residential custody of their son,then three years old,to newman.under the terms of the custody order,neither parent was permitted to remove the child from florida without written,notarized consent of the other parent.
shortly after the divorce decree was entered,newman picked up his son for a scheduled visitation but never returned the child to his mother.instead,he took the child to yemen in violation of the state court decree in an effort to avoid the court custody determination.newman abducted his son because,in his words,he could not just sit back and let his son be taken away,he wanted to be his son father and he wanted to raise him,and they would allow him to do that here,and contrary to the state court decision,he knew what was best for his son.
as a result of his actions,the florida state attorney office charged newman with interference with custody in violation of florida law and issued a state arrest warrant.the whereabouts of the father and child remained unknown,however,and he was never arrested or prosecuted on the state charges.nearly eight years would pass before newman and the boy were located.during this time,newman had no contact with her son.
in,however,investigators got two breaks.first,authorities notified the state department that newman crossed an international border traveling on his united states passport.second,newman was arrested in dubai in the united arab emirates for auto theft and attempted robbery.through their investigation,federal law enforcement officers then learned that the child was living with newman second wife in yemen.shortly thereafter,yemeni law enforcement officers working in concert with federal agents took custody of the child and a yemeni court granted legal guardianship to the child maternal grandmother.the grandmother then traveled with the child from yemen to the united states,where he was reunited with his mother at the age of eleven.
following his arrest in dubai,newman was indicted in the middle district of florida and charged with one count of removing his child from,and retaining his child outside of,the united states in violation of the ipkca.upon his release from prison in dubai five years later,newman was returned to the united states and immediately arrested.he pleaded guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.
the presentence report psr prepared by the united states probation office recommended that newman sentence be enhanced under two guidelines provisions.first,the psr recommended a increase under b because the offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice.second,the psr recommended a enhancement under b c based on the probation officer finding that the offense was extensive in scope,planning,or preparation.with a criminal history category of iii and a decrease for acceptance of responsibility,newman guidelines range was to months.
newman objected to both enhancements,but the district court overruled his objections.specifically,the district court found the enhancement for substantial interference with the administration of justice applied based on newman violation of the state court custody order.the district court also found that newman offense warranted an enhancement because it was extensive in scope,planning,or preparation,based on the duration of the offense and his flight to a country in the middle east where it would be extraordinarily difficult to locate and return the child.after hearing from newman,argument from the parties,and newman allocution,the district court sentenced him to months in prison.he now appeals.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states,cir.for a factual finding to be clearly erroneous,this court,after reviewing all of the evidence,must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
congress enacted the international parental kidnapping crime act in to deter the removal of children from the united states to foreign countries in order to obstruct parental rights.see,at,reprinted in.the legislative history of the ipkca explains that the act was intended as a response to issues left unaddressed by international law 
there is an international civil mechanism relating to cases of international parental kidnapping,the hague convention on international parental child abduction,for which congress passed implementing legislation in.as a result of this convention,the signatories will recognize the custody decrees of other signatories,thereby facilitating the return of abducted children.however,most countries are not signatories to the convention,thus leaving individual countries to take whatever legal unilateral action they can to obtain the return of abducted children.
id.at,at see also united states,cir united states amer,cir explaining that the ipkca was passed to close the gap left by the many countries that are not signatories to the hague convention and to deter abductions to safe haven countries.in furtherance of that objective,the ipkca makes it a federal felony for a parent to remove a child from the united states,or to retain outside the united states a child who has been in the united states,with the intent to obstruct the other parent lawful exercise of his or her parental rights.a.
under the sentencing guidelines,violations of the ipkca are assessed under,which applies to obstruction of justice offenses.see app.a statutory index.as explained above,the district court enhanced newman sentence by a total of five levels under b and 
b c.newman argues that application of both of these enhancements was error.each is addressed in turn.
section b provides for a increase if the offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice.
b.the phrase substantial interference with the administration of justice includes a premature or improper termination of a felony investigation an indictment,verdict,or any judicial determination based upon perjury,false testimony,or other false evidence or the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.id.cmt.because the term includes is not exhaustive,id.cmt,the definition of substantial interference with the administration of justice in is not limited to the examples set out in the guidelines.see united states probel,cir describing the nonexhaustive nature of the term includes in the context of amer,at the term includes clearly indicates that the subsequent listing of acts warranting this enhancement is not exclusive,and that other similarly or even more disruptive of the administration of serve as bases for the section b enhancement.
the district court found that newman violation of the state court custody decree substantially interfered with the administration of justice,justifying the enhancement.the district court believed that newman decision to abduct his child and secret him in the middle east was motivated by his dissatisfaction with the state court custody decision 
here,the defendant had the opportunity to participate in proper legal proceedings,to be heard,and to make his case.and then,dissatisfied with the outcome,rather than perhaps appeal it or otherwise contest it within the proper legal process,he chose to take the matter completely outside
