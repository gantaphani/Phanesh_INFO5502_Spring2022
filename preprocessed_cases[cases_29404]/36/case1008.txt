we issued an order to show cause to consider whether a juvenile court may dismiss a dependency petition,sua sponte and with no advance notice,at the conclusion of a detention hearing.we conclude that,barring exceptional and exigent circumstances not present in this case,it may not.accordingly,we grant the petition for writ of mandate of the los angeles county department of children and family services department to the extent it challenges such a dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
in december,the department detained then isabella and filed the dependency petition at issue in this writ proceeding.at the time,five of isabella siblings and were dependents of the juvenile court pursuant to a petition the department had filed months earlier the five siblings were in placement with grandparents,the children mother mother was receiving reunification services,and a contested review hearing welf,was scheduled to take place the following month 
the dependency petition filed on isabella behalf alleged that in june,a then sibling of isabella was found suffering from serious injuries caused by physical abuse,including a fractured rib,a fractured skull,retinal hemorrhages to both eyes,swelling to the head and bruises to the face,upper chest,right knee and left ankle,isabella siblings were dependents of the court due to acts of domestic violence between mother and father,which took place in the siblings presence,and mother had failed to participate regularly in counseling to address domestic violence issues 
according to the detention report,mother claimed she no longer had a relationship with father,but the department had doubts regarding the truth of the claim.the report noted that,when mother appeared for a visit,she had a black eye which she tried to conceal from the department social worker.mother claimed the bruise was caused when one of her children hit her with a toy.mother advised that she had been taking two of her children to father for visits,but she was not sure if this was permissible.
the detention hearing took place on the same day the petition was filed.mother counsel argued that the allegations in the petition were not new,and that mother was do ing her work as required by her reunification plan.mother counsel asked that the court order isabella released to mother.counsel for isabella joined in the request.neither counsel asked the court to dismiss the dependency petition.nonetheless,sua sponte and without prior notice,the juvenile court declared i going to dismiss this petition.i sorry.there is no current information in it,and the timing of it is really suspect.i mean,we have a contest ed review hearing for the older siblings in two weeks.i really do not like this counsel for the department objected to the dismissal,noting that i t a detention hearing not an adjudication.counsel also asked for a stay,which the court denied.
the department filed a writ petition challenging the decisions to dismiss the dependency petition and to release isabella to her mother.we issued an order to show cause limited to the question whether the juvenile court had authority to dismiss the petition,and we stayed the dismissal.
after we issued the order to show cause,isabella counsel filed a joinder in the department petition mother filed a return,arguing that the court had authority to dismiss the petition,which she characterized as insufficient on its face.the department filed a reply and an unopposed request for judicial notice,which we grant in part 
discussion 
the question whether a court is authorized to perform a certain act is a purely legal question which entails construction of statutory language and application of legal principles.therefore,we apply de novo review.gilliland medical board th,d barner leeds cal th,d.
no constitutional or statutory provision expressly states that juvenile courts may not dismiss a dependency petition,sua sponte and without notice,at a detention hearing however,as we now explain,when we consider the statutory scheme governing dependency the provisions governing detention and jurisdiction conclude the legislature did not intend for courts to resolve jurisdictional questions in such a manner.
where,as here,the issue presented is one of statutory construction,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citations.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.citations.any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences is to be avoided.citation.allen contracting cal th,d,third brackets in original.
when considering individual statutory provisions,we must keep in mind that a statute must be construed in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among its parts.gilliland medical board,supra,th at,d,original brackets see also in re david th,d welfare and institutions code provisions must be construed with reference to whole system of dependency law,so that all parts may be harmonized.
we begin with section,the statute governing detention hearings.as mother correctly notes,this section does not expressly state that a court lacks authority to dismiss a petition at the detention hearing.this omission,however,is telling,especially considering that the statute does address the options available to a court at a detention hearing.those are either to order the child detained,or order the child released to the parent or guardian,subds.b d.even where the court concludes there has been no prima facie showing that the child comes within section,the only option referenced in the statute is the child release,subd.b see also cal.rules of court,rules rules governing detention hearings make no mention of dismissal.
in contrast,section discusses the findings the juvenile court is required to make after hearing evidence at the jurisdiction hearing the adjudication specifically references dismissal of the dependency petition.the section provides 
after hearing the evidence,the court shall make a finding,noted in the minutes of the court,whether or not the minor is a person described by section and the specific subdivisions of section under which the petition is sustained.if it finds that the minor is not such a person,it shall order that the petition be dismissed and the minor be discharged from any detention or restriction theretofore ordered.if the court finds that the minor is such a person,it shall make and enter its findings and order accordingly,italics added see also cal.rules of court,rule a court may dismiss the petition at the disposition hearing.
thus,the statutory scheme appears to envision that the sufficiency of the dependency petition will be addressed at the adjudication,not at the detention hearing this makes perfect sense considering the limited purpose of the detention hearing and the schedule established by the legislature for resolving both detention and jurisdictional issues.
the detention hearing purpose is reflected in section,which states the juvenile court must conduct such a hearing to determine whether the minor shall be further detained or,conversely,released from custody.it says nothing about determining whether the dependency petition should be dismissed.
aside from the specific code language,the chronological schedule established by the statutory scheme also militates against dismissal at the detention hearing.a detention hearing must take place within three court days after the child is detained.see,subd.a dependency petition must be filed within hours excepting nonjudicial days of detention,detention hearing shall take place no later than one judicial day after dependency petition is filed.considering these time constraints,the department will often have little time to investigate all the relevant facts,marshal all the evidence,and still prepare a detention report and draft a petition.for these reasons,and because fundamental fairness and the interests of the child require that the department and the other parties receive advance notice and an opportunity to be heard before a dependency petition is dismissed,it is at odds with the statutory scheme for judges to summarily dismiss a petition in absence of clear legislative authorization 
our conclusion is bolstered because no interested party will suffer significant prejudice if the sufficiency of the petition is deferred until the adjudication hearing.in the interim,even assuming the dependency petition is insufficient,the child will have been released to the parents see,subd.b child must be released if there has been no prima facie showing,that child comes within section.although we understand parents are likely to be uneasy that a jurisdiction hearing is still in the offing,fundamental fairness and sound procedure,as well the need to protect potentially endangered children should take precedence.in addition,the parents are protected by the statutory right to a speedy jurisdiction hearing.see adjudication must take place within days after petition is filed,unless child was detained when petition was filed,in which case adjudication must take place within days of filing of petition.and,if parents wish to challenge the legal sufficiency of the petition sooner,they can raise the issue by way of a noticed motion.see in re fred d.parent may make a motion akin to a demurrer to test sufficiency of dependency petition super.county,local rules,rule d parent or guardian may file a demurrer which must be set for hearing to challenge the legal sufficiency of a dependency petition that alleges facts which,even if determined to be true,a are not sufficient to state a cause of action,or b are not sufficiently clear or precise for the party to prepare a defense.
although not cited by the juvenile court at the detention hearing or by mother in her return to the department writ petition,we note that section contains a general dismissal provision.it provides a judge of the juvenile court in which a petition was filed,at any time before the minor reaches the age of years,may dismiss the petition or may set aside the findings and dismiss the petition if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require the dismissal,and that the parent or guardian of the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation.italics added.notwithstanding the obvious breadth,nothing in the statute or its legislative history suggests the legislature intended for this provision to be invoked in summary fashion at a detention hearing.before a juvenile court may invoke this provision,it must make certain findings.absent advance notice and opportunity for briefing,argument,and the presentation of evidence by the parties,the juvenile court is not in a position to make the requisite findings regarding the interests of justice,and the welfare and needs of the child at the initial detention hearing.thus,in the ordinary course,section is not an appropriate vehicle for the summary dismissal of a dependency petition at a detention hearing.this may explain why the juvenile court did not purport to rely on it or make the findings required by that section when it summarily dismissed the petition in this case 
although there is no case addressing the specific question before us,our conclusion is consistent with the analysis of some commentators.thus,a leading practice guide explains 
if the social services agency fails to meet its burden to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction,the child must be returned to the parent or guardian.the petition is not dismissed,however,since the detention hearing is not a jurisdiction hearing.the fact that the agency fails to meet its burden at a detention hearing held only a few days after it becomes involved in the case does not mean the agency will not be able to prove jurisdictional grounds at a full jurisdiction hearing held weeks later after it has had time to conduct a more complete investigation.as such,unless all parties,including the agency,agree to a dismissal of the matter at the detention hearing,the court lacks the authority to dismiss the petition and a jurisdiction hearing must be set seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure ed,italics added.
similarly,the california judges benchguide for juvenile proceedings states unless the department and the child otherwise agree to a dismissal of the petition,a jurisdiction hearing must still be held.cal.judges benchguides,juvenile and family court procedures,benchguide,juvenile dependency initial or detention hearing cjer.
we also observe that the judicial council form designed for use by judicial officers to make findings and orders after a detention hearing contains no option for dismissal of the petition.see judicial council forms,form,findings and orders after detention hearing.in contrast,the judicial council form designed for judicial findings and orders after a jurisdictional hearing provides a space for dismissal.see judicial council forms,form,findings and orders after jurisdictional hearing.
finally,as already noted,rule d of the los angeles county superior court local rules specifically provides a mechanism for a parent or guardian to file a demurrer to challenge the legal sufficiency of a dependency petition that alleges facts which,even if determined to be true,a are not sufficient to state a cause of action,or b are not sufficiently clear or precise for the party to prepare a defense.see also in re fred,supra,d at.parent may make a motion akin to a demurrer to test sufficiency of dependency petition.the local rule requires that the motion be in writing and that the matter be set for hearing.at a minimum,permitting a court to summarily dismiss a petition at the detention hearing is inconsistent with spirit of this local rule.
citing the principle that a ll courts have inherent powers which enable them to carry out their duties and ensure the orderly administration of justice in re amber th,d,mother argues that since section does not forbid summary dismissal,the juvenile court has the inherent power to do so.we disagree.
mother relies on in re amber,supra,th at page,d,where the court of appeal explained 
all courts have inherent powers which enable them to carry out their duties and ensure the orderly administration of justice.the inherent powers of courts are derived from article vi,section of the california constitution and are not dependent on statute.citations.these powers entitle courts to adopt any suitable method of practice,both in ordinary actions and special proceedings,if the procedure is not specified by statute or by rules adopted by the judicial council.citation.citation.thus,a trial court has the inherent authority to create a new form of procedure in a particular case,where justice demands it.citations.the power arises from necessity where,in the absence of any previously established procedural rule,rights would be lost or the court would be unable to function.citation.citation.ellipses and second and fifth brackets in original see also rutherford,cal th,d.
