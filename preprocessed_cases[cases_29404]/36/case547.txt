petitioner jeffrey elkins represented himself during a trial conducted in marital dissolution proceedings instituted by his wife,marilyn elkins real party in interest,in the contra costa superior court.a local superior court rule and a trial scheduling order in the family law court provided that in dissolution trials,parties must present their case by means of written declarations.the testimony of witnesses under direct examination was not allowed except in unusual circumstances,although upon request parties were permitted to declarants.in addition,parties were required to establish in their pretrial declarations the admissibility of all exhibits they sought to introduce at trial.
petitioner pretrial declaration apparently failed to establish the evidentiary foundation for all but two of his exhibits.accordingly,the court excluded the remaining exhibits.without the exhibits,and without the ability through oral testimony to present his case or establish a foundation for his exhibits,petitioner rested his case.as the court observed,the trial proceeded quasi by default,and the court disposition of the parties property claims demonstrated that the court divided the marital property substantially in the manner requested by petitioner former spouse.
petitioner challenges the local court rule and trial scheduling order on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the guarantee of due process of law,and that they conflict with various provisions of the evidence code and the code of civil procedure.respondent court counters that the promulgation of the rule and order comes within its power to govern the proceedings before it,and that its rule and order are consistent with constitutional and statutory provisions.
we need not reach petitioner constitutional claim because,as applied to contested marital dissolution trials,the rule and order are inconsistent with various statutory provisions as we explain below,we reach this conclusion because,pursuant to state law,marital dissolution trials proceed under the same general rules of procedure that govern other civil trials.written testimony in the form of a declaration constitutes hearsay and is subject to statutory provisions governing the introduction of such evidence.our interpretation of the hearsay rule is consistent with various statutes affording litigants a day in court,including the opportunity to present all relevant,competent evidence on material issues,ordinarily through the oral testimony of witnesses testifying in the presence of the trier of fact.
although we are sympathetic to the need of trial courts to process the heavy case load of dissolution matters in a timely manner,a fair and full adjudication on the merits is at least as important in family law trials as in other civil matters,in light of the importance of the issues presented such as the custody and of children and the disposition of a family entire net worth.although respondent court evidently sought to improve the administration of justice by adopting and enforcing its rule and order,in doing so it improperly deviated from state law.
subsequent to the trial and our grant of review in the present case,respondent incorporated much of its trial scheduling order into regularly adopted and published local rules of court.as of january,respondent local rules were amended to provide that although declarations still are required from each witness in a dissolution trial,litigants have the option of calling witnesses for direct examination in addition to filing declarations this amendment does not render petitioner case moot,because the prior rule and order were enforced against petitioner.in addition,the amended rules still require the admission into evidence of hearsay declarations,a practice inconsistent with the evidence code.
in addressing the issues raised by petitioner,we also exercise our inherent authority to ensure the orderly administration of justice and to settle important issues of statewide significance.see people kelly cal th,d,in re roberts cal th,d,konig fair employment housing com.cal th,fn,d,burch george cal th,fn,d.in addition to providing guidance to the trial courts,our discussion highlights the unusual burdens and restrictions that have been imposed upon family law litigants at the local level in response to increasing case loads and limited judicial resources.we observe that this problem may merit consideration as a statewide policy matter,and suggest to the judicial council that it establish a task force for that purpose.
marilyn and jeffrey elkins were married on april.they had one child,who was born in.after marilyn subsequently instituted marital dissolution proceedings,the issue of date of separation was bifurcated and tried first.property issues were to be tried on september.
the matter proceeded subject to a local rule of court providing that at trials in dissolution matters,d irect examination on factual matters shall not be permitted except in unusual circumstances or for proper rebuttal.the court may decide contested issues on the basis of the pleadings submitted by the parties without live testimony.super.contra costa county,local rules,former rule b,eff.july.in addition,the rule provided that s ubject to legal objection,amendment,and,all declarations shall be considered received in evidence at the hearing.ibid.under the rule,a party failure to file responsive pleadings,including declarations,in the time prescribed by the rules authorized the court to permit the matter to proceed as a default,or order a continuance and impose a monetary sanction on the untimely party,former rule b.
a trial scheduling order tso or order imposed additional restrictions and sanctions.like the rule,it ordered that all direct testimony at trial be presented prior to trial in the form of declarations filed in lieu of oral direct testimony,subject to.indeed,even if a party witness refused to sign a declaration,the party was required to file an unsigned declaration.
under the tso,the parties were ordered to file initial declarations executed by themselves and by their witnesses court days prior to trial,along with trial briefs.the order provided that the declarations were to explain the appended complete set of trial exhibits,and that a ny required evidentiary foundation for admission of the proposed exhibits shall be completely set forth in the declaration s.
sanctions for failure to comply with the tso were severe.failure to provide initial declarations may result in there being no direct testimony on that issue and issue sanctions may result.failure to file a trial brief indicates to the court that no cases are being relied on by that side.failure to provide a declaration because a witness refused to sign it shall not excuse the filing of any unsigned declarations.italics added.
the tso directed the parties to file responsive declarations and exhibits five court days prior to trial,along with any objections to exhibits,as well as responsive briefs and any demands for the production of declarants for the purpose of.the tso concluded with the following warning failure to comply with these requirements will constitute good cause to exclude evidence or testimony at trial to make adverse inferences or findings of fact against the party.
marilyn,who was represented by counsel,filed her declaration,exhibits,and trial brief on september,and her responsive declaration on september.jeffrey,who was not represented by counsel,filed his trial brief and declaration on september.he failed to attach his exhibits,however,and his binder of exhibits was not delivered to the court and to opposing counsel until one court day prior to the date set for trial.
according to marilyn declaration,the issues to be determined at trial included valuation and disposition of the family home jeffrey right to reimbursement for postseparation improvements to the home the characterization and division of a litigation settlement awarded to jeffrey business the amount of jeffrey income from specified sources the characterization and division of assets withdrawn by jeffrey from community accounts division of a retirement account held in marilyn name the status of certain property declared to be the separate property of marilyn division of the contents of a joint safe deposit box and marilyn attorney fees.the issue of child support was reserved,and the parties waived spousal support.
the matter came on for trial.counsel for marilyn objected to all but two of jeffrey exhibits because,contrary to the tso,jeffrey declaration failed to refer to the exhibits or offer a basis for their admission into evidence.the court had not received its copy of jeffrey declaration or exhibits when trial began,forcing it to review jeffrey copy on the bench.marilyn counsel announced he would not jeffrey if the court sustained counsel objection to jeffrey exhibits,and asserted that jeffrey therefore was not entitled to offer any further evidence.
when jeffrey explained that the procedure he had followed was the same he had engaged in at the trial of the bifurcated issue of the date of separation,the court admonished jeffrey that he had misunderstood the objection raised by marilyn counsel.the court explained in order to get a document admitted into evidence under the trial scheduling order it says that the evidentiary basis and foundation for each exhibit must be set forth in the declaration so the other side can object to see,you know,if exhibits have an evidentiary basis or not.and marilyn counsel is saying that those exhibits do have any foundation in your declaration.so if you can point me to the foundations in your declarations,then dispose of that argument quickly.if not exhibits that do have an evidentiary foundation will be stricken.italics added.
the court provided a typical example of what i talking about with foundation,noting that jeffrey proposed exhibit was not referred to in jeffrey declaration,s o there no way of knowing what this document is without any testimony saying what this is or what it purports to be.italics added.jeffrey attempted to explain that his exhibit refers to an accounting given to my by my wife to me,and this document is in relation to that.
the court responded i understand that.i already reviewed your declaration.tentatively,i am going to rule in favor of marilyn.i going to allow you at one of the breaks that we have so as not to disrupt the flow right now to rethink your argument and give me the specific evidentiary foundations for these documents,but i do see it in your declaration.particularly,the one we were specifically taking about,exhibit,i do see any specific reference to it in your declaration.there a general reference to a general category.italics added.jeffrey responded your honor,there are no specific references in any document.the court,after asking jeffrey not to interrupt,continued there a general reference,and under that general category,arguably,every document that ever been filed in this case would be generally referred to,but what required under the trial scheduling order are the specific evidentiary foundations so that i can rule on them.there being no evidentiary support for jeffrey exhibits with the exception of exhibit and to which counsel for marilyn had not objected because the foundation for the evidence appeared in jeffrey declaration,the objections will be sustained tentatively subject to further argument after the morning break.italics added.no such break ensued.
marilyn declaration and exhibits were admitted into evidence,and she rested her case.counsel for marilyn objected to any consideration of the proposed order filed by jeffrey because the filing of that document was untimely under the tso.
the court stated its understanding,based upon jeffrey declaration,that jeffrey did not wish to marilyn and that he consented to a dissolution of the marriage.jeffrey stated he was resting his case.the court confirmed that jeffrey had withdrawn his request to marilyn,and jeffrey added that he also wished to withdraw his request to expert witness eggers.the court stated well,before you rest,i assuming you would like to admit into evidence your declaration,but jeffrey stated he did not wish to do so.accordingly,jeffrey declaration was not admitted into evidence.without providing the anticipated morning break,the court invited closing argument.although observing that the trial was proceeding quasi by default,so to speak,the court stated that both parties still should address the subjects of the furniture lists and the contents of the safe deposit box.counsel for marilyn responded that those issues had been settled by stipulation prior to trial.
jeffrey confirmed the stipulations and further offered to relinquish his interest in the family home and in his automobile.the court responded that jeffrey offer was too drastic and that the court would permit him to reconsider,stating that the court would render a decision along the lines of marilyn counsel proposed order after trial,despite your request here,because that was not what was before me to be tried today.and so the tenor of what you just said is in contrast to the declaration that you submitted to me that i prepped on,your trial brief 
jeffrey responded that he was not referring to the proposed order he had submitted prior to trial.he declared my concern is that i came into the trial with the intent of presenting my position,and i being cut out of that completely with only reliance on two exhibits which way can defend my position.so i might as well give up my position and leave it to the best of my family.italics added.
the court responded that jeffrey would be well advised to secure legal counsel,and that the exclusion of jeffrey exhibits would not lead to an order depriving him of his interest in the family home,referring again to the proposed order submitted prior to trial by marilyn counsel.jeffrey responded your honor,if you take a spreadsheet and you add up and deduct everything that counsel for marilyn is asking for,i am left with nothing.zero dollars.zero house.zero car.nothing.so what the difference 
the court took the matter under submission.marital status was terminated,and additional issues were reserved for future trial.the court asked the parties to decide by the end of the week whether to submit a settlement agreement presumably reflecting jeffrey waiver of any interest in the community property or instead to ask the court to rule upon the proposed orders that were submitted to the court prior to trial.apparently the parties selected the latter option on october,the court filed a final disposition of the property issues still reflecting jeffrey in the family home.the order noted the parties stipulation concerning child custody and visitation and the court reservation of jurisdiction over the matter of child support.by further stipulation,the parties waived spousal support,and the court jurisdiction over that issue was terminated.the community interest in marilyn retirement account was divided,and the court resolved the additional property issues identified in marilyn declaration in a manner substantially reflecting the order proposed by marilyn.
jeffrey filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition in the court of appeal.he asserted that there was no statutory authority for the local rule and order preventing the parties from presenting the direct examination of witnesses and requiring the evidentiary foundation for proposed exhibits to be established in a declaration filed well in advance of trial.he further argued that the local rule and order established a system of trial by declaration that violated due process principles and placed an unreasonable burden on litigants.jeffrey petition also contended that the sanctions established by the rule and order were inconsistent with the policy favoring trial on the merits,and that their enforcement by the trial court constituted an abuse of discretion requiring reversal of the judgment that resolved the parties community property dispute.
the court of appeal summarily denied the petition.we subsequently granted petitioner petition for review and ordered the contra costa county superior court to show cause why the challenged local rule and trial scheduling order should not be deemed invalid for the reasons stated in the petition for writ of mandate or prohibition prior to hearing oral argument,this court requested and received briefing on the question whether the local rules and order conflicted with the hearsay rule.
as respondent court asserts,trial courts possess inherent rulemaking authority as well as rulemaking authority granted by statute.rutherford,cal th,d,rutherford code civ.proc.it is well established that courts have fundamental inherent equity,supervisory,and administrative powers,as well as inherent power to control litigation before them.citation.that inherent power entitles trial courts to exercise reasonable control over all proceedings connected with pending litigation in order to insure the orderly administration of justice.citation.rutherford,supra,cal th at,d.
the scope of a court inherent rulemaking authority has been discussed in various decisions see,rutherford,supra,cal th at,d,and the outer limits of such authority are clear a trial court is without authority to adopt local rules or procedures that conflict with statutes or with rules of court adopted by the judicial council,or that are inconsistent with the constitution or case law.rutherford,supra,at,d,see also hall superior court th,d.as provided in government code section,subdivision a every court may make rules for its own government and the government of its officers not inconsistent with law or with the rules adopted and prescribed by the judicial council.italics added see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.courts,id.supp.in sum,local courts may not create their own rules of evidence and procedure in conflict with statewide statutes.
reviewing courts have not hesitated to strike down local court rules or policies on the ground they are inconsistent with statute,with california rules of court promulgated by the judicial council,or with case law or constitutional law.appellate decisions have invalidated local rules or restricted their application in many areas of affected litigation,including dissolution actions litigation under the trial court delay reduction act et fast track litigation complex litigation cal.rules of court,rule et and general civil litigation we also have disapproved rules and procedures adopted by the courts of appeal see people pena cal th,d,as well as rules adopted by the judicial council.see people hall cal th,d.
a common theme in the appellate decisions invalidating local rules,and one that also appears in the present case,is that a local court has advanced the goals of efficiency and conservation of judicial resources by adopting procedures that deviated from those established by statute,thereby impairing the countervailing interests of litigants as well as the interest of the public in being afforded access to justice,resolution of a controversy on the merits,and a fair proceeding.
in lammers superior court th,d,for example,a local court rule governing family law proceedings required the parties to file a timely request that the court review the case file prior to a hearing on a contested matter.in order to avoid obvious constitutional issues,the reviewing court refused to endorse the trial court view that the local rule relieved the court of the obligation to read the case file at all when the request to do so was untimely.the court of appeal explained that a measure implemented for the sake of efficiency can not jeopardize the constitutional integrity of the judicial process citation.in other words,court congestion and the press of business will not justify depriving parties of fundamental rights and a full and fair opportunity to present all competent and material evidence relevant to the matter to be adjudicated.id.at,d.
this court made similar observations in garcia mccutchen cal th,d,garcia,involving fast track litigation.et we concluded a trial court was without authority to dismiss an action for failure to comply with local fast track rules,because such a dismissal contravened a statute establishing that sanctions for failure to comply with these rules should fall on counsel,and not on the party,if counsel was responsible for the failure to comply.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
we rejected the trial court argument that such power to dismiss was essential to serve the goal of reducing delay in litigation.we pointed out that the trial court delay reduction act did not elevate delay reduction over the right of a litigant to present his or her case to the court,nor was delay reduction favored over deciding cases on the merits.cases filed in california trial courts should be resolved as expeditiously as possible,consistent with the obligation of the courts to give full and careful consideration to the issues presented,and consistent with the right of parties to adequately prepare and present their cases to the courts.citation.thus,in establishing delay reduction programs,the legislature recognized competing public policy considerations and attempt ed to balance the need for expeditious processing of civil matters with the rights of individual litigants.citation.garcia,supra,cal th at,d.
although some informality and flexibility have been accepted in marital dissolution proceedings,such proceedings are governed by the same statutory rules of evidence and procedure that apply in other civil actions with exceptions inapplicable to the present case.the family code establishes as the law of the superior courts are without authority to adopt rules that deviate from this except as otherwise provided by statute or rule adopted by the judicial council,the rules of practice and procedure applicable to civil actions generally apply to,and constitute the rules of practice and procedure in,proceedings under the family code,in re marcus th,d in re marriage of mallory th,d fewel fewel cal d,conc.opn.of traynor,fewel see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.husband and wife,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,samuels mandabach,practice under the cal.family code.
the rule and order that were applied in the present case called for the admission of declarations in lieu of direct testimony at trial.it is well established,however,that declarations constitute hearsay and are inadmissible at trial,subject to specific statutory exceptions,unless the parties stipulate to the admission of the declarations or fail to enter a hearsay objection,lacrabere wise cal,lacrabere see also estate of fraysher cal d,fewel,supra,cal d at,conc.opn.of traynor,pajaro valley water management agency mcgrath th,d windigo mills unemployment ins.appeals bd.d.reifler superior court d.reifler in re estate of horman d.
the law provides specific exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay evidence see,et,including those governing the admission of affidavits or declarations.for example,in the marital dissolution context,family code section requires various items of proof of fact to be submitted to the court in support of a default judgment and requires such proof to be in the form of an affidavit,subd.a.but there is no general statutory exception to the hearsay rule for contested marital dissolution trials.on the contrary,the existence of a specific statutory exception for default judgments,where an adversary proceeding is waived or forfeited,only serves to support the general rule that hearsay declarations are inadmissible at contested marital dissolution trials.
another statutory exception to the hearsay rule permits courts to rely upon affidavits in certain motion matters.code civ.proc.although affidavits or declarations are authorized in certain motion matters under code of civil procedure section,this statute does not authorize their admission at a contested trial leading to judgment.as this court explained in lacrabere,supra,cal,code of civil procedure section has no application to the proof of facts which are directly in controversy in an action.it was not intended to have the effect of changing the general rules of evidence by substituting voluntary ex parte affidavits for the testimony of witnesses.the section only applies to matters of collateral,ancillary,or incidental to an action or has no relation to proof of facts the existence of which are made issues in the case,and which it is necessary to establish to sustain a cause of action.lacrabere,supra,at,italics added see also fewel,supra,cal d at,conc.opn.of traynor,the fact that section permits the admission of affidavits upon a motion does not mean that the issues in a contested case may be determined and a judgment rendered on the basis of written statements of parties not before the court hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.
the same point was emphasized in reifler,supra,d.in that case the court of appeal considered a challenge to a los angeles superior court policy of adjudicating hearings on postjudgment motions in marital dissolution matters solely on the basis of affidavits.the reviewing court acknowledged that affidavits ordinarily are excluded as hearsay,but concluded code of civil procedure section provides a hearsay exception that grants a trial court discretion to decide motions on the basis of when facts are only so long as the controverted facts do not require factfinding resulting in a judgment.reifler,supra,at.the court expressed no doubt that hearsay was inadmissible at a contested marital dissolution trial.
a recent decision by this court demonstrates the limited application of code of civil procedure section,and also illuminates the policy underlying application of the hearsay rule when questions of credibility arise,as they certainly do in dissolution trials.people johnson cal th,d,johnson.in johnson,we concluded that at a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case,the prosecution can not carry its burden by submitting affidavits in lieu of live testimony.the pertinent statute,penal code section,did not provide for such a procedure,and the historic practice long had been to require oral testimony.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
moreover,as we explained in johnson,allowing a prosecutor to oppose a suppression motion with written affidavits in lieu of live testimony would be inconsistent with the trial court vital function of assessing the credibility of witnesses.johnson,supra,cal th.at,fn,d,see id.at,d.a suppression motion presents issues as to which the credibility of witnesses often is of critical significance id.at,d,and the witness personal presence and oral testimony is significant because it enable s the trier of fact to consider the demeanor of the witness in weighing his testimony and judging his credibility.id.at,d.
we also observed in johnson that,unlike a pretrial suppression motion,the motions referred to in code of civil procedure section are on preliminary or ancillary procedural matters that historically have been decided on the basis of affidavits alone,whereas it is well settled that section does not change the rules of evidence.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.quoting lacrabere,supra,cal,we confirmed that section has no relation to proof of facts the existence of which are made issues in the case,and which it is necessary to establish to sustain a cause of action.johnson,supra,at,d,italics added.
we conclude that respondent rule and order are inconsistent with the hearsay rule to the extent they render written declarations admissible as a basis for decision in a contested marital dissolution trial.as we shall discuss,our conclusion is consistent with fundamental principles established in other statutes.all relevant evidence is admissible,including evidence bearing on the issue of witness credibility,and the oral testimony of witnesses supplies valuable evidence relevant to credibility,a critical issue in many marital dissolution trials.permitting oral testimony rather than relying upon written declarations also is consistent with the historically and statutorily accepted practice of conducting trial by means of the oral testimony of witnesses given in the presence of the trier of fact.see,code of civ.the conclusion we reach also permits us to avoid the difficult question whether the local rule and order violate petitioner right to due process of law,m indful as we are of the prudential rule of judicial restraint that counsels against rendering a decision on constitutional grounds if a statutory basis for resolution exists.nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d.this rule directs that if reasonably possible,statutory provisions should be interpreted in a manner that avoids serious constitutional questions.id.at,d.
as noted,evidence bearing on the issue of credibility of witnesses comes within the basic rule that all relevant evidence is admissible,except as specifically provided by statute.describing a party fundamental right to present evidence at trial in a civil case,witkin observes one of the elements of a fair trial is the right to offer relevant and competent evidence on a material issue.subject to such obvious qualifications as the court power to restrict cumulative and rebuttal evidence citation,and to exclude unduly prejudicial matter citation,denial of this fundamental right is almost always considered reversible error.citations.witkin,cal.evidence ed.presentation at trial,italics added.ordinarily,parties have the right to testify in their own behalf guardianship of waite cal d,and a party opportunity to call witnesses to testify and to proffer admissible evidence is central to having his or her day in court.kelly new west federal savings th,d see spector superior court cal d.
as stated by an appellate court in with reference to a trial court refusal to permit a witness to testify in a marital dissolution matter we are fully cognizant of the press of business presented to the judge who presides over the domestic relations department of the superior court,and highly commend his efforts to expedite the handling of matters which come before him.however,such efforts should never be directed in such manner as to prevent a full and fair opportunity to the parties to present all competent,relevant,and material evidence bearing upon any issue properly presented for determination.matters of domestic relations are of the utmost importance to the parties involved and also to the people of the state of california to this end a trial judge should not determine any issue that is presented for his consideration until he has heard all competent,material,and relevant evidence the parties desire to introduce.shippey shippey d,italics added.
oral testimony of witnesses given in the presence of the trier of fact is valued for its probative worth on the issue of credibility,because such testimony affords the trier of fact an opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses.ohio roberts,d.a witness demeanor is part of the evidence and is of considerable legal consequence.people adams th,d see meiner ford motor d.o ne who sees,hears and observes a witness may be convinced of his honesty,his integrity,and his reliability because a great deal of that highly delicate process we call evaluating the credibility of a witness is based on intuition.
the testimony of witnesses given on direct examination is afforded significant weight at trial in ascertaining their credibility does not provide the sole evidence relevant to the weight to be accorded their testimony.in a contested hearing,the precise words and demeanor of a witness during direct as well as bears on the credibility and weight the trier of fact accords the witness testimony.moreover,observation of a witness on direct is important to the planning and execution of effective.denny superior court th,d.
ordinarily,written testimony is substantially less valuable for the purpose of evaluating credibility.goldberg kelly,d particularly where credibility and veracity are at issue written submissions are a wholly unsatisfactory basis for decision rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,it pretty difficult to weigh credibility without seeing the witnesses.a prepared,concise statement read by counsel may speed up the hearing,but it is no substitute for the real thing.lost is the opportunity for the trier of fact and counsel to assess the witness strengths and weaknesses,recollection,and attempts at evasion or spinning the facts w ith a scripted statement,prepared and agreed to by one party in advance,comes the passage of time and with that lapse may come the party unyielding acceptance of the script.lost to is the opponent ability to immediately test and dissect adverse testimony.denny superior court,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
the historical pattern of a trial as an oral examination of witnesses in the presence of the trier of fact rather than an exchange of written declarations is reflected in evidence code section,which provides that a t the trial of an action,a witness can be heard only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties to the action,if they choose to attend and examine.italics added.also in conformity with the historical form of a trial,evidence code section directs the trier of fact to evaluate witness credibility by,among other methods,observing the witness demeanor while testifying as well as his or her attitude toward the action in which he testifies or toward the giving of testimony.italics added.
although code of civil procedure section provides that the testimony of a witness may be taken by affidavit deposition or oral examination,deposition testimony is admissible at trial only as prescribed by certain statutes not at issue in the present case.moreover,affidavits a term including declarations made under oath,as explained,constitute hearsay and are inadmissible at trial in the absence of stipulation or lack of objection,or as otherwise provided by law.
the only remaining means recognized in code of civil procedure section for taking the testimony of a witness is oral examination.in a provision that again reflects the historical form of the adversary trial in which live witnesses are examined in the presence of the parties and the finder of fact,oral examination is defined as an examination in the presence of the jury or tribunal which is to decide the fact or act upon it,the testimony being heard by the jury or tribunal from the lips of the witness.code civ,italics added.
in sum,consistent with the traditional concept of a trial as reflected in provisions of the evidence code and the code of civil procedure,we conclude that respondent rule and order calling for the admission and use of declarations at trial conflict with the hearsay rule.
respondent contends courts have authority to adopt nonstatutory exceptions to the hearsay rule and that prior decisions approve of such exceptions in marital dissolution matters.cases cited in support of the latter proposition,however see,reifler,supra,d,conclude that statutory authorization,namely code of civil procedure section,exists for deciding motion matters in marital dissolution proceedings on the basis of declarations.as we have explained,this statute does not authorize the introduction of hearsay evidence at a contested trial.respondent has not offered any persuasive argument in support of its claim that an individual local court may adopt a hearsay exception applicable solely to marital dissolution trials despite state law providing that marital dissolution proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the ordinary rules governing civil trials,except as specified by statute.
respondent relies upon this court decision in in re marriage of brown yana cal th,d,brown yana for the proposition that courts have discretion not to hold a full evidentiary hearing in contested family law matters.respondent reliance is misplaced,as we shall explain.
when parties have been unable privately or through mediation to agree on custody,the court shall set the matter for hearing on the unresolved issues,subd.a.it is undisputed that such a hearing is an ordinary adversarial proceeding leading to a final judicial custody determination.brown yana,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d,montenegro diaz cal th,d,see also in re marriage of burgess cal th,d.but once a judgment has been entered in the custody matter,a motion or request for an order to show cause for a change in custody,based upon an objection to the custodial parent plan to move away,requires an evidentiary hearing only if is,only if the moving party is able to make a prima facie showing that the move will be detrimental to the child or has identified a material but contested factual issue that should be resolved through the taking of oral testimony.brown yana,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d.
our decision in brown yana,supra,cal th,d,did not suggest litigants must make a prima facie showing of some kind in order to be entitled to proceed to trial.nothing we said undermines the requirement that at a contested marital dissolution trial,prior to entry of judgment,the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the disputed issues,at which the usual rules of evidence apply.indeed,we explained that a trial court had authority to deny a full evidentiary hearing in brown yana in part because the custody issue already had been fully litigated and the resulting judgment therefore was entitled to substantial deference in the absence of a showing of a significant change of circumstances.id.at,d,see burchard garay cal d,change of circumstances requirement is based upon res judicata principles in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,d.nor did we discuss code of civil procedure section or the hearsay rule in that case 
respondent also refers to evidence code section as authority to admit hearsay declarations as a means of presenting the testimony of witnesses under direct examination.that statute provides in pertinent part the court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode of interrogation of a witness so as to make interrogation as rapid,as distinct,and as effective for the ascertainment of the truth,as may be,and to protect the witness from undue harassment or embarrassment,subd.a.
this provision never has been interpreted as affording a basis for disregarding the statutory rules of evidence or working a fundamental alteration in the nature of a trial.respondent argument would prove too much under its analysis,code of civil procedure section would be unnecessary,because evidence code section a recodification of former code of civil procedure section,enacted in would confer authority to conduct any hearing or trial on the basis of affidavit evidence.
respondent contends evidence code section should be interpreted to afford trial courts the authority to require declarations in lieu of oral direct examination of witnesses,because assertedly similar language in rule a of the federal rules of evidence has been interpreted to supply such authority to the federal courts.see in re adair cir.respondent does not claim,however,that federal procedure includes provisions similar to code of civil procedure section,permitting affidavits in certain types of proceedings not leading to judgment,nor does respondent compare the rules of evidence and procedure we have discussed in the previous section of this opinion with the rules applicable in federal district courts.compare also fed.rules,rule,granting courts authority to admit reliable hearsay in the court discretion.
respondent claims that if we conclude that declarations should be excluded as hearsay in contested marital dissolution trials,our decision will overturn settled practice and cause serious disruption.it does not appear,however,that respondent description of settled practice is accurate.as is evident from our consultation of treatises and practice manuals,it is well settled that the ordinary rules of evidence apply in marital dissolution trials.
the same rules of evidence apply at trial in a marital action as in civil actions generally.thus,facts must be established by admissible evidence,and objections must be properly stated and based on the evidence code or other applicable statutes or court rules a litigant has a right to present evidence at trial and,although the court can exclude otherwise admissible evidence because it is unduly,prejudicial,confusing,or misleading,outright denial of the right to present evidence is error.citations.the court discretion to exclude oral testimony entirely does not apply to trials.samuels mandabach,practice under the california family code,supra.the same source recognizes that some courts nonetheless attempt to place special restrictions upon the introduction of evidence,noting that t raditionally,trial judges have often regarded trials in marital actions as somehow less important than other civil litigation.this attitude has been both recognized and strongly criticized by appellate courts.citations,see also witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,husband and wife,provisions governing civil trials apply unless otherwise specified by statute or judicial council rule,including the rules of evidence.another practice manual explains at a contested trial,affidavits are not competent evidence though made under oath,they are hearsay hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,see also.
commenting upon justice traynor concurring opinion in fewel,supra,cal d,and this court decision in lacrabere,supra,cal,respondent asserts we have limited the admissibility of declarations only when there is no opportunity for.although our decisions indeed have noted the absence of an opportunity for,more broadly they have interpreted code of civil procedure section as applying solely to hearings on motions,and not to a trial of issues leading to a judgment.see lacrabere,supra,cal.at,see also fewel,supra,cal d at,conc.opn.of traynor.respondent also claims the opportunity for satisfies the policy underlying the hearsay rule.as we have explained,however,in addition to allowing a party to adverse witnesses,the hearsay rule assures that the witness will appear in the presence of the trier of fact on direct examination,thereby further aiding it in evaluating the witness demeanor and determining his or her credibility.
marilyn contends that the distinction between hearings on motions at which reifler,supra,d,permits the introduction of hearsay evidence and trials is illusory in the context of marital dissolution proceedings and should not be the basis for our decision in the present case.as she asserts,in many instances the family court retains jurisdiction over marital dissolution matters for an extended period,responding to repeated motions for interim rulings and for modification of orders.yet we have drawn a distinction between hearings at which a judgment is entered,and hearings on postjudgment motions.a postjudgment motion for modification of a final child custody order,for example,requires the moving party to demonstrate a significant change of circumstances warranting departure from the judgment.montenegro diaz,supra,cal th at,d.a presumption exists that the judgment is correct and should not be presumption that would not be well founded were the judgment to be based upon hearsay unless admitted into evidence upon stipulation of the parties.marilyn fails to support her claim that,for the purpose of the hearsay rule,there is and should be no procedural or substantive distinction between motions and trials in the context of marital dissolution proceedings.
marilyn claims petitioner forfeited any claim challenging respondent rule barring oral examination of witnesses on direct examination,because he did not object on that basis.we do not agree that petitioner forfeited his claim.it should have been evident to the trial court that petitioner inability to proceed stemmed both from the local rule precluding direct testimony and the order governing the admissibility of evidence.
in any event,even if petitioner failed to preserve his claim with respect to the prohibition on oral examination of witnesses,he certainly objected to the exclusion of nearly all of his evidence for noncompliance with the court trial scheduling order.the trial court abused its discretion in sanctioning petitioner by excluding the bulk of his evidence simply because he failed,prior to trial,to file a declaration establishing the admissibility of his trial evidence.the sanction was disproportionate and inconsistent with the policy favoring determination of cases on their merits.
although authorized to impose sanctions for violation of local rules code civ,subd.a,courts ordinarily should avoid treating a curable violation of local procedural rules as the basis for crippling a litigant ability to present his or her case.as the court declared in kalivas,supra,th,d,in the absence of a demonstrated history of litigation abuse,a n order based upon a curable procedural defect including failure to file a statement required by local rule,which effectively results in a judgment against a party,is an abuse of discretion.id.at,d.
this court made a similar point in mann cracchiolo cal d,in which an attorney failed to file opposition to a motion for summary judgment within the time prescribed by local rules.we concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to consider the tardy opposition.id.at.judges generally prefer to avoid acting as automatons and routinely reject requests by counsel to function solely in a ministerial capacity.rigid rule following is not always consistent with a court function to see that justice is done.cognizant of the strong policy favoring the disposition of cases on their merits citations,judges usually consider whether to exercise their discretion in applying local court rules and frequently consider documents which have been untimely filed.id.at,italics added.
even under the fast track statute,a demanding efficiency scheme that does not apply in family law matters,subd.a,subd.b,the preference for trying cases on the merits prevails.for example,in hernandez superior court th,d,the reviewing court held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing,in reliance upon a local fast track rule,to reopen discovery.strict adherence to these delay reduction standards has dramatically reduced trial court backlogs and increased the likelihood that matters will be disposed of efficiently,to the benefit of every litigant.citation.here,the trial court orders promote judicial efficiency by maintaining strict time deadlines.but efficiency is not an end in itself.delay reduction and calendar management are required for a purpose to promote the just resolution of cases on their merits.citations.accordingly,decisions about whether to grant a continuance or extend discovery must be made in an atmosphere of substantial justice.when the two policies collide,the strong public policy favoring disposition on the merits outweighs the competing policy favoring judicial efficiency.id.at,d.the fast track rules were not intended to override the strong public policy in favor of deciding cases on the merits when possible garcia,supra,cal th at,d,and we see no basis for disregarding the same strong public policy in marital dissolution actions 
in the present case,the trial court applied the sanction provision of its local rules in a mechanical fashion without considering alternative measures or a lesser sanction,resulting in the exclusion of all but two of petitioner exhibits.had the court permitted petitioner to testify,he could have provided some foundation for his exhibits.in applying the local rule and order mechanically to exclude nearly all of petitioner proceeding,in the words of the trial court,quasi by default the trial court improperly impaired petitioner ability to present his case,thereby prejudicing him and requiring reversal of the judgment 
respondent claims f irst and foremost that efficiency and the expeditious resolution of family law cases support its rule and order.it also seeks to justify these requirements on the theory that they serve to reduce rancor and adversarial confrontation between estranged spouses,and to assist the many litigants in the family law courts by giving them direction as to how to prepare for trial,how to frame issues properly,and how to provide evidentiary support for their positions and avoid being blindsided by the adverse party.
that a procedure is efficient and moves cases through the system is admirable,but even more important is for the courts to provide fair and accessible justice.in the absence of a legislative decision to create a system by which a judgment may be rendered in a contested marital dissolution case without a trial conducted pursuant to the usual rules of evidence,we do not view respondent curtailment of the rights of family law litigants as justified by the goal of efficiency.what was observed three decades ago remains true today while the speedy disposition of cases is desirable,speed is not always compatible with justice.actually,in its use of courtroom time the present judicial process seems to have its priorities confused.domestic relations litigation,one of the most important and sensitive tasks a judge faces,too often is given the treatment.in re marriage of brantner d.
moreover,the amicus curiae briefs we have received strongly dispute respondent assertion that its rule and order promote efficiency,reduce rancor or costs,promote settlement,or aid unrepresented litigants.in their brief,the northern and southern california chapters of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers academy argue that the local rule and order only increase the burden on the trial courts and further strain limited judicial resources,because it is more time consuming for the court to examine lengthy declarations than it is to listen to testimony,leaving courts with two options spend more time than they have available at court to read the lengthy materials,or just give the written materials a cursory review,and rule by guesstimate.this is not a choice favored by litigants,lawyers,or judicial officers.
the same brief characterizes as an absurdity respondent claim that the rule and order help litigants by describing in detail how they must prepare for trial.on the contrary,the brief claims,t he burdens created by the local court rule and order are so onerous that they overwhelm most attorneys,let alone litigants.according to the academy brief,the rule and order restrict access to justice by increasing the cost of litigation.the brief points to the added costs of preparing exhaustive declarations of all potential witnesses,including an evidentiary foundation for all proposed exhibits,and taking the deposition of nonparty witnesses in the event they refuse to prepare a declaration.
the family law section of the contra costa county bar association commissioned a professional survey of family law practitioners in the county,and the great majority of those surveyed were decidedly critical of the rule and order,including the successor to the order at issue in the present case,believing the order did not increase judicial efficiency and,along with their clients,questioning whether courts have the time to read the voluminous binders of declarations and exhibits required by the rule.a substantial majority of family law attorneys in the county also reported finding the rule and order inordinately time consuming,difficult,and costly to comply with 
respondent suggests its rule and order encourage settlement by apprising both sides,well in advance of trial,of the facts that will be presented.local attorneys reported,however,that unfortunately the rule and order have not aided settlement,because parties take extreme positions in their declarations,causing an increase in animosity and a diminished likelihood of settlement.the various amici curiae,including local practitioners,confidently claim that any increase in settlements achieved by the rule and order occur because litigants generally can not afford the substantial added litigation costs created by compliance with the rules.
we are most disturbed by the possible effect the rule and order have had in diminishing litigants respect for and trust in the legal system.the contra costa survey confirmed that litigants believed the rule and order deprived them of the essential opportunity to tell their story and have their day in court,and felt the rule and order caused the lawyers who drafted the declarations to be the persons testifying,not themselves.members uniformly report that their clients are stunned to be told that they will not get to tell their story to the judge,and express shock,anxiety and outrage along with the belief that they had been denied their right to have their case heard by a judicial officer.overwhelmingly,practitioners criticized the rule and order for creating what their clients understood to be a lesser standard of justice for family law litigants.
a recent statewide survey reflects a similar concern with court procedures that do not permit family law litigants to tell their story,a circumstance reported by litigants to diminish their confidence in the courts.judicial council of,admin.off.of courts,on trust and confidence in the california courts phase ii,litigants express ed frustration that they did not have a chance to fully explain their side of the story to the judge public trust and confidence in the courts will continue to be negatively affected by procedures that do not permit litigants to tell their story at some length and in their own words.
we are aware that superior courts face a heavy volume of marital dissolution matters,and the case load is made all the more difficult because a substantial majority of cases are litigated by parties who are not represented by counsel.see judicial council of,rep on statewide action plan for serving litigants executive summary,of the cases have at least one unrepresented party by the time of disposition.in its report,the judicial council estimated that although family and juvenile cases represent percent of total filings,they account for nearly of the trial courts judicial workload judicial council of,ann,italics added.
in light of the volume of cases faced by trial courts,we understand their efforts to streamline family law procedures.but family law litigants should not be subjected to status or deprived of access to justice.litigants with other civil claims are entitled to resolve their disputes in the usual adversary trial proceeding governed by the rules of evidence established by statute.it is at least as important that courts employ fair proceedings when the stakes involve a judgment providing for custody in the best interest of a child and governing a parent future involvement in his or her child life,dividing all of a family assets,or determining levels of spousal and child support.the same judicial resources and safeguards should be committed to a family law trial as are committed to other civil proceedings.
trial courts certainly require resources adequate to enable them to perform their function.if sufficient resources are lacking in the superior court or have not been allocated to the family courts,courts should not obscure the source of their difficulties by adopting procedures that exalt efficiency over fairness,but instead should devote their efforts to allocating or securing the necessary resources.see cal.stds.jud.admin,c.as stated in the advisory committee comment to the california standards for judicial administration it is only through the constant exertion of pressure to maintain resources and the continuous education of personnel and administrators that the historic trend to give less priority and provide fewer resources to the family court can be changed,foll.c.
courts must earn the public trust.see cal.stds.jud,subd.b a b.we fear that respondent rule and order had the opposite effect despite the court best intentions 
the judgment rendered by the court of appeal summarily denying the petition for writ of mandate or prohibition is reversed,and the matter is remanded to that court with directions to issue a writ in terms consistent with this opinion.
i agree that the superior court local rule and trial scheduling order were inconsistent with statutory provisions of the evidence code and code of civil procedure,particularly the hearsay rule of evidence code section,ante,d at,at.i also agree the trial court abused its discretion in excluding petitioner exhibits because the rule and order were inconsistent with state law,enforcing these invalid measures to exclude virtually all of a party evidence was necessarily an abuse of discretion.but given the existence of the local rule and order at the time of trial,i would not conclude that the trial judge acted arbitrarily or unduly mechanically in excluding petitioner evidence.see,ante,d at,at.the trial court excused one breach of the order petitioner late submission of his exhibits and explained to petitioner the other failure of petitioner declaration to establish the foundation for his exhibits.the co
