after a juvenile court referee declared two children dependents of the court,a juvenile court judge denied their father applications for rehearing by signing and dating a denial order on the face of each application on the day after the applications were filed.as to one child,no minute order was prepared by the clerk to document the denial of the rehearing application as to the second child,a minute order was prepared but was dated more than days after the rehearing application was filed.in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that the juvenile court judge handwritten orders denying the applications for rehearing within days of filing satisfied the timeliness requirements of welfare and institutions code section.we further hold the clerk failure to prepare a minute order as to one child and the preparation of a minute order beyond the period as to the second child did not result in rehearing being granted as a matter of law
