facts and procedural history 
this appeal involves three children siblings celine,now five years old,and angel,now four years old,and their half sister,crystal,now years old.the three have the same mother,but crystal has a different father.in august,the juvenile court adjudged them dependents of the court and removed them from parental custody after law enforcement agents discovered a methamphetamine laboratory in the family home.by the beginning of september,crystal was placed with a maternal aunt,while celine and angel were placed with a paternal uncleand his girlfriend.
in april,after efforts to reunify the family had failed,the court ordered crystal into foster care,and she continued to live with her maternal aunt.the court set a hearing under section to select and implement a permanent plan for celine and angel.the hearing was originally scheduled for august,but the kern county department of human services department requested a continuance to search for a prospective adoptive home.the court continued the hearing until late february.
in its supplemental report prepared shortly before the hearing,the department advised the court that the paternal uncle and his girlfriend had agreed to adopt celine and angel.angel did not understand the concept of adoption,but celine said she wanted to be adopted.she understood adoption to mean her uncle and his girlfriend would be her legal parents and she would live with them until she was.the report concluded that adoption with them was the best permanent plan for celine and angel,and it recommended termination of parental rights.
on february,the court held the hearing to choose a permanent plan for celine and angel.counsel for the parents indicated that the parents did not oppose termination of parental rights and the proposed adoption by the father brother and the girlfriend.counsel for the three children,however,expressed concerns,especially in light of the recent statutory change regarding the sibling relationship.she stated that she had unsuccessfully tried to contact the paternal uncle and girlfriend regarding celine and angel.she had learned from crystal aunt that visitation was no longer occurring between crystal and the other two.she spoke with crystal,and crystal would be very hurt and very saddened if her siblings were adopted by other people and she became separated from her sibling group totally.she asked the court to continue the matter again and order a bonding study,because she was concerned there might be emotional interests that could really be in jeopardy,especially with crystal who is older than these kids and her caregiver has concerns about how she would feel if her brother and sister were adopted.the attorney for the father noted that the children had been separated since september,about a year and a half earlier.the court noted,and counsel for the children agreed,that even if the court did not terminate parental rights and permit the adoption,the children would still not be able to live together.but counsel was concerned that the children should visit with each other.
at this point,counsel for the children stated that maybe the court should allow me to conflict out on celine and angel,then i could represent crystal.t his presents a real problem when we are dividing up children and i attempt to represent all three because i know probably going to adoption,being secure,having permanency is really what necessary for all of the kids,and we have a very permanent plan for two of the kids they are all young.i do know if there is that kind of bonding that would scar these little kids never seeing their sister again.the court asked the social worker whether there had been sibling visits.the social worker stated that he was informed the last visit had been in december,but there had been visits before that time.the court noted that the practical consequences of its decision were that it could order sibling visits if they are in foster or guardianship.whereas,if these two are adopted,t he court is out of it.the court interpreted the new code section as focusing on the two children being considered for adoption rather than the older sibling.it noted that those two had not lived with the older sibling since they were infants and they would not remember her they would not have any emotional attachment any more than they would with any other child or one of their little cousins or something.accordingly,the court denied another continuance.
the court then terminated parental rights and referred celine and angel to the county adoption agency for adoptive placement.it set the matter for another hearing the following august and ordered visits among the three siblings in the meantime.counsel for the children,but not the parents,filed a notice of appeal.
the court of appeal affirmed the orders terminating parental rights.it held that section,subdivision c,and its exceptions pertained to celine and angel,not crystal.it also found the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance.finally,it held that any error in not relieving counsel from representing all three children was harmless.
we granted the children petition for review to decide whether the new sibling relationship exception obligates the court to consider the interests of all the siblings or only those being considered for adoption,and under what circumstances the court must appoint separate counsel for separate siblings 
ii.discussion 
a.the sibling relationship exception 
california has a comprehensive statutory scheme establishing procedures for the juvenile court to follow when and after a child is removed from the home for the child welfare.et see generally cynthia superior court cal th,d.the objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.in re marilyn cal th,d.when the child is removed from the home,the court first attempts,for a specified period of time,to reunify the family.cynthia superior court,supra,at,d.in this case,those efforts have failed.when that occurs,the court must terminate reunification efforts and set the matter for a hearing pursuant to section for the selection and implementation of a permanent plan,subd.g.id.at,d.this appeal concerns the section hearing,also called a permanency planning hearing in re marilyn,supra,at,fn,d,that was held in february.
once reunification services are ordered terminated,the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.a section hearing is a hearing specifically designed to select and implement a permanent plan for the child.id.at,d.it is designed to protect children compelling rights to have a placement that is stable,permanent,and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child.id.at,d.the legislature has declared that california has an interest in providing stable,permanent homes for children who have been removed from parental custody and for whom reunification efforts with their parents have been unsuccessful.id.at,d.
the court has four choices at the permanency planning hearing.in order of preference the choices are terminate parental rights and order that the child be placed for adoption the choice the court made here identify adoption as the permanent placement goal and require efforts to locate an appropriate adoptive family appoint a legal guardian or order foster care,subd.b.whenever the court finds that it is likely the child will be adopted,the court shall terminate parental rights and order the child placed for adoption,subd.c.the circumstance that the court has terminated reunification services provides a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights unless the court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child due to one or more of specified circumstances.ibid.the legislature has thus determined that,where possible,adoption is the first choice.adoption is the legislature first choice because it gives the child the best chance at a full emotional commitment from a responsible caretaker.in re jasmine th,d.guardianship,while a more stable placement than foster care,is not irrevocable and thus falls short of the secure and permanent future the legislature had in mind for the dependent child.in re lorenzo th,d.
we thus see that if the child is no one disputes that celine and angel is the norm.indeed,the court must order adoption and its necessary consequence,termination of parental rights,unless one of the specified circumstances provides a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.the specified statutory,exceptions to the general rule that the court must choose adoption where possible must be considered in view of the legislative preference for adoption when reunification efforts have failed.in re jasmine,supra,th at,d.at this stage of the dependency proceedings,it becomes inimical to the interests of the minor to heavily burden efforts to place the child in a permanent alternative home.cynthia superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the statutory exceptions merely permit the court,in exceptional circumstances in re jasmine,supra,at,d,to choose an option other than the norm,which remains adoption.
until recently,section,subdivision c,contained four exceptions to the normal requirement of adoption.effective january,the legislature added a fifth exception,the one at issue here there would be substantial interference with a child sibling relationship,taking into consideration the nature and extent of the relationship,including,but not limited to,whether the child was raised with a sibling in the same home,whether the child shared significant common experiences or has existing close and strong bonds with a sibling,and whether ongoing contact is in the child best interest,including the child emotional interest,as compared to the benefit of legal permanence through adoption,subd.c e stats,ch.this new exception now permits the court to consider the sibling relationship in deciding whether a compelling reason exists to choose something other than adoption.
at the hearing in this case,counsel for the children expressed concern that crystal might be hurt and saddened if celine and angel were adopted.the issue before us is whether the sibling relationship exception permits the court to consider whether adoption would be detrimental,not to the children being considered for adoption,but to a sibling.the trial court and court of appeal in this case held that the new exception permits the court to consider possible detriment to the child being considered for adoption,but not detriment to a sibling.as the court of appeal explained,crystal was not the subject of the termination hearing the court had previously selected for her a permanent plan of foster care.section,subdivision c and its exceptions pertain to the child for whom the court is conducting the hearing to select and implement a permanent plan.the purpose of the february hearing was to select and implement a permanent plan for celine and angel.in order for the court to refrain from selecting adoption as the permanent plan for celine and angel,given their adoptability,it would have to find a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child,in this case,them,subd.c.
we agree with the courts below that the sibling relationship exception permits the trial court to consider possible detriment to the child being considered for adoption,but not a sibling of that child.the plain language of the new exception compels this conclusion.although it concerns the sibling relationship in general,the statute continually refers to that relationship impact on the child being considered for adoption,not the impact on the sibling or anyone else,subd.c e.t he language focuses exclusively on the benefits and burdens to the adoptive child,not the other siblings.the court is specifically directed to consider the best interests of the adoptive child,not the siblings,and must ultimately determine whether adoption would be detrimental to the adoptive child,not the siblings.in re daniel th,d.nothing in the statute suggests the legislature intended to permit a court to not choose an adoption that is in the adoptive child best interest because of the possible effect the adoption may have on a sibling.
counsel for the children argues that the court must examine the relationship among all the siblings in considering the sibling relationship exception and may not restrict its inquiry to the children at issue in the hearing before the court.in a way,this is correct.the sibling relationship with the child is not irrelevant.certainly,evidence of the sibling relationship with the child and,if the sibling is articulate,perhaps of the sibling views of that relationship,might be relevant as indirect evidence of the effect the adoption may have on the adoptive child.a nonadoptive sibling emotional resistance towards the proposed adoption may also implicate the interests of the adoptive child.in an appropriate case,the court should carefully consider all evidence regarding the sibling relationship as it relates to possible detriment to the adoptive child.but the ultimate question is whether adoption would be detrimental to the adoptive child,not someone else.this conclusion does not mean that the court must totally disregard the interests of the sibling or the significance of the sibling relationship when it orders adoption.when appropriate,the court can encourage the adoptive parents to agree to visits among the siblings although,as the court recognized in this case,it can not require them to do so,see in re daniel,supra,th at,d.
appointment of separate counsel for separate siblings 
the children argue that the trial court should have appointed a separate attorney for crystal and another for celine and angel when their trial counsel expressed concern at the february,hearing about representing all three.where a child is not represented by counsel,the court shall appoint counsel for the child unless the court finds that the child would not benefit from the appointment of counsel.the court shall state on the record its reasons for that finding,subd.c.here,the court did appoint counsel for the children,although just one for all three.the law has been somewhat uncertain regarding whether and under what circumstances separate siblings must have separate counsel.
the children do not argue that each child must always have his or her own attorney.we agree that the court should not automatically appoint separate counsel for separate children.in a dependency case,each parent generally has separate counsel.another attorney represents the social services agency.counsel for the children is the fourth attorney in the case.thus,four attorneys appeared at the february,hearing of this case.if each child had separate counsel,matters could become unwieldy,especially when there are several children so many attorneys could interfere with the need to resolve dependency questions expeditiously as well as fairly.for example,carroll superior court th,d carroll,discussed further below,involved seven children.separate counsel for each would have resulted in a total of attorneys,which would have made the matter resemble complex litigation.in addition to the obvious inefficiencies of having so many might create scheduling difficulties and push the case in contradictory the serious draining of scarce public resources,separate counsel could also unnecessarily make siblings feel they are adversaries,which could harm their ability to provide mutual emotional support.having a single attorney would also permit the children to consult with their attorney together rather than separately,which can be quite beneficial in the often intimidating environment of judicial proceedings.children interests are not always adversarial,and they should not always be treated as such.
on the other hand,sometimes the interests of siblings are so conflicting that they should have separate counsel.we must determine the exact standard for trial courts to apply when first appointing counsel and thereafter.
some courts have held that the court must appoint separate counsel for siblings only when an actual,not merely potential,conflict arises among them.in re candida th,d in re richard d.another said that there must be separate counsel whenever a potential conflict of interest exists.in re elizabeth d.the relevant statute seems to require separate counsel only when an actual conflict exists.counsel for the child may be a district attorney,public defender,or other member of the bar,provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interests conflict with the child,subd.c,italics added.as pointed out in in re richard,supra,at page,the original bill that became the revised section said,provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interest may conflict with the minor.bill reg.sess,as introduced,italics added.a later amendment deleted the word may,and the language became provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interests conflict with the minor.bill,supra,as amended in assembly july.thus,may conflict,which would seem to include a potential conflict,became conflict,which seems to require an actual conflict.
the california rules of professional conduct rules appear to differ slightly from section.rule c provides that,without each client written consent,an attorney shall not accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict thus,this provision states that at the outset,an attorney may not accept representation if there is a potential conflict it does not require an actual conflict.in carroll,supra,th,d,the court sought to reconcile the apparent tension between section and rule c.
the carroll court first held that an attorney must withdraw from an existing representation only when an actual conflict arises among multiple clients.carroll,supra,th at,d.noting the language of rule,it then considered when an attorney must refuse to accept representation of multiple clients at the outset due to a potential conflict among them.it noted that there may always be at least a theoretical potential conflict among siblings.carroll,supra,at,d.this theoretical potential conflict exists from the commencement of a dependency proceeding because of the possibility reunification will be unsuccessful and the siblings interests may differ at the permanent plan stage therefore,in multiple sibling cases,it can be argued that separate counsel must be appointed for each at the commencement of the proceedings.on the other hand,dependency proceedings often result in reunification and even if they do not,permanent plans do not necessarily involve an actual conflict.although a theoretical potential conflict of interest exists in each multiple sibling dependency proceeding,it appears this potential conflict is theoretical,not realistic.therefore,appointment of separate counsel for each sibling at the commencement of the dependency proceeding would in most cases result in an unnecessary duplication of effort and resources.ibid.
a degree of tension exists between rule,which prohibits an attorney from accepting new representation of multiple clients when a potential conflict of interest exists among the clients,and section,subdivision c,which prohibits representation of a minor in a dependency proceeding and another person or agency whose interests conflict with the minor.rule refers to potential conflict and section,subdivision c seems to contemplate an actual conflict.we believe,however,that in the dependency context the two concepts can be reconciled by a rule that an attorney may not represent multiple clients if an actual conflict of interest between clients exists and may not accept representation of multiple clients if there is a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict of interest between them may arise.by interpreting the rule concept of potential conflict to mean,at least in the dependency context,a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict will arise,it is possible to reconcile the importance of independent representation with the practicality of not overwhelming the dependency system when unnecessary.carroll,supra,th at,d.
counsel for the children urges us to adopt the formulation in carroll as both consistent with existing law and workable in the dependency context.we agree that the carroll court appropriately reconciled section and rule,as well as the sometimes contradictory needs to assure that everyone is properly represented but not to overburden the dependency system or unnecessarily suggest that siblings are adversaries.when first appointing counsel in a dependency matter,the court may generally appoint a single attorney to represent all the siblings.it would have to appoint separate attorneys if,but only if,there is an actual conflict among the siblings or if circumstances specific to the just the potential for conflict that inheres in all multisibling dependency a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict will arise.if these specific circumstances exist,the court should appoint separate counsel at the outset rather than await an actual conflict and the possible disruption a later reappointment may cause.after the initial appointment,the court will have to relieve counsel from multiple representation if,but only if,an actual conflict arises.
nothing in the record indicates there was a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict would arise among the siblings when the court first appointed counsel in this matter.the children do not argue otherwise.the children,however,argue that the court was required to appoint separate counsel at the february,hearing when counsel cited the new sibling relationship exception of section,subdivision c e,and expressed concern that the adoption of celine and angel would have a negative impact on crystal.in a similar situation,the carroll court concluded that groups of siblings that
