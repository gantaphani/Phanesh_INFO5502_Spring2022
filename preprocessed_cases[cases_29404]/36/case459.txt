background 
petitioner was born in the philippines in,to stanley scales,scales,an american at the time,and aily topaz,a philippine citizen.scales and topaz met during the first week of september,and one week later,topaz told scales that she was pregnant,probably from a prior relationship.topaz and scales were married on march,and petitioner was born on april.when petitioner was two years old,the family moved to texas,where they lived until about,at which time they moved to the state of washington,where they all apparently still live.scales and topaz separated in.there is nothing in the record to indicate that scales has ever treated petitioner as other than his own son.
on january,petitioner was convicted in the superior court for king county,washington,of a violation of the uniform controlled substances act,for possession with intent to deliver cocaine.on february,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause,charging petitioner as deportable under ina a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony 
at his deportation hearing,petitioner conceded that he was a citizen of the philippines,and that he was deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.on appeal to the bia,however,petitioner contended that he is actually a citizen,based on the principle that children born during a valid marriage are presumed offspring of that marriage.petitioner also argued that it was possible that scales was his natural father.the bia rejected his arguments on the merits,citing an affidavit of that his father had signed in order to obtain an immigrant visa for petitioner when the family moved to the united states in.in the affidavit,scales stated that he was not petitioner natural father,that his wife was pregnant at the time she and scales met,and that he accept ed petitioner as his own son in every legal sense permissible,but did not make any attempts of making a claim for citizenship for him at this time or at any other time.
the bia reasoned that,in order to acquire united states citizenship at birth there must be a blood relationship between the child and the parent through whom citizenship is claimed,citing the foreign affairs manual of the state department.because there was no evidence in the record that petitioner was scales biological child,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia further rejected petitioner claim for relief under ina c,citing,inter alia,aedpa d and matter of soriano,int,wl,holding that aedpa d applied retroactively to bar c relief.
standard of review 
where,as here,the bia conducts a de novo review of the record,our review is limited to the decision of the bia,except to the extent that the immigration judge decision is expressly adopted by the board.see ghaly ins,cir.factual determinations of the bia are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard,and are upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.andriasian ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the bia determination of purely legal questions regarding the ina is reviewed de novo.see ins,cir.
the applicable law for transmitting citizenship to a child born abroad when one parent is a citizen is the statute that was in effect at the time of the child birth.united states,cir.quoting ablang reno,cir,cert.denied,d.in,the year of petitioner birth,the applicable statute provided,inter alia,that a person shall be a national and citizen of the united states at birth who is 
born outside the geographical limits of the united states and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien,and the other a citizen of the united states who,prior to the birth of such person,was physically present in the united states or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years,at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years provided,that any periods of honorable service in the armed forces of the united states may be included in order to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph.
a redesignated in as g.in addition,provided 
the term child means an unmarried person under years of age and includes a child legitimated under the law of the child residence or domicile,or under the law of the father residence or domicile,whether in the united states or elsewhere,and a child adopted in the united states,if such legitimation or adoption takes place before the child reaches the age of sixteen years,and the child is in the legal custody of the legitimating or adopting parent or parents at the time of such legitimation or adoption.
c.petitioner contends that,under the law of washington,where the family has resided since petitioner was years old,there is a presumption that a man is the natural father of a child born during marriage.see.he thus argues that he was legitimated for purposes of c and therefore meets the citizenship requirement of a of being born of a citizen parent.
the government,on the other hand,points to scales affidavit of and petitioner own admission in his deportation hearing that he is a philippine citizen as proof of petitioner alienage.in deportation proceedings,the ins has the burden of establishing the facts supporting deportability by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.woodby ins,d see also murphy ins,cir.evidence of foreign birth,however,gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of alienage,and the burden then shifts to the petitioner to prove citizenship.see ins,cir see also matter of leyva,bia.
petitioner concedes that he was born in the philippines,giving rise to the presumption of alienage.the circumstances surrounding his birth are not generally disputed,although petitioner contends that it is possible that scales is actually his natural father.therefore,petitioner arguments in support of his citizenship rely not so much on disputed facts as on the washington presumption that scales is his father because he was born in wedlock this presumption,that scales is petitioner natural father,in turn,may be rebutted only by clear,cogent,and convincing evidence.the government contends that the presumption is overcome by scales affidavit of.
there are two sources of citizenship,and two only birth and naturalization.miller albright,d q
