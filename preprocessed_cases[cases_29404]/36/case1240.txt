introduction 
appellant catherine challenges an order of the trial court denying her request for attorney fees under family code section.section gives the court discretion to award attorney fees to a party for the costs associated with actions brought pursuant to california uniform parentage act,et 
catherine sought attorney fees she incurred relating to an order to show cause osc she filed seeking modification of a custody and visitation order entered in a paternity action previously instituted by her daughter father,robert j.the parties had stipulated to paternity in the paternity action.the trial court concluded that once the trial court adopted the stipulation and paternity was established,there was no longer an action in which attorney fees could be awarded.according to the trial court,the attorney fees provision of the cupa grants courts the power to award attorney fees only for those proceedings that take place prior to final judgment on the issue of paternity.the trial court thus concluded that it was without discretion to award catherine attorney fees for the costs of preparing for and litigating the custody and visitation issues raised by the osc she filed after the final order of paternity had been entered.
we disagree with the trial court interpretation of section,and conclude that section gives the trial court discretion to award attorney fees for proceedings on the issues of custody,visitation,and support that occur after paternity has been established after judgment.thus,the trial court had discretion to grant or deny catherine request for attorney fees.because the court concluded that it did not have discretion,and acted accordingly,we reverse and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to determine whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate in this situation.
factual and procedural background 
on march,robert filed a petition to establish paternity of his unborn daughter,robert asked the court to determine that he had a relationship with,and to award the parties joint legal custody,with robert having physical custody and catherine being allowed reasonable visitation.filed with the petition was a stipulated order for paternity,custody,and visitation.the stipulation incorporated a detailed custody and visitation agreement between robert and catherine and their attorneys.the agreement provided that robert would have physical custody of,and catherine would have reasonable visitation with at robert house.
on september,catherine filed an osc requesting that the existing custody and visitation order be modified.she sought sole physical custody of,with robert to be allowed reasonable visitation,on both an interim and basis.she requested that robert be required to submit to a psychological examination,appointment of an attorney for to be paid by robert,guideline child support,and attorney fees for the costs of bringing the osc.
on october,robert filed an osc to bifurcate the custody issue from the child support issue and to try the custody issue first.robert filed a responsive declaration to catherine osc on october.
on november,the court heard arguments as to the custody issue raised by catherine osc.concerned with a possible risk of harm to if catherine were awarded custody,the court denied the request for an interim change in custody and refused to allow catherine unsupervised visitation.the court ordered a full psychological evaluation of the parties and,and an alcohol and drug assessment of catherine.
on december,robert filed a reply declaration and a memorandum of points and authorities opposing catherine request for attorney fees and costs.
on june,robert filed a revised and supplemental memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to catherine request for attorney fees.robert argued that section did not allow for an award of attorney fees after judgment had been entered in the case.
on june,both parties filed supplemental declarations regarding their respective financial positions and statements regarding the financial circumstances of the other party.robert sought a statement of decision from the court pertaining to a number of legal and factual issues,including the legal authority for an award of fees to catherine.
the court held a hearing on the attorney fees issue on june.the court filed its statement of decision,which included its findings and orders,on july.the court denied catherine request for fees,concluding,
section by its terms authorizes this court to order reasonable fees and other costs of the action and pretrial proceedings.the issue of paternity has been resolved with practical finality.the parties stipulated to it,the court adopted that stipulation as an order of the court the action in this paternity case had concluded and there will be no trial on the issue of paternity.the instant motion does not fall within the ambit of family code because the action has in effect concluded.there is no statutory basis for an award of attorney fees to respondent.there is no provision for an award of fees,or of fees incurred in a related proceeding,with respect to paternity actions.
on july,the court issued its findings and order after hearing,to which it attached and incorporated by reference the findings made in its july statement of decision.on september,catherine filed a notice of appeal from the july order.
discussion 
at issue in this case is the scope of a court authority to award attorney fees in an action to establish paternity under the cupa.specifically,the question presented is whether a court may award attorney fees arising from proceedings that occur after the entry of a final order or judgment.interpretation of the statute presents a question of law,which is subject to de novo review.see banning newdow th,d banning.
catherine contends that the trial court erred in concluding that section does not grant it the authority to award attorney fees for the costs of litigating her requests to modify the custody,visitation and support order.section provides 
the court may order reasonable fees of counsel,experts,and the child guardian ad litem,and other costs of the action and pretrial proceedings,including blood tests,to be paid by the parties,excluding any governmental entity,in proportions and at times determined by the court.
by its text,the statute allows for an award of attorney fees for the costs of the action.what is not apparent,however,is what the term action means in this context.neither the cupa nor the general provisions of the family code provide a definition of action to aid us in our analysis.
robert contends that an action under the cupa exists only where there remains a controversy as to the issue of paternity,and that an action ends upon judgment when the issue of paternity is resolved.thus,once a judgment is entered in a case brought pursuant to the cupa,the action is extinguished.although no formal judgment was entered in this case,robert contends that the order of the court accepting the parties stipulation as to paternity ended the controversy and,therefore,like a judgment,represented the end of the action thus,he maintains,the trial court had no authority to award catherine attorney fees she accrued as a result of proceedings that occurred after the court entered the order establishing his paternity.
we disagree that the final paternity determination is necessarily equivalent to a judgment,or that either the final paternity determination or a formal judgment signifies the end of an action pursued under the cupa.rather,the term action in section encompasses all of the proceedings that occur in a case initiated through a petition to establish parentage,which may include custody and support determinations or modification proceedings that occur after judgment.as a result,an action initiated by a petition to establish a parental relationship is not necessarily extinguished upon the court final determination of parentage or upon the entry of a final order or judgment.
though not specific to the family code,the code of civil procedure provides that a n action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.code civ.this broad definition suggests that an action encompasses all that is involved in prosecuting a case to its final resolution.although a judgment may represent the final resolution of a case in many situations,we are not convinced that this is necessarily true in the unique circumstances presented by family law cases.as the court acknowledged in in re marriage of schaffer th,d,
f amily law cases often do not end at the final judgment of dissolution.because family law cases typically entail issues concerning an ongoing relationship rather than a distinct support,custody and visitation,for law builds in the necessary flexibility to accommodate changing circumstances by postjudgment orders to show cause hearings where the judgment has provided jurisdiction to do so.unlike an auto accident case which might end with a tidy final judgment for money damages,the successive modifications possible in a family law proceeding can make the case resemble an unruly desert caravan strung out upon the sands.
indeed,the cupa specifically contemplates that a petition to establish paternity will likely involve orders regarding custody,visitation,and support,and provisions of the statute grant the court the authority to make such orders.the cupa also grants the court continuing jurisdiction to modify or amend its previous judgments and orders.the court has continuing jurisdiction to modify or set aside a judgment or order made under this part.in doing so,the cupa envisions that an action under its provisions may include a series of proceedings to determine child support,visitation,custody.
of course,if the court determines that a party does not have a parental relationship with the child at issue,then custody,visitation,and support orders are unnecessary.in such a case,the determination of paternity may,in fact,signal that the paternity action has ended.however,in cases where a parental relationship is established,resolving the issues of custody,visitation,and support then becomes necessary for parents who are neither married nor in domestic partnerships,petitions to establish parentage under the cupa represent the only method for resolution of child custody,visitation,and support issues,even if there is no controversy about parentage.there is nothing in the statute that would indicate that proceedings to determine custody,visitation,and support issues,which are only properly considered if a parental relationship has been determined to exist,are not part of an action under the cupa.
at least one court has affirmed the awarding of attorney fees for proceedings held subsequent to the establishment of paternity.in banning,supra,th,d,the appellate court analyzed whether section provisions are constitutional in the context of fees for requests to modify custody and support arrangements.robert argues that banning does not provide authority for this case because the banning court was not asked to consider the question before us what is significant for our purposes,however,is the fact that the attorney fee award challenged in banning arose from custody and child support proceedings that occurred after the paternity issue had been fully resolved.banning,supra,th at,d.thus,as in this case,the paternity issue had been resolved prior to the proceedings for which the court ordered the father in banning to pay a portion of the mother attorney fees although banning resolved the question of the constitutionality of section,and not the question before us,the banning court impliedly had to interpret section as authorizing trial courts to award attorney fees for proceedings held subsequent to resolution of the paternity issue.otherwise,there would have been no need for the banning court to have considered the constitutional question.see wolston reader digest,fn,d,courts should resolve dispositive statutory issues before reaching constitutional issues.banning is thus consistent with our interpretation of the statute.
in further support of his argument that section does not give a court the authority to award attorney fees after a judgment of paternity has been entered,robert refers us to section,the provision that authorizes courts to award attorney fees in dissolution,legal separation,or nullity actions.at the time of this proceeding,section,subdivision c provided for services rendered or costs incurred after entry of judgment,the court may award the attorney fees and costs reasonably necessary to maintain or defend any subsequent proceeding,and may augment or modify an award so made,including after an appeal has been concluded.according to robert,the fact that section does not have a similar specific provision addressing the court ability to award costs for proceedings after a judgment must mean that section does not authorize such an award.
the fact that the legislature chose to be very specific in setting out the attorney fees provision in the context of dissolution cases,however,does not necessarily reflect on the meaning of the words in the attorney fees provision of the cupa.first,there is no evidence suggesting that the legislature adoption of the particular wording in section was intended to be contrasted with what the trial court called the meaningful and specific attorney fee provisions enacted in section,subdivision c.rather than being the result of deliberate drafting by the california legislature,section was simply california adoption of the corresponding provision in the upa it is not surprising,then,that the language and structure of the two provisions are entirely different.for example,section does not make any reference to an action and section does not make any reference to a judgment.under these circumstances,we have no reason to think that the legislature purposefully intended to give a narrow construction to the term action by failing to specifically list postjudgment proceedings as being covered by the provision.rather,an action under this statute should include all of the proceedings that are contemplated to occur within the context of a petition to establish paternity,which by the cupa terms,may include proceedings to determine issues of custody,support,and visitation,and proceedings to modify final orders or judgments.
robert contends that the inclusion of the phrase pretrial proceedings in section suggests that fees for posttrial proceedings are not included in the provision.robert argues that because section refers only to the costs of pretrial proceedings and the costs of the action,the absence of any discussion of postjudgment proceedings such as were referenced in section means that courts do not have the authority to award attorney fees for proceedings that occur after the entry of judgment.
in our view,the specific inclusion of pretrial proceedings does not limit the meaning of action to events that occur prior to entry of judgment.rather,the reference to pretrial proceedings in the statute appears to be a reference to a special separate proceeding provided for in the upa,which was only partially adopted in california.
section of the upa,entitled pretrial proceedings,provided for a specific informal hearing that was to occur after the filing of the petition.west laws ann.parentage act.the upa drafters described this specialized,informal proceeding in subdivision a of the section 
as soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship has been brought,an informal hearing shall be held.the court may order that the hearing be held before a referee.the public shall be barred from the hearing.a record of the proceeding or any portion thereof shall be kept if any party requests,or the court orders.rules of evidence need not be observed.west laws,supra,parentage act,subd.a,brackets retained.
the comment to section explains,sections through provide details concerning the hearing.the purpose of the hearing is to minimize inconvenience and embarrassment in the many cases which the committee expects will be resolved on the basis of the voluntary compromise contemplated by section.west
