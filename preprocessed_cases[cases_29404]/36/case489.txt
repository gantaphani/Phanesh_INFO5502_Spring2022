appellant victor johnson of arizona,putative father of a child born out of wedlock and subsequently adopted by a married couple,filed a complaint in the district court against the biological mother,the adoptive parents and the adoption center of choice.he contended that the utah adoption statute,as applied to him,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.utah code ann.to supp.he also asserted various state law claims.
he sought a judgment declaring that the utah state courts were without jurisdiction over appellant to terminate his parental rights,because the utah adoption statute was unconstitutional.appellant brief at.because the defendants were citizens of utah,or a state other than arizona,he averred subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship.upholding the constitutionality of the statute,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both federal and state issues.
in the original briefing before us,the parties discussed the merits of the constitutional argument.we asked for supplemental briefing on whether a claim based upon a fourteenth amendment deprivation could properly be lodged against defendants,and heard oral argument on the question of whether appellees acted under color of state law.we now decide that appellees were not state actors,and affirm the judgment of the district court without meeting the substantive constitutional question.we affirm also the district court treatment of claims brought under utah law.
the district court originally had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to.a timely appeal was filed pursuant to rule a,federal rules of appellate procedure.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,applying the standard set forth in.c.wright abbott,cir byers city of albuquerque,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.rule c,federal rules of civil procedure.
because of the view we take,only a brief review of the extensive factual and procedural background is necessary.victor johnson and monica rodrigues orozco engaged in a brief sexual relationship in in phoenix,arizona.throughout this relationship,which lasted between one to two months,johnson did not even know orozco last name.appellee.at.indeed,johnson apparently knew very little about orozco.he was unaware of how he had met her,how she was employed,where she was from,where she had gone to school,whether she had siblings,or even the name of her daughter.id.at.he considered his association with orozco to be casual,and when a person he referred to as his girl friend returned from california with the two children he had fathered with her,he promptly ended the relationship with orozco.id.at.
approximately a week thereafter,orozco telephoned johnson home to inform him of her pregnancy.her call was answered by tracy dennis,johnson former girlfriend,who was still living with johnson,along with his current girlfriend,and his current girlfriend children.notwithstanding these unique entangling domestic alliances,johnson drove to orozco home and asked her to take a home pregnancy test he had purchased.he handed the testing materials to her and awaited the results.orozco then told him that she had made a mistake while administering the test,and did not get a result.
approximately three months later,a friend told johnson that orozco was,in fact,pregnant.confronted with this news,johnson took no action.the following month,he was told again by the same friend that orozco was pregnant.again,he did nothing.some three months passed and johnson encountered orozco at a chance meeting in a phoenix mall,when she was seven and a half months pregnant.when he told her that he would be willing to take care of her financially,she told him that because he had not been willing to help her out early in the pregnancy,she was not interested in his help at this late stage.
monica decided to place the child for adoption.on february,she traveled to orem,utah,and contacted the adoption center of choice.it placed her in an apartment to await full term.johnson was unaware that she had gone to utah.on march,orozco gave birth to a daughter,and on the following day relinquished her parental rights to the adoption center at.at,the agency examined the birth certificate and determined that no father had been named.it then searched the utah bureau of vital records putative father list,and found no paternity claims regarding orozco child.later that day,the infant was placed with its adoptive parents.
orozco left utah the following week to stay with an aunt in wisconsin.shortly after the child birth,johnson learned from orozco former roommate that the child had been born.about a month later,on april,johnson went to orozco mother and told her of his intent to seek custody of her daughter child.
there followed a series of legal proceedings.on april,the adoptive parents filed a verified petition for adoption in utah fourth district court.under utah law,a decree of adoption may be entered six months after the child is placed in the adoptive parents home.on may,in an arizona state court,not a utah court,johnson filed a complaint for paternity and child custody against monica rodrigues orozco.however,he did not file a paternity claim with the arizona bureau of vital records.the arizona court ordered johnson,orozco,and orozco baby to undergo laboratory paternity testing,and set another hearing date.
on june,johnson filed a notice of commencement of paternity proceedings with the utah bureau of vital records.soon thereafter,johnson procured domestic relations subpoenas directed towards the utah bureau of vital records and the utah hospital where orozco baby was born.a hearing on johnson request was held in arizona on august,at which time the court ordered the utah hospital to release the medical records to johnson.orozco did not attend the hearing.
on september,johnson filed a petition in the fourth district court of utah to register the arizona court order.the order was filed on september.the final decree of adoption in favor of the baby adoptive parents was issued by the fourth district court of utah on september.
after the adoption was finalized,johnson made harassing telephone calls to the adoptive parents,having learned their identity from confidential information he had obtained.over the telephone,he pretended to be someone else,and asked the adoptive parents personal questions about the infant.the adoptive parents reported the phone calls to the local police,who then contacted johnson.
johnson then filed an action in the united states district court for the district of arizona on november,alleging tortious interference with family relations,violation of the parental kidnaping prevention act,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.he sought damages of,as well as custody of the child.the court dismissed his case on may,holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants.
seven months later,on june,johnson filed the present action in the united states district court for the district of utah.the court granted the motion for dismissal filed by the adoption center and the adoptive parents,stating,inter alia,that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under abstention.see district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d rooker fidelity trust.johnson appealed to this court,which affirmed in part and reversed in part,determining that neither johnson constitutional nor tort claims fell within the teachings of.we determined that neither plaintiff constitutional claim challenging the utah adoption laws nor his tort claim fell within the domestic relations exception.these claims should be considered and decided on remand by the district court.johnson rodrigues,cir.upon remand,the parties filed for summary judgment.the court granted the joint motion filed by the adoption center and the adoptive parents,and denied johnson motion.
shortly before the adoptive infant fifth birthday,johnson appealed the summary judgment ruling to this court.
appellant argues here,as he did in the district court,that he is not basing his claim on.this he does,notwithstanding the fact that the district court opinion begins with the following statement plaintiff victor johnson claims in this lawsuit,brought under johnson rodrigues,order at hereinafter order.it can not be denied that victor johnson is alleging a violation of the fourteenth amendment that provides,in relevant part 
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
const.amend.xiv.
irrespective of whatever label appellant wishes to place on the procedural vehicle he is utilizing to assert a fourteenth amendment deprivation,it is beyond cavil that in order to prevail,the united states constitution requires activity by a state.the procedural vehicle for this action in a federal court is found in the civil rights act of,partially codified in 
the court has explained that 
a claim upon which relief may be granted to plaintiffs against defendants under must embody at least two elements.the plaintiffs are first bound to show that they have been deprived of a right secured by the constitution and the laws of the united states.they must secondly show that defendants deprived them of this right acting under color of any statute of the state.it is clear that these two elements denote separate areas of inquiry.
flagg,brooks,d.assuming that johnson has alleged a deprivation of a federal right,we then proceed to decide whether he has fulfilled the second requirement,namely,a demonstration that either the adoption center or the adoptive parents acted under color of state law.
the court has created a test to determine whether a private person action constitutes state action 
first,the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible second,the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.this may be because he is a state official,because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials,or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the state.
lugar edmondson oil,d.
to support a thesis that appellees acted under color of state law,johnson summarized his argument as follows 
the adoption placement was under color of state law and is thus subject to section liability.it can not be said that appellees are sic nominally private party,but rather they are actors.there is a nexus between what the state requires of appellees and what the state an sic appellees actually do.the relationship is also symbiotic and results in joint action between the state and private adoption agencies.the promotion of adoption is a traditional public power and public function.
appellant supp.brief at.we now turn to these contentions.
it is undisputed that neither the adoption agency,a private party,nor the adoptive parents,other private parties the appellees here,are employees of the state of utah.private individuals and entities may be deemed state actors,however,if they have acted together with or have obtained significant aid from state officials,or if their conduct is otherwise chargeable to the state.lugar,at.
in gallagher neil young freedom concert,cir,we issued a comprehensive opinion that discussed in detail the tenets of what constitutes action under color of law by private parties.we discussed therein four tests delineated by the court to determine whether private parties should be deemed state actors when conducting a state action analysis the public function test,the nexus test,the symbiotic relationship test and the joint action test.
the court has taken a flexible approach to the state action doctrine,applying a variety of tests to the facts of each case.in some instances,the court has considered whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.the court has also inquired whether the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private party that there is a symbiotic relationship between them.in addition,the court has held that if a private party is a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents,then state action is present.finally,the court has ruled that a private entity that exercises powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state is engaged in state action.
under each of these four tests,the conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right must be fairly attributable to the state.in order to establish state action,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights was caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible.in order to resolve the state action question before us,we will apply these general principles and each of the tests articulated by the supreme court.
at citations omitted.appellees respond that the adoption center and the adoptive parents can not be considered state actors under any test.we agree.
the public function test consists of determining whether the state has delegated to a private party a function traditionally exclusively reserved to the states.id.this is an arduous standard to satisfy.while many functions have been traditionally performed by governments,very few have been exclusively reserved to the state.flagg,at.citing jackson metro.edison,d.this often involves situations such as when private parties hold elections,perform necessary municipal functions,or run a nursing facility.in situations such as these,the actions taken were considered to be equivalent to state action,because the private parties performed a service which was traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.
johnson has not presented any evidence indicating that the adoption center or adoptive parents are the exclusive means to adopt children in utah.indeed,four and a half pages of adoption agencies are listed in the salt lake city yellow pages.because all actors involved here were private parties,and there was no exclusive state involvement in the adoption process,we agree that there was no state action under the public function test.
under the nexus test,a plaintiff must demonstrate that there is a sufficiently close nexus between the government and the challenged conduct such that the conduct may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.gallagher,at citing jackson,at.we have stated that under this approach,a state normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the state.id.citing blum yaretsky,d.merely availing oneself of state judicial procedures is insufficient to constitute state action.lugar,at.
johnson has not presented any evidence indicating a nexus between the state of utah and either the adoptive parents or the adoption center.further,he has not demonstrated that the state exercised coercive power or provided significant encouragement to the parties involved.monica orozco and the adoptive parents made a private either state support or voluntarily avail themselves of the state adoption laws.the adoption center made a private decision to facilitate the adoption.thus,no nexus existed between either of the private parties and the state of utah.
under the analysis referred to as the symbiotic relationship test,the state must have so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with a private party that it must be recognized as a joint particip
