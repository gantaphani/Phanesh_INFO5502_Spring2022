erika mother is a member of a federally recognized indian tribe.due to financial difficulties,mother left her daughter,cecelia,in the care of a friend,nicole,and moved away.nicole thereafter assumed responsibility for cecelia parenting and financial support.four years later,mother asked that her daughter be returned to her.when both cecelia and nicole resisted,mother filed a petition for child custody.nicole responded by joining as a party and seeking custody of cecelia herself,but she did not petition separately to be appointed cecelia guardian.following an evidentiary hearing,the family court awarded custody of cecelia to nicole.while acknowledging that the indian child welfare act icwa et applied to the proceedings,the family court made no findings under the icwa because it concluded that cecelia constitutional right to a stable home was paramount.
mother contends that nicole lacked standing to join as a party under the family code,that the court was precluded from awarding custody of cecelia to a nonparent who had not been appointed cecelia guardian,and that the family court erred in finding the icwa unconstitutional as applied to cecelia.we find no error in the family court application of the family code custody provisions,but we agree that the court erred in concluding that the icwa was unconstitutional before applying its substantive provisions.the order awarding custody of cecelia to nicole is reversed,and the matter is remanded for the limited purpose of securing compliance with the icwa.
background 
mother has five children,two older than cecelia and two younger.in,just before cecelia entered the second grade,financial difficulties caused mother,then a single mother,to send cecelia to live with nicole,whom mother characterized as cecelia godmother.cecelia was already well acquainted with nicole and often stayed with her on weekend visits.initially,cecelia resided with nicole during the week and with mother on weekends,but cecelia weekend visits declined in frequency after mother lost her home a few months later.in november,mother moved away,initially within california and then to an indian reservation in montana.cecelia remained behind with nicole.
the arrangements for cecelia care and nurture were informal.mother and nicole considered cecelia residence with nicole to be the result of a mutual agreement,and nicole never petitioned to be appointed cecelia guardian.when asked why she had not sought guardianship,nicole explained,i t has been my goal to support both mother and helping cecelia and to support cecelia,and it did seem to me that it would be supportive to try to take a was placement.my role was to to be there for cecelia and mother and to not try to cause any problem or anything.
from the time cecelia came to live with nicole,responsibility for raising cecelia shifted to nicole,who treated her like a daughter.nicole initially supported cecelia financially entirely from her own income,but this was eventually supplemented with modest child support payments from cecelia father,who had never been married to mother and had played no role in cecelia life.mother provided no financial support for cecelia.
cecelia was given her own room in nicole home and lived,from all reports,a happy and satisfying life,participating in team sports,playing in the school band,forming varied friendships,and keeping pets and a horse.cecelia also formed a strong bond with nicole mother,whom she treated as a grandmother.nicole mother participated actively in cecelia care,taking her to appointments and activities,and attending school functions.cecelia often stayed with nicole mother on weekends.
although mother played no part in raising cecelia day to day,the two did not lose contact.cecelia visited mother during summers and some holidays,spending extended periods with her.native american culture and religion are an important part of mother life,and both she and cecelia participated in native american cultural and religious activities with some frequency,both in montana and california.nonetheless,the pair relationship does not appear to have been particularly close.
in the summer of,mother decided that it was time for cecelia to resume living with her and her two younger children in montana when mother came to visit cecelia in california,however,cecelia refused to return with her,and nicole was unwilling to force cecelia to return against her will.
after the police refused to intercede,mother filed a petition for custody of cecelia.mother filed her petition pro se under the docket number of a prior proceeding brought by the county of humboldt against mother and cecelia father to procure payment of child support.the only other party listed by mother in her petition was cecelia father.
nicole promptly petitioned to be joined as a party to mother proceeding.the family court thereafter denied mother request for temporary custody and granted nicole petition to participate as a party.after the filing of mother custody petition,both mother and cecelia became enrolled members of the wailaki indian tribe,based on mother native american heritage.
the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on mother petition in august.after speaking with cecelia in camera and taking testimony from mother,nicole,nicole mother,and a native american tribal official,the court granted custody of cecelia to nicole.in a written order,the court found that mother had essentially abandoned cecelia and that a bond has developed between nicole and cecelia.it concluded that breaking that bond would be detrimental to cecelia and that vesting custody in nicole would serve cecelia best interests because it would permit cecelia to maintain the settled life she had established in nicole home.the court also noted,the child has expressed her preference to stay with nicole to the court,in camera,as well as to all who would listen.the court finds that the child is of sufficient age and judgment to not only state her preference,but to express in her way the serious emotional trauma she would suffer if she were removed from the only stable home she has ever known.
in considering mother argument that her petition was subject to the placement provisions of the icwa,the family court held,the icwa does not prevail over the child right to have a stable home and environment cecelia has a fundamental right to remain during her developing years in one stable and loving home.based on this finding,the court believes the icwa allows for continuance of the present placement.
ii.discussion 
mother first contends that the family court erred in permitting nicole to join as a party to the proceeding because nicole had no right to custody.specifically,mother contends that nicole lacked standing because the family code permits an award of custody to a third party only under certain circumstances that were not present here.mother relies on a continuing education of the bar publication,which in turn cites to family code sections,and,to support her argument that third party custody may be granted only in the context of a dissolution,legal separation,nullity of a marriage,an action brought by a married parent for exclusive custody of a child,or certain other limited circumstances.cal.child custody litigation and practice.
contrary to the impression created by mother brief,there are no provisions in the family code that specifically limit the types of proceedings in which third party custody may be granted.instead,the provisions cited by the publication on which mother relies are those that define the legal proceedings to which the family code custody provisions as a whole are applicable.if,as mother argues,this is not one of those proceedings,the family court would have been without power to hear mother petition,since her petition was brought under those same family code provisions.
we do not,however,accept mother argument.although the custody provisions of the family code make no express reference to unmarried parents,the provisions have been applied to resolve custody disputes between unmarried as well as married parents,niko foreman th,d.the only subdivision of section that could authorize a petition by an unmarried parent is subdivision f,which applies the family code custody provisions to a proceeding to determine physical or legal custody or visitation in an action pursuant to the uniform parentage act upa,et.while mother did not style her pro se petition as brought pursuant to the upa,a upa petition is the procedural vehicle by which unmarried parents establish their rights each other and their children we therefore conclude that it is appropriate to apply the custody provisions of the family code in this circumstance,which features an unmarried parent seeking exclusive custody of her child.
regardless,nicole was properly made a party to this child custody proceeding.family code section,subdivision c expressly anticipates that child custody might be granted under the family code to a nonparent who has assumed,on a basis,the role of a child parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.this is a codification of the de facto parent doctrine,which grants standing to persons who,like nicole,have come to function as parent to a child,even though not the child natural parent.in re kieshia cal th,d.it would make no sense for the family code to permit such a person to be awarded custody,yet deny them standing to participate as a party in the custody proceeding itself 
third party custody 
mother also argues that,for various reasons,the family court erred in granting custody to nicole.
mother first argues that custody can not be granted to a nonparent who is not a relative of the child unless that nonparent seeks and is awarded guardianship of the child.guardianship is governed by the probate code,which grants broad discretion to the trial court in appointing a guardian,subd.a.once such a petition is granted,the guardian stands in a fiduciary relationship to the ward,and is responsible for the care,custody,and control of,and has charge of the education of the ward,subd.a.a guardian of the person of a minor stands in the place of a parent,whose duty it is to supply that watchfulness,care and discipline which are essential to the young.guardianship of howard cal.
child custody is governed by the family code,which grants similar broad discretion to the trial court.the trial court may make a child custody order that seems necessary or proper.legal custody of a child grants the custodian the right and the responsibility to make the decisions relating to the health,education,and welfare of a child.the essence of custody is the companionship of the child and the right to make decisions regarding his care and control,education,health,and religion.lerner superior court cal d.
although the family code provisions apply to disputes between or involving parents,they allow for an award of custody to others as well.the trial court is guided by a statutory ranking of placement preferences custody by one or both parents is preferred,followed by the person or persons in whose home the child has been living in a wholesome and stable environment,followed by any other person or persons deemed by the court to be suitable,subd.a.in order to award custody to a nonparent over the objection of a parent,the court must find that granting custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the best interest of the child,subd.a.
as suggested by the foregoing,the role and responsibilities of a guardian appointed under the probate code are essentially identical to those of a nonparent custodian selected under the family code.the connection is made explicit by probate code section,subdivision b,which states that when a court appoints a guardian of the person of a minor,it must be guided by family code sections,and other words,it must make the identical judgment required in appointing a nonparent custodian.see,guardianship of olivia th,d.accordingly,a guardian and a nonparent child custodian under the family code have essentially identical rights with respect to the child.
we find no authority to support mother contention that nonparent custody can not be granted to a nonrelative under the family code in the absence of a guardianship petition.there is no statutory requirement for such a petition.on the contrary,the provisions of the family code make no reference to guardianship or the probate code,yet they plainly permit an award of custody to a nonparent.family code.the two systems,guardianship in the probate code and custody in the family code,are parallel and independent.
mother points out that custody of a child has rarely been awarded to a nonparent outside the context of a guardianship petition.assuming this is true,it does not mean that a guardianship petition is a necessary prerequisite for nonparent child custody.on the contrary,the explanation for the prevalence of guardianship petitions appears to be procedural.the custody provisions of the family code apply only in proceedings that are generally,if not invariably,initiated by the parents of a child.further,they have been held not to provide an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction.in re marriage of lewis goetz d.a nonparent seeking custody therefore lacks standing to initiate a custody proceeding under the family code.a guardianship petition under the probate code is the only judicial means for a nonparent to obtain custody when the parents have not themselves initiated a custody proceeding.
mother also makes the broader argument that a nonparent can never be awarded custody of a child under the family code when a parent such as mother is available to assume custody of the child and actively seeks custody.this argument is contradicted by family code section,which anticipates that custody can be awarded to a nonparent even over parental objection further,family code section,subdivision c states that custody can be awarded to a third party even though the child parents have not been found unfit,expressly contradicting mother argument that nonparent custody can never be awarded when an otherwise suitable parent is available and willing to accept custody.
nor do we find any merit in mother argument that family code section,subdivisions a and c are inapplicable to a child who originally came into the care of the nonparent as a result of a consensual arrangement.section makes no such distinction,and we find no basis in policy to imply an exception for consensual foster care.regardless of the manner in which the child came into foster care,subdivision c authorizes a finding of detriment to the child from the harm of removal from a stable placement of a child with a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of his or her parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.we find no abuse of discretion in the family court conclusion that the statutory requirements of detriment and best interest were satisfied in these circumstances.see montenegro diaz cal th,d.
the family court assumed,as we do,that mother and cecelia enrollment in the wailaki tribe was sufficient to make cecelia an indian child for purposes of the icwa.mother contends that,as a result,the icwa was applicable to these proceedings and that the family court decision violated the icwa.
under california law implementing the icwa at the time of this proceeding,special rules applied to a proceeding leading to the foster care placement of an indian child.former cal.rules of court,rule j k.because a f oster care placement was defined as any temporary placement from which a child may not be removed by the parent or indian custodian upon demand,including the home of a guardian or conservator former cal.rules of court,rule a,cecelia custody hearing qualified as such a proceeding.accordingly,the family court could not award custody to nicole over mother unless it found by clear and convincing evidence that continued custody with the parent or indian custodian is likely to cause the indian child serious emotional or physical damage.former rule j.further,the finding o
