amber,the mother of sabrina,dakota,ashley,christina and christopher,appeals the juvenile court orders that detained and placed some of her children in mexico after they were taken into protective custody.
amber contends that detention and placement of dependent children in a foreign country is inimical to juvenile court law and the court lacked jurisdiction to place the children in a mexican residence without adequate background checks of the caregiver.amber also contends the detention of her children in mexico violated the statutory requirements of prior notice to the parent and a showing of good cause for a placement outside of san diego.additionally,amber contends the court abused its discretion in placing the children in the mexican home of the caregiver.
on march,dakota,then years old,was admitted to a hospital psychiatric ward for children after he threatened to kill amber,his and christopher father.the hospital was ready to release dakota on april,but amber refused to pick him up and bring him home because she was afraid for her other children.on april agency filed a dependency petition on behalf of dakota,alleging he had a mental disorder requiring mental health treatment and did not have a parent capable of providing appropriate care.welf,subd.c.
on may,at the jurisdictional hearing,amber submitted to dakota petition on the basis of the social worker reports.the court continued the jurisdictional hearing and the dispositional hearing pending the results of a psychological evaluation of dakota.
on may police responded to a call reporting a family disturbance at the home of amber and christopher father.christopher father was lying in the front yard,and amber was sitting on the patio.amber smelled of alcohol and her speech was slurred when she talked to police.amber said she and christopher father had been together for several years and had been involved in approximately domestic violence incidents.amber said they had been fighting on and off for the last four days,and he had hit her and the children.according to amber,christopher father pushed christopher,then two years old,to the floor on one occasion,and ashley,then nine years old,to the floor on another occasion.
on june agency took sabrina,ashley,christina and christopher into protective custody.they were detained in two foster homes.on june agency filed dependency petitions on behalf of these four children,alleging they were at substantial risk of harm because they were periodically exposed to domestic violence in the home and their parents used alcoholic beverages to excess,subd.b.in ashley petition,the section,subdivision b allegation also included a separate count alleging that her stepfather had subjected her to physical abuse.christopher petition also contained an allegation that he had suffered or was at substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally by his father,subd.a.sabrina,ashley and christina petitions contained an allegation that each of them was at substantial risk of being abused based on the physical abuse of christopher,subd.j.
on june alfredo,christopher paternal grandfather,told the social worker that he was willing to care for all five children.alfredo said he had a house in ensenada,mexico,which could accommodate the children,and sufficient income to provide for them.alfredo said all of the children except dakota had spent days in his home during easter vacation.according to the social worker,the children indicated they were willing to go to alfredo home.agency requested desarrollo integral de la familia dif,a mexican social services agency,to conduct an evaluation of alfredo home.
on june agency received the dif evaluation of alfredo home.the evaluation was very favorable,and dif agreed to supervise the case on a monthly basis while the children were in mexico.according to the dif report,alfredo was years old and retired.since alfredo lived with beth,whom he had known for years.beth was years old and had completed two years of college.alfredo and beth denied having any criminal history.
the dif report stated that alfredo and beth home had three bedrooms and three bathrooms,a dining room,a receiving room,a kitchen,a laundry room and a carpentry workshop.the neighborhood was peaceful and the house was close to a primary school and a medical center.the dif report indicated alfredo and beth had sufficient means to pay for the medical care of the children.
agency adopted the dif recommendation that the children be detained with alfredo in mexico.
on june,at the hearing for the children,amber,who opposed placement of the children in mexico,requested a trial.after amber counsel questioned whether the court had the authority to place the children in a foreign country before it took jurisdiction over the children,the court acknowledged counsel had presented a legal issue.nonetheless,the court granted agency discretion to detain the children with alfredo in mexico.the court suggested that amber could challenge its ruling by filing a writ petition 
on july,at the contested hearing for sabrina,ashley,christina and christopher,the court sustained the dependency petitions and found the allegations of each child petition to be true by clear and convincing evidence.the court continued the dispositional hearing until the home evaluation of the maternal grandmother was completed 
by early august,sabrina and ashley,who were having emotional problems,were in foster homes in san diego county.christina and christopher remained in mexico under the care of alfredo.
amber did not attend the contested dispositional hearing on august,and the matter was submitted.the court declared sabrina,ashley,christina and christopher dependent children,removed them from amber custody and ordered amber to comply with her case plan the court placed sabrina and ashley in a licensed foster home and ordered psychological evaluations of the girls.the court placed christina and christopher with alfredo in mexico 
on august timothy,the father of ashley and christina,telephoned the juvenile court and requested counsel be appointed to represent him.the court granted the request.
on august timothy,who lived in north carolina,appeared in juvenile court and requested presumed father status and an expedited evaluation of his home under the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc.the court granted timothy presumed father status in ashley and christina cases,and ordered an expedited icpc evaluation of his home.
the social worker contacted alfredo about bringing christina to san diego county for a visit with timothy.alfredo responded that he was unable to do so before timothy returned to north carolina.alfredo said if he brought christina to the united states he would have to leave her in this country to be placed in a new home.christina told the social worker that she did not want to leave her placement with alfredo for a visit with timothy until he was evaluated and approved.christina said she did not want to be moved back and forth from homes where she did not know the caregiver.
discussion 
placement of dependent children in mexico is not contrary to the interests of dependency law 
amber contends the juvenile court lacked the authority to detain or place the children in mexico because the juvenile law,by not expressly providing for the detention and placement of dependent children outside the united states,implicitly prohibits such placements.amber also contends placement of dependent children in foreign countries is inimical to the primary purpose of the juvenile,preservation of the family.these contentions lack merit.
we reject amber statutory construction argument based on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,which means the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other things not expressed,fair employment housing com.cal d,fn.first,the application of this statutory construction tool to an entire code is questionable.the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is generally applied to a specific statute,which contains a listing of items to which the statute applies.under the familiar rule of construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute,other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed.mutual life ins.city of los angeles cal d,see also people johnson cal d,under the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius we must infer that the listing of terms and conditions is complete,and that there are no additional requirements which bind petitioner.our supreme court has characterized the maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius as a mere guide to be utilized when a statute is ambiguous,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.
there are other limitations to this maxim of statutory construction.t he maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is inapplicable where no reason exists why persons and things other than those enumerated should not be included,and manifest injustice would follow by not including them people reed cal th,d.further,in estate of banerjee cal d,the supreme court noted it is true that the canon of construction upon which respondent rests its case should be applied where appropriate and necessary to the just enforcement of the provisions of a statute.citation.nevertheless,expressio unius est exclusio alterius is no magical incantation,nor does it refer to an immutable rule.like all such guidelines,it has many exceptions the high court listed some of the exceptions as follows 
the rule is inapplicable where no manifest reason exists why other persons or things than those enumerated should not be included and thus exclusion would result in injustice citation to a statute the language of which may fairly comprehend many different objects,some of which are mentioned merely by way of example,without excluding others of similar nature citation to a matter which is only incidentally dealt with in a statute citation where its application would run counter to a well established principle of law.id.at,fn.
in in re michael cal d,the supreme court observed this rule,of course,is inapplicable where its operation would contradict a discernible and contrary legislative intent.
amber does not point to any specific statute that lists a series of permissible placements and omits placements in foreign countries.applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius to the welfare and institutions code to prohibit foreign placement of dependent children would be at odds with the legislative intent and with basic goals of juvenile court,to protect and serve the best interest of dependent children.see.amber has not pointed to the existence of any manifest reason supporting a ban on child placements in a foreign country.if a foreign placement is in the best interest of a child,such a ban would result in an injustice.for all these reasons,we decline to apply the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius to the welfare and institutions code and thereby read an implicit ban on placing dependent children in foreign countries.adding language into a statute violate s the cardinal rule of statutory construction that courts must not add provisions to statutes.security pacific national bank wozab cal d.it is against all settled rules of statutory construction that courts should write into a statute by implication express requirements which the legislature itself has not seen fit to place in the statute.in re rudy th,d.in other words,had the legislature intended a ban on placement of dependent children in a foreign country,it could have explicitly enacted one.
furthermore,although there is no explicit statute in the welfare and institutions code which contains much of juvenile dependency law providing for placement of dependent children in foreign countries,there are statutory provisions regarding such placements in the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act the act,et the act applies to juvenile dependency proceedings and international custody disputes.in re stephanie cal th,d.foreign countries are treated as states for jurisdictional purposes,subd.a.california courts have subject matter jurisdiction under the act when california is the home state of the children,subd.a 
amber statutory arguments also ignore published case law that recognizes foreign placement of dependent children.for example,in in re angelica th,d,this court affirmed the adoption of the dependent children by the grandmother,who moved with the children to mexico.also,in in re stephanie,supra,cal th at pages,d,to,the supreme court implicitly recognized placement of dependent children in mexico as an option available to the juvenile court.
contrary to amber argument,the placement of a dependent child in a foreign country is not necessarily inimical to the juvenile dependency law goal of reunification and does not necessarily stifle frequent visitation for parents.we realize visitation is an important component of reunification.however,in communities that are located along the border,such as san diego county,placement of the child in the neighboring country may result in shorter distances for the parent to travel than placement in another county or a different state.further,placement of children with relatives or extended family members is preferred over foster care.see.in some cases,the child has no relatives other than those living in the foreign country.prohibiting all placements of dependent children in a foreign country would deprive those children of being placed with relatives and extended family members,which is contrary to the legislative goal of promoting placement of dependent children with relatives by giving such placements preferential consideration.see fn,ante.
amber has not shown that foreign placements of dependent children is contrary to the interests of juvenile dependency law.
ii.criminal and child abuse background checks should have been conducted before placing children with alfredo in mexico 
amber contends the juvenile court erred by detaining sabrina,ashley,christina and christopher in alfredo home before required criminal and child abuse background checks of him and beth had been completed,and placing christina and christopher in alfredo home before the required background checks were completed.agency counters that the issues are moot.
detention placement proper 
the record on appeal supports agency mootness argument with respect to the detention of the children in alfredo home.this is an appeal of the judgment following a dispositional hearing of the children hence,the dispositional hearing has taken place.see in re richard d.erroneous failure to follow detention hearing procedural requirements rendered moot by subsequent jurisdiction and disposition proceedings.furthermore,by the time of the dispositional hearing,sabrina and ashley were no longer living in alfredo home they were in foster care 
ordinarily,we do not address moot issues however,in this case we reach the issue because it is important to distinguish the standards applicable to detaining dependent children in a relative home before the dispositional hearing and the standards applicable to placing dependent children in a relative home at the dispositional hearing.
the propriety of an order detaining a dependent child in a relative home is subject to the provisions of section,subdivision d.in re miguel th,d.section,subdivision d concerns the agency assessment and approval of a relative home for temporary placement of the child pending the detention hearing.in re miguel,supra,at,citing,subd.d see also,subd.f.
section,subdivision d provides in pertinent part 
if an able and willing relative,as defined in section,or an able and willing nonrelative extended family member,as defined in section,is available and requests temporary placement of the child pending the detention hearing,the county welfare department shall initiate an assessment of the relative or nonrelative extended family member suitability,which shall include an inspection to assess the safety of the home and the ability of the relative or nonrelative extended family member to care for the child needs,and a consideration of the results of a criminal records check conducted pursuant to subdivision a of section and a check of allegations of prior child abuse or neglect concerning the relative or nonrelative extended family member and other adults in the home.
section,subdivision d provides 
if a relative or nonrelative extended family member meets all conditions for approval,except for the receipt of the federal bureau of investigation criminal history information for the relative or nonrelative extended family member,and other adults in the home,as indicated,the county welfare department may approve the home and document that approval,if the relative or nonrelative extended family member,and each adult in the home,has signed and submitted a statement that he or she has never been convicted of a crime in the united states,other than a traffic infraction as defined in paragraph of subdivision a of section of the vehicle code.if,after the approval has been granted,the department determines that the relative or nonrelative extended family member or other adult in the home has a criminal record,the approval may be terminated.
the procedures followed here were in substantial compliance with section,subdivision d.after alfredo came forward and offered his home for the placement of his grandson and amber other children,agency contacted dif,which is its counterpart in mexico,and arranged for a home evaluation of alfredo.with respect to the required criminal background checks,alfredo and beth denied having a criminal history.under section,subdivision d,such were sufficient.dif recommended the children be detained there based on these and other factors,and agency adopted the recommendation.
given the temporary nature of detentions,and the legislature recognition of the need for different standards in evaluating homes for detention and for placement of dependent children see fn,ante,the detention orders here were proper.if the circumstances warrant it,under section,subdivision d,courts are authorized to detain a child with relatives or nonrelative extended family members in a prospective home prior to formal criminal background checks as long as the adults living in that home claim they have no criminal history other than traffic infractions.
record on appeal,augmentation request and judicial notice 
with respect to christina and christopher placement orders,agency asks us to augment the record on appeal with the social worker report prepared for the review hearing originally scheduled in december,and rely on the information in the report to find the background check issues as to these two children are moot as well.amber objected to agency augmentation request we agree with amber that it would be inappropriate to augment the record with the social worker report.doing so would effectively put us in the role of fact finder,which properly belongs to the juvenile court.in re jennifer th,d.making the appellate court the trier of fact is not the solution.id.at,d.
appellate courts rarely accept postjudgment evidence or evidence that is developed after the challenged ruling is made.see in re zeth cal th,d,zeth.the zeth court set forth the general rule that 
an appeal reviews the correctness of a judgment as of the time of its rendition,upon a record of matters which were before the trial court for its consideration.citation.this rule reflects an essential distinction between the trial and the appellate court that it is the province of the trial court to decide questions of fact and of the appellate court to decide questions of law citation.the rule promotes the orderly settling of factual questions and disputes in the trial court,provides a meaningful record for review,and serves to avoid prolonged delays on appeal.id.at,d.
zeth was primarily concerned with postjudgment evidence aimed at a reconsideration of the lower court factual findings and ultimately a reversal of the judgment.zeth,supra,cal th at,d,see in re josiah cal th,d.here,the postjudgment evidence proffered by agency is aimed at showing the issue is moot,and it does not seek a reversal of the judgment.nonetheless,given the hearsay nature of the social worker report and no showing that amber had an opportunity to the social worker see in re malinda cal d,we deny agency motion to augment the record on appeal.
however,on our own motion,we take judicial notice of the january,juvenile court minute order in christina case,which reads in pertinent part minor is placed with the father,subd.d,subds.a,c see also boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london cal th,fn,d.because we consider the minute order not as a basis to reverse,but to show that events occurring during the appeal render amber contention as to christina moot,taking judicial notice here is not prohibited by zeth,supra,cal th,d.
the issue of whether required background checks were conducted before placement is not moot as to christopher.further,even if it were,we would still address the substantive issue because it is an issue of continuing public concern and is likely to recur.see in re christina th,d.
adequate background checks were not conducted prior to placement 
section,known as the lance helms child safety act of,is intended to protect dependent children who are in placements with relatives or other individuals other than licensed or certified facilities.los angeles county of children family services superior court th,d.before a child is placed in a home other than a licensed or certified foster home,the child services agency must conduct a criminal records check on all adults living in the potential home,and on any other known adult who may have significant contact with the child or who has a familial or intimate relationship with anyone living in the potential home,subd.b.within days,the agency must follow this records check with a fingerprint clearance to ensure accuracy of the criminal records check.ibid.if the criminal records check and the fingerprint clearance show no criminal record,the child services agency and the court may consider the home for placement of a child,subd.d.if the fingerprint clearance check shows that the individual has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic offense,the child shall not be placed in the home,unless a criminal records exemption has been granted by the appropriate authorities,subd.d.
the record shows agency did not comply with section.agency asked dif to conduct an evaluation of alfredo home.a week later,agency received a glowing evaluation by dif,indicating alfredo had a spacious home in a peaceful neighborhood and adequate means to provide for four of the children.also,alfredo and beth denied having any criminal history.but agency can not properly rely on a of no criminal history for placement purposes under section.section requires a review of criminal records and a fingerprint clearance check before a child can be detained or placed in an unlicensed or noncertified home.for purposes of placement,the dif evaluation,absent criminal background checks comparable to those required under section,was inadequate 
the court erred by placing christina and christopher in alfredo home without the required criminal background checks or comparable criminal record checks used in mexico.see fn,ante.as to christina,the issue is moot,and we dismiss the appeal pertaining to her on this issue.however,it is not moot as to christopher accordingly,we reverse his placement order and remand his case with directions that the juvenile court instruct agency to show the mandatory background criminal checks required in section or comparable criminal record checks used in mexico of alfredo and beth have been conducted,and these individuals do not have any criminal history other than minor traffic violations.upon a proper showing,the court shall reinstate christopher placement order,if appropriate.
iii.lack of required statutory notice of intent is harmless error in this case 
amber contends agency did not give her required notice of its plans to have the children detained in mexico with alfredo and did not make a showing of good cause for detaining the children outside of san diego county.although amber has shown noncompliance with section,we find amber has waived this issue and any error was harmless.
section requires that children shall not be placed
