introduction 
under the changed circumstance rule,after the trial court has entered a final or permanent custody order reflecting that a particular custodial arrangement is in the best interest of the child,custody modification is appropriate only if the parent seeking modification demonstrates a significant change of circumstances indicating that a different custody arrangement would be in the child best interest.in re marriage of brown yana cal th,d.but the changed circumstance rule does not apply when a parent requests only a change in the parenting or visitation arrangement not amounting to a change from joint custody to sole custody,or vice versa.instead,the trial court considers a request to change the parenting or visitation arrangement under the best interests of the child standard.
in this case,bernardo lucio bernardo brought an order to show cause osc requesting an alteration to the visitation arrangement set forth in the judgment of dissolution of his marriage to amanda lucio amanda the dissolution judgment granted amanda sole physical custody of the children and permitted bernardo monitored visits for six hours each sunday.in a postjudgment order dated june,the june order,the trial court dismissed the osc,stating bernardo failed to allege changed circumstances that would allow the court to consider his request to alter the visitation arrangement.the court erred because bernardo did not request a change in custody and therefore was not required to demonstrate changed circumstances.we can not tell how the trial court would have exercised its discretion had it considered bernardo request under the best interests of the child standard,and therefore reverse the june order and remand for further consideration.
in a postjudgment order entered on july,the july order,the trial court awarded amanda attorney fees.the july order did not identify the statutory basis for the award,and the parties dispute whether the award was a sanction under family code section or was based on need and ability to pay under section.based on the record before us,we conclude the trial court awarded attorney fees as a sanction against bernardo under section for seeking to change the visitation arrangement.our reversal of the june order eliminates the grounds for sanctioning bernardo,and therefore we also reverse the july order.
facts and proceedings in the trial court 
the marriage of amanda and bernardo was dissolved on august.the dissolution judgment awarded amanda sole physical custody of jordan born in and juliana born in,and awarded bernardo and amanda joint legal custody.
the dissolution judgment granted bernardo monitored visitation for six hours every sunday.on february,bernardo had pleaded guilty to one count of indecent exposure in violation of penal code section,subdivision.he was sentenced to days in jail,placed on three years formal probation,and ordered to register under penal code section.in,bernardo had pleaded guilty to one count of lewd conduct in violation of section,subdivision a and had been placed on informal probation.the record on appeal does not reveal the ages of the victims of either crime.a partial parenting agreement reached at a mediation in may included the provision that father shall have monitored visitation with the children,with the goal of having unmonitored visits once the father probation is terminated.
bernardo completed three years of therapy and his probation ended in march.in april,bernardo,in propria persona,brought an osc the first osc requesting the trial court to modify the existing child custody order by granting joint physical custody of the children.a hearing on the first osc was conducted on july.at the hearing,the court soundly advised bernardo i really think you should get a lawyer.this is extremely complex.this is extremely sensitive and extremely difficult.you not going to be able to do this by yourself.get a lawyer and come back when you have done that which the attorney suggested you should do because you not going to be able to make this happen yourself.it going to take an experienced lawyer to set this up right,so you presented as being somebody who is not a danger to the children or the community.the court denied the first osc,and amanda counsel agreed to prepare a formal order.
bernardo obtained counsel and,on september,before entry of the formal order denying the first osc,brought another osc the second osc requesting the custody order be modified to shared parenting plan with no monitored visits.in a supporting declaration,bernardo stated his probation had ended in march without incident,and he had completed three years of therapy,as his probation officer had directed.bernardo also stated previously,amanda allowed me to call and at least speak with the children over the phone.now,amanda refuses to allow me to talk to the children at all.all contact whatsoever between the children and i have been cut off by amanda since early.he believed,it is in the children best interest for them to spend a considerable amount of time with me and suggested unmonitored visits on alternating weekends.bernardo stated he intended to call his probation officer to testify at the hearing on the second osc.
a formal order denying the first osc was entered on september.in the order,the court also awarded amanda sole legal custody of the children and reinstated monitored visitation for bernardo.bernardo did not appeal from the september,order.
on september,bernardo submitted a declaration from his former treating psychologist,anthony fiore,in support of the second osc.fiore stated at no time during my treatment of lucio has lucio shown any tendencies to perform any sexually deviant acts upon children,especially his own children.in my opinion,lucio is not a pedophile and has exhibited no outward signs of being a danger to children.based upon my treatment of lucio,i am confident he presents no harm whatsoever to his children and is free to visit with them without the need for a monitor.
on october,amanda filed an osc requesting an award of attorney fees in the amount of the attorney fees osc.she claimed an award of attorney fees was justified because the second osc did not describe any circumstances that had changed since the court denied the first osc.she denied blame for bernardo inability to have monitored visitation,claiming family assessment,counseling education services was unwilling to schedule monitored visitation due to the unavailability of an order directing monitored visitation between bernardo and our minor children to recommence.
on november,amanda filed a responsive declaration to the second osc.she requested the visitation arrangement set forth in the september,order remain in effect because bernardo is a registered sex offender and despite having been recently released from formal probation,bernardo continues to refuse to avail himself of monitored visitation arrangements with which i have attempted to make on numerous occasions.the order to show cause filed by bernardo is almost identical to that which he filed on april,and which was heard and denied by the court on july.
bernardo retained a clinical and forensic psychologist,laura brodie,who interviewed him for an hour and tested him for eight hours between november,and january.in her report,brodie concluded psychosexual assessment of lucio indicates he has a normal heterosexual interest pattern.he shows no deviant sexual interest in children.there was no interest in sexual violent themes.research has shown that the behavior of exhibitionism is more closely associated with an impulse control disorder and is not associated with pedophilia.there is no indication of current impulse control issues in lucio assessment.lucio has completed a three year program and shows insight into understanding his problem,is able to identify his triggers and avoid being in the type of situations that formerly triggered the behavior.he appears open and honest about his behaviors and his role in being unable to see his children without a monitor.it is my professional opinion lucio is not a danger to his children and does not have a deviant sexual interest in children.
the second osc and the attorney fees osc were heard on april.at the hearing,the trial court dismissed the second osc without prejudice on the ground it was premature because it was filed before entry of the formal order on the first osc.the court requested the parties submit updated income and expense declarations for purposes of the attorney fees osc.
in the june order,the trial court formally dismissed the second osc,stating the court finds that bernardo has failed to allege any change of circumstances having occurred after the last order was entered on september,as required by brown yana cal th d,which would allow the court to consider bernardo request as contained in the order to show cause and based thereon bernardo order to show cause in its entirety.
the trial court received the parties updated income and expense declarations and,in the july order,awarded amanda in attorney fees.the court stated family code section is quite specific about custody and unsupervised visitation to p enal c ode section registrants such as bernardo.the expert report suggests that he had poor impulse control which he is now over.given the fact,that one of the victims of the p enal c ode section,subdivision was a year old girl,the court did not believe that this type of behavior is so predictable.the court believes that the intent of the statute is rather clear and that bernardo chances of prevailing on the second osc were from the outset rather slim.he and his attorney chose to bring this action and have a hearing in spite of the opposition of amanda and the language of family code section.
bernardo timely appealed from the june order and the july order.
discussion 
trial court erred in dismissing the second osc because bernardo was not required to prove changed circumstances to seek a change of the visitation schedule.the correct test was best interests of the child.
bernardo contends the trial court erred by dismissing the second osc without granting him a hearing on the ground he failed to prove changed circumstances.he argues,among other things,the changed circumstance rule did not apply to the second osc because he was seeking a modification of the monitored visitation order rather than a change in custody.
in the recent case of in re marriage of brown yana,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court explained california statutory scheme governing child custody and visitation determinations is set forth in the family code under this scheme,the overarching concern is the best interest of the child.citation.for purposes of an initial custody determination,section,subdivision b,affords the trial court and the family the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.citation.when the parents are unable to agree on a custody arrangement,the court must determine the best interest of the child by setting the matter for an adversarial hearing and considering all relevant factors,including the child health,safety,and welfare,any history of abuse by one parent against any child or the other parent,and the nature and amount of the child contact with the parents.citations.once the trial court has entered a final or permanent custody order reflecting that a particular custodial arrangement is in the best interest of the child,the paramount need for continuity and stability in custody the harm that may result from disruption of established patterns of care and emotional bonds with the primary heavily in favor of maintaining that custody arrangement.citation.in recognition of this policy concern,we have articulated a variation on the best interest standard,known as the changed circumstance rule,that the trial court must apply when a parent seeks modification of a final judicial custody determination.citation.under the changed circumstance rule,custody modification is appropriate only if the parent seeking modification demonstrates a significant change of circumstances indicating that a different custody arrangement would be in the child best interest.citation.not only does this serve to protect the weighty interest in stable custody arrangements,but it also fosters judicial economy.citation.the family code contemplates that,in making a custody determination,consideration of the best interest of the child may lead the trial court to award custody either to both parents joint or shared custody or to only one parent sole custody.in that case,the supreme court held that where sole legal and physical custody of a child has been awarded to one parent after a contested custody dispute,a noncustodial parent opposing the custodial parent decision to relocate with the child is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.id.at,d.
the changed circumstance rule applies to a modification request seeking a change in a final determination of custody the changed circumstance rule does not apply to a modification request seeking a change in the parenting or visitation schedule.enrique angelina th,d enrique in re marriage of birnbaum d.birnbaum.in birnbaum,the mother contended the trial court erred by granting the father request for a modification of the parenting and visitation schedules in a joint custody arrangement without requiring the father to demonstrate changed circumstances.birnbaum,supra,d at.the court of appeal,affirming,held the changed circumstance rule does not apply when an order does not change custody but only alters a parenting schedule.the court stated the basic deficiency in the mother contention and her appeal from an order she claims changes custody is,whether there were changed circumstances or not,there has been no change of custody.the trial court ordered,the parties shall continue to have and share joint legal and joint physical custody of their minor children,just as they did under the prior order.at most there has been a change in what the trial court deemed the residential arrangement.ibid.
in enrique,the court of appeal held the trial court erred by applying the changed circumstance rule to deny a father request to alter a visitation schedule in a joint custody arrangement.enrique,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal concluded the changed circumstance rule does not apply to requests for modification of parenting or visitation arrangement not amounting to a change in custody.id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted the california supreme court has repeatedly discussed the changed circumstance rule in cases involving requests to modify custody,where granting the request would remove custody from one parent and give it to the other parent.id.at,d.after discussing birnbaum,the court concluded that case and the supreme court decision in in re marriage of burgess cal th,d,burgess were consistent.enrique,supra,th at,d.
in burgess,the supreme court considered the parents respective burdens when a parent with sole physical custody of a child seeks to move away.burgess,supra,cal th at,d.the burgess court held the noncustodial parent bears the burden of establishing the custodial parent move would cause the child prejudice and a change in custody would be essential or expedient to the child welfare.id.at,d.if the noncustodial parent fails to meet that burden,the burgess court confirmed nonetheless the trial court has broad discretion to modify orders concerning contact and visitation to minimize the minor children loss of contact and visitation with the noncustodial parent in the event of a move.ibid.
this recognition that a trial court has residual and broad discretion to modify visitation orders led the enrique court to conclude burgess was consistent with birnbaum.the enrique court explained the burgess court statement that a trial court has the discretion to modify visitation orders,without any suggestion that the noncustodial parent would have to demonstrate changed circumstances to justify such changes,is fully consistent with birnbaum.further,the burgess court statement that such modifications of visitation could serve to obviate custody litigation illustrates the distinction between requests to modify visitation,or parenting time,and requests to modify custody.enrique,supra,th at,d.
