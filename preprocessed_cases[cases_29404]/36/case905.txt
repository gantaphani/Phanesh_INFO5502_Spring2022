in this marital dissolution case,both parties challenge a spousal support order.in her appeal,the wife asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in reducing temporary spousal support and in setting permanent support.she contends that the court failed to account for all of the husband income and that it erred in imputing investment income to her.in his,the husband contends that the permanent spousal support order unfairly charges him a second time for earnings from the business that he operates.in his view,since the wife received half of the business value in the property division,the court should not consider the entire stream of business income in assessing his ability to pay support.the husband asks us to announce a new rule in california prohibiting such double dipping.
rejecting both parties contentions,we affirm the challenged order.in the published part of the opinion,we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in determining the husband income for purposes of spousal support.

contentions 
in her appeal from the may spousal support order,wife argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding part of husband income when considering his ability to pay support and in imputing investment income to her.

discussion 
to establish the proper framework for our analysis,we begin by summarizing the applicable legal principles before turning first to wife appeal and then to husband.
legal principles 
spousal support 
the trial court is authorized to order and to modify temporary and permanent spousal support,as provided in the family code 
temporary support 
the trial court has statutory authority to order temporary spousal support while a marital action is pending.temporary support usually is higher than permanent support because it is intended to maintain the status quo prior to the divorce.in re marriage of schulze th,d.the trial court has broad discretion to determine the amount of temporary spousal support,considering both the supported spouse need for support and the supporting spouse ability to pay.in re marriage of dick th,d.
permanent support 
permanent spousal support is governed by the statutory scheme set forth in sections through.section authorizes the trial court to order a party to pay spousal support in an amount,and for a period of time,that the court determines is just and reasonable,based on the standard of living established during the marriage,taking into consideration the circumstances set forth in section.in re marriage of nelson th,d in re marriage of cheriton th,d.the statutory factors include the supporting spouse ability to pay the needs of each spouse based on the marital standard of living the obligations and assets of each spouse,including separate property and any other factors pertinent to a just and equitable award,subds.c e,n.the trial court has broad discretion in balancing the applicable statutory factors and determining the appropriate weight to accord to each,but it may not be arbitrary and must both recognize and apply each applicable factor.in re marriage of ackerman th,d.
appellate review 
as a general rule,we review spousal support orders under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.in re marriage of nelson,supra,th at,d.we examine the challenged order for legal and factual support.as long as the court exercised its discretion along legal lines,its decision will be affirmed on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support it.in re marriage of duncan th,d in re marriage of geraci th,d.to the extent that a trial court exercise of discretion is based on the facts of the case,it will be upheld as long as its determination is within the range of the evidence presented.in re marriage of ackerman,supra,th at,d.
where a question of law is presented on undisputed facts,appellate review is de novo.see,elsenheimer elsenheimer th,d interpretation of child support statute presents question of law in re marriage of von der nuell th,d on undisputed facts,date of separation is a question of law in re marriage of duncan,supra,th at,fn,d rejecting wife bid for de novo review where the evidence was in conflict.
with those principles in mind,we consider the issues raised here.we begin with wife appeal.

exclusions from husband income 
pertinent facts 
in assessing husband income for spousal support purposes,the court excluded funds used to capitalize bw and to vertically integrate the business.in the court words the need to maintain higher capitalization in the company and the need to diversify the company work are reasonable expenses that should not be charged against husband income but rather should be taken out of the company before assessing what his reasonable income is for purposes of support.wife assigns this determination as error.
on the question of capitalization,the court heard testimony from two experts.
husband expert witness was certified public accountant richard wilkolaski.wilkolaski described bw as very thinly capitalized for a business with such high gross revenue.husband had drawn down his capital account at bw by more than million in the three years from january to december.wilkolaski opined that the company was endangered by the level of capital,which instead should be building back up again.based on some years of forensic accounting,wilkolaski understood that capital account withdrawals are not income available for spousal support.
wife called certified public accountant jeffrey wriedt as her expert witness.wriedt agreed that husband bw capital account had declined.he characterized bw as probably slightly undercapitalized.and wriedt agreed with wilkolaski that probably more money should have been left in the business.since he is not a legal expert,wriedt could not say whether spousal support should be based on money withdrawn from husband bw capital account.but wriedt did state withdrawals from the partnership capital account are not taxable income.
concerning vertical integration,the court heard testimony from the same two expert witnesses,and from husband.
husband testified about his actions to expand and vertically integrate bw.explaining the need for these actions,husband said we had to change the way we did business because the retail side was looking to cut out the middle man to lower their costs so we have had to change and accept the fact that the buying broker entity is no longer a viable business plan.explaining the nature of the change,husband testified that the company expanded in two directions,transforming from a to include both distribution and growi
