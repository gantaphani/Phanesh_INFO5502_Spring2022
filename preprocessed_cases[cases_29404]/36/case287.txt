this class action suit by parents,now in its tenth year,challenges a range of practices by illinois agency claimed to infringe parental rights that are protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment for background,see dupuy samuels,cir.the present appeal is from a preliminary injunction that the plaintiffs,who are the appellants,contend does not go far enough the defendants have not.the plaintiffs are also attempting to appeal from the judge class certification order,which they contend defined the plaintiff class too narrowly.but their time to appeal from that order has long expired.f.
the injunction of which the plaintiffs complain violates rule d of the civil rules though that is not the plaintiffs complaint about it,which requires that an injunction be a document rather than incorporate by reference materials in other documents.the purpose is to minimize disputes over what has been enjoined.schmidt lessard,d per curiam international longshoremen ass philadelphia marine trade ass n,d patrick,ford motor,cir charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed moore federal practice,ed.the ninth circuit allows incorporation by reference if the material thus incorporated is physically attached,as by stapling,to the injunction order.reno air racing ass n,mccord,cir california campbell,cir.there is no reason to complicate the administration of the rule by such an interpretation.there are times when literal interpretation is best this is one of them.the ninth circuit approach would encourage just the kind of mistake that the rule aims to thoughtless attachment of separately composed documents when if the judge had integrated their contents into the injunction order he might have realized that they would not cohere with the rest of the order without changes.
rule d is simple,clear,sensible,easily complied with,and not even new we are distressed by the failure of the parties and the district judge to have complied with it in this case that underscores the good sense of the rule.what the parties and the district judge understand to be the injunction begins with an opinion by the judge in which she says that the court approves the dcfs proposal,with certain modifications,outlined below,and the outline follows.if the certain modifications were literally an outline,there would be no injunction but merely the sketch of one.but it is apparent that the word outlined was used imprecisely and likewise that when the court,as one of its modifications,said vaguely that the court would add a statement to this effect emphasis added,it meant that the language that followed was part of the injunction.yet one of the modifications modifies nothing it says merely that the court recommends that the plan provide a recommendation can not be an injunction.
both sides are complicit in the violation of rule d,having expressed no concern with the form of the injunction.but the appellants in addition violated cir.d,which requires certification that the appendix contain all materials required by rule a to be included in the appendix.for among the retired materials are the judgment,and the judgment in this case includes not only the judge order modifying the defendant proposed injunction,chicago north western transportation railway labor executives ass n,cir,but also those portions of that proposed injunction that the judge improperly incorporated by reference.they do not appear in the appellants appendix but instead are deeply buried in the record the lawyers could not find them when asked for them at argument.
so rule d was flouted.but a violation of the rule does not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to review the injunction,combs ryan coal,cir unless as a result of the violation it is so unclear what the defendant is enjoined from doing that he could not be punished for violating the injunction.for in that event he would lack standing to challenge the injunction because,being unenforceable,it would place no burden on him.he could thumb his nose at it with impunity.marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,cir chicago north western transportation railway labor executives ass n,supra,at see also bates johnson,cir.a n unenforceable order is no order at all.marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,supra,at.
the power to review an injunction that violates rule d extends to any adequately clear materials clearly incorporated into the injunction by reference,as we held in original great american chocolate chip cookie river valley cookies,cir abbott laboratories unlimited beverages,cir.and that is this case.the core of the injunction is clear enough to be enforceable it requires the defendant to provide informal administrative review of safety plans.
there is tension between the holding in original great american chocolate chip cookie river valley cookies,supra,and patrick,ford motor,supra,which states that an injunction that incorporates materials by reference can not be enforced,though the court went on to find that in any event the incorporated settlement ambiguous.at.patrick did not cite great american,and its flat statement of unenforceability,which is not limited to incorporation by reference but embraces any injunction that violates rule d,is inconsistent with the decisions holding that a violation of the rule does not affect the jurisdiction of the reviewing court as long as the obligations that the injunction imposes on the defendant are clear enough that he can be punished should he violate them.
patrick justified its unorthodox position by quoting from porter national friction products,cir,that rule d is no mere extract from a manual of procedural practice.it is a page from the book of liberty.at.beware decision by metaphor.what the court seems to have meant was that it would be unjust to punish someone for violating an injunction that he could not understand.it would be.but rule d is not needed in order to ward off that injustice if the injunction is not clear,the defendant can not be punished for violating it,rule d or no rule d.the purpose of the rule is to make sure that violations of injunctions are punishable.
the lofty language of porter is particularly inapt when as in this case it is the plaintiff that is appealing the injunction.for it is then much as if the plaintiff were appealing from the denial of injunctive relief altogether,which would present no problem under rule d.the difference is that when there is an injunction and the plaintiff is seeking additional relief,the need for that relief is likely to depend on what relief the judge has already granted,and to be able to form a precise and concise understanding of that relief may require that the rule have been complied with.
enough said about the procedural issue.let us turn to the merits,and explain what a safety plan is.
if the state of illinois has reason to believe that the child can not be cared for at home or in the custody of the person responsible for the child welfare without endangering the child health or safety and there is not time to apply for a court order for temporary custody of the child,the state can take the child into temporary protective custody without additional process,ilcs,but there is a right to a judicial hearing within hours.ilcs,in re john paul,d.other states have similar laws,though often they require reasonable cause or probable cause rather than reason to believe,alyson oswald,comment,they took my child an examination of the circuit split over emergency removal of children from parental custody,cath,although it is doubtful whether there is any practical difference among these formulas,any one of which should satisfy the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see,berman young,cir brokaw mercer county,cir doe kearney,cir croft westmoreland county children health services,cir.among the liberties protected by that clause is the right of parents to the custody of their children.santosky kramer,d troxel granville,d plurality opinion.but when a child safety is threatened,that is justification enough for action first and hearing afterward.lossman pekarske,cir see also duchesne sugarman,cir.
