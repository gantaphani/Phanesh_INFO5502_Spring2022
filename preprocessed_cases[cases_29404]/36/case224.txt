david and melody smith filed this action against judy social worker employed by the hamilton county department of jobs and family services children services claiming violation of their due process right to a hearing before the temporary removal of their children from their home.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of,holding that the smiths were not entitled to a hearing because they consented to the removal of their children pursuant to a voluntary safety plan.we agree and affirm.
david and melody smith are the parents of two minors and the legal custodians of another minor,malake dancer.the smiths have custody of who suffers from cerebral palsy and other a kinship program administered by children services.pursuant to this program,richard montifore,a children services employee,inspected the smith home in.he found a home so filthy that he felt uncomfortable leaving malake and the other children in the house.lori social the residence and also concluded that the children needed to leave.patton found dog feces under one child bed and so much clutter in the house that,in her opinion,the children could not evacuate in the event of a fire.
these unsanitary and dangerous conditions spurred montifore to call the police the smiths were later charged with and convicted of misdemeanor child endangerment.the next day,children services assigned to the case.she persuaded the smiths to consent to a safety plan that removed the children from the smiths home and placed them with friends in the neighborhood.with the children in nearby homes,the smiths maintained close visited,arranged outings,and drove the children to and from school.
the safety plan informed the smiths,y our decision to sign this safety plan is voluntary,and read 
this safety plan is a specific agreement to help ensure your child ren safety.
the custody of your child ren does not change under this safety plan.
children services is here to help you protect your child ren when you may not be able to do it on your own.
if you can not or will not be able to continue following the plan,children services may have to take other action s to keep your child ren safe.
the safety plan will end when you are able to protect your child ren without help from children services.
this safety plan may be changed if new or different services are necessary.
you must contact your caseworker immediately if you decide that you can not or will not be able to continue following the plan.
as a part of ensuring the children safety,the plan prohibited the smiths from bringing the children to their home.
once the parties agreed to the plan and placed the children in safe homes,launched an investigation into the smiths ability to care for the minors.over the next two weeks,interviewed the smiths,the children,the children doctors,the temporary caregivers,and the smiths therapist.she also the smiths home.
the smiths allege that during this time they cleaned their house and repeatedly asked what else they needed to do to allow the children to return.they allege that ignored their requests for information and threatened to permanently remove their children if they stopped cooperating.though the record before the district court includes response regarding additional requirements necessary to permit the children return,including doctors reports about the state of the children health,we take the smiths allegations to be true for purposes of summary judgment.
after two weeks,the smiths filed this action against in her individual capacity for violating their substantive and procedural due process rights children services terminated the safety plan two days later and returned the days after they were removed.
moved the district court to dismiss,citing her right to qualified immunity.the denial of that motion precipitated the first appeal of this case.it resulted in a dismissal of the smiths substantive due process claims,and an affirmance of the denial of qualified immunity,because judging the complaint only,it set up a violation of the smiths clearly established right to procedural due process.smith,cir per curiam.although argued in her first appeal that the safety plan was voluntary,the panel assumed that children services acted without the smiths consent because failed to enter the plan into the record.id.at.the court invited to reassert her qualified immunity defense based upon a more complete record.id.at.

to state a viable claim,the smiths must demonstrate that they were deprived of a right,privilege,or immunity secured by the constitution or laws of the united states and the deprivation was caused by a person acting under color of state law.flagg brooks,d rutter,cir.here,no one disputes that acted under the color of state law,only whether she deprived the smiths of their right to procedural due process.

acknowledges that children services removed the smith children from their home without affording the smiths a hearing.she insists,however,that she did not violate the smiths due process rights because she removed the children with the smiths consent.
we agree,adopting the reasoning set forth by judge posner in dupuy samuels,cir.in dupuy,an appeal challenging a preliminary injunction issued in a suit against illinois child welfare agency,the seventh circuit reviewed the constitutionality of voluntary safety plans similar to the one at issue here.the court held that when a parent voluntarily consents to a safety plan,no hearing of any kind is necessary hearings are required for deprivations taken over objection,not for steps authorized by consent.id.at.
although the parents in dupuy argued that safety plans are inherently coercive when agencies force parents to sign the plan or face the threat of formal removal proceedings,the court found no fault in this strategy.it is not a forbidden means of coercing a settlement,judge posner stated,to threaten merely to enforce one legal rights.id.at.he analogized the agency threat to a plaintiff legitimate threat to press a case to trial in order to induce a defendant to settle.id.the defendant choice between accepting a settlement or risking a harsher outcome at trial is a dilemma implicit in any settlement process.if there were a downside to refusing to settle,there would be no settlements.id.at.
in this case,the smiths remained in the safety plan voluntarily at all times.although our dissenting colleague questions whether the smiths were coerced into the plan,not even the smiths argue that they involuntarily consented to enter into the plan.rather,they only argue that they were not allowed to recover their children after the safety plan had been initiated despite their best efforts,appellants br.at emphasis in original,invoking the principle announced in farley farley that the consent given as part of a voluntary safety plan may become involuntary during the course of the plan.lexis,at cir.july,unpublished.but here,in light of the smiths admitted failure to utilize the safety plan clear,simple mechanism for rescinding the plan,they fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to their continuing consent to the plan.
in addition to informing the smiths that their agreement with children services relied on their voluntary participation y our decision to sign this safety plan is voluntary,the safety plan instructed the smiths to inform if they no longer wanted to participate you must contact your caseworker immediately if you decide that you can not or will not be able to continue following the plan.a
