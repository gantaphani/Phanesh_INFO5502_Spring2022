factual and procedural background 
the property at issue in this case is located at mountain view avenue in san anselmo.it was purchased by husband in or around,using money originally loaned to him by his grandfather.husband and wife first met in or around july.they began living together in husband home on the property in the spring or summer of.at the time,husband owned the property free and clear of any encumbrances except a deed of trust in favor of his grandfather.when husband grandfather died in june,that debt was forgiven in his will.
wife had worked in law offices as a secretary and legal assistant as such,she had specialized in probate work.in a prior dissolution,wife had been awarded a community interest in real property as a result of a joint interest in property she had earlier obtained from her former spouse in connection with a loan on that property.husband testified he had been diagnosed with a learning disability that severely limited his reading comprehension.he relied on wife to handle all legal and financial matters for the couple.
the parties first child was born in march.after cohabiting for approximately five years,the parties married in september.around that time,wife became pregnant again.in anticipation of the birth of their second child,the parties decided to add a nursery room to the property.they obtained a bank loan,secured by the value of the property,in order to finance the remodeling construction.in july,and in connection with the loan application process,husband executed a grant deed conveying the at the time was entirely his separate wife and husband as joint tenants.the grant deed was recorded on august.husband testified that he did not realize he was giving half of his property to wife in order to obtain the bank loan until he noticed that both of their names appeared on a property tax bill.
the parties second child was born in august.they continued to reside together at the property until april.on april,husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.after several failed attempts at reconciliation,the parties separated permanently on december.
the trial court bifurcated the issues to be resolved.over a two day period december,and january,it took evidence on the single issue of the validity of the grant deed conveying the property from husband to wife and husband as joint tenants.in its statement of decision filed on march,the trial court determined that a wife had not given sufficient consideration for the transfer of husband property to joint tenancy b as a fiduciary,she bore the burden of establishing that the joint tenancy grant deed was not the product of undue influence c she had failed to sustain her burden in this regard and d the grant deed was therefore void.the trial court ordered set aside the grant deed transferring title to the property to the parties in joint tenancy.
pursuant to its judgment voiding and setting aside the grant deed,on july,the trial court ordered wife to sign a quitclaim deed to the property in favor of husband,and to vacate the residence by august.after wife failed to vacate the premises and sought the protection of the bankruptcy court in august,husband obtained relief from the automatic stay and sought an order evicting wife from the property.ultimately,on october,the trial court issued an ex parte order requiring the sheriff to remove wife from the property.on january,bifurcated trial was held on the reserved issues of spousal support and attorney fees,and the marriage was ordered dissolved.
final judgment of dissolution was entered on february.in this appeal from the final judgment of dissolution,appellant seeks review of the bifurcated judgment setting aside the joint tenancy grant deed of the property from husband to wife and husband as joint tenants,as well as the subsequent orders requiring wife to sign a quit claim deed of her interest in the property,requiring her to vacate the residence by october,and ordering the sheriff to remove her from the property.
discussion 
appellant wife contends that the trial court erred by placing on her the burden of proving that the transfer of husband separate ownership of the subject property to joint tenancy was not the product of undue influence.instead,she argues,the trial court should have required husband to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption under evidence code section that record title to the property was held by the parties in joint tenancy or else have required him to rebut,by documentary evidence of a written agreement or deed of title,the presumption set out in family code section that the property was community property because it was acquired by the parties during marriage in joint tenancy.appellant is wrong on both counts.
this case concerns a conflict between legal presumptions.in imposing on wife the burden of establishing that she did not obtain a joint interest in the property by means of undue influence,the trial court relied on section,as that provision has been interpreted by the appellate courts section states that in transactions between themselves,a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other.this confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners 
this provision establishes that with respect to property transactions,married couples are subject to the same standards of disclosure toward each other applicable to any confidential fiduciary relationship.as a consequence,when any interspousal transaction advantages one spouse to the disadvantage of the other,the presumption arises that such transaction was the result of undue influence.in re marriage of haines th,d haines u nder california community property law,because spouses occupy confidential relations with each other,when an interspousal transaction advantages one spouse over the other,a presumption of undue influence arises see also in re marriage of bonds cal th,d,bonds persons,once they are married,are in a fiduciary relationship to one another,subd.b,so that whenever the parties enter into an agreement in which one party gains an advantage,the advantaged party bears the burden of demonstrating that the agreement was not obtained through undue influence.
rather than applying this presumption derived from section,appellant wife contends the trial court should have applied the two presumptions derived from evidence code section and section,respectively first,the presumption in favor of the owner of record title to property and its concomitant requirement of clear and convincing evidence to rebut that presumption,and second,the presumption that property acquired during marriage in joint form,including property held in joint tenancy,is community property unless otherwise agreed in writing we disagree.
this appeal is controlled by haines.in that case,the court of appeal specifically addressed the kind of situation presented here,in which the presumption favoring stability of title found in evidence code section is in direct conflict with the presumption of undue influence arising where one spouse obtains an advantage over the other in an interspousal property transaction.the court concluded that in every such instance,the presumption based on the c
