enrique enrique filed an order to show cause seeking to modify a stipulated order governing the parenting schedule and schooling of his and angelina angelina son,x.the trial court denied enrique requests on the ground enrique had failed to carry his burden of showing a change of circumstances sufficient to justify the modification.on appeal,enrique contends that he was not required to demonstrate a change of circumstances because he did not seek to modify custody of x.we hold that the standard of proof a parent sharing joint custody must meet to effect a change in parenting time is the best interest of the child,not changed circumstances.we therefore reverse the order and remand for further proceedings 
factual and procedural background 
enrique and angelina dated from to.in september,after their relationship had ended,angelina gave birth to their son,
in march,enrique filed a complaint to establish a parental relationship and child custody and visitation.in the complaint,enrique alleged that angelina had refused to allow him to have any involvement with 
the parties reached a partial agreement in a mediation conducted by family court services fcs.the parties agreed to a program of gradually introducing into his father life more extensively until such time as the parents are sharing the child fairly equally.after a hearing in april,the trial court entered an order in june adopting the parties partial agreement and the fcs recommendations.the court order stated that the parents would share joint legal custody of the child,that primary residence would be initially with angelina,and that enrique custody rights would be gradually increased over time until the parents shared joint physical custody.
by the end of,was with enrique from sunday night through monday morning,tuesday night through wednesday morning,friday night through saturday afternoon,and on alternating holidays.did well with this arrangement for several years.
enrique and angelina were unable to cooperate with each other regarding numerous issues relating to upbringing.by the time of the entry of the january order at issue in this appeal,the parties had participated in private mediation sessions,and five mediation sessions with fcs.
in late,a dispute arose over where would attend kindergarten the following year.at the time,angelina lived in san marcos with her husband and baby daughter,and enrique lived in san ysidro with his older daughter from a prior marriage.angelina was working in kearny mesa,and enrique attended law school at the university of san diego.angelina wanted to attend richland elementary school in san marcos.she also wanted to modify the parenting schedule once started kindergarten so that would reside with her during the school week and with enrique only on the first,third,and fifth weekends of the month.enrique opposed any change in the parenting schedule,and wanted to attend the language academy in san diego,where enrique older daughter attended school.
in december,the family court denied a request by angelina that she be awarded sole legal custody of and that enrique visitation rights be decreased.the court also ordered that be enrolled at richland elementary school for kindergarten.in its written order filed in february,the court stated i t is appropriate to enroll the child in the district of the primary custodial parent.the court sees mother in that role.
in march,angelina obtained a temporary restraining order based on her allegation that enrique had perpetrated domestic violence against her by driving his car away while angelina was leaning into the back window to kiss.enrique contended that angelina was exaggerating the incident,and that he had merely inch ed his car away while angelina was peeking into the back window.
concurrently with her application for a temporary restraining order,angelina filed another request for modification of enrique visitation rights.she requested that enrique visitation rights be limited to alternating weekends to accommodate upcoming kindergarten schedule.this was essentially the same request angelina had made prior to the court order of december.
enrique again opposed any change in the parenting schedule.he stated that he was planning to move from san ysidro to normal heights,and he reiterated that he wanted to attend the language academy with his daughter.in mediation with fcs,the counselor recommended that the parenting schedule be changed once entered kindergarten in san marcos.specifically,the counselor recommended that when kindergarten started,enrique parenting time during the school year be limited to the first,third,and fifth weekends of the month,and one evening per week.
enrique opposed the fcs recommendation.he submitted a declaration stating that the recommended reduction of his parenting time would be detrimental to his relationship with enrique also requested a continuance in order to allow him time to secure housing in the north heights area.he contended that once he moved from san ysidro to north park,which is closer to san marcos,he would be able to take back and forth to school with no difficulty,even if were to remain at richland elementary.
on june,the parties entered into a handwritten stipulation and order signed by them and by the family court judge.the parties agreed that they would continue to share joint legal and physical custody,and that primary residence would be with angelina.they further agreed that once was in school,enrique would have him from friday afternoon until monday morning on the first,third,and fifth weekends of each month.in addition,enrique would have on thursday evenings preceding each of these weekends,and on thursdays,overnight,preceding angelina weekends.finally,the parties agreed to share parenting time equally during school breaks,with enrique having on wednesdays,thursdays,and alternating weekends,and angelina having him on mondays,tuesdays,and alternating weekends.
in july,started kindergarten in track d at richland elementary school,a school with four different tracks,or schedules.enrique moved to north park later that month.
in august,enrique filed the motion underlying this appeal.in his motion,enrique requested that the parenting schedule be modified to include overnights with him every tuesday and thursday.enrique also requested that be enrolled in the track b schedule at richland elementary rather than track d,so that school schedule would coincide with enrique daughter school schedule.in the alternative,enrique requested that he be allowed to enroll in the language academy.
on january,the court denied enrique requests.the court concluded that,due to the stipulation and order of june,the father bears the burden of showing a substantial and compelling change in circumstances in order to modify the existing order,and that there is evidence of a substantial and compelling change in circumstance that would cause the court to modify the existing order.
however,the court indicated it would have been inclined to modify the parenting schedule if it were considering the matter in the first instance.the court stated in relevant part 
by the way,let me say as an aside,i do really like the current schedule.i do think it the best schedule for this child the schedule is too complicated for you folks to work through together because you do cooperate with each other very well and,frankly,to be honest with you,i do think it gives dad enough time with the child 
even though i may not think it the best order for this child and the best order for the child and the father or even the child and the mother,it does matter what i think about it.you entered into a stipulation that became an order of the court.it became a final order of the court on the issue of custody and visitation.and you have shown me enough of a change in circumstance that would allow the court,as a matter of law,to modify the order.
if we had to start this from scratch,i probably come up with a different plan but,again,i do think,as a matter of law,that i can change this order because i do think you shown me level of evidence under the standard of review that required for me to make the change.so that why i denied t
