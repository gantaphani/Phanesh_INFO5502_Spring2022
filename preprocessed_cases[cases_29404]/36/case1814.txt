in this appeal we determine the proper standard of proof applicable during the portion of a proceeding to terminate parental rights.the circuit court of cook county terminated respondent mother parental rights based on the court sound discretion,declining to hold the state to a clear and convincing burden of proof,as urged by respondent.the appellate court reversed.although also rejecting a clear and convincing standard,the appellate court held that the state must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of parental rights is in the minor best interests,and that the state had failed to meet its burden in this case.d.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on february,respondent,brenda,took her son,to the emergency room of ravenswood hospital.was in severe pain from an injury to his scrotum inflicted by respondent boyfriend at least hours earlier.the injury was caused by repetitive blunt blows to the scrotum.was transferred to children memorial hospital,where he underwent surgery to determine whether castration would be necessary.in addition to this injury,multiple bruises to face,arm,back,buttock and thigh were apparent.a linear bruise on his cheek had the characteristic appearance of a mark left by an slap.tolerated the surgery well,and although castration was unnecessary,the injury left with an increased risk of infertility later in life.
was discharged from the hospital on february,and taken into protective custody.the trial court later placed guardianship of in the department of children and family services dcfs and appointed the cook county public guardian as attorney and guardian ad litem gal.after living in a group home for several months,in august,was placed in a foster home,where he resided continuously through at least june.at the time of the underlying proceedings,was participating in individual therapy and performing well academically,but was experiencing some problems socially in school.the foster mother expressed her desire to adopt 
following the removal of from respondent custody,respondent participated in parenting classes,individual therapy,and domestic abuse counseling in accordance with the dcfs client service plans.respondent attended all scheduled visits with and was rated satisfactory on service plan tasks.she reportedly made slow but steady progress in therapy.
on july,the state filed a petition seeking termination of respondent parental rights and appointment of a guardian with the right to consent to adoption.hearing on the unfitness portion of the state petition began in september.completion of the unfitness hearing was delayed pending a determination of the applicability of the indian child welfare act of et.ultimately,on april,after hearing testimony from respondent,the foster mother,the dcfs investigator,caseworkers,counselors,and other service providers,the trial court determined that the state had demonstrated,by clear and convincing evidence,that respondent was unfit in that she failed to protect from an environment injurious to his welfare.hearing on the portion of the state petition commenced the following month,and on june,the trial court found,within its sound discretion,that it was in best interest to terminate respondent parental rights at the time of the hearing,respondent was not able to parent without supervision.respondent appealed,challenging the trial court finding of unfitness,as well as its decision to terminate parental rights.
the appellate court affirmed the finding of unfitness and held that a preponderance of the evidence standard,which the state had failed to satisfy,applies at a hearing.the appellate court reversed the trial court order terminating parental rights and remanded the matter for further proceedings.d at.we allowed the gal petition for leave to appeal see,and permitted the cook county state attorney to join in that appeal.we also allowed the loyola childlaw center and the national coalition for child protection reform leave to file a joint amicus curiae brief in support of respondent.see.we note that respondent has requested,pressing her claim that a clear and convincing standard of proof is required at the hearing.see g a.respondent does not challenge the appellate court decision affirming the trial court finding of unfitness.because our determination of the appropriate standard of proof at a hearing involves an issue of law,our review proceeds de novo.see in re.
proceedings to terminate parental rights are governed principally by the juvenile court act of ilcs et west and the adoption act ilcs et west.generally,under the juvenile court act,where a child is adjudicated abused,neglected or dependent,and the state seeks to free the child for adoption,unless the parent consents,the state must first establish that the parent is unfit under one or more of the grounds set forth in the adoption act.ilcs west ilcs d west.if the trial court finds the parent to be unfit,the court then determines whether it is in the best interests of the minor that parental rights be terminated.ilcs west.
the state does not dispute that it bears the burden of proof when it files a petition to terminate parental rights.the juvenile court act expressly sets forth the state burden during the first step of the termination process,the unfitness hearing.the statute states that parental unfitness must be based upon clear and convincing evidence.ilcs,west.although the juvenile court act does not expressly set forth the state burden during the second step of the termination process,the hearing,the statute does provide some guidance.the juvenile court act states the standard of proof and the rules of evidence in the nature of civil proceedings in this state are applicable to proceedings under this article.ilcs west.t his article refers to article ii of the juvenile court act,titled abused,neglected or dependent minors,and includes the section under which the termination petition in this case was filed.see ilcs west.the standard of proof in civil proceedings typically is either a preponderance or clear and convincing.see graham,cleary graham handbook of illinois evidence ed bazydlo volant.thus,the language of the juvenile court act suggests that one of these two standards of proof must apply at a hearing the appellate court determined that a preponderance standard is appropriate.d at.
the gal and the state,however,argue that the appropriate standard of proof is sound discretion.under this standard,as explained by the state,a trial judge decision to terminate parental rights would not rest on a quantitative measure of the evidence.indeed,according to the state,sound discretion permits the trial court to reject perhaps all of the evidence submitted by a party without risk of being reversed based on some perceived balance of the evidentiary scale.the gal adds that the trial judge ruling would be presumptively correct on review.
in support of their position,the state and the gal note that the trial court,in making a determination,is charged with the daunting task of weighing and balancing the following statutory factors,all in light of the child age and developmental needs 
a the physical safety and welfare of the child 
b the development of the child identity 
c the child background and ties 
d the child sense of attachments,including 
i where the child actually feels love,attachment,and a sense of being valued 
ii the child sense of security 
iii the child sense of familiarity 
iv continuity of affection for the child 
v the least disruptive placement alternative for the child 
e the child wishes and goals 
f the child community ties,including church,school,and friends 
g the child need for permanence 
h the uniqueness of every family and child 
i the risks attendant to entering and being in substitute care and 
j the preferences of the persons available to care for the child.ilcs west.
the state and the gal reason that the difficulty and delicacy of a decision requires that such decision rest within the trial court discretion.they argue that imposition on the state of a traditional or formalistic standard of proof,like the preponderance standard adopted by the appellate court,will only impede the trial judge decision.
although we agree that determination of a child best interests presents a difficult and delicate task,requiring a nuanced analysis of the statutory factors,we disagree that the difficulty of the task facing the trial court justifies relieving the,the its burden to demonstrate its entitlement to the relief it seeks.we also disagree with the suggestion that sound discretion is some sort of nontraditional standard of proof.sound discretion is simply not a standard of,nontraditional,or otherwise.standards of proof are concerned with the quantum and quality of proof that must be presented in order to prevail on an issue.davis,a basic guide to standards of judicial review.as the united states supreme court explained 
the function of a standard of proof,as that concept is embodied in the due process clause and in the realm of factfinding,is to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.addington texas,d,quoting in re winship,d,harlan,concurring.
see also wigmore,evidence through chadbourn ed discussing the measure of jury persuasion in criminal and civil cases.sound discretion says nothing about the degree of confidence the trial judge must have in the correctness of his or her factual conclusions concerning the child best interests.rather,as discussed more fully below,sound discretion implies the degree of deference the trial court decision will be given by a reviewing court.thus,sound discretion is tied to the standard of review it does not identify a standard of proof.
although the state argues that the trial court determination should not rest on a quantitative measure of the evidence,the state nonetheless argues that it presented enough evidence for the trial court to find that termination of respondent parental rights was in best interests.the state thus effectively concedes that the trial court decision must be supported by some quantum of evidence.the question much evidence is enough evidence sound discretion does not provide an answer.
we also find the state sound discretion standard difficult to reconcile with the nature of the trial court ruling.when a trial court finds that the best interests of the child warrants termination of parental rights and enters an order to that effect,the relationship is permanently and completely severed,at,citing santosky kramer,d,see also ilcs west after entry of an order terminating parental rights,the parents shall be relieved of all parental responsibility for such child and shall be deprived of all legal rights as respects the child.if this ruling is a matter of judicial discretion,as the state and the gal argue,then it is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion.see.prac.appeal error,at.
abuse of discretion is the most deferential standard of to no review at is therefore traditionally reserved for decisions made by a trial judge in overseeing his or her courtroom or in maintaining the progress of a trial.people coleman.for example,a trial judge decision whether to allow or exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion swick liautaud,as is his or her decision to limit discovery people williams,impose a sanction for a discovery violation sullivan edward hospital,disqualify counsel people ortega,accept or reject a negotiated plea people henderson,and deny a forum non conveniens motion dawdy union pacific.accordingly,a trial judge evidentiary rulings during a hearing are subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.see,at,in re,d.but a trial judge ruling on the ultimate issue at a the relationship should be permanently and completely plainly not the type of ruling to which the highly deferential abuse of discretion review traditionally applies.
the state and the gal cite to various appellate court cases which state that termination of an individual parental rights rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge that termination orders are reviewed for an abuse of discretion,in re,d,in re diane,d,in re jeffrey,d,in re,d,in re,d,in re,d,in re allen,d,in re hollis,d,in re dalton,d.a review of the cited cases,however,reveals no analysis as to the origin or reason behind the appellate court application of the sound discretion standard.even in those cases in which the appellate court expressly rejected a clear and convincing standard of proof in favor of sound discretion,the appellate court undertook no review of the propriety of the sound discretion standard itself.see in re precious,d,in re,d,in re,d,in re,d,in re,d.mere repetition of a purported rule of law does not establish its validity.moreover,when this court becomes aware that an erroneous burden of proof has become entrenched in the case law,we will not hesitate to correct the error.see people trainor,holding that the state bears the burden of proof at a recovery proceeding under the sexually dangerous persons act,notwithstanding years of precedent placing the burden on the defendant.we do so now and hold that sound discretion does not define the state burden of proof at the stage of a proceeding to terminate parental rights.
we turn to the issue of whether the preponderance standard,adopted by the appellate court,or the clear and convincing standard,urged by respondent,is applicable.respondent renews her argument,rejected by the appellate court,that the supreme court decision in santosky kramer,d,mandates imposition of a clear and convincing standard of proof at a hearing.
at issue in santosky was the constitutionality of a new york statute that permits the state to terminate parental rights upon a finding,supported by a fair preponderance of the evidence,that the child is permanently neglected.the new york statute,as described by the court,bifurcates permanent neglect proceedings into a hearing and a dispositional hearing.at the hearing,the state is required to prove permanent neglect,as defined in the statute at the subsequent dispositional hearing,the court determines what placement would serve the child best interests.santosky,at.at,d at.the order terminating the santoskys parental rights was entered at the subsequent dispositional hearing.santosky,at.at,d at.the supreme court sustained the parents challenge to the new york statute and held that the due process clause required proof of permanent neglect by clear and convincing evidence.santosky,at.at,d at.
the court noted its recognition that freedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment,and that the liberty interest of parents in the care,custody and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the state.santosky,at.at,d at.thus,state action to terminate the relationship between a parent and child must be accomplished by procedures that comport with due process.santosky,at.at,d at.when the state moves to destroy weakened familial bonds,it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.santosky,at.at,d at.
whether the preponderance standard of proof employed under the new york statute satisfied due process turned on the court balancing of the three public and private interest factors identified in mathews eldridge,d,the private interests affected by the proceeding the risk of error created by the state chosen procedure and the countervailing governmental interest supporting use of the challenged procedure.santosky,at.at,d at.the court determined that the mathews factors weighed against new york preponderance standard.the court explained,in relevant part,that a preponderance standard allocates the risk of error in roughly equal fashion between the parents and the state,but that such allocation is constitutionally intolerable because the possible injury to the parents from an erroneous finding is significantly greater than any harm to the state.santosky,at.at,d at.an evidentiary standard greater than a fair preponderance is required to reduce the risk of erroneous termination orders.santosky,at.at,d at.the court went on to hold that a clear and convincing standard of proof,rather than a beyond a reasonable doubt standard,satisfied due process.santosky,at.at,d at.
respondent maintains that new york first stage of its bifurcated termination comparable to both steps of illinois termination proceeding and that,in accordance with santosky,a clear and convincing standard of proof must be imposed at an illinois hearing.we disagree.if a comparison is to be made between the two proceedings,we conclude,as did the appellate court,that new york hearing,during which the court considers whether the child is permanently neglected santosky,at.at,d at,is comparable to the unfitness portion of an illinois termination proceeding,during which the court considers whether the parent is unfit.new york subsequent dispositional hearing,during which the court considers what placement will serve the child best interests santosky,at.at,d at,is comparable to the portion of an illinois proceeding.thus,the clear and convincing evidentiary standard adopted in santosky for new york hearing is applicable only to illinois unfitness hearing.we note that following issuance of santosky,the illinois legislature amended the juvenile court act,raising the state evidentiary burden necessary to support a finding of parental unfitness from a preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence.see pub.act,eff.august,amending,ch,par.
in addition to her contention that santosky is dispositive,respondent contends that b ecause the relationship still exists at the stage of a termination proceeding,due process requires that the burden of proof be clear and convincing.we agree with respondent that,until an order is entered terminating parental rights,the relationship exists.see in re.we disagree,however,that parents are entitled to the same procedural safeguard,the same standard of proof,at the hearing that they are entitled to at the unfitness hearing.
in any given proceeding,the minimum standard of proof the due process clause permits reflects the weight of the private and public interests affected,as well as a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be allocated between the parties.santosky,at.at,d at.the more stringent the burden of proof a party must bear,the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision.cruzan director,missouri department of health,d.for example,in a criminal case the private interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that society imposes the risk of error almost entirely on itself by requiring the state to prove the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.addington,at.at,d at.this high standard of proof reduces the risk of finding an innocent person guilty,but increases the risk of acquitting a guilty person.lyon department of children family services.
in contrast,civil cases generally require the lesser preponderance standard of proof.this standard allocates the risk of error roughly equally between the litigants santosky,at.at,d at,reflecting the view that the interests at stake are of relatively equal societal importance lyon,at.in some civil cases,however,the interests at stake are deemed to be more substantial,requiring a higher standard than a preponderance.in these cases,a clear and convincing standard is imposed.addington,at.at,d at bazydlo,at.the clear and convincing standard requires proof greater than a preponderance,but not quite approaching the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.bazydlo,at.a party burdened with a clear and convincing standard shoulders a greater share of the risk of an erroneous determination.see cruzan,at.at,d at.
in determining whether,as argued by respondent,a clear and convincing standard is the minimum burden of proof at a hearing that the due process clause will allow,we apply the test developed in mathews eldridge,d.see in re andrea,evaluating challenged procedure at parental rights termination proceeding under mathews in re,same.under mathews,the dictates of due process require consideration of three factors f irst,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.mathews,at.at,d at.
two private interests are at stake in a proceeding to terminate parental rights the parent fundamental liberty interest in the care,custody and management of his or her child santosky,at.at,d at,at,and the child interest in a normal family home santosky,at.at,d at,or,as our appellate court described it,an interest in a loving,stable and safe home environment d at.see also people,t he minor also has a private interest in his or her own and in a stable environment.at the unfitness stage,the interests of the parent and the child coincide to the extent that they both share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship.santosky,at.at,d at.the alignment of these interests at the unfitness hearing favors the use of procedures,use of a more stringent burden of proof than a preponderance.see santosky,at.at,d at.the same,however,is not true at a hearing.once the state proves parental unfitness,the interests of the parent and the child diverge.santosky,at.at,d at.thus,at a hearing,the parent and the child may become adversaries,as the child interest in a loving,stable and safe home environment become more aligned with the state interest in terminating parental rights and freeing the child for adoption.although the parent still possesses an interest in maintaining the relationship,the force of that interest is lessened by the court finding that the parent is unfit to raise his or her child.
the second mathews factor requires us to consider the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent and child interests resulting from the use of a preponderance standard and the likelihood that a higher evidentiary and reduce the risk of error.see santosky,at.at,d at.at the unfitness hearing,the focus is on the parent conduct relative to the ground or grounds of unfitness alleged by the state.the trial court is not permitted to consider the child interests.in re.a clear and convincing standard underscores the importance of the parent interest and the fact that such interest will not be extinguished lightly,at.a clear and convincing standard reduces the risk that a fit parent will be found unfit.
following a finding of unfitness,however,the focus shifts to the child.the issue is no longer whether parental rights can be terminated the issue is whether,in light of the child needs,parental rights should be terminated.accordingly,at a hearing,the parent interest in maintaining the relationship must yield to the child interest in a stable,loving home life.see in re,d,in re,d,allen,d at.the stricter clear and convincing burden of proof would place a greater share of the risk of an erroneous determination on the state,operating to the benefit of the parent,but to the detriment of the child.this is so because an erroneous finding that termination of parental rights is not in the child best interests results in preservation of the relationship,to the obvious favor of the unfit parent.such an erroneous finding,however,would also deprive the child of the opportunity for permanency,one of the stated goals of the juvenile court act ilcs west,and subject the child to the frequently uncertain and fluctuating world of foster care.thus,application of a clear and convincing burden of proof at the hearing does not adequately safeguard the interest of the child in a normal family home santosky,at.at,d at.imposition of a preponderance standard,however,would distribute the risk of error relatively equally,reflecting the roughly equal interest the parents,the state,and the child have in the outcome of the proceeding.
turning to the final mathews factor,two governmental interests are
