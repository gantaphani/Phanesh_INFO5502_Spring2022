emma boyd was an employee of delta airlines,who participated in a life insurance plan administered by metropolitan life insurance company metlife and governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.at the time of emma death in november,the plan documents on file with metlife designated emma husband,robert alsager,as the primary beneficiary of the plan.metlife thus paid the plan proceeds to alsager even though he and emma had separated and even though he had previously signed a separation agreement in family court waiving any claim to the benefits.
in response,mary emma boyd emma mother and boyd mary emma son and the personal representative of emma estate filed this suit,claiming eligibility for the benefits on the theory that alsager had relinquished his right to receive them.the district court dismissed their suit,concluding that metlife had fulfilled its statutory duty under erisa by awarding benefits to the beneficiary designated in the documents emma filed with the plan.we agree.the boyds arguments are foreclosed by the supreme court recent decision in kennedy plan administrator for dupont savings investment plan,and we therefore affirm the judgment.
the facts of this case are both brief and undisputed.emma boyd,a resident of charleston,south carolina,worked for delta airlines until her untimely death.as a delta employee,she participated in a life insurance plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.the plan allowed her to designate a beneficiary in her application or in her enrollment form that person would be first in line to receive the proceeds of the policy.moreover,emma could unilaterally change the designated beneficiary at any time by sending a signed and dated written request to metlife.in the event that emma failed to designate a beneficiary or had no surviving beneficiary at the time of her death,the plan made clear that metlife would disburse benefits to her estate.the plan did not specify any procedure for beneficiaries to follow in order to waive their claims to benefits.
on december,emma filed a beneficiary designation form naming her husband,robert alsager,as the primary beneficiary of the plan.emma also designated her mother,mary emma boyd,as the contingent beneficiary in the event that alsager refused to take the benefits.roughly six years later,however,emma and alsager separated.in april,the family court in charleston,south carolina entered an order approving emma and alsager separation and property settlement agreement.one provision of that agreement released emma and alsager claims to the other estate or property 
each party relinquishes and disclaims all right,claim or interest whether actual,inchoate or contingent,in law and in equity that she or he may acquire in the property or estate of the other,including without limitation the right to receive proceeds,funds or property as a beneficiary under any life insurance policies.
while emma obtained alsager signature on that agreement,she never changed the beneficiary designation on file with metlife,meaning that alsager remained the primary beneficiary under the plan.
on november,emma passed away.mary emma boyd and her son,boyd the boyds,filed a claim for the benefits from the life insurance policy.despite having signed the settlement agreement,alsager filed a claim as well.relying on the plan documents on file,metlife determined that the benefits should be paid to alsager and denied the boyds claim.metlife indicated at oral argument that it has since paid the benefits to alsager.
the boyds then sent a letter to metlife appealing the denial of their claim,arguing that alsager had waived any right to recover benefits when he signed the property settlement agreement.after metlife replied with a letter upholding the denial of benefits,the boyds filed suit under a b which permits an individual to file a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan or to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan in district court in december.the court granted metlife motion to dismiss the boyds suit on june,concluding that metlife had carried out its statutory obligations by disbursing benefits in accordance with the beneficiary designation form on file with the plan.this appeal followed.
enacted in,erisa established a comprehensive and complex scheme for regulating private pension plans.borden,bakery confectionery union indus.int l pension,cir.in order to protect plan participants and beneficiaries from fiduciary abuses,erisa requires plan administrators to discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,and to do so for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.a.to that end,plan administrators must act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the other provisions of erisa.a d.indeed,congress identified the need to follow plan documents as a core principle of the act.see,at,reprinted in.
in kennedy plan administrator for dupont savings investment plan,the supreme court construed a d as a broad endorsement of the plan documents rule,kennedy.at,under which plan administrators look solely at the directives of the plan documents in determining how to disburse benefits,id.at.in other words,a claim for benefits must stand or fall by the terms of the plan.id.quoting a b.this rule followed the plain text of the statute,which instructs employers to distribute benefits in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.a d.it also accorded with the statute purpose,as erisa statutory scheme is built around reliance on the face of written plan documents.kennedy.at quoting curtiss wright schoonejongen.
moreover,as the court noted,the rule makes good sense.the plan documents rule provides plan participants with a clear set of instructions for making their own instructions clear.id.it gives employers clear distribution instructions,without going into court,id.at,and thus permits them to create a uniform administrative scheme,with a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits,id.at quoting egelhoff egelhoff.and it avoids the complications,delays,and costs inherent in requiring administrators to examine external documents in an attempt to piece together a plan participant intent.in short,the plan documents rule ensures that beneficiaries get what coming quickly,without the folderol essential under rules.id.at quoting fox valley vicinity constr.workers pension fund brown,cir easterbrook,dissenting.
kennedy,however,did not just announce the plan documents rule.it also confirmed the rule soundness through application.in kennedy,the court confronted a situation where kennedy was party to a divorce decree divesting her of any right to proceeds from kennedy retirement or pension plans,but where she remained the designated beneficiary of one of kennedy pension benefit plans in the documents on file with the plan.id.at.upon kennedy death,the executrix of his estate claimed that the funds from that pension plan should be distributed to the estate insofar as kennedy had waived any claim to benefits under the divorce decree.id.at.but the court rejected that argument,concluding that the plan administrator was not required to honor the waiver with the consequence of distributing the plan balance to the estate,but instead was statutorily required to distribute benefits in accordance with the documents on file.id.at.
in other words,even though kennedy waiver was clear,the court concluded that it could not trump the plan documents.in its view,requiring plan administrators to analyze such waivers would involve them in thorny questions about whether a claimed federal common law waiver was knowing and voluntary,whether its language addressed the particular benefits at issue,and so forth.id.at.such an approach would be and ultimately unnecessary,given that both the participant and the beneficiary could head such situations off at the p
