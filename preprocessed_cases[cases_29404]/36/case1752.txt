grohman and kahlig divorced in.as part of their divorce settlement,kahlig agreed to pay grohman approximately million.kahlig paid grohman approximately million in cash and gave grohman a promissory note for million,to be paid off in annual installment payments of approximately million.as collateral,kahlig pledged a majority of his stock in two corporations,north park,and kahlig enterprises,totaling seventy percent of the shares outstanding in each corporation.
kahlig and grohman entered into a security agreement in to protect grohman interest in the collateral.the agreement described the collateral and kahlig rights and duties 
kahlig grants grohman a continuing security interest in and to the following 
a of the outstanding shares of common capital stock in north park,and b of the outstanding shares of common capital stock in kahlig enterprises,and such shares and all replacements,additions,and substitutions therefor now owned or hereafter acquired by borrower,plus all cash and proceeds and all proceeds of proceeds arising from those shares all of which is individually and collectively hereinafter referred to as collateral.

in,prior to the divorce,kahlig inquired into the franchise tax benefits of converting his two corporations to limited partnerships.in,he requested a private letter ruling from the irs seeking confirmation that the conversion would not adversely affect the dealership inventory accounting method.the irs confirmed the conversion would not adversely affect the businesses in a favorable private letter ruling six months later.kahlig converted the corporations to partnerships shortly thereafter.
kahlig formed two identical plans of reorganization for the two corporations.kahlig organized a holding company corresponding to each corporation.he contributed his existing stock in each corporation to each holding company.then,kahlig converted each corporation to a limited partnership,and each holding company exchanged the shares of corporate stock for equal units of limited partnership interest with the newly formed limited partnership.the corporate shares were canceled once they were replaced with partnership units.the conversions had no effect on grohman security interest other than replacing corporate stock with units of limited partnership,and kahlig equity in the entities actually increased in value due to the more beneficial franchise tax treatment.kahlig converted the entities back to corporations in when the limited partnership form was no longer advantageous for reducing the entities franchise taxes.
grohman discovered the conversions during a second child custody suit against kahlig.she sued kahlig for breach of contract in august alleging that the conversions breached the agreement because kahlig agreed not to sell,transfer,lease or otherwise dispose of the collateral or any interest therein without grohman consent and further agreed not to allow the collateral to become wasted or destroyed.grohman contended that kahlig alleged breach accelerated the debt at the time of the breach,despite kahlig timely payment as agreed.she claimed damages,beyond the amount due under the promissory note,in the form of additional interest on the accelerated principal.later,grohman amended her complaint to add fraud,negligence,and gross negligence claims.kahlig asserted a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the agreement did not preclude kahlig from continuing to unilaterally determine the business form under which his businesses operated,and thus the conversion of the business form was not an event of default under the agreement.
at trial,the court held that the breach of contract claim was a question of fact and thus submitted it to the jury.the court refused to submit grohman tort claims,holding that no evidence supported them.the jury found that kahlig did not breach the agreement by converting the corporations to limited partnerships.the trial court entered a judgment as to grohman claims.it also granted kahlig request for declaratory relief and awarded attorney fees in the amount of to kahlig and to the business entities.see.civ.prac.allowing recovery of attorney fees in a suit for declaratory judgment.
grohman appealed,contending the trial court erred by submitting a question of law to the jury that should have been answered by the trial court failing to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because she established kahlig breached of the agreement as a matter of law refusing to submit her tort claims to the jury and awarding attorney fees.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment on grohman tort claims,but reversed the judgment on the breach of contract claim and the awards of declaratory relief and attorney fees.it first held the contract stated unambiguously that the secured collateral could only be in the form of shares of corporate stock,and it was undisputed that kahlig converted the corporations to partnerships.id.at.thus,the court held that whether kahlig breached the contract was a question of law that should not have been submitted to the jury.id.at.the submission was not harmless error because the conversion of business entities disposed of the collateral,and kahlig had indeed breached as a matter of law.id.at.because kahlig breached the agreement and the court of appeals reversed the award of declaratory relief,it did not reach grohman arguments regarding attorney fees.it reversed the attorney fees award and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of damages.id.at.
both parties appealed.kahlig argues,as a matter of law,he did not breach the agreement because it did not prohibit converting his corporations to limited partnerships.thus,the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court judgment because the jury submission was harmless error.alternatively,he argues the agreement was ambiguous as to his right to convert the business forms,and thus the trial court was correct to submit the question to the jury.grohman argues that the court of appeals erred in remanding to the trial court,rather than rendering judgment in her favor,on the breach of contract claim.she also argues the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court refusal to submit her tort claims to the jury.we analyze each claim separately.
