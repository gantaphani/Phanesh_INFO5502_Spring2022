defendant gerald austin brooks appeals in propria persona from an august,restraining order entered against him,after a hearing,pursuant to the domestic violence prevention act dvpa,et 
defendant asserts that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because,at the time of the commencement of this proceeding and at the time of the hearing,he lived out of state.defendant further asserts that the trial court erred in failing or declining to consider his opposition papers he sent to the court by fax on the morning of the hearing.
we conclude that,because defendant failed to properly move to quash service,he waived his challenge to the trial court exercise of jurisdiction over him.we further conclude that,assuming the trial judge ever saw defendant untimely opposition papers,it would have been proper to disregard them because defendant attempted to file them by fax in violation of the local rules of court 
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order in the superior court for el dorado county on august.she sought a restraining order protecting herself and two named nieces from defendant.
in her declaration,plaintiff stated that the parties were married in,but they separated in.they attempted reconciliation,but plaintiff filed for divorce in june and the couple divorce was finalized in december.plaintiff set forth detailed allegations of defendant violent,threatening,and intimidating behavior before and during the marriage.she further asserted that defendant had been harassing her since the parties reached their divorce agreement in september.plaintiff stated that,between august and december,defendant sent her frightening text messages,stating,for example,nothing will separate us we are always going to be together,we will always be one,nothing can separate us.plaintiff also learned that defendant had told his roommates that the parties would be back together and remain married forever.additionally,in or about september,plaintiff learned that defendant had purchased ammunition for the first time for a gun he had owned for many years.on november,plaintiff wrote defendant a formal request,asking him not contact her or her family.defendant responded that he would not contact her again unless she needed him.
plaintiff stated in her declaration that she did not hear from defendant until march.she stated,i am being harassed by him on average of one time a week since march.defendant texted her through his email on june.on july,he texted plaintiff through his mother cell phone.on july,he sent her a gift through the mail.on july,he emailed her at multiple email accounts.on july,he texted her.on july,he sent plaintiff an email to a new guessed account,asking to talk.according to plaintiff,in an august,email,the pattern changed and defendant started to blame her.plaintiff stated,he is never going to stop harassing me.she asserted that defendant anger was escalating.she was in fear for her life and for the lives of her family.
on august,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order.the court also issued a notice of court hearing,notifying defendant that a hearing was scheduled for august,at in the superior court,el dorado county,main street,placerville,ca.the notice informed defendant that,if he wished to respond in writing,he was to have a copy of a dv response to request for domestic violence restraining order form mailed to the plaintiff,and file a copy of that form with the court.no address for the court appeared on the temporary restraining order or the notice other than the main street address.the notice further informed defendant whether or not you respond in writing,go to the court hearing if you want the judge to hear from you before making orders.
on the morning of the august,hearing,a clerk office for the superior court,el dorado county,received a faxed document and cover letter from defendant.the document was entitled gerald austin brook plea to the jurisdiction,special appearance,motion for continuance of hearing,subject to plea to the jurisdiction,and response to request for restraining order.hereafter,the opposition papers.the cover letter was dated august,and addressed to administration,placerville court,fairlane court,placerville,ca.the letter reads in pertinent part,dear administrator please find enclosed gerald austin brook plea to the jurisdiction plea to the jurisdiction sic,special appearance,motion for continuance of hearing,subject to plea to the jurisdiction,and response to request for restraining order.thank you for your attention to this matter.the letter also bore the words,via fax no.and e mail to and via first class mail.the fax send report indicates the opposition papers were received on a superior court fax machine at on the morning of august,from a law office in abilene,texas.no documents indicated when the letter purportedly was mailed by first class mail.defendant averred that the opposition papers were forwarded to plaintiff on august.
in his opposition papers,defendant asserted that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the court because,on or about may,he moved to abilene,texas.he also stated that for the approximately years he lived in california,he had lived in ventura and los angeles counties.he stated that he had never resided in el dorado county,and therefore claimed that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the el dorado county superior court.he purported to make a special appearance by this document,without waiving the jurisdiction issue.defendant also made a lengthy denial of the merits of plaintiff claims.among other things,defendant said he sent plaintiff messages for six months in an attempt to reconcile,but stopped when he got a call from an el dorado s heriff on august.
the trial court conducted the hearing on august.the judge who presided over the case did not mention defendant faxed opposition papers during the hearing.it is not entirely clear on this record whether the judge ever actually received defendant opposition papers.as noted,a superior court fax machine received the document at,only minutes before the time the hearing was calendared.and the courtroom where the hearing was calendared was located at main street in placerville,but the cover letter for the document was addressed to administration,placerville court at fairlane court,suite,in placerville.moreover,as we discuss post,the el dorado county superior court does not accept fax filing,and because no file stamp appears on the copies of the opposition papers in the record before us,it does not appear defendant papers were accepted for filing by the clerk.
at the hearing,plaintiff testified that defendant had hacked into her email accounts,stolen one of her house keys,and sent her a handwritten letter and unwanted gifts.she realized defendant had hacked into her email account when defendant referenced facts he could not have otherwise known.

plaintiff also testified that defendant had attempted to track her down in person.he discovered which church she had been attending and contacted the pastor,seeking to have the pastor facilitate a reconciliation between the parties.
