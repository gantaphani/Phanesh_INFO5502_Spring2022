introduction 
we hold under the california domestic partner rights and responsibilities act of stats,ch.the domestic partner act,and consistent with the rationale of our supreme court in koebke bernardo heights country club cal th,d,koebke,a person reasonable,good faith belief that his or her domestic partnership was validly registered with the california secretary of state entitles that person to the rights and responsibilities of a registered domestic partner,even if the registration never took place.
the california legislature stated purpose in enacting the domestic partner act was to extend to registered domestic partners all the rights,benefits,and obligations of married persons,with the exception of the rights,benefits,and obligations accorded only to married persons by federal law,the california constitution,or initiative statutes.under the equitable putative spouse doctrine,a person reasonable,good faith belief that his or her marriage is valid entitles that person to the benefits of marriage,even if the marriage is not,in fact,valid.the doctrine is not accorded by federal law,the california constitution,or a voter initiative.it therefore extends to those who intended to register their domestic partnerships under the domestic partner act and had a reasonable,good faith belief that the registration had occurred,despite the failure to properly complete the registration.as a result,a person may plead and attempt to prove that he or she is entitled to the rights and responsibilities of a registered domestic partner under these circumstances.
in this case,the trial court dismissed a petition for dissolution of a domestic partnership because the domestic partnership had never been registered with the california secretary of state.appellant submitted a declaration in opposition to respondent motion to dismiss the petition stating he believed his partner had completed the registration process with the state after they signed and had notarized the necessary documents.we conclude the trial court erred by granting the motion to dismiss the petition without permitting appellant an opportunity to plead and prove a reasonable,good faith belief in the existence of a registered domestic partnership we therefore reverse.
we decide this case by applying and uncontroversial principles of statutory construction,driven by the legislature express stated intent in enacting the domestic partner act.we do not reach other,broader issues urged by appellant.
statement of facts and procedural history 
on september,darrin ellis filed a petition for dissolution of his domestic partnership with david james arriaga.ellis alleged the domestic partnership had been registered on august.
arriaga filed a motion to dismiss the petition,arguing the declaration of domestic partnership,which he and ellis signed and had notarized on august,had never been filed with the california secretary of state,and no domestic partnership had therefore been formed.
the trial court granted the motion to dismiss,concluding putative status was unavailable to domestic partners who had not registered with the california secretary of state.
ellis timely appealed.
discussion 
this case involves an interpretation of statutes our review is de novo.mckee orange unified school dist.th,d.in construing a statute,our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin with the language of the statute,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.the language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.if the statutory terms are ambiguous,we may examine extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we choose the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,endeavoring to promote rather than defeat the statute general purpose,and avoiding a construction that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.smith superior court cal th,d.
putative spouse doctrine 
we start by considering the putative spouse doctrine,an equitable doctrine first recognized by the judiciary,and later codified by the legislature.in,our supreme court recognized,i t is well settled that a woman who lives with a man as his wife in the belief that a valid marriage exists,is entitled upon termination of their relationship to share in the property acquired by them during its existence.citations.the essential basis of a putative marriage,however,is a belief in the existence of a valid marriage.citations.in addition,in the majority of cases,the de facto wife attempted to meet the requisites of a valid marriage,and the marriage proved invalid only because of some essential fact of which she was unaware,such as the earlier undissolved marriage of one of the parties citations,a consanguineous relation between the parties citations,or the failure to meet the requirement of solemnization.citations.vallera vallera cal d.
in,the legislature codified the putative spouse doctrine in former civil code section.that statute used language almost identical to that in family code section,subdivision a,which contains the current version of the putative spouse doctrine and provides in relevant part if a determination is made that a marriage is void or voidable and the court finds that either party or both parties believed in good faith that the marriage was valid,the court shall declare the party or parties to have the status of a putative spouse.relief under the putative spouse doctrine is not precluded even if the circumstances do not establish either a void or voidable marriage.estate of depasse th,d in re marriage of vryonis d.t he codification of the putative marriage doctrine in former civil code section was not intended to narrow the application of the doctrine only to parties to a void or voidable marriage.instead,the legislature contemplated the continued protection of innocent parties who believe they were validly married.in re marriage of vryonis,supra,d at.
the good faith belief that a marriage has been validly entered into is tested by an objective,not a subjective standard.estate of depasse,supra,th at,d.a proper assertion of putative spouse status must rest on facts that would cause a reasonable person to harbor a good faith belief in the existence of a lawful california marriage.id.at,d.
the domestic partner act 
before the enactment of the domestic partner act,the rights granted to registered domestic partners in california were specifically enumerated,and r egistration as a domestic partner under this division shall not be evidence of,or establish,any rights existing under law other than those expressly provided to domestic partners in this division and any provision of law specifically referring to domestic partners.former,subd.a see armijo miles th,d.various legislative enactments and amendments gave registered domestic partners a variety of rights and responsibilities.see,subd.a standing for negligent infliction of emotional distress claim code civ,subd.a standing for wrongful death claim,subd.g c access to domestic violence incident reports,subd.b eligibility for stepparent adoption procedures former,subd.a continuing health care coverage for domestic partners of deceased public employees,subd.a death benefits for surviving domestic partners of county employees health,subd.c access to copies of domestic partner birth and death records,subd.c intestate rights,subd.a exemption from prohibition against donative transfers to drafter of will unemp,wage replacement benefits for employees caring for ill domestic partners.
with its enactment in,the domestic partner act changed the entire manner in which rights are granted to and responsibilities are imposed on registered domestic partners as compared to the former system of granting specific,limited rights,the domestic partner act extends to registered domestic partners substantially all rights,benefits,and obligations of married persons under state law,with the exception of rights,benefits,and obligations accorded only to married persons by federal law,the california constitution,or initiative statutes.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,see armijo miles,supra,th at,d.
the domestic partner act requires us to liberally interpret its reach in the same way as the laws of california apply to spouses,except as to the rights and benefits only afforded to married persons by law.the domestic partner act states this act shall be construed liberally in order to secure to eligible couples who register as domestic partners the full range of legal rights,protections and benefits,as well as all of the responsibilities,obligations,and duties to each other,to their children,to third parties and to the state,as the laws of california extend to and impose upon spouses.stats,ch.
under the domestic partner act,r egistered domestic partners shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,whether they derive from statutes,administrative regulations,court rules,government policies,common law,or any other provisions or sources of law,as are granted to and imposed upon spouses,subd.a.as our supreme court opined,i t is clear from both the language of family code section and the legislature explicit statements of intent that a chief goal of the domestic partner act is to equalize the status of registered domestic partners and married couples.koebke,supra,cal th at,d.
the rights and responsibilities of domestic partners upon separation are in the category of the rights and responsibilities to be decided by a court under the domestic partner act.significantly,family code section,subdivision d,states the superior courts shall have jurisdiction over all proceedings relating to the dissolution of domestic partnerships,nullity of domestic partnerships,and legal separation of partners in a domestic partnership.the dissolution of a domestic partnership,nullity of a domestic partnership,and legal separation of partners in a domestic partnership shall follow the same procedures,and the partners shall possess the same rights,protections,and benefits,and be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties,as apply to the dissolution of marriage,nullity of marriage,and legal separation of spouses in a marriage,respectively italics added.
to summarize,the domestic partner act provides it must be construed liberally to give registered domestic partners the same rights and obligations as married couples,to the extent permissible by law and the same rights,protections,and benefits are to be granted to registered domestic partners dissolving their domestic partnership as are granted to spouses dissolving their marriage.as explained,ante,the law of this state is that an individual with a reasonable,good faith belief in the validity of his or her marriage,even if that marriage is void or voidable,is entitled to protection as a putative spouse,subd.a.given the intended reach of the domestic partner act,we conclude that a person with a reasonable,good faith belief in the validity of his or her registered domestic partnership is similarly entitled to protection as a putative registered domestic partner,even if the domestic partnership was not properly registered.
here,the trial court erred in its conclusion that the putative spouse doctrine could only apply if ellis and arriaga had registered their domestic partnership.the whole point of the putative spouse doctrine is to protect those whose marriage was not or could not be properly formalized,or was void,voidable,or otherwise invalid.the domestic partner act was intended by the legislature to extend to registered domestic partners the legal rights and responsibilities held by married couples to the extent permitted by law.the putative spouse doctrine is not a right or obligation accorded by federal law,the california constitution,or voter initiative,and therefore is not excluded from the rights granted and obligations imposed under the domestic partner act.there is no sound reason under california statutory law to deprive domestic partners of the rights granted to registered domestic partners if they reasonably believed they were so registered.
our conclusion is consistent with the california supreme court analysis of the domestic partner act in a different context.in koebke,supra,cal th at page,d,our high court concluded the unruh civil rights act prohibits discrimination based on marital status.the court also concluded registered domestic partners under the domestic partner act are the equivalent of spouses for purposes of application of the unruh civil rights act.koebke,supra,cal th at,d.to couples who meet the requirements of establishing a domestic partnership under the domestic partner act and who have registered under that law,the legislature has granted legal recognition comparable to marriage both procedurally and in terms of the substantive rights and obligations granted to and imposed upon the partners,which are supported by policy considerations similar to those that favor marriage.citation.id.at,d.the court rejected the argument that because the domestic partner act contains only one specific antidiscrimination code section,subdivision g,prohibiting discrimination by public legislature did not intend to ban discrimination against registered domestic partners in public accommodations no specific legislative declaration is required for this court to infer from the statements of legislative intent accompanying the domestic partner act an intent that registered domestic partners should not be discriminated against in favor of married couples in public accommodations.koebke,supra,cal th at,d.
similarly,here,we are convinced that the legislative intent of the domestic partner act is to apply the equitable putative spouse doctrine codified in family code section to persons with a reasonable,good faith belief in the validity of their registered domestic partnerships,enabling them to plead and prove they reasonably believed they were registered domestic partners.
given our holding,we need not reach other issues urged by ellis,namely,whether a contrary decision would violate federal or state constitutional guarantees of equal protection,or that we should equitably read into existing statutes the language necessary to equalize the statuses of married couples and registered domestic partners.
velez smith th is inapposite.to the extent it is inconsistent with our holding,we disagree with that decision.
in velez smith th,d velez,lena velez and krista smith registered as domestic partners with the city and county of san francisco in.in,they again registered as domestic partners in san francisco when they attended a public commitment ceremony.ibid.velez and smith never registered or attempted to register their domestic partnership with the california secretary of state.id.at,d.in november,before the domestic partner act went into effect,smith filed a notice ending the domestic partnership with the san francisco county clerk and mailed a copy to velez.velez,supra,th at,d.velez filed a petition for dissolution of the domestic partnership in december,and filed an amended petition in january,after the domestic partner act became effective,seeking a division of the domestic partnership assets and a termination of the court jurisdiction to award support to smith.velez,supra,th at,d.the trial court found it lacked jurisdiction over the case,and granted smith motion to strike the amended petition.id.at,d.
the appellate court agreed there was no domestic partnership to be dissolved,and therefore affirmed the trial court order striking velez amended petition.the appellate court first concluded registration of a domestic partnership with the secretary of state,as specified in the family code,was a prerequisite t
