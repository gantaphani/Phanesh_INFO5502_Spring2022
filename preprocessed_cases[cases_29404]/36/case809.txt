contends the juvenile court abused its discretion and violated her due process rights when it denied her request for a contested review hearing under welfare and institutions code section we reverse the order.
section,subdivision f,states the parent of a child in foster care is entitled to participate in a review hearing.here,at a month permanency review,the parent of a child in foster care disputed the social service agency evidence and recommendations and requested a contested hearing.the juvenile court conditioned the right to a contested hearing on an offer of proof,which the parent provided and the court found insufficient.the court then adopted the agency report as the findings and orders of the court.
the courts of appeal are divided as to whether the right to a contested hearing at a review may be conditioned on an offer of proof.maricela superior court th maricela court may require offer of proof in re kelly th kelly right to participate in review includes right to challenge or contest proposed order in re josiah th josiah parent has statutory and due process right to present evidence,and confront and witnesses superior court th court may require offer of proof when the parent has the burden of proof.this court has not previously examined the issue.
we conclude that section,subdivision f,does not by its plain terms require a parent to submit an offer of proof to gain the right to be heard at a review hearing.section,subdivision f,explicitly states the court may order another period of reunification services if the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.the scheme also imposes on the court the obligation to review factors concerning the child circumstances and to consider all permanency options for the child,including return to the parent home.further,in view of the interests at stake,a parent of a child in foster care has a due process right to be heard at a review.we conclude the error was prejudicial and requires reversal.
factual and procedural background 
is now years old.he grew up in an unstable,violent and chaotic household,and became a dependent of the juvenile court in at age as a result of his stepfather physical abuse and domestic violence,and his mother inability to protect him.had no relationship with his biological father.
mother,made only limited progress with her case plan.the court terminated family reunification services in.
in its report prepared for the section hearing,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency reported that said he missed his mother and not seeing her would be the worst thing ever.he did not want to live with his mother because she had resumed a relationship with his stepfather.had strong ties to his community and birth family.in view of those factors,the social worker recommended,and the juvenile court ordered,a plan of foster care for.the court previous order for reasonable,supervised visitation between and remained in effect.
at the review,the social worker reported that asked for visitation.did not want to see his mother,stating she makes me mad.he did not want to have any contact with his stepfather.the social worker stated was not adoptable because of his emotional and behavioral problems.
in the report prepared for the month review report,the social worker reported that did not want to visit his mother.after moved to a new foster care home in august,his mother did not make any efforts to see him.new foster family was open to the possibility of adopting him.however,in view of past emotional and behavioral problems,the social worker wanted to wait six months before deciding whether to request a new section hearing.
at the month review,disputed the factual assertions in the report and asked for a contested hearing on the issues of returning to her care,reinstatement of reunification services and visitation.
relying on maricela,the court asked for an offer of proof.stated the report did not accurately describe the visits she had with and the attempts she made to see him.she believed the evidence would show that might want to live with her,or visit her under a plan of reunification services.
the court found that offer of proof was insufficient and denied her request for a contested hearing.objected to the court order,stating she was denied an opportunity to respond to the agency evidence.based on the report,the court found that did not wish to visit and had not requested services.the court adopted the agency report as the findings and orders of the court.
discussion 
asserts she was entitled to a contested review hearing without having to make an offer of proof or file a section petition.she contends section,subdivision f,grants the parent of a child in foster care the right to participate in a review and to show that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.asserts the court violated her due process rights when it denied her an opportunity to be heard.she states she has the right to present evidence,controvert the contents of the social worker report and witnesses at a review.
the agency argues the decision whether to grant a contested hearing at a review is within the discretion of the juvenile court,and the court may condition such a hearing on an offer of proof.the agency asserts the court is not obligated to hold a contested hearing on a parent request to return the child to the parent home.the agency further contends that because of the child interest in permanency,the state interest in avoiding unnecessary litigation and the parent tenuous interest in the care and companionship of his or her child,a parent of a child in foster care does not have the due process right to an evidentiary hearing at a review.

statutory framework 
generally,the parent of a dependent child in care is offered or provided reunification services to make it possible for the child to return to a safe home.the court must hold a hearing every six months to review the status of the child and the progress the parent has made toward family reunification.if reunification efforts are not successful within the applicable time frame,the court must terminate services and set a hearing to select and implement an appropriate permanent plan.at the permanency planning hearing,the court selects a permanent plan from those specified in section,including,in order of mandatory preference,adoption,guardianship,or placement in foster care subject to the juvenile court periodic review,subd.b,san diego county of social services superior court cal th,san diego county.
if the juvenile court selects foster care as a child permanency plan,the court or an appropriate local agency must review the status of the child at least every six months,subd.d,san diego county,supra,cal th at see also.the court is required to conduct the review if it has been months since the court ordered the child to remain in foster care,if it has been months since a review was conducted by the court or upon request of the parent or child,subd.d.
section,subdivision e,directs the reviewing body to inquire about the progress being made to provide a permanent home for the child and other matters,including the necessity for,and appropriateness of,the placement the child safety the extent of the agency compliance in making reasonable efforts either to return the child to the safe home of the parent or to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the child permanent placement and the extent of progress the parent has made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating the child placement in foster care,subd.e.
unless parental rights have been permanently terminated,the child parent is entitled to receive notice of,and participate in,those hearings,subd.f.continued foster care is presumed to be in the child best interests unless the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.ibid.
the court is required to consider all permanency planning options,including whether the child should be returned to the home of the parent,placed for adoption,appointed a legal guardian or placed in another planned permanent living arrangement,subd.h.the court must set a section hearing unless it determines by clear and convincing evidence there is a compelling reason that a section hearing is not in the child best interest,subd.h.a compelling reason exists when the child is being returned to the home of the parent,the child is not a proper subject for adoption or there is no one willing to accept legal guardianship of the child.ibid.
the review may be conducted earlier than every six months if the court determines that an earlier review is in the child best interests or as court rules prescribe,subd.k.california rules of court rule b,provides if circumstances have changed since the permanent plan was ordered,the court may order a new permanent plan under section at any subsequent hearing,or any party may seek a new permanent plan by filing a motion under section.rule see,rule but see,san diego county,supra,cal th at at a review,the court may set a section hearing sua sponte there is no requirement that a party file a section petition.
under section,subdivision f,the parent of a child in long term foster care has the right to participate in the child post permanency review 
to determine legislative intent,we begin by examining the statutory language,giving words their usual and ordinary meaning.estate of griswold cal th.we consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.phelps stostad cal th.where the language of the statute is clear,there is no need to resort to other indicia of legislative intent.lungren deukmejian cal d.
section,subdivision f,states the child parent is entitled to receive notice of,and to participate in,review hearings.the usual and ordinary meaning of participate is to take part.merriam webster coll.dict.ed.the statute does not condition the right to take part in a review on an offer of proof or a petition for modification under section,subd.f.instead,section,subdivision f,provides the court may order a further period of reunification services if the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that services are the best alternative for the child.thus,by its plain language,section,subdivision f,grants the parent the right to take part in the review and anticipates the parent may present evidence to overcome the presumption continued foster care is in the child best interests,italics added.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.estate of griswold,supra,cal th at.
to the extent we look beyond the statute to interpret the phrase entitled to receive notice of,and participate in,those hearings,we concur with the analysis in kelly,supra,th at.in that case,the reviewing court reasoned that a parent right to notice and to participate in a review hearing connotes involvement as a party to the proceeding,with the reasonable expectation the parent of a child in foster care can challenge agency proposals and any proposed modifications of the permanency orders,including visitation orders.accord,josiah,supra,th at.a parent right to participate has little meaning or content if it does not include the right to challenge or contest a proposed order.kelly,supra,at josiah,supra,at.t he right to a contested hearing contemplates that a parent has the right to testify and otherwise submit evidence,adverse witnesses,and argue his or her case.josiah,supra,at,quoting kelly,supra,at see rule k.
we are not persuaded by the agency reliance on maricela,supra,th.maricela did not examine the statutory language granting the parent the right to participate in a review hearing.see kelly,supra,th at.instead,the reviewing court examined the legislative history of the subdivision directing the juvenile court to consider all permanency options for a child in foster care at a review now codified at section,subd.h the reviewing court explained the legislature amended the statute to clarify that a month review hearing was not a section hearing and the juvenile court was not required to set a new section hearing unless the child was suitable for adoption or guardianship.maricela,supra,th at.maricela held that requiring a parent to make an offer of proof to obtain a contested hearing furthered the legislature intent to avoid relitigating a child permanency plan at the reviews.ibid.
were it not for its emphasis on the state interest in avoiding repetitive litigation,maricela acknowledges that section,subdivision h,could be interpreted as entitling a parent of a child in foster care to notice and an opportunity to be heard without requiring the parent to make an offer of proof.maricela,supra,th at.we are not persuaded the legislative amendment clarifying when the juvenile court must set a section hearing for a child in foster care supports the conclusion the legislature intended to condition a parent right to contest the social service agency evidence and recommendations on an offer of proof at review hearings under section,subdivision e.
maricela examined the statutory language of section,subdivision h,and concluded that the directive to the court to consider all permanency planning options did not necessitate a contested hearing.maricela,supra,th at.significantly,the reviewing court did not construe section,subdivision h,in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.phelps stostad,supra,cal th at.section,subdivision h,directs the court to consider all permanency planning options for a child in foster care at the review held pursuant to subdivision d.section,subdivision d,mandates a review every six months.section,subdivision e,describes the issues under review.section,subdivision f,states the parent is entitled to receive notice of,and participate in,those hearings,italics added referring to the reviews under subdivision d.thus,when the court considers all permanency planning options for the child under section,subdivision h,it does so pursuant to the requirements of section,subdivisions d and f,which include the right of a parent to participate in the hearing.
similarly,did not examine the right of a parent to participate in a review but merely noted its disagreement with the appellant argument the phrase afforded a parent an absolute right to an evidentiary hearing,supra,th at.distinguished the holdings in kelly and josiah on the grounds those cases did not involve a challenge to a recommendation to set a new section hearing under section,subdivision h,supra,at.for the reasons set forth above,we do not find this distinction significant.the court consideration of all permanency planning options under section,subdivision h,is part of the review.
in support of its holding that the parent of a child in foster care does not have an absolute right to an evidentiary hearing under section,subdivision h,reasoned that due process interests differ at different stages of dependency proceedings thus,case law holding that a parent has a due process right to confront and adverse witnesses at review hearings during the reunification period does not compel the identical conclusion with respect to hearings,supra,th at.although this general proposition applies to reviews for a child who is placed in a guardianship or who has been freed for adoption,the interests of a child in foster care and those of his or her parent are not commensurate with those cases and merit closer scrutiny.
in dependency proceedings,t he balancing standard considers the private interest that will be affected by the agency action,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest,the interest in informing parents of the basis for and consequences of the action and in enabling them to present their side of the story,and the agency interest in expeditious decisionmaking as affected by the burden caused by an additional procedural requirement.in re james th,accord,david superior court th.
