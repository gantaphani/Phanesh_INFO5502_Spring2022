introduction 
barbara simundza and richard simundza entered into a stipulated marital dissolution judgment under which barbara agreed to accept the sum of from richard monthly pension benefit for years following his retirement.barbara contends the value of the pension benefit has increased since the parties entered into the stipulated judgment in,and thus the pension benefit was only partially divided in the judgment.relying on in re marriage of melton th,d melton,she filed a motion to further divide the pension benefit which she argued constituted a partially omitted asset within the meaning of family code section all further statutory references are to the family code.the trial court denied her motion and she appealed.
we conclude there is no partially omitted asset within the meaning of section because nothing in the stipulated judgment suggested barbara was entitled to anything more than the flat amount.melton,supra,th,d is factually and materially distinguishable from this case.in melton,the stipulated judgment provided the wife would receive,inter alia,of the value of a fixed pension benefit and specified that value equaled a monthly amount of.id.at,d.when the husband began to receive his monthly pension benefit,the value of the benefit was significantly higher than it had been estimated to be at the time the stipulated judgment was entered.id.at,d.the appellate court concluded the amount constituting the difference between the actual benefit value and the lower estimated benefit value had not been divided in the stipulated judgment and thus constituted an omitted asset to be divided by the trial court.id.at,d.here,the parties agreed barbara would receive a flat amount of richard pension benefit.we therefore affirm.
background 
richard and barbara were married in june.they had two children,who are now adults.richard filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage in april.in may,richard filed an interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage to which was attached the parties stipulation resolving various custody,support,community debt,and community property issues,including the division of richard pension benefit the stipulated judgment included the following provision pertaining to the pension.pension plan the court further orders that,upon petitioner retiring from united airlines,petitioner to pay to respondent the sum of per month for a period of twelve years out of his pension plan with united airlines.the interlocutory judgment also stated,jurisdiction is reserved to make such other and further orders as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this judgment.the trial court approved the interlocutory judgment,and a final judgment of dissolution of marriage was entered october.
twenty years later,in april,barbara filed a motion in which she requested that the court divide an asset not divided at the time of our judgment of dissolution of marriage,namely,the community interest in the united air lines retirement plan earned by richard during our marriage.to accomplish that division,i request that a qdro qualified domestic relations order be filed.in support of her motion,barbara filed a declaration stating at the time of the interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage,she could not afford an attorney and wanted to dissolve the marriage on friendly terms richard hired a paralegal to draw up paperwork w ith respect to the pension earned by united air line s united by richard during the marriage,we were informed by the paralegal that the pension was community property richard wrote to his employer and was informed the value of the plan would be around per month when richard retired barbara was awarded each month to be paid by richard for years she could no longer recall why the number of twelve years was used unless that was the number of years richard had worked for united air lines during the marriage b ased on barbara belief that the contents of the judgment represented the division of community property required by law,barbara approved the judgment as to form and content and she did not remember agreeing to take less than barbara and richard thought barbara was entitled to from the pension or anything else.barbara stated the award contained in the stipulated judgment was only part of her interest in the pension benefit and the parties intended to equally divide that community interest.she further stated,t he amount in excess of per month has never been determined or divided.now that richard is eligible to retire,i request that the court award to me my community interest in the retirement plan.
richard opposed barbara motion.he filed a declaration stating the per month was arrived at from the figure that he got from a call to his employer pension clerk in who told him the pension was worth richard and barbara gave that amount to the paralegal richard and barbara thought years would be fair because richard had been building up the pension for years prior to their separation and richard and barbara had give and take on a few things in the settlement.she took the newer better car,a grand piano,most of the furniture and very little child support richard had the kids.
following a hearing,the trial court denied the motion,stating,it obvious that the judgment was entered into by two people who decided to act as their own lawyers which is sort of unfortunate i have a fair reading of this,and paragraph talks about the pension plan,and number talks about the life and retirement insurance policy,and it obvious to me from that that these parties in the limited legalese that they had at their command bargained for a disposition of the pension plan as well as the private retirement insurance policy,and made an agreed judgment.whatever negotiations there were,i was not unaware of the fact that the husband wound up with custody.and as you commented,counsel,there a number of reasons why people get into these plans or into these kinds of judgment negotiations which are necessarily set forth with any specificity in the judgment,and i do really feel compelled to look through years later as to what parties had in mind when they signed off on this judgment.it final,it unappealed,no motion to set it aside or do anything was done in years,and i do think this is an omitted asset at all.and even if i did,i do have the jurisdiction to do anything about it,because it a property division and at this point there no reservation to do anything about anything in here.therefore,i do think that even if i thought that this was an omitted asset,which i find is not,the parties thought about it,knew about it,and bargained for it,and if she took less than what she was entitled to,that part of the bargain,i guess.
barbara appealed.
discussion 
this appeal raises the following single issue did the stipulated judgment fail to resolve any portion of the parties interests in richard pension benefit,resulting in a partially omitted asset to be divided according to section the answer to this question is no.
barbara contends that while the stipulated judgment determined she would be entitled to of richard monthly pension check,it did not divide the remaining value of richard monthly pension check and this remainder constituted an omitted asset.citing melton,supra,th,d,which barbara describes as virtually identical to the facts of this case,she argues the trial court erred by denying her motion under section to divide this partially omitted asset between the parties.
