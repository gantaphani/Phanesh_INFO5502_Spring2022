we granted review in this case,as well as in,cal th,d,wl,and kristine lisa,cal th,d,wl to consider the parental rights and obligations,if any,of a woman with regard to a child born to her partner in a lesbian relationship.
in the present action for child support filed by the el dorado county district attorney,we conclude that a woman who agreed to raise children with her lesbian partner,supported her partner artificial insemination using an anonymous donor,and received the resulting twin children into her home and held them out as her own,is the children parent under the uniform parentage act and has an obligation to support them.
on june,the el dorado county district attorney filed a complaint in superior court to establish that elisa is a parent of twins kaia and ry,who were born to emily and to order elisa to pay child support elisa filed an answer in which she denied being the children parent.
a hearing was held at which elisa testified that she entered into a lesbian relationship with emily in.they began living together six months later.elisa obtained a tattoo that read emily,por vida,which in spanish means emily,for life.they introduced each other to friends as their partner,exchanged rings,opened a joint bank account,and believed they were in a committed relationship.
elisa and emily discussed having children and decided that they both wished to give birth.because elisa earned more than twice as much money as emily,they decided that emily would be the mother and elisa would be the primary breadwinner for the family.at a sperm bank,they chose a donor they both would use so the children would be biological brothers and sisters.
after several unsuccessful attempts,elisa became pregnant in february.emily was present when elisa was inseminated.emily began the insemination process in june of and became pregnant in august.elisa was present when emily was inseminated and,the next day,elisa picked up additional sperm at the sperm bank and again inseminated emily at their home to make sure she got pregnant.they went to each other medical appointments during pregnancy and attended childbirth classes together so that each could act as a coach for the other during birth,including cutting the children umbilical cords.
elisa gave birth to chance in november,and emily gave birth to ry and kaia prematurely in march.ry had medical problems he suffered from down syndrome,and required heart surgery.
they jointly selected the children names,joining their surnames with a hyphen to form the children surname.they each all of the children.elisa claimed all three children as her dependents on her tax returns and obtained a life insurance policy on herself naming emily as the beneficiary so that if anything happened to her,all three children would be cared for.elisa believed the children would be considered both of their children.
elisa parents referred to the twins as their grandchildren,and her sister referred to the twins as part of their family and referred to elisa as the twins mother.elisa treated all of the children as hers and told a prospective employer that she had triplets.elisa and emily identified themselves as of ry at an organization arranging care for his down syndrome.
elisa supported the household financially.emily was not working.emily testified that she would not have become pregnant if elisa had not promised to support her financially,but elisa denied that any financial arrangements were discussed before the birth of the children.elisa later acknowledged in her testimony,however,that emily was going to be an mom for maybe a couple of years and then the kids were going to go into day care and she was going to return to work.
they consulted an attorney regarding adopting each other child,but never did so.nor did they register as domestic partners or execute a written agreement concerning the children.elisa stated she later reconsidered adoption because she had misgivings about emily adopting chance.
elisa and emily separated in november.elisa promised to support emily and the twins as much as i possibly could and initially paid the mortgage payments of approximately per month on the house in which emily and the twins continued to live,as well as other expenses.emily applied for aid.when they sold the house and emily and the twins moved into an apartment in november,elisa paid emily a month.in early,elisa stated she lost her position as a employee and told emily she no longer could support her and the twins.at the time of trial,elisa was earning a year.
the superior court rendered a written decision on july,finding that elisa and emily had rejected the option of using a private sperm donor because t hey wanted the child to be raised exclusively by them as a couple.the court further found that they intended to create a child and acted in all respects as a family,adding that a person who uses reproductive technology is accountable as a de facto legal parent for the support of that child.legal parentage is not determined exclusively by biology.
the court further found that elisa was obligated to support the twins under the doctrine of equitable estoppel,finding emily agreed to have children with respondent,and relied on her promise to raise and support her children.she would not have agreed to impregnation but for this agreement and understanding.the need for the application of this doctrine is underscored by the fact that the decision of respondent to create a family and desert them has caused the remaining family members to seek county assistance.one child that was created has special needs that will require the remaining parent or the county to be financially responsible for those needs.the child was deprived of the right to have a traditional father to take care of the financial needs of this child.respondent chose to step in those shoes and assume the role and responsibility of the other parent.this should be her responsibility and not the responsibility of the taxpayer.elisa was subsequently ordered to pay child support in the amount of per child for a total of per month.
elisa petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate,and the court directed the superior court to vacate its order and dismiss the action,concluding that elisa had no obligation to pay child support because she was not a parent of the twins within the meaning of the uniform parentage act,et.we granted review.
discussion 
we must determine whether the court of appeal erred in ruling that elisa could not be a parent of the twins born to her lesbian partner,and thus had no obligation to support them.this question is governed by the uniform parentage act upa,et the upa defines the p arent and child relationship as the legal relationship existing between a child and the child natural or adoptive parents the term includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.one purpose of the upa was to eliminate distinctions based upon whether a child was born into a marriage,and thus was legitimate,or was born to unmarried parents,and thus was illegitimate.johnson calvert cal th,d.thus,the upa provides that the parentage of a child does not depend upon the marital status of the parents johnson,supra,at,stating the parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent,regardless of the marital status of the parents.
the upa contains separate provisions defining who is a mother and who is a father.section provides that t he parent and child relationship may be established a between a child and the natural mother by proof of her having given birth to the child,or under this part.subdivision b of section states that the parental relationship b etween a child and the natural father may be established under this part.
section provides several circumstances in which a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child,including if he is the husband of the child mother,is not impotent or sterile,and was cohabiting with her if he signs a voluntary declaration of paternity stating he is the biological father of the child,subd.a and if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,subd.d.
although,as noted above,the upa contains separate provisions defining who is a mother and who is a father,it expressly provides that in determining the existence of a mother and child relationship,i nsofar as practicable,the provisions of this part applicable to the father and child relationship apply.
the court of appeal correctly recognized that,under the upa,emily has a parent and child relationship with each of the twins because she gave birth to them,subd.a.thus,the court of appeal concluded,emily is the twins natural mother.relying upon our statement in johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d,that for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother,the court of appeal reasoned that elisa,therefore,could not also be the natural mother of the twins and thus has no legal maternal relationship with the children under the upa.
the attorney general,appearing pursuant to section to represent the public interest in establishing,modifying,and enforcing support obligations,argues that the court of appeal erred,stating johnson comment can not be thoughtlessly interpreted to deprive the child of couples the same opportunity as other children to two parents and to two sources of child support when only two parties are eligible for parentage.as we shall explain,the attorney general is correct that our statement in johnson that a child can have only one natural mother does not mean that both elisa and emily can not be parents of the twins.
the issue before us in johnson was whether a wife whose ovum was fertilized in vitro by her husband sperm and implanted in a surrogate mother was the mother of the child so produced,rather than the surrogate.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.the surrogate claimed that she was the child mother because she had given birth to the child.no provision of the upa expressly addresses the parental rights of a woman who,like the wife in johnson calvert,has not given birth to a child,but has a genetic relationship because she supplied the ovum used to impregnate the birth mother.but,as noted above,the upa does provide that provisions applicable to determining a father and child relationship shall be used to determine a mother and child relationship i nsofar as practicable.former,now.accordingly,we looked to the provisions regarding presumptions of paternity and concluded that genetic consanguinity could be the basis for a finding of maternity just as it is for paternity.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.
we concluded,therefore,that both surrogate who gave birth to the child and the wife who supplied the adduced evidence of a mother and child relationship as contemplated by the act.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.anticipating this result,the american civil liberties union appearing as amicus curiae urged this court to rule that the child,therefore,had two mothers.because it was undisputed that the husband,who had supplied the semen used to impregnate the surrogate,was the child father,this would have left the child with three parents.we declined the invitation,stating even though rising divorce rates have made multiple parent arrangements common in our society,we see no compelling reason to recognize such a situation here.the calverts are the genetic and intending parents of their son and have provided him,by all accounts,with a stable,intact,and nurturing home.to recognize parental rights in a third party with whom the calvert family has had little contact since shortly after the child birth would diminish the wife role as mother.id.at,fn,d.we held instead that for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother id.at,d,and proceeded to conclude that the wife,rather than the surrogate,was the child mother we conclude that although the act recognizes both genetic consanguinity and giving birth as means of establishing a mother and child relationship,when the two means do not coincide in one woman,she who intended to procreate the is,she who intended to bring about the birth of a child that she intended to raise as her the natural mother under california law.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
in johnson,therefore,we addressed the situation in which three people claimed to be the child parents the husband,who undoubtedly was the child father,and two women,who presented conflicting claims to being the child mother.we rejected the suggestion of amicus curiae that both the wife and the surrogate could be the child mother,stating that a child can have only one mother,but what we considered and rejected in johnson was the argument that a child could have three parents a father and two mothers we did not address the question presented in this case of whether a child could have two parents,both of whom are women the court of appeal in the present case erred,therefore,in concluding that our statement in johnson that a child can have only one mother under california law resolved the issue presented in this case.language used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.citation.ginns savage cal d,fn.
we perceive no reason why both parents of a child can not be women.that result now is possible under the current version of the domestic partnership statutes,which took effect this year.et two women who have chosen to share one another lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring and have a common residence can file with the secretary of state a declaration of domestic partnership.section,subdivision d provides,in pertinent part the rights and obligations of registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of spouses.
prior to the effective date of the current domestic partnership statutes,we recognized in an adoption case that a child can have two parents,both of whom are women.in sharon superior court,supra,cal th,d,we upheld a second parent adoption in which the mother of a child that had been conceived by means of artificial insemination consented to adoption of the child by the mother lesbian partner.if both parents of an adopted child can be women,we see no reason why the twins in the present case can not have two parents,both of whom are women.
having determined that our decision in johnson does not preclude a child from having two parents both of whom are women and that no reason appears that a child two parents can not both be women,we proceed to examine the upa to determine whether elisa is a parent to the twins in addition to emily.as noted above,section provides that provisions applicable to determining a father and child relationship shall be used to determine a mother and child relationship insofar as practicable.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d,in re marriage of buzzanca th,d the declaration in section that a husband who consents to artificial insemination is treated in law as the father of the child applies equally to the wife if a surrogate,rather than the wife,is artificially inseminated,making both the wife and the husband the parents of the child so produced.
subdivision d of section states that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.the court of appeal in in re karen th,d,held that subdivision d of section should apply equally to women.this conclusion was echoed by the court in in re salvador th,d,which stated though most of the decisional law has focused on the definition of the presumed father,the legal principles concerning the presumed father apply equally to a woman seeking presumed mother status.citation.
applying section,subdivision d,we must determine whether elisa received the twins into her home and openly held them out as her natural children.there is no doubt that elisa satisfied the first part of this test it is undisputed that elisa received the twins into her home.our inquiry focuses,therefore,on whether she openly held out the twins as her natural children.
the circumstance that elisa has no genetic connection to the twins does not necessarily mean that she did not hold out the twins as her natural children under section.we held in in re nicholas cal th,d,that the presumption under section,subdivision d,that a man who receives a child into his home and openly holds the child out as his natural child is not necessarily rebutted when he admits he is not the child biological father.
the presumed father in nicholas,thomas,met the child mother,kimberly,when she was pregnant with nicholas.nevertheless,thomas was named as the child father on his birth certificate and provided a home for the child and his mother for several years.thomas did not marry kimberly.when nicholas was removed by the court from kimberly care,thomas sought custody as the child presumed father,although he admitted he was not nicholas biological father.
we held in nicholas that thomas was presumed to be nicholas father despite his admission that he was not nicholas biological father.the court of appeal had reached the opposite conclusion,observing that the legislature has used the term natural to mean biological and concluding that the presumption under section,subdivision d is rebutted under section,subdivision a by clear and convincing evidence that the man is not the child natural,biological father.in re nicholas,supra,cal th,d.we noted,however,that the upa does not state that the presumption under section,subdivision d,is rebutted by evidence that the presumed father is not the child biological father,but rather that it may be rebutted in an appropriate action by such evidence.in re nicholas,supra,at,d.we held that nicholas was not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption because no one had raised a conflicting claim to being the child father.applying the presumption,therefore,would produce the harsh result of leaving the child fatherless.id.at,d.we quoted language from the court of appeal opinion in steven matthew th,d,recognizing that a man who has lived with a child,treating it as his son or daughter,has developed a relationship with the child that should not be lightly dissolved this social relationship is much more important,to the child at least,than a biological relationship of actual paternity in re nicholas,supra,cal th at,d,in re jesusa cal th,d,the statute did not contemplate a reflexive rule that biological paternity would rebut the section presumption in all cases,without concern for whether rebuttal was appropriate in the particular circumstances.
the court of appeal in in re karen,supra,th,d,applied the principles discussed in nicholas regarding presumed fathers and concluded that a woman with no biological connection to a child could be a presumed mother under section,subdivision d.karen petitioned for an order determining the existence of a mother and child relationship between her and leticia,who had raised her from birth.leticia admitted she was not karen biological mother,explaining that karen birth mother had tried unsuccessfully to abort her pregnancy and then agreed to give the child to leticia.the birth mother falsely told the hospital staff that her name was leticia so that leticia name would appear on the child birth certificate.the birth mother gave karen to leticia promptly after the child was born.the juvenile court denied karen petition,ruling that leticia could not be karen mother because she had not given birth to her and they had no genetic relationship.the court of appeal reversed,determining that leticia was the child presumed mother under section because she had taken karen into her home and raised her as her child.in re karen,supra,th at,d.the court remanded the matter to the juvenile court to apply the rule in nicholas to determine whether this was an appropriate action in which to find the presumption that leticia was karen mother was rebutted by the fact that she had not given birth to her.ibid.
similarly,the court of appeal in in re salvador,supra,th,d,held that a woman who had raised her half brother as her son could be the child presumed mother under section,subdivision d.in that case,the child mother died when he was three years old and he was raised by his half sister,who had a daughter of her own and later gave birth again.the child believed that his half sister was his mother and that her offspring were his siblings.his half sister revealed her true relation to the child in official matters,such as school registration,but maintained that to the rest of the world the child is my son.in re salvador,supra,at,d.the court of appeal applied section,subdivision d,stating the paternity presumptions are driven,not by biological paternity,but by the state interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family.citation.in re salvador,supra,at,d.the court concluded that the half sister had openly held out the child as her own,despite admitting to various officials that she was the child half sister,noting that the most compelling evidence that she held out the child as her own was that the child believed appellant was his mother which supported the conclusion that she held the child out to the community as her son.id.at,d.having concluded that she was the child presumed mother under section,subdivision d,the court concluded that this was clearly not an appropriate case to find the presumption was rebutted by the fact that she was not the child birth mother,because there was no competing maternal interest and to sever this deeply rooted bond would contravene the state interest in maintaining the family relationship.in re salvador,supra,at,d.
we conclude that the present case,like nicholas and salvador,is not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption of presumed parenthood with proof that elisa is not the twins biological parent.this is generally a matter within the discretion of the superior court in re jesusa,supra,cal th,d,but we need not remand the matter to permit the superior court to exercise its discretion because it would be an abuse of discretion to conclude that the presumption may be rebutted in the present case.it is undisputed that elisa actively consented to,and participated in,the artificial insemination of her partner with the understanding that the resulting child or children would be raised by emily and her as coparents,and they did act as coparents for a substantial period of time.elisa received the twins into her home and held them out to the world as her natural children.she gave the twins and the child to whom she had given birth the same surname,which was formed by joining her surname to her partner.the twins were half siblings to the child to whom elisa had given birth.she all three children,claimed all three children as her dependents on her tax returns,and told a prospective employer that she had triplets.even at the hearing before the superior court,elisa candidly testified that she considered herself to be the twins mother.
declaring that elisa can not be the twins parent and,thus,has no obligation to support them because she is not biologically related to them would produce a result similar to the situation we sought to avoid in nicholas of leaving the child fatherless.the twins in the present case have no father because they were conceived by means of artificial insemination using an anonymous semen donor.rebutting the presumption that elisa is the twin parent would leave them with only one parent and would deprive them of the support of their second parent.because emily is financially unable to support the twins,the financial burden of supporting the twins would be borne by the county,rather than elisa.
in establishing a system for a voluntary declaration of paternity in section,the legislature declared there is a compelling state interest in establishing paternity for all children.establishing paternity is the first step toward a child support award,which,in turn,provides children with equal rights and access to benefits,including,but not limited to,social security,health insurance,survivors benefits,military benefits,and inheritance rights 
by recognizing the value of determining paternity,the legislature implicitly recognized the value of having two parents,rather than one,as a source of both emotional and financial support,especially when the obligation to support the child would otherwise fall to the public.see librers black th,d whenever possible,a child should have the benefit of two parents to support and nurture him or her in re marriage of pedregon th,d recognizing the importance to a child of having the support of two parents clevenger clevenger d.
we observed in dicta in nicholas that it would be appropriate to rebut the section presumption of parentage if a court decides that the legal rights and obligations of parenthood should devolve upon an unwilling candidate.in re nicholas,supra,cal th,d.but we decline to apply our dicta in nicholas here,because we did not consider in nicholas a situation like that in the present case.
although elisa presently is unwilling to accept the obligations of parenthood,this was not always so.she actively assisted emily in becoming pregnant with the expressed intention of enjoying the rights and accepting the responsibilities of parenting the resulting children.she accepted those obligations and enjoyed those rights for years.elisa present unwillingness to accept her parental obligations does not affect her status as the children mother based upon her conduct during the first years of their lives.
further,our observation in nicholas that the obligations of parenthood should not be forced upon an unwilling candidate who is not biologically related to the child must be understood in light of the circumstances before us in nicholas h.in that case,as noted above,the presumed father met the child mother when she was pregnant and voluntarily accepted the unborn child as his own.when the child later was removed from the mother custody,the presumed father was denied custody of the child because he was not the child biological father.
in the present case,elisa did not meet emily after she was pregnant,but rather was in a committed relationship with her when they decided to have children together.elisa actively assisted emily in becoming pregnant,with the understanding that they would raise the resulting children together.having helped cause the children to be born,and having raised them as her own,emily should not be permitted to later abandon the twins simply because her relationship with emily dissolved.
as we noted in the context of a husband who consented to the artificial insemination of his wife using an anonymous sperm donor,but later denied responsibility for the resulting child one who consents to the production of a child can not create a temporary relation to be assumed and disclaimed at will,but the arrangement must be of such character as to impose an obligation of supporting those for whose existence he is directly responsible.people sorensen cal d,dunkin boskey th,d.we observed that the intent of the legislature obviously was to include every child,legitimate or illegitimate,born or unborn,and enforce the obligation of support against the person who could be determined to be the lawful parent.people sorensen,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.further a reasonable man who,because of his inability to procreate,actively participates and consents to his wife artificial insemination in the hope that a child will be produced whom they will treat as their own,knows that such behavior carries with it the legal responsibilities of fatherhood and criminal responsibility for nonsupport i t is safe to assume that without defendant active participation and consent the child would not have been procreated.id.at,see dunkin boskey,supra,th at,d.
we were careful in nicholas,therefore,not to suggest that every man who begins living with a woman when she is pregnant and continues to do so after the child is born necessarily becomes a presumed father of the child,even against his wishes.the legislature surely did not intend to punish a man like the one in nicholas who voluntarily provides support for a child who was conceived before he met the mother,by transforming that act of kindness into a legal obligation.
but our observation in nicholas loses its force in a case like the one at bar in which the presumed mother under section,subdivision d,acted together with the birth mother to cause the child to be conceived.in such circumstances,unlike the situation before us in nicholas,we believe the legislature would have intended to impose upon the presumed father or mother the legal obligation to support the child whom she caused to be born.as stated by amicus curiae the california state association of counties,representing all counties in california a person who actively participates in bringing children into the world,takes the children into her home and holds them out as her own,and receives and enjoys the benefits of parenthood,should be responsible for the support of those of her gender or sexual orientation.
we conclude,therefore,that elisa is a presumed mother of the twins under section,subdivision d,because she received the children into her home and openly held them out as her natural children,and that this is not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption that elisa is the twins parent with proof that she is not the children biological mother because she actively participated in causing the children to be conceived with the understanding that she would raise the children as her own together with the birth mother,she voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood after the children were born,and there are no competing claims to her being the children second parent.
elisa relies upon the court of appeal decisions in curiale reagan d,nancy michele d,and west superior court th,d,for the proposition that partners from a relationship,who have not adopted their partners children,are deemed nonparents for purposes of custody or visitation and thus must also be deemed nonparents for purposes of establishing child support orders for those same children.as we explain below,these decisions predated our recognition in nicholas and jesusa that a person with no biological relationship could be a presumed parent under section,subdivision d.accordingly,we do not find these cases persuasive.
curiale involved a situation similar to that in the present case in which two women in a lesbian relationship agreed that one of them would conceive a child through artificial insemination and that the child would be raised by both of them.curiale reagan,supra,d.the couple relationship dissolved when the child was two years old,and the plaintiff filed a complaint to establish de facto parent and for custody and visitation.ibid.the court of appeal summarily dismissed the plaintiff reliance upon the upa,stating it has no application where,as here,it is undisputed defendant is the natural mother of the child.citation.curiale reagan,supra,at.the decision,therefore,did not consider the applicability of the predecessor to section,subdivision d,which was former civil code section stats,ch.the court concluded,without discussion or explanation the legislature has not conferred upon one in plaintiff position,a nonparent in a bilateral relationship,any right of custody or visitation upon the termination of the relationship.curiale reagan,supra,d at.but the court reasoning was circular,because it began its analysis by assuming the plaintiff was a nonparent even though the issue to be decided was whether the plaintiff was a parent under the upa.
nancy involved two women in a lesbian relationship who had two children by artificially inseminating nancy on two occasions.nancy michele,supra,d.michele was listed on the birth certificates as the father,and the children were given michele family surname.the children referred to both nancy and michele as mom.after the couple relationship dissolved,nancy filed an action under the upa to obtain a declaration that she was the sole parent of the children.the court of appeal determined that michele was not a parent under the upa based in part on the circumstance that i t is undisputed that michele is not the natural mother of the children.nancy,supra,at.nancy was decided before we recognized in in re nicholas,supra,cal th,d,that natural as used in the upa does not always mean biological.
