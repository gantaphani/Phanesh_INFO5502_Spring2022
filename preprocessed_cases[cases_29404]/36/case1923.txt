we have for review the decision in acker acker,so d dca,which certified conflict with the decisions in rogers rogers,so d dca paris paris,so d dca ellis ellis,so d dca bain bain,so d dca and gentile gentile,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the following reasons,we approve the decision of the third district court of appeal in the instant case and disapprove the decisions of the other district courts.
petitioner charles acker acker and respondent barbara acker acker were divorced after years of marriage.acker was years old at the time of dissolution and a pilot for delta airlines,earning approximately per year.acker earned approximately per year from employment.
at the time of dissolution in,the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which the parties substantial assets were distributed between them.as part of his equitable distribution,acker received his pension benefits from delta airlines.acker received,among other things,the marital residence,acker k plan,and other ira accounts and stock plans.acker was also awarded permanent alimony in the amount of per month.the settlement agreement provided that the alimony awarded to acker was not modifiable for any reason for the first three years but could be modified at the end of those three years.the parties also agreed to revisit the alimony award in,when acker reached delta mandatory retirement age of sixty.
in,delta offered an early retirement option,which acker accepted.under this retirement option,acker pension benefits were substantially larger than the value of the pension at the time of dissolution.at the time of dissolution,acker pension was valued at approximately.at the time of retirement,acker received a payment of,plus per month.
acker turned sixty on march,at which time he ceased paying alimony to acker and moved for termination of his alimony obligation,arguing that because his monthly income had decreased from approximately to approximately,he no longer had the ability to pay alimony.
the trial court denied acker motion to terminate alimony,finding that the provision of the parties settlement agreement which stated that the issue of alimony would be revisited when acker retired did not mean that alimony payments would automatically be terminated.the trial court further rejected acker argument that he took a risk by giving his wife his savings plans and keeping only his pension because the monthly value of his pension benefits could have decreased.the trial court reasoned that acker monthly benefits did not decrease but,rather,generated a cash payoff,which had increased by.the court therefore concluded that,taking into consideration the benefits received from acker pension,acker continues to have the ability to pay acker per month in permanent alimony,and acker continues to have the need for such payments.acker acker,cir.order filed.
acker appealed the trial court order to the third district court of appeal,arguing that the trial court erred as a matter of law in considering his pension benefits as a source of funds with which to pay alimony because his pension had been treated as property and awarded to him in equitable distribution.he argued that to now consider the pension benefits in a determination of alimony would violate this court decision in diffenderfer diffenderfer,so d.after a panel of the district court heard oral argument on this issue,the case was referred to the district court for en banc review.the parties were thereafter directed to address whether the court should recede from two of its prior decisions that interpreted diffenderfer.
the third district divided its opinion into two sections,the first discussing this court decision in diffenderfer.the third district noted that some of the difficulty in analyzing this issue resulted from a typographical error contained in the westlaw and versions of the diffenderfer decision.the pertinent portions of the correct diffenderfer opinion in the words of the third district are as follows 
in diffenderfer,the florida supreme court held that a spouse entitlement to pension or retirement benefits must be considered a marital asset for purposes of equitably distributing marital property.so d at.the court also said that such benefits may be considered as a source of payment of permanent periodic alimony.id.at.the court then said 
obviously,however,injustice would result if the trial court were to consider the same asset in calculating both property distribution and support obligations.if the wife,for example,has received through equitable distribution or lump sum alimony of the husband retirement pension,her interest in his pension should not be considered as an asset reflecting his ability to pay.
id.emphasis added.
acker acker,so d,dca.thus,if of the husband pension is given to the wife,that half is no longer available to the husband in calculating the husband ability to pay alimony.the half which has been transferred to the wife,however,would reduce the wife need for alimony at such time as the parties were able to draw on the pension benefits.id.
at the time diffenderfer was released,the westlaw and versions erroneously substituted the word his for her in the phrase.the incorrect decision therefore provided if the wife,for example,has received through equitable distribution or lump sum alimony of the husband retirement pension,his interest in his pension should not be considered as an asset reflecting his ability to pay.id.the third district concluded that the incorrect version of diffenderfer entirely changed the meaning of the opinion,causing all five district courts to erroneously conclude that a pension could be treated as an asset for equitable distribution or as income available to determine a spouse ability to pay alimony,but not both.id.at quoting rogers rogers,so d,dca.the court reasoned that under the plain language of the correct version of diffenderfer,a court is in fact permitted to consider a pension which has been equitably distributed to the payor in determining the payor ability to pay alimony.in so holding,the court receded from its prior decisions in hollinger baur,so d dca,and waldman waldman,so d dca.
the second portion of the third district opinion went on to note,however,that the foregoing discussion of diffenderfer is rendered academic because the legislature subsequently enacted statutes which are now controlling on this issue.in,the legislature created the equitable distribution statute and amended the alimony statute the court concluded that the plain language of these statutes requires the court to consider the assets and liabilities that have been distributed to each party,which means that an equitably distributed pension is an asset to be considered on the issue of alimony.acker,so d at.thus,the district court held that acker pension was properly considered by the trial court in the instant case and certified conflict with rogers rogers,so d dca paris paris,so d dca ellis ellis,so d dca bain bain,so d dca and gentile gentile,so d dca.
the issue presently before this court is whether pension benefits equitably distributed to a party may be considered in determining the proper amount of alimony.we agree with the third district that pension benefits can be so considered.
in this case,the parties appear to have contemplated that at the time of acker retirement,the issue of the alimony paid to acker would be reexamined.the settlement agreement specifically provided that at the end of approximately six years,when the husband retires,no longer flies for delta and is living off his pension,the parties agree to revisit the matter of the amount of alimony that he pays,thereafter.acker acker,agreement at cir.agreement filed.based upon the specific provision of the parties settlement agreement,we find no error in the trial court considering the income received from acker pension in denying acker petition to terminate his alimony payments.by the agreement,the trial judge could have reduced the alimony payment if the evidence indicated that such reduction was then equitable.but the trial judge did not make that decision,and the decision made by the trial judge was within the trial judge proper discretion based upon the evidence.
we reject acker argument that the trial court decision is in conflict with a correct application of this court decision in diffenderfer.rather,we approve the third district court of appeal opinion in respect to diffenderfer and the court application of sections and,florida statutes.
in dissolution cases,the trial judge possesses the broad,discretionary authority to do equity between the parties.canakaris canakaris,so d.this discretionary authority is guided by the specific considerations provided by the legislature.we agree with the third district that in sections and,florida statutes,the legislature provided the guidelines that courts are to follow in determining an equitable distribution of marital property and in determining whether to require a reasonable amount of alimony.these statutory provisions expressly authorize the trial court to include an equitably distributed pension in a determination of alimony.
we further agree with the fourth district court of appeal reading of diffenderfer in lauro lauro,so d,dca.in lauro,the district court interpreted this court statement in diffenderfer with respect to pension plans that an injustice would result if the trial court were to consider the same asset in calculating both property distribution and support obligations,so d at,as follows 
what the supreme court meant,however,is explained by the next sentence,which is that the of the husband pension distributed to the wife could not be considered as an asset reflecting his ability to pay.in other words,the ability of the husband in diffenderfer to pay alimony should be based on his financial situation after equitable distribution,not before.similarly,the needs of the wife in this case should be based on her financial situation after equitable distribution,not before.that would include her income from the pension.
section d,florida statutes,requires trial courts to consider,when fashioning awards of alimony,all relevant economic factors,including but not limited to the financial resources of each party,the and the marital assets and liabilities distributed to each.section g requires the court to consider all sources of income available to either party.
lauro,so d at.
accordingly,the portion of a pension which has been equitably distributed to a spouse can not be considered in determining the other spouse ability to pay alimony because the other spouse obviously no longer has that portion of the marital asset.similarly,the needs of a spouse should be based on that spouse financial situation after,not before,equitable distribution.we therefore approve the decision of the third district court of appeal in this case and disapprove rogers,paris,ellis,bain,and gentile to the extent they conflict with this decision.
we find that acker argument that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to acker is not preserved for review.
it is so ordered.
the ackers marital assets were equitably distributed when their marriage was dissolved.acker received his pension,and acker received the remainder of the marital assets.acker also was awarded permanent,periodic alimony.acker has since retired,and,because he no longer draws a salary,he seeks to terminate his obligation to make alimony payments to acker.he argues that he no longer has the ability to make such payments.
the issue in this case is whether the income acker receives from his pension,which was awarded to him in the equitable distribution,may be considered by the court when determining acker ability to pay alimony.i agree with the majority that this income should be considered in determining acker continued ability to pay alimony.i recognize the concerns raised by the dissent,but i conclude that the majority holding is dictated by the statutes governing equitable distribution and alimony.
pensions equitable distribution,alimony,and the statutory scheme 
the issue in this case is whether the income acker receives from his pension,which was equitably distributed to him,may be considered by the court when determining acker continued ability to pay alimony.the resolution of this issue is controlled by florida and alimony statutes.see.stat.equitable distribution.stat.alimony.the first thing these statutes make clear is that acker pension was a marital asset subject to equitable distribution upon dissolution of marriage.see a.stat.defining marital assets to include a ll vested and nonvested benefits,rights,and funds accrued during the marriage in retirement,pension,annuity,deferred compensation,and insurance plans and programs.stat.all vested and nonvested benefits,rights,and funds accrued during the marriage in retirement,pension,annuity,deferred compensation,and insurance plans and programs are marital assets subject to equitable distribution.
it is simply not the case that acker pension could either have been considered as a marital asset subject to equitable distribution or as a source of funds that would enable acker to make alimony payments to acker.to treat the portion of acker pension that accrued during the marriage simply as a source of funds from which acker would be able to draw to make alimony payments to acker would treat the pension as the nonmarital or separate property of acker.the contrary conclusion,embraced by the dissent and adopted nearly uniformly by the case law,relies on a mistaken reading of our decision in diffenderfer diffenderfer,so d and a failure to of what we might have held in subsequently enacted statutes discussed above.
in fact,the precise holding in diffenderfer was that a spouse entitlement to pension or retirement benefits must be considered a marital asset for purposes of equitably distributing marital property.so d at emphasis added.we rejected the first district decision,which held that the husband entitlement to retirement benefits could not properly be considered marital property subject to equitable distribution,and limited consideration of the benefits to a source of maintenance and support obligations.id.at see also id.at we join the vast majority of jurisdictions which have found it necessary to consider entitlement to retirement benefits in order to achieve an equitable distribution.id.at to the extent that a pension right result s from employment time during the marriage,it is a contract right of value,received in lieu of higher compensation which would otherwise have enhanced either marital assets or the marital standard of living and,therefore,is marital property.quoting majauskas majauskas.
the widespread misreading of diffenderfer is the result of the seemingly contradictory language we used in the decision.for instance,in addition to our holding that a spouse entitlement to pension or retirement benefits must be considered a marital asset for purposes of equitably distributing marital property,so d at emphasis added,we also said that such benefits may be considered as a source of payment of permanent periodic alimony.the potential income may certainly bear on the employee spouse ability to pay id.at emphasis added.if we had stopped there it would have been clear that after the court distributed the pension plan as it must in light of its status as marital property to one party or the other,or a portion to one party and a portion to the other,it could then,in determining whether an award of alimony was appropriate,consider the pension benefits as a source of funds from which the party ability to make alimony payments could be determined.we went on to note,however,that it would be unjust to consider the same asset in calculating both property distribution and support obligations.id.at.this is the statement that has caused courts to conclude that a pension may be considered marital property for the purpose of equalizing and distributing assets for equitable distribution purposes or as an asset source for payment for alimony,but not both.dissenting op.at.but,as the majority and the district court explain,our injustice statement must be read in light of the sentence which followed it.
after stating that it would be unjust to consider the same asset in calculating both property distribution and support obligations,we explained that i f the wife,for example,has received through equitable distribution or lump sum alimony of the husband retirement pension,her interest in his pension should not be considered as an asset reflecting his ability to pay.diffenderfer,so d at.in this light,it is clear that our warning simply reflected the logical conclusion that once the pension or a portion thereof was distributed to one party,the pension or that portion should no longer be considered as an as asset reflecting the other party ability to pay alimony.were our warning about injustice to be read any other way,it would make the diffenderfer decision internally contradictory.it makes no sense to hold,on one hand,that pension benefits must be treated as marital property and equitably distributed as such,but,on the other hand,that such benefits may be treated either as marital property to be equitably distributed or as a source of funds from which the pensioner can make alimony payments.
in any event,the majority and the district court correctly note that diffenderfer holding on this point is immaterial in light of the subsequently enacted and alimony statutes.section clearly provides that a ll vested and nonvested benefits,rights,and funds accrued during the marriage in retirement,pension,annuity,deferred compensation,and insurance plans and programs are marital assets subject to equitable distribution.stat.there is no question then that the reading of diffenderfer that would hold that pension benefits may be treated either as marital property subject to equitable distribution or as a source of funds for the payment of alimony,if indeed that was what diffenderfer held,has clearly been legislatively altered pension benefits accrued during the marriage must be treated as marital property subject to equitable distribution.
the question then becomes whether such benefits,after they are distributed and once they begin to produce a stream of income,can be considered as a source of funds reflecting the party ability to pay alimony.this question is answered by section,which provides that i n determining a proper award of alimony or maintenance,the court shall consider all relevant economic factors,including but not limited to t he financial resources of each party,including the marital assets distributed to each,and a ll sources of income available to either party.d,g.stat.because these statutes are clear,i agree with the majority that the income acker is now receiving from his pension,the rights to which were equitably distributed to him,should be considered along with all other relevant factors by the court when determining acker ability to pay alimony.
ii.the argument 
i recognize the concerns raised by the dissent,but i believe such concerns are more appropriately addressed to the legislature.the new jersey legislature,for example,amended its alimony statute to provide explicitly that w hen a share of a retirement benefit is treated as an asset for purposes of equitable distribution,the court shall not consider income generated thereafter by that share for purposes of determining alimony.stat.ann.b west see also innes innes,the plain language of the pertinent amendment provides that income from pension benefits that have been treated as an asset for equitable distribution purposes is not to be considered in determining alimony.florida statutory scheme,however,contains no such provision.contrary to new jersey,florida statutory scheme expressly provides that among the relevant economic factors to be considered in fashioning an appropriate amount of alimony are t he financial resources of each party,including the marital assets distributed to each,d.stat.emphasis added,and a ll sources of income available to either party.g.stat.
the statutory scheme adopted by the florida legislature and this court decision today applying that scheme are not the result of faulty reasoning and superficial logic,dissenting op.at,nor has either accomplish ed the total destruction of the foundation of the principles upon which the concept of equitable distribution of property has been based with regard to pension assets.dissenting op.at.whether the benefits received from an equitably distributed pension should be considered in determining the party ability to pay alimony is a controversial issue on which there are varying perspectives but there is certainly logical support for the position adopted by the florida legislature,and that position will not spell the total destruction of the concept of equitable distribution.
part of the dissent concerns,i think,are based on a misconception of just what today decision and the legislative scheme mandating it will actually do.the dissent repeatedly refers to the court decision as effecting a redistribution of the pension asset or a modification of the original property settlement.see,dissenting op.at former marital assets equitably distributed as property are not subject to redistribution a second time due to later values attributed to the asset used to equitably distribute property s pouses should not be entitled to a modification following the finalized equitable distribution as a result of the increase or decrease in value of an asset equitably distributed as property to the other former spouse here,the majority essentially authorizes a second redistribution of the former husband pension distributed to him as property in the initial dissolution action with an equal value of assets distributed as property to the wife and subtracted from other marital the pension plan increased in value following the final dissolution.allowing a court to look to acker pension benefits when determining his ability to pay alimony will in no way redistribute the rights to the pension plan.consider,for instance,if acker also had a pension plan that had accrued entirely in the years after the parties marriage was dissolved.would allowing a court to look to the benefits received from that pension,in determining acker ability to pay alimony,somehow transfer the rights to that pension to acker 
the dissent asserts that acker has no alimony entitlement to the assets previously equitably distributed to acker.dissenting op.at.respectfully,the issue here is not whether one party has an entitlement to the other party assets those claims were resolved in the equitable distribution.the issue now,quite separately,is whether one party has a need for alimony and whether the other party has the ability to pay alimony.see moreno moreno,s pousal support and equitable distribution of property are two distinct concepts.the nonpensioned spouse is not claiming rights as a in the distributed property,but is instead simply asserting that the pension should not be ignored when gauging the financial position of the two parties for purposes of awarding alimony.quoting double dipping,equitable distribution.as one commentator has noted 
the receipt of pension benefits is always an important factor in determining whether alimony should be paid and how much either spouse should receive.any source of income is material to such a determination.this is true whether the jurisdiction treats pensions as marital property and,indeed,was equally true in the now defunct system that did not provide any marital property distribution at divorce.
grace ganz blumberg,marital property treatment of pensions,disability pay,workers compensation,and other wage substitutes an insurance,or replacement,analysis,ucla,see also homer clark,the law of domestic relations in the united states,at ed.the first step in reaching a judgment about a party ability to pay alimony is a determination of how much property and income he possesses.if there has been a division of property in the divorce,the share of property awarded to him is of course to be considered.
the american law institute principles of the law of family dissolution takes the position that s pousal income from marital property allocated at dissolution between the spouses should not be considered.to consider it invites double counting that will yield anomalous distinctions between equivalent cases.american law institute,principles of the law of family dissolution analysis and recommendations,cmt.f.the principles,however,adopt a,rather than a,approach to alimony.see cmt.a.this is an important distinction because,as the reporter notes recognize,the concern is unfounded in a alimony scheme 
under existing law,cases divide on the question of whether income from marital property should be considered available for alimony claims.the issue typically arises when the court has divided a pension earned by spouse a,and is then later asked to include spouse a share of the pension income in deciding whether a should make alimony payments to spouse b 
under prevailing law in which alimony is largely,the concern is unfounded.the potential obligor income from allocated marital property is appropriately considered because the potential obligee income from that property is considered as well.typically,this is implicit all the resources of both of them are taken into account in evaluating the obligee needs and the obligor capacity to respond to those needs.
american law institute,principles of the law of family dissolution analysis and recommendations,reporter notes,cmt.
in a alimony scheme,such as florida,the problem,properly understood,arises in only very limited circumstances.as professor blumberg has noted,
e rroneous only occurs where the actual division of the pension,or other marital asset,is postponed and will be made only if and when benefits are paid out.then each spouse is,properly speaking,an owner of a portion of those benefits and it would be incorrect to attribute the whole to either spouse for alimony determination purposes.when,however,all marital property division is effected at divorce and one spouse is awarded the entire pension,it is not in any way improper to consider the pension benefits as entirely his income for purposes of alimony determination.
grace ganz blumberg,intangible assets recognition and valuation,in valuation and distribution of marital property,c,at.
a number of courts in other jurisdictions have recognized the logic of professor blumberg position and similarly have rejected arguments.see in re marriage of white,d,krafick krafick,we reject the defendant contention that to consider vested benefits for purposes of equitable distribution and also,as allocated,as a source of alimony constitutes impermissible double dipping.relying on the pension benefits allocated to the employee spouse under the equitable distribution statute as a source of alimony would be improper only to the extent that any portion of the pension assigned to the nonemployee spouse was counted in determining the employee spouse resources for purposes of alimony.riley riley.it is true,of course,that,in awarding and setting the terms of alimony,the court can not properly consider as a resource of the payor spouse property or income that the spouse does not have.thus,if the court removes an asset or source of income from the payor spouse through a monetary award or otherwise,it can not premise an alimony award on the assumption that that asset or source of income is still available to the payor.but we see no reason why it can not base such an award on assets or sources of income that have not been taken from the payor and that do remain available.that does not constitute double dipping moreno,at w e hold that the income received by the husband from his share of the distribution of his pension is a fungible asset that may be considered as a resource when determining the amount of his spousal support obligation.
simply stated,despite the dissent criticism of,the cases and commentary discussed above make clear that florida statutory scheme is not based on faulty reasoning and superficial logic,nor has it total ly destr oyed the concept of equitable distribution.whether or not the policy is wise is a question left to the legislature.the majority has properly applied the statutory scheme,and i fully concur in its opinion.
the majority opinion,the specially concurring opinion,and that of the third district below present a myopic view of the fundamental principles and issue addressed and resolved in diffenderfer diffenderfer,so d,almost two decades ago,and the principles which have naturally and correctly developed over that span of time.today,this court with faulty reasoning and superficial logic,substantially and erroneously impacts and very seriously alters the stability of a multitude of contractual marital agreements and marital judgments entered in good faith based upon the uniformly recognized principles established in diffenderfer and applied in its progeny over the past twenty years here and in the district courts of appeal.
the fundamental issue is not simply the superficial and ever present issue of need or ability to pay.the misstatement of the fundamental issue in dispute produces the incorrect result and a failure to understand or address that upon and after distribution,if the property initially distributed as and in the form of equitable distribution property is later taken back and given to the other party there has been no equitable distribution of assets at all.
after today,no asset or property distribution is final because the property or asset distribution can be altered upon a theory of need and ability to pay.the law as stated in diffenderfer and as interpreted by all florida appellate decisions during the last two decades is contrary to the majority and concurring opinions and compels a contrary result.it is most interesting that a subsequent decision of this court following diffenderfer and two decades of leading appellate decisions are now relegated to a category and conclusion that all appellate judges in florida have simply repeatedly and uniformly engaged in a mistaken reading of the law.
the decision today fails to accommodate those marital agreements entered into in good faith during the last twenty years based upon the law as stated by all florida courts which are now merely labeled a mistaken reading,and the final judgments predicated upon this mistaken reading of the law.if this court is determined to reject and reverse twenty years of florida jurisprudence it certainly may do so,but it should do so prospectively and not use the guise of mistaken reading or interpretation to so drastically impact twenty years of existing agreements and judgments and thereby generate a basis for an unknown number of modifications.to change the law is one thing,but to do so under a protective cloak of correcting two decades of mistaken reading is far different.
initially,the third district fell victim to incorrectly elevating an apparent single typographical error in one sentence into a total transformation of an entire fundamental body of law upon which material economic decisions in marital disputes have been predicated for years.the lower court next improperly blended its fundamental error with inapplicable statutory provisions to justify an erroneous result which further misdirected florida law in a very substantial manner.this court falls victim to and even magnifies the same errors by not only adopting the incorrect decision below,but also proceeding to interpret a marital agreement entered into under the then existing law as though diffenderfer and its progeny never existed at the time the parties entered into the contract in.this court applies this new,different,and previously nonexistent erroneous interpretation of diffenderfer to negate the marital agreement which was clearly drafted based on the principles discussed in diffenderfer.the court today accomplishes the total destruction of the foundation of the principles upon which the concept of equitable distribution of property has been based with regard to the type of asset which generates the disputed issue here.
in my view,the issue before the court,namely whether a party remaining asset which has been previously specifically valued and utilized as a property asset for the purpose of shifting and the equalization of property by equitable distribution may again be utilized as a fund to be taken as alimony,in a later proceeding,is controlled by this court almost old precedent of diffenderfer diffenderfer,so d,and our subsequent decision in pastore pastore,so d.in diffenderfer,this court clearly held that an asset which has been valued to include the value of future distributions for property distribution,such as a pension plan,may be considered marital property for the purpose of equalizing and distributing assets for equitable distribution of property purposes or as an asset source for payment for alimony,but not both.see diffenderfer,so d at.diffenderfer has remained the controlling law on this question for almost twenty years,has been consistently applied correctly by this court and all district courts of appeal that have ever considered the issue until now,and,in my view,has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.the majority has simply elected to ignore this body of law,the equitable foundation of equitable distribution of property and instead mandated an inequitable and unconscionable result.therefore,i must dissent.
acker,the former husband,properly argues that the trial court decision to consider the income he receives from his pension in determining his alimony payments conflicts with this court holding in diffenderfer.the majority rejects acker argument with an absence of sound logic.moreover,the majority expressly approves the third district erroneous treatment of diffenderfer in its opinion in acker acker,so d dca.see majority op.at.all seem to also ignore that within months of diffenderfer,this court again addressed the controlling issue in pastore.referring to and quoting from diffenderfer,this court,in pastore,again recognized and stated the general principle that 
in most cases it may be preferable to deal with pension rights as a marital asset rather than merely a source of support obligations 
pastore,so d at quoting diffenderfer,so d at emphasis supplied.following this court decisions in diffenderfer and pastore,the second,fourth,and fifth districts all correctly interpreted diffenderfer and held that an asset may not be counted twice,both during the equitable distribution of marital property as property and again as income for alimony purposes.see rogers rogers,so d,dca paris paris,so d,dca ellis ellis,so d,dca bain bain,so d,dca gentile gentile,so d,dca.in acker,the third district has mistakenly attempted to explain the decisions of the second,fourth,and fifth districts by suggesting that the original westlaw and versions of the diffenderfer opinion contained a typographical error,and,therefore,speculating that the decisions rendered by the second,fourth,and fifth districts were all a direct result of reliance upon the typographical error in diffenderfer without any basis whatsoever for such faulty conclusion.see acker,so d at.the acker court below held,without explanation,that based upon the authoritative version of diffenderfer,a court is allowed to consider a pension which has been equitably distributed to the payor in determining the payor ability to pay alimony.id.at.the majority here simply regurgitates the third district erroneous view of the application of diffenderfer.
the third district explanation for the decisions of the second,fourth,and fifth districts which interpreted diffenderfer is,however,clearly misdirected.a review of rogers,paris,ellis,bain,and gentile reveals that there is absolutely no indication whatsoever that any of those courts relied upon the asserted typographical error in diffenderfer first published by westlaw and on.in fact,of those five decisions,three did not quote directly from diffenderfer at all,see rogers,so d at paris,so d at gentile,so d at,while two quoted from the correct,authoritative version,see ellis,so d at bain,so d at.the third district here has attempted to create confusion in diffenderfer where none exists.in diffenderfer,this court clearly held that injustice would result if the trial court were to consider the same asset in calculating both property distribution and support obligations.diffenderfer,so d at.the subsequent decisions of the second,fourth,and fifth districts all properly interpreted the clear mandate of diffenderfer,which the majority now rejects even though the citizens of florida,their counsel,and florida courts have relied thereon for almost twenty years.
moreover,the third district,in acker,asserted that its discussion of diffenderfer was merely academic because the legislature subsequently enacted sections and of the florida statutes in,which effectively superseded this court diffenderfer holding.see acker,so d at.the majority here approves the third district application of sections and.see majority op.at.however,as recognized by judge gersten in his dissent in acker below,with which i totally agree,florida equitable distribution statute section and alimony statute section do not at all conflict with this court diffenderfer holding.see acker,so d at gersten,dissenting.judge gersten noted in his dissent that c onsiderations in the initial dissolution proceedings are distinct from those raised in a scenario.id.at.while sections and pertain to initial dissolution proceedings,here we are faced with a action.sections and are not controlling here and the generalizations contained therein do not even attempt to address the specific true issue with which we are confronted in this case.the statutory provisions do not address the issue of the distribution of assets,including the value of a stream of future payments,as property to fund and accomplish equitable distribution and then later in subsequent proceedings utilization of the same asset again as one from which to distribute a flow of continuing payments to a party who has already received the value of such payments in the prior property distribution allocations.the fundamental dynamics and rights change after the classification and distribution of an asset as property and a division based on such classification.
in the initial proceeding,the assets were equalized and distributed with the former husband receiving his pension plan with its future distributions valued as an asset in the equitable distribution of property while the wife received other valuable assets to offset and place the total assets of each party in an equalized position.to now take that property asset previously classified as and subject to property distribution for valuation purposes for alimony payments violates the fundamental principles of equitable property distribution and fairness and constitutes a clear of result this court sought to avoid in diffenderfer.certainly,when the specific asset was originally assigned as property with value to acker,the value recognized and received enhancement because it would eventually produce a future stream of income,and it was valued accordingly as a total property.similarly,the former wife was assigned the marital residence asset,and additional other assets valued and equalized accordingly of significantly higher value than if the stream of payments had not been included in the value as property for the husband.the former wife has no additional alimony entitlement to the current value of the former husband asset distributed and valued as property,just as the former husband has no entitlement to the current value of the assets distributed as property to the wife.the majority holding encourages a dissipation of assets previously used for property distribution and permits a second redistribution of an asset already distributed as property in the initial process.
in an initial dissolution proceeding,a court begins the equitable distribution of property with the premise that the distribution should be equal.stat.upon the distribution of assets as property in the final dissolution proceeding,the parties become independent of each other,and are entitled to the use of their equitably distributed property assets distributed for that purpose without interference from their former spouse.if one spouse dissipates the value of a distributed asset or a spouse distributed property asset does not proportionately increase,that spouse is not entitled to a subsequent redistribution of the property following the initial finalized equitable property distribution.former marital assets equitably distributed as property are not subj
