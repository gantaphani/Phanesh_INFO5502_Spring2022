if,during a marriage,a child is fathered by a man who is not married to the mother of the child,the presumptions provided by family code sections and subdivision a,permit the mother and her husband to prevent the biological father from ever establishing any parental rights over the child.however,where,as here,the mother and her husband have allegedly permitted the biological father to receive the child into his home and hold him out as his child,the biological father may assert the rebuttable presumption provided by section,subdivision d.
accordingly,in this case we reverse the trial court order quashing the paternity petition of a man who alleges that he is the biological father of a child who he received into his home.
in reaching this conclusion we recognize that when,as is alleged here,more than one presumption of paternity arises under section,section requires that a trial court weigh the considerations of policy and logic.however,contrary to the holding of the trial court,the state interest in protecting the marriage and promoting family stability does not per se outweigh the interests of a presumptive father and child in maintaining their relationship.when,as here,a married couple has permitted another man to hold a child out as his own such that the presumption provided by section,subdivision d,would arise,the trial court must evaluate a number of factors and in the end protect the of the child.
factual summary 
in the spring of respondent sandy was married to brian appellant craig is an attorney and was a family friend of sandy and brian.indeed,craig represented brian in a criminal matter.during the spring of sandy and craig had a brief sexual relationship.
sandy became pregnant during the affair and delivered jeffrey on february.while sandy was carrying jeffrey,all parties believed brian was jeffrey father.indeed,brian took sandy to the hospital when she went into labor and assisted in the delivery.however,routine testing at the hospital disclosed that jeffrey blood was rh negative.because both brian and sandy are rh positive,this discovery eliminated the possibility brian was jeffrey biological father.
when sandy advised brian that he was not jeffrey father and that craig was the only other possible father,brian reacted angrily.immediately following jeffrey birth,sandy and jeffrey stayed at her mother home in san clemente.eventually,however,sandy returned with jeffrey to the home she shared with brian.
according to craig petition,he and his wife,kathryn,agreed to participate as fully as possible in jeffrey upbringing.craig signed a support agreement and made support payments to sandy.when sandy returned to work,kathryn took care of jeffrey three to four days a week in the home she and craig shared.according to craig petition,when jeffrey was a few months old the visits began including one overnight stay each week.although disputed by sandy and brian,craig further alleged that he held jeffrey out to his family and friends as his son.
on march,sandy sent craig an in which she advised him that she no longer needed the childcare services craig and kathryn had been providing.
trial court proceedings 
on april,craig filed a petition alleging he was jeffrey presumed father under the terms of section,subdivision d.shortly thereafter,he filed a motion for a temporary order permitting him to maintain visitation with jeffrey.the motion for temporary relief was never heard by the trial court.craig also moved for an order directing that the parties submit to dna testing.that order was not heard either.
initially,craig named only sandy as a respondent.sandy moved to join brian and her motion was granted.brian then moved to quash craig petition.brian argued that because he was sandy husband at the time of jeffrey conception and birth,he was jeffrey presumed father under section,subdivision a,and that his status prevented craig from asserting paternity under section,subdivision d.on september,the trial court granted brian petition.in its statement of decision the trial court found if craig were able to prove that he is a presumed father pursuant to california family code section d,subdivision a of california family code section would not confer upon him standing to challenge paternity of brian who is a presumed father pursuant to california family code section a.there is a strong public policy in california to maintain the integrity of the unitary family and the welfare of jeffrey requires a concern for jeffrey perceived legitimacy.the court finds that pursuant to statute,decisional law,and california strong public policy to maintain the integrity of a child legitimacy,craig does not have standing to establish a paternal relationship.
in light of its determination that craig did not have standing to assert paternity,the trial court found that it was not necessary to address craig motions for temporary visitation and dna testing.
craig filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas and in the alternative a writ of mandate.we denied the petition for writ of supersedeas but expedited his appeal.
discussion 
icraig claima.section,subdivision d 
section,subdivision d,gives presumed paternity to a man who receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.in interpreting the statutory predecessor to section,subdivision d,the court in in re richard cal d,found that a child who stayed with his biological father every other weekend had been received into the father home.the level of contact craig has alleged during the first year of jeffrey life is sufficient to establish paternity under section,subdivision d.see in re richard,supra,cal d at,but see also adoption of kelsey cal th,d.thus craig had standing to initiate paternity proceedings under section section,subdivision b.brian ginger th,d.
contrary to sandy and brian brief,the conclusive presumption of paternity provided by section does not bar craig paternity action.section states except as provided in section,the child of a wife cohabiting with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.because brian was cohabiting with sandy at both the time of jeffrey conception and his birth,he falls within the scope of section.see dawn superior court cal th,d,fn.dawn.
however,section provides in pertinent part a notwithstanding section,if the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts,as disclosed by the evidence based on blood tests performed pursuant to chapter commencing with section,are that the husband is not the father of the child,the question of paternity of the husband shall be resolved accordingly.
b the notice of motion for blood tests under this section may be filed not later than two years from the child date of birth by the husband,or for the purposes of establishing paternity by the presumed father or the child through or by the child guardian ad litem.as used in this subdivision,presumed father has the meaning given in sections and.italics added.
here,although brian falls within the description of a father within the meaning of section,craig claim is not barred by section.rather,because craig brought his claims before jeffrey second birthday and alleges he is a presumed father under section,subdivision d,under the express terms of section,subdivision b,his claim is not subject to section.
in dawn the mother and her husband prevented the biological father from actually receiving his offspring into his home within even the broadest interpretation of section,subdivision d.notwithstanding the absence of any statutory standing,the biological father argued that he nonetheless had the constitutional right to establish such a relationship.in rejecting this contention the court found that in the absence of any social relationship between the child and the biological father,the state could adopt a substantive rule of law which prevented such a relationship from ever developing.the court stated here,jerry the biological father has never had any personal relationship with dawn child,only an alleged biological link with an attempt to negotiate an agreement for child support and visitation.as explained above,in michael gerald d the united states supreme court decided that a biological father mere desire to establish a personal relationship with the child is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.accordingly,in this case jerry claim must fail.dawn,supra,cal th at,d.
craig claim is of course markedly different than the claim considered in dawn most importantly,unlike the biological father in dawn,craig alleges facts which would give rise to the presumption provided by section,subdivision d.he alleges not only a great deal of physical contact with jeffrey but a meaningful relationship with jeffrey.as we discuss more fully below that relationship not only supports a statutory right under section,subdivision d,but an interest which may well be subject to protection under the due process clause of the united states constitution.
in sum,although under section and the holding in dawn a married couple has the right to prevent a biological father from ever establishing any paternal relationship with a child born into the marriage,where the couple permits such a relationship to develop they can not unilaterally terminate it.thus craig claim under section,subdivision d,is not barred by either the conclusive presumption of section or the holding in dawn 
brian claim 
brian also had standing to pursue a paternity claim.as sandy husband at the time of jeffrey birth,he could pursue a claim not only under section but under the broader provisions of section,subdivision a.contrary to craig suggestion,brian ability to make a claim under section did not preclude brian from also making a claim under section,subdivision a.
although distinct,the conclusive presumption set forth in section and the rebuttable presumptions recognized under section,subdivision a,are in no sense mutually exclusive.because it requires proof of cohabitation,the section presumption is narrower than the section,subdivision a,presumption.the cohabiting requirement of section has been interpreted as requiring proof that the husband and wife were living together as husband and wife steven matthew th,d at the time of conception.brian ginger,supra,th at,d.as our cases have repeatedly recognized,the presumption embodied in section is a rule of substantive law which in general is not subject to contest by a husband,a mother or a child after a child is two years old.see in re marriage of freeman,supra,th at,d.in the landmark case of kusior silver cal d,the court found there are significant reasons why the integrity of the family when husband and wife are living together as such should not be impugned.a conclusive presumption is in actuality a substantive rule of law and can not be said to be unconstitutional unless it transcends such a power of the legislature.
in contrast,section,subdivision a,provides a rebuttable presumption where a man and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage,or within days after the marriage is terminated by death,annulment,declaration of invalidity,or divorce,or after a judgment of separation is entered by a court.the rebuttable presumption of section,subdivision a,does not require any proof of cohabitation rather,the only predicate is birth during a valid marriage or within days after the marriage is terminated.importantly,under section,subdivision a,the presumption created by section,subdivision a,may be challenged by the child,the mother or the husband,at any time so long as it is brought within a reasonable time after obtaining knowledge of relevant facts.thus,unlike a conclusively presumed father under section,the rights and obligations of a presumed father under section,subdivision a,may be asserted or challenged even after a child reaches the age of two.
section and section,subdivision a,are not in any manner incompatible.proof of cohabitation and the passage of two years from birth will give a husband far greater protection of his paternal rights,and far less of an opportunity to be relieved of paternal obligations,than is afforded the husband who can not show he was living with the mother at the time of conception or the husband whose child is less than two years old.however,there is nothing on the face of the statutes which prevents a husband,who can not show cohabitation or who did cohabit but has a child less than two years old,from asserting alternative rights under section,subdivision a.by its express terms the face of section,subdivision a,includes both cohabiting and noncohabiting husbands.
notwithstanding the inclusive provisions of section,subdivision a,craig argues that section somehow prevents a cohabiting husband within the meaning of section from asserting alternative rights under section,subdivision a.craig relies on the fact that under section,subdivision a,the question of paternity is resolved according to the results of blood tests.however,craig narrow interpretation of section ignores both important statutory limitations on the right to obtain blood tests and the views of a majority of our supreme court as recently expressed in in re jesusa cal th,d.
section,subdivision b,places an important procedural hurdle in the path of unwed biological fathers,such as craig,who seek blood tests under section,subdivision a.under the express terms of section,subdivision b,the husband,the presumed father and the child by a guardian ad litem are the only parties who may move for the blood tests provided by section,subdivision a.significantly,section,subdivision b,further provides as used in this subdivision,presumed father has the meaning given in sections and.italics added.thus under a plain reading of section,subdivision b,an unwed biological father may obtain blood tests but only if he meets the requirements of sections and.
section,subdivision b,in turn provides a significant limitation on the universe of presumed fathers.it provides if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.italics added.as we read the statutory scheme,an unwed biological father has no right to blood tests under section,subdivision a,unless he has satisfied the requirements of sections and,including the weighing process required by section,subdivision b.in our view,if the legislature did not intend that an unwed biological father challenge under section be subject to the weighing requirements of section,subdivision b,the legislature would not have made an express reference to section in section,subdivision b.
our view that under section biology is an important but not determinative factor is consistent with the views expressed by the supreme court in in re jesusa v.in re jesusa resolved a conflict between a husband claiming paternity under section,subdivisions a and d,and an unwed biological father asserting paternity under section subdivision d.the court rejected the unwed biological father contention that proof of his biological paternity defeated the presumption of paternity available to the nonbiological fathers under section.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.two dissenting opinions had suggested,as does craig,that under section blood tests control paternity and that biology should also therefore control paternity under section.however,the supreme court rejected the dissenters premise that under section blood tests will always defeat a nonbiological father competing claim to paternity the legislative history of section fails to support either dissenting opinion.according to these materials,the amendment to section was intended to provide unwed biological fathers,who were previously foreclosed from challenging the husband conclusive presumption of paternity,the opportunity to establish paternity when they have demonstrated an interest in raising and providing for their children.citation.a mere opportunity for the unwed biological father to establish paternity hardly supports the claim that biology is necessarily determinative.indeed,in construing a statute similar to section,the colorado supreme court observed that the provision does not state that blood ev
