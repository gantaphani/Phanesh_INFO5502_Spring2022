appellants dianne and ellen,the and maternal grandmother of minors brittany and amanda the minors,appeal from permanent placement plan orders finding the minors adoptable,terminating dianne parental rights,and denying placement of the minors with the maternal grandmother.on this appeal,dianne mother contends the juvenile court improperly determined that she had failed to meet her burden of demonstrating under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c a that her parental rights should not be terminated.ellen grandmother contends that the order terminating mother parental rights is void because it was made by a court commissioner sitting as a referee without the stipulation of appellants,and without subsequent approval by a judge and that the order referring the minors for adoption must be reversed because respondent sonoma county human services department department failed properly to assess grandmother for relative placement,and the juvenile court failed to place the minors with the grandmother or explain why it was not doing so.each of the two appellants joins in the arguments of the other.
separately,the minors move this court to take additional evidence concerning the minors current circumstances,and argue that in light of alleged changed circumstances with respect to the minors prospective adoptive parents the case should be reversed and remanded for further proceedings to determine whether foster care or guardianship is the best alternative for the minors.concurring in part in the contentions of the minors,appellants mother and grandmother join in the request that the matter be reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
all parties,including the respondent department,acknowledge this to be an unusually difficult and painful case.based on our careful review of the complete record,including our previous decision denying mother petition for writ review of the juvenile court orders terminating reunification services and setting a section permanency planning hearing,we conclude that the juvenile court did not err or abuse its discretion,and there are no grounds for reversal.we therefore affirm the juvenile court orders in their entirety.
iv.failure to stipulate to commissioner presiding at hearing 
in her lead argument on appeal,grandmother argues that the juvenile court decision and orders were void and ineffective because the section hearing was heard by a court commissioner sitting as a referee without the stipulation of appellants and without subsequent approval by a judge.the contention is meritless.
at the outset of the contested hearing,the juvenile court commissioner stated on the record that because she had already made prior orders setting the contested hearing before her without any objection by the parties,they had waived any contention that she should not preside at the hearing.counsel for mother thereupon stated his willingness to stipulate to the matter being heard by the commissioner and noted that he had advised his client so to stipulate as well,although he was not sure she was willing to do so because she was not present.counsel for grandmother,on the other hand,stated his client refusal to stipulate to the commissioner.at that point,the commissioner ordered a recess to ascertain whether mother would be attending the hearing.after the recess,mother counsel indicated his client was too scared to come.nothing more was said regarding mother consent to the hearing being held before a commissioner.thereafter,the contested section hearing proceeded with grandmother and all the other parties participating,and with no further reference to the issue of whether the parties agreed to it being held before the commissioner.
under the california constitution,court commissioners may perform subordinate judicial duties including the trying of cases,subject to the stipulation of the parties.cal,art.vi,in re horton cal d.code of civil procedure section provides that every court commissioner shall have the power to a ct as temporary judge when otherwise qualified so to act and when appointed for that purpose,or by written consent of an appearing party.code civ,subd.e,italics added.california rules of court,rule defines a t emporary judge as a member of the state bar appointed pursuant to article vi,section of the california constitution and rule.unless otherwise indicated,all further references to rules are to the california rules of court.rule in turn sets out the general requirement that trial of a matter by a temporary judge be subject to written stipulation of the parties,but also states that this requirement does not apply to the selection of a court commissioner to act as a temporary judge.rule a.a referee,on the other hand,is defined as a person appointed under section or of the code of civil procedure.rule.under sections through of the welfare and institutions code,referees may also be appointed to preside in juvenile court matters these provisions make it clear that by their nature,the functions and powers of a referee are more limited than those of a temporary judge,and more subject to the agreement and consent of the parties.thus,the subordinate judicial classifications of referee and temporary judge are distinct,vested with different powers,and subject to differing procedural constraints.code civ,rules see badgley van upp th,d in re carina d.
court commissioners may serve as referees or as temporary judges,depending on the circumstances.under the sonoma county superior court local rules,a superior court commissioner appointed by a majority of the judges of the superior court may be appointed by the presiding supervising judge to sit either as a commissioner or as a referee or as a judge pro tempore or as a juvenile court referee on such matters as the needs of the court may require.superior court of california,county of sonoma,local rules of court local rules.under local rule,u nless otherwise expressly specified,a commissioner shall act as a temporary judge with respect to any and all actions,causes or proceedings in any court department to which the commissioner is assigned,without further order of the court.local rule,italics added.the local rules go on to enumerate the duties and powers that may be exercised by a commissioner so acting as a temporary judge.these include but are not limited to c onduct ing the trial or hearing of assigned actions,causes and proceedings,whether or not contested,and o therwise exercis ing the powers,duties and functions of a superior court judge.local rule a,k.the local rules clearly distinguish between the powers and duties of a commissioner serving as a temporary judge and the more limited ones of a commissioner serving as a referee.thus,without further order or assignment,a commissioner is authorized to s erve as a juvenile court referee even if he or she is unable to act as a temporary judge in any matter.local rule a.
these provisions of the local rules are in full compliance with california statutory and decisional authority,pursuant to which a temporary judge has full judicial powers,and his or her orders are as final and nonreviewable as those of a permanent judge.in re mark cal d,where a referee sits as a temporary judge,his or her orders become final in the same manner as orders made by a judge.because it was not otherwise expressly specified that the commissioner in this case was acting as anything other than a temporary judge local rule,the applicable law requires us to conclude that she was acting as such,and thereby exercising all the powers of a superior court judge.thus,grandmother assertion that the commissioner in this case was sitting as a referee rather than a temporary judge is simply incorrect.
grandmother insists that to the extent they permit a commissioner to try the contested hearing as a temporary judge without stipulation of the parties,the sonoma county local rules are in violation of article vi,section of the california constitution.in the first place,clearly the local rules must be interpreted and applied in compliance with the constitutional principle that t he jurisdiction of a court commissioner,or any other temporary judge,to try a cause derives from the parties stipulation.in re horton,supra,cal d at.regardless of whether the parties required stipulation is explicitly mentioned by the local rules,that jurisdictional requirement can not simply be omitted or disregarded.
it is under the facts of this case that grandmother challenge fails.although the jurisdiction of a temporary judge to try a cause derives from and depends upon the parties stipulation thereto,this constitutional requirement is nevertheless subject to implied waiver.thus,for constitutional purposes a valid stipulation may be implied by the conduct of the parties,including their participation in a proceeding tried by a temporary judge.in re horton,supra,cal d at,in re mark,supra,cal d at,estate of soforenko d.the record reflects that although grandmother purportedly refused to stipulate to the commissioner sitting as judge at the outset of the contested hearing,she had earlier failed to object at the time trial was originally set before the commissioner.this failure to make a timely objection was tantamount to an implied waiver of the required stipulation that the matter be heard by the commissioner sitting as a temporary judge.in re horton,supra,cal d at,in re mark,supra,cal d at,estate of soforenko,supra,d at.
moreover,even were we to accept the validity of grandmother belated attempt on the day of the scheduled hearing to withdraw her earlier implied stipulation,she effectively waived her present procedural claim by subsequently failing to seek any rehearing of the commissioner decision before a juvenile court judge.absent timely challenge,the orders of a subordinate judicial officer sitting as a temporary judge,even without proper stipulation,become final upon expiration of the time for rehearing.in re carina,supra,d at.it is undisputed that grandmother did not seek such a rehearing.to the extent the decision of the commissioner in this case was subject to rehearing by a juvenile court judge at all,grandmother failure to seek such a rehearing rendered the orders and decision of the commissioner final.
citing several rules and statutory provisions requiring referees to give litigants express written notice of their right to a rehearing by a juvenile court judge,grandmother nevertheless insists her failure to seek a rehearing is excused by the fact the commissioner failed to give her such notice of the right to a rehearing in this case.rules a,b.the principal difficulty with this contention is that,as discussed,in this instance the commissioner was acting not as a referee,but as a temporary judge.as such,the commissioner was clothed with full judicial powers,and her orders were as final and nonreviewable as those of a permanent judge.in re mark,supra,cal d at,italics added see also.indeed,just as california law makes a clear distinction between referees and temporary judges,it differentiates between the powers of a superior court commissioner sitting as a temporary judge and those of an ordinary member of the bar sitting as such.as seen,the california rules of court specifically provide that the requirement of a written stipulation for a matter to be tried by a temporary judge does not apply to the selection of a court commissioner to act as a temporary judge rule a,b,italics added.although section requires that a referee provide the minor parent or guardian or adult relative with a written explanation of the right of such persons to seek review of the order by the juvenile court,that provision on its face refers to the duties of a juvenile court referee,not those of a commissioner sitting as a temporary judge in a juvenile court matter.there is no corresponding provision in the applicable statutes and rules requiring that a court commissioner sitting as a temporary judge give express written notification of a right of review by a juvenile court judge.in short,a commissioner sitting as a temporary judge exercises all the power,duties and functions of a superior court judge,and his or her decisions are as final and nonreviewable as those of such a judge.in re mark,supra,cal d at.
neither rule a nor rule b supports grandmother assertion that her failure to seek a rehearing before the juvenile court was excused or indeed was at all relevant to the finality of the commissioner decision.rule a which provides that t he referee shall inform the child and parent or guardian of the right to seek review by a juvenile court judge is expressly limited to proceedings in a which a referee was not acting as a temporary judge,a situation that did not obtain in this case.rule a,italics added in re carina,supra,d at,fn.in the same way,rule also deals exclusively with orders of referees not acting as temporary judges 
finally,even if for the sake of argument we were to accept grandmother assumption that the commissioner in this case was sitting as a juvenile court referee and not as a temporary judge,we are nevertheless unpersuaded that the commissioner failure to give express written notice of the statutory right to a rehearing before a juvenile court voids the finality of the decision and requires reversal.even in a capital case,a defendant is not entitled to an express admonition of his or her right to trial before a regularly appointed superior court judge rather than a court commissioner sitting as a temporary judge indeed,such a defendant may even be bound by his or her attorney implied waiver of the right to stipulate to trial by a commissioner sitting as a temporary judge.in re horton,supra,cal d at,in re mark,supra,cal d at,estate of soforenko,supra,d at.given the fact sections and set forth the right to seek a rehearing before a juvenile court judge and the procedure for doing so,grandmother and her attorney were clearly on statutory or constructive notice of the right of which she now complains she was uninformed.in light of the supreme court analysis in horton,we see no reason why the failure of grandmother attorney to seek a rehearing on her behalf within days as required by sections and should be excused by the lack of an additional express notification,and thereby require reversal of the commissioner decision.this is particularly true in the context of this expedited appeal from a contested section permanency planning hearing wherein the paramount consideration before both the juvenile court and this court on appeal is to determine the best interests of the minors,and to do so as expeditiously and as finally as possible.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d,in re jasmine,supra,th at,d.bearing all this in mind,we conclude that the failure to give express written notice of the statutory right to a rehearing in a civil juvenile dependency proceeding may be waived when a party who is represented by counsel fails to request such a rehearing.in re horton,supra,cal d at.
