factual and procedural background 
the appellate record 
in may the juvenile court sustained the department petition alleging that mother had failed to protect her three children,and,subd.b.was,was eight,and was two years old at the time.a year later the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a section hearing to select a permanent plan for and.the hearing was reset a number of times and was finally held on march.mother was present at the hearing.the court identified adoption as the permanent placement goal for and but declined to terminate parental rights at that time the court continued the hearing for days to give the department time to locate an appropriate adoptive home and set a continued hearing for september.on march,the department mailed notice of the continued hearing date to mother last known address.
mother last saw her children during a visit in april.no visits took place in may or june because mother had been incarcerated.mother contacted the social worker in july asking to reinstate visits and two visits were set up for august.however,toward the end of august the social worker learned that mother was again incarcerated and those visits had to be cancelled.the juvenile court issued an order on august,requiring mother to be transported from monterey county jail to the september,hearing in santa clara county.
the continued hearing was held as scheduled on september.mother did not appear.mother attorney asked the court to continue the matter because the attorney had not yet spoken with mother about the department latest report.after confirming that mother had been notified of the hearing date,the court denied counsel request.
the department report for the continued hearing indicated that the children were placed with a family that was committed to all of them.the department recommended that the court terminate parental rights to and to free them for their expected adoption.the court so ordered.
the evidence 
the department march,status report reveals that remained with his sisters in the home until january when his placement was terminated.he was moved to the children shelter where he remained at the time of the march,report.had no legal relatives because the juvenile court had previously terminated parental rights as to him,and there was no suitable person available to assume legal guardianship of him.the court ordered his permanent plan changed from adoption to planned permanent living arrangement and ordered that he continue under the care,custody and control of the department for placement in a suitable foster home.the court ordered visitation with his two sisters at least twice per month.
did mother receive adequate notice of the hearing at which her parental rights were terminated 
was the evidence sufficient to support the finding that was likely to be adopted 
did the juvenile court err in refusing to continue the hearing at which mother parental rights were terminated 
in light of the department concession that the order terminating parental rights to must be reversed,should the matter be remanded for the juvenile court to consider whether the sibling relationship exception of section,subdivision c e should apply to preclude termination of parental rights to 
discussion 
did mother receive adequate notice of the hearing 
in general,due process requires only that the parent receive notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the continued pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.in re anna th,d.former section,subdivision a,which applied at all times relevant here,set forth detailed requirements for notifying parents whenever the court set a section hearing under former section,it was not necessary to give a parent a second notice conforming to the requirements of that section if he or she received proper notice of the hearing in the first instance and the hearing was continued to another date when the parent was present in court.in re malcolm th,d.that was because duplication of the more demanding and service requirements of former section,where the permanent plan recommendation is not changed,would do nothing to enhance the likelihood the parent would appear at the continued hearing.in re phillip th,d phillip.actual notice of the continued hearing date was sufficient so long as the department recommendation concerning the child placement was unchanged.id.at,d.
the september,hearing at which mother parental rights were terminated was a continuation of the section hearing first held on march.mother does not challenge the sufficiency of the notice she received for the march,hearing,nor does she deny that it contained notice that the department then recommended termination of her parental rights.mother also acknowledges that she was present in court on march,and received actual notice of the date to which the hearing was continued.nevertheless,mother argues that since adoption was sufficiently uncertain on march,and since parents in the dependency system have many problems that compromise their abilities,the department should have sent another formal notice closer to the time of the hearing.we are not persuaded.
mother received all the notice the law required.we have no facts to suggest that another notice would have increased the likelihood that she would have appeared at the hearing or that she would have contacted the social worker to explain her absence.under all the circumstances,the notice she received was reasonably calculated to apprise her of the date of the hearing.
was there sufficient evidence of adoptability 
mother next argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the courts finding that the children are adoptable.since the department concedes that is no longer adoptable,mothers argument now relates only to 
at a section hearing the juvenile court is expected to select a permanent placement plan for a dependent child.the preferred plan is adoption,subd.b.in order to select adoption as the permanent placement plan the juvenile court must find by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely that the child will be adopted.in making that determination the court focuses on whether the child age,physical condition and emotional state will create difficulty in locating a family willing to adopt her.in re sarah th,d.
on review of the sufficiency of the evidence,we presume in favor of the order,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving the prevailing party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of
