michael bowen appeals from the trial court order renewing a restraining order against him for three additional years,arguing that reversal is necessary on multiple grounds.sonya lister,petitioner below,opposes bowen grounds,and also argues that the appeal must be dismissed as untimely.we conclude the appeal is timely but that bowen appellate claims lack merit.therefore,we affirm the court order.
background 
the initial restraining order 
according to lister november,testimony,she is an outreach case manager for community awareness treatment services cats and in the course of her duties works out in the field and at different cats locations in san francisco.in,the trial court,having found that bowen had been stalking lister,including in the parking lot by her workplace,issued a restraining order against bowen,through september.the court ordered bowen to stay yards away from lister and her daughter,as well as lister hayward,california home,vehicle,and workplace at cats,except that he could visit certain cats offices for purposes.the court further limited bowen ability to contact lister family members or spend time in lister neighborhood.
in an unpublished opinion,lister bowen,no,issued on june,we summarized lister testimony to the trial court at the hearing on her request for a restraining order among other things,lister told the trial court she had dated bowen five or six years before,and had recently dated him again for about a month.in the first half of july,he suddenly appeared as she walked in a parking lot where she worked and made comments indicating that he was stalking her,such as that he was around watching her even though she did not always see him,and indicated that he was going to keep it up.later in july,he appeared again as she was walking in the parking lot and started talking to her again.she did not see where he came from,felt unsafe,and did not wish to talk to him.she had not contacted him or called him,they did not have a good rapport,and he knew she did not care to speak to him.
lister also said she had seen bowen vehicle parked in front of a hayward restaurant that was three blocks from her home,although he lived in daly city,and that she was not able to access entertainment and things with him stalking around and driving around and frequenting her neighborhood.he also had contacted her year old daughter without lister permission or knowledge,and visited her at their home.her daughter had contacted him regarding driving lessons he had paid for,unaware of her mother concerns about him.lister also said she thought lister was buying her family and friends.
lister said bowen frequented the offices of cats,having graduated from it,sometimes visiting at the request of others to say hello or for a consultation on a job because he was a contractor.lister did not want to see him there because she felt he was stalking her.
at the hearing,the trial court,after noting that years before bowen had pled guilty to inflicting corporal injury to a spouse of inhabitant,albeit before he became clean and sober,found bowen history pretty damning.that,along with lister contentions and bowen own statements at the hearing,indicated to the court that he was pretty obsessive about folks that he became involved with,engaged in stalking,and was invasive and getting into people emotional and psychological space.
after the court issued the initial restraining order,bowen retained legal counsel and filed a motion for reconsideration.the court denied his motion and bowen appealed on a variety of grounds.we affirmed the trial court order and remanded the matter to the trial court with the instruction that it promptly issue a single,comprehensive written order of all of its orders to date.
in july,the trial court issued an amended restraining order that,among other things,ordered that lister stay yards away from the office building in which lister was employed,and stated that,if lister was not present at other cats offices or locations,bowen could enter them for purposes,although he was required to leave if lister arrived.the court added to the written order its previous oral instruction that bowen not initiate contact with lister family or continue any kind of relationship with them.
the court renewal of the restraining order 
on july,lister filed a request to renew the restraining order with the trial court.the court held a hearing on september,regarding her request,at which bowen,represented by counsel,and lister both appeared and testified under oath.among other things,lister testified that on july,she was told not to come into her workplace building because bowen was present there as a result,she stayed away for two days.she also testified that bowen approached her stepmother at a store about a year before and told her he had heard she was mad at him for some things he had said at a previous court hearing.lister added that she had seen bowen within a couple of blocks of her house in or.
bowen counsel argued that there was no credible reason to renew the restraining order,as most of lister allegations were about,bowen had not had any contact with lister since that time,and there was no credible evidence to suggest that bowen posed any imminent risk of harm to lister.counsel referred the court to a declaration,apparently by perry zinnanti,indicating that bowen had gone into the cats building to address someone who had relapsed,and had promptly left when he learned there were some questions about his right to be there.
the trial court cited family code section section as indicating that orders could be renewed at the request of a party for either five years or permanently,without a showing of any further abuse.bowen counsel asked for additional time to brief the question because in his experience,there usually has to be some objective fear.some reason to extend it.counsel also argued the order had a chilling effect on bowen business.
the trial court concluded that,since bowen defense was based on his allegation that there was not further abuse and that was not statutorily required,it was appropriate to renew the order for five years.the court rejected bowen counsel request for an evidentiary hearing to address the legal standard,stating,it is not an evidence issue,it is a legal issue.asked to clarify its ruling,the court stated that lister has made factual allegations.she has made it in her request and she has made them here today.and i believe under the statute she has made sufficient showing to have a reissuance of the order.and that on the face on the statute.she made the request to reissue.it also stated,my finding is that she has met the requirements of section,subdivision a.and i am choosing the shorter duration of the choices that are outlined there for me.
on september,the court issued a restraining order against bowen for five more years,until midnight on september,september order.
bowen motion for reconsideration 
on september,bowen filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.the register of actions contained in the record indicates that,for reasons that are neither explained by the parties nor apparent from the record the hearing,originally scheduled for october,was continued to november,and then to november.
at the november,hearing november hearing,bowen,again represented by counsel,and lister appeared.at the beginning of the hearing,the court indicated that the legal standard,pursuant to the ricci case,an apparent reference to ritchie conrad th ritchie,was that lister must show a reasonable apprehension of future abuse and her showing must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.
lister testified at the november hearing that bowen had violated the initial protective order multiple times.first,in december,he sent mail to her employer.this caused lister to be very,very stressed out and worried about why he contacting my employer,what is his reasons for it,like what else could they have been discussing about me,and also caused fear.
second,lister said,on july,bowen entered one of cats buildings,on mission street.her director told her not to go to that site because bowen was present,and he was asked to leave the site immediately.this caused lister to worry.
third,according to lister,bowen sent mail to her home on two occasions in october.she was afraid to open the mail,which was addressed from him,for fear that it was poisoned,anthrax.she gave one envelope to the police and retained the other,which was at her home.
lister also testified that since she filed for a restraining order,bowen continuously had filed paperwork with the court,causing her to miss work to come to the court,which she considered to be continuous harassment.
lister also referred to private investigators following her and her friends,declarations written against her,including by a coworker,and bowen tearing apart of her family by using his money to buy his way into some people in my family who are now no longer dealing with him.among other things,she said,he had wanted her aunt to come to court the week before to testify against her.he also told someone at her work that she had engaged in paycheck fraud,resulting in an investigation of her in february that found the allegations were not true.
on by bowen counsel,lister testified that the letters she received from lister in october were copies of filings in the present case.in her view,the correct way to send her such documents would be through his attorney.lister also acknowledged that she had been convicted of larceny because she did not report her earnings to the housing authority seven years ago.bowen counsel argued that this information was relevant to lister credibility.
lister called a coworker as a witness,who testified that after bowen appeared at the cats office in july,lister was very distressed crying,unable to focus on her case load,in fear that her work area is no longer a safe place.the coworker said that from july,to the date of the hearing,lister had been overwhelmed by very stressful legal proceedings,had been an emotional wreck,and had missed work.
lister also called her sister as a witness.she testified that since may,the situation had been very stressful for lister,who seems very paranoid,worrying that she would run into bowen at certain places.lister spirit had changed and she showed a lot of anxiety,such as when she had to go to court.the family was divided about the matter.
on,lister sister testified that bowen had held some property of a cousin,including a motorcycle,which caused an aunt to support him for fear that bowen would throw the motorcycle in the street.the sister also said she understood that criminal proceedings against lister had been initiated as a result of bowen hiring a private investigator and getting criminal charges brought against her based on hearsay the sister had no personal knowledge of this but had been told it by family members that dealt with bowen.
bowen counsel called perry zinnanti as a witness and his declaration was admitted into evidence,presumably the declaration contained in the record that was filed with the court on august.zinnanti declared that he contacted bowen in july,and asked him if he could visit a cats employee who zinnanti had heard had relapsed,and with whom bowen was close.zinnanti further declared that bowen did not go to the cats offices to harass lister,but to help another person in crisis.
bowen also testified.he said his purpose in entering a cats building on july,was to see one of his counselors,who,bowen had been told,had relapsed.he intended to see the counselor,but was not able to he spoke to another person and did not mention the restraining order.
bowen denied ever hiring a private investigator to follow lister,or having any involvement in the criminal proceedings against her.he said he had a friend mail court papers to lister that contained the friend address,not his own.
on by lister,bowen acknowledged his visit to lister workplace on july,was not for matters.he denied being within three blocks of her hayward home,attending a gym in her neighborhood to which he once belonged,or driving down her street since the issuance of the restraining order,but acknowledged he had been in hayward and had dinner there.he also acknowledged contacting one of her family members after the previous week hearing to tell her he had told the judge that he was going to request her presence at the hearing.
at the end of the hearing,the trial court denied lister motion for reconsideration.it stated that,based on the ricci case,the test to be considered was whether lister had a reasonable apprehension of future abuse.it found that lister had shown that she has an apprehension of future abuse,and i do find that that apprehension is unreasonable.i do believe given her concerns about bowen following her,concerns about his involvement in her family in a way that was appropriate are sufficient reasons for her to have an apprehension of future abuse.
the court further noted bowen was sophisticated and had advice of counsel such that he knew the scope of the protective order and had violated it.the court specifically referred to bowen choosing to enter lister work site for a reason in violation of the order,and with an awareness of the serious and sensitive nature of a heavily litigated dispute that had put him on notice that his actions would have an impact on lister.this caused the court grave concern.
the court was also concerned about the number of hearings held on the matter.it indicated the view that bowen could not let this go for reasons that were not clear to the court,and urged him to let go and move on.
the court then ruled that lister had shown a reasonable apprehension of future abuse and met the standard established in the ricci case,and that it was going to keep the restraining order in place,but would reduce its length from five to three years.it ruled that the september order would remain in effect until a new order was submitted to it,which was to be exactly the same in terms of the terms as the september order,but three years shorter in length.
on december,the court issued a new restraining order that contains the same terms and conditions as the september,restraining order,except that it expires at midnight on september,rather than on september,december order.
on december,bowen filed a notice of appeal from the court december order.
discussion 
bowen argues that reversal is necessary because the trial court erred in applying section,in relying on the fact of bowen litigation as a ground for reissuance of the restraining order,and in issuing an overbroad injunction that improperly invaded bowen associational interests with cats.lister opposes each ground and argues that bowen appeal should be dismissed as untimely.we begin with whether this appeal has been timely made.
i.the timeliness of the appeal 
lister argues that we must dismiss this appeal as untimely because bowen filed his notice of appeal beyond the time allowed,since the date he filed it was more than days after he filed his motion for reconsideration.bowen disagrees,arguing that the appeal should be construed as from a grant of a motion for reconsideration and issuance of an order after a new hearing,from which he is entitled to appeal.we conclude the appeal was timely because,however we construe the court ruling on lister motion for consideration,the december order included a material or substantial modification of the september order that enabled bowen to appeal from the latter order.
the parties do not dispute that the court september order was an appealable order.code civ,subd.a.bowen then filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.california rules of court,rule e provides that when a party does so,the time to appeal is extended to the earliest of three circumstances,which in this case,lister asserts,was days from bowen filing of his motion for reconsideration on september,
bowen,relying on case law involving grants of motions for reconsideration see mink superior court th,and tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,argues that a better characterization of events is that the trial court granted the motion to reconsider,pointing to the court holding of a long cause evidentiary hearing,where,bowen contends,the court considered for the first time the factors detailed in ritchie,supra,th.it was the conduct of this hearing and the prejudice which flowed from it which bowen complains of here.should we find his appeal untimely,he asserts,there would be no way for this court to reach the errors of the hearing challenged here.
it does not appear that the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration.at the end of the november hearing,the court did not explicitly state that bowen motion was denied,but referred to its review of the motion for reconsideration and ordered that the september order would remain in effect until a new order was issued containing the identical terms and conditions,albeit with a time period shortened from five to three years.also,the register of actions contained in the record states that the court denied bowen motion for reconsideration and,although we do not know why the court held the november evidentiary hearing,the register also indicates that,rather than previously grant the motion,the court continued the hearing regarding it twice.it appears that the trial court denied the motion,but in the course of doing so ordered a reduction in the length of the restraining order,for unexplained reasons.
nonetheless,given these circumstances,we agree with bowen that he had the right to appeal from the december order,although for a reason he does not directly raise.that is,the trial court reduction of the length of the new restraining order from five to three years was a material or substantial modification of the september order,as indicated in the case relied on by lister for her argument,dakota payphone,llc alcaraz th dakota.
in dakota,a party appealed from an amended judgment,seemingly in a timely manner.confronted with the issue of whether to dismiss the appeal,the appellate court,after acknowledging that appellate courts generally had no jurisdiction to consider untimely appeals,stated that t he resolution of this issue turns on the question whether the amended judgment superseded the original judgment for purposes of computing the time in which to file a notice of appeal.dakota,supra,th at.the crux of the problem is whether there is a substantial change in the rights of the parties such that allowing an amendment nunc pro tunc relating back to the original judgment would unfairly deprive them of the right to contest the issue on appeal or otherwise i t is ultimately the parties ability to challenge the ruling that is key.the right we are concerned with materially affecting is the right to appeal.id.at.
similarly,this court,in nestle ice cream,llc workers comp.appeals bd.th,stated regarding civil judgments that the period for filing a notice of appeal is not extended by an amendment that corrects a clerical error,but it is extended by an amendment that effects a substantial or material change or involves the exercise of a judicial function or judicial discretion.id.at.
we conclude that the trial court reduction of the length of the renewed restraining order from five to three years in its december order was a material or substantial modification of the september order.in the course of arguing for dismissal,lister asserts that the trial court had no legal authority to reduce the length of the restraining order from five to three years.because lister has not filed a,we need not address this issue.however,lister argument highlights that,if she had chosen to appeal this reduction,we would have undoubtedly addressed it,which inevitably would have led to an evaluation of the evidence introduced at the november hearing,including that which was not presented prior to issuance of the september order,and the court findings after the hearing.in other words,the amended restraining order contains a substantial modification regarding the parties rights based on additional evidence and involved the exercise of judicial discretion,albeit in bowen favor.
lister argues that the december order did not reset bowen time to appeal based on dakota.lister points out that the dakota court rejected the argument that a reduction of million in damages via an amended judgment reset the time in that case because a ll other parts of the judgment not affected by the modification remained valid and could have been challenged by appeal.dakota,supra,th at.however,the dakota court determined that the alteration to the judgment was not substantial and did not materially affect the parties rights under the circumstances of that case,analogizing the change to postjudgment orders that filled in the blanks for attorney fees and interest.ibid.in the present case,the change was one of substance,as it eliminated two years of previously ordered restraints against bowen,substantively altering the parties rights.it is more analogous to the circumstances discussed in stone regents of university of california th,one of the cases discussed in dakota id.at,in which the appellate court ruled that a modification of a judgment to require a party to pay an additional nine months of legal expenses was undeniably one of substance that materially affected their rights.stone,at.we reach the same conclusion here.
in short,whether or not the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration,bowen correctly and timely appealed from the december order.we now turn to the merits of bowen appeal from the december order.
ii.reasonable apprehension 
bowen first argues that the trial court erred in its application of section because lister did not have the objectively reasonable apprehension of future abuse required pursuant to ritchie,supra,th.lister counters that the trial court properly renewed the restraining order based on her reasonable apprehension of future abuse,which was justified because of bowen violation of the order and his litigation abuse.we agree with lister,based on the evidence cited by the trial court regarding bowen violation of the order,particularly in light of the facts underlying the issuance of the original order.
legal standards 
as we have discussed,the procedural history below is somewhat muddled.the trial court,in the course of apparently denying respondent motion for reconsideration,held an evidentiary hearing on november,at which it considered additional evidence regarding renewal of the order,considered the legal standard for renewal articulated in ritchie,apparently for the first time,and substantially modified its order.the parties arguments presume that our standard of review under these muddled circumstances is to evaluate all the evidence presented at this hearing pursuant to ritchie to determine if there is a basis for the renewal of the order.we do so without determining whether our standard of review should be more constrained in some way because of the context in which the trial court ruling was made.
section provides in relevant part that a trial court may renew a restraining order upon the request of a party,either for five years or permanently,without a showing of any further abuse since the issuance of the original order,subject to termination or modification by further order of the court either on written stipulation filed with the court or on the motion of a party,subd.a.
when contested,a request to renew a restraining order should not be granted pursuant to section simply because the requesting party has a subjective fear the party to be restrained will commit abusive acts in the future.ritchie,supra,th at.the apprehension those acts will occur must be reasonable.that is,the court must find the probability of future abuse is sufficient that a reasonable woman or man,if the protected party is a male in the same circumstances would have a reasonable apprehension such abuse will occur unless the court issues a protective order.ibid.however,an imminent and present danger of abuse is not required.ibid.in other words,under this objective test,a trial court should renew the protective order,if,and only if,it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected party entertains a reasonable apprehension of future abuse t his does not mean the court must find it is more likely than not future abuse will occur
