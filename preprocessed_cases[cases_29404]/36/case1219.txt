in this writ proceeding we hold that the trial judge abused her discretion in declaring a mistrial in a family law case merely because the parties did not complete the trial of a dissolution prior to an arbitrary deadline set by the trial judge.the actual trial,in fact,had consumed less than two court days,and there was only one witness left to call and only a few more hours left to go 
we also hold,since trial was already in progress,that it was possible within the meaning of family code section for the trial judge,assigned at the time of the trial to a family law panel,to have taken the case with her to her subsequent courtroom assignment,and in fact she should have taken it.as it turned out,her new assignment is literally one courtroom away in the same courthouse and is still denominated a family law assignment.we will therefore grant the petition brought by the wife for a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to vacate the mistrial and set the matter for completion of the trial before this same trial judge.
until the beginning of trial in october the case had proceeded at what can only be described as a leisurely trot.the petition for dissolution was filed more than five years ago,and in the previous century september.the record in this writ proceeding shows that judge nancy pollard was assigned to the case no later than april.the case was considered a long cause matter.while the status of marriage was officially dissolved in september,trial of the reserved issues the hard part of the case went through a series of continuances from september to november to august to january to april to august to january to may to october when it finally got going.the court,however,did not begin to take any testimony until october.
the record in this writ proceeding does not reveal why the trial judge granted most of these continuances.it is clear,though,that judge pollard continued to preside over the case during the period,and,on the record before us,we presume there was good cause for each continuance.see,presumption that the law has been obeyed.in any event,at the end of the first day of trial testimony on october,the trial judge told the parties that the next date available to hear their case would be november.she ordered the parties back,but also stated we will finish.i want everybody to think about what their most important questions are because the very last important question is going to be asked and answered at three.
so that readers can have a better sense of exactly what happened,we will now detail the proceedings of the afternoon of november as they led to the mistrial.
the afternoon session that friday began with the redirect examination of an expert for the husband as the nominal respondent in the litigation,having put on his last by the husband counsel.then came recross examination of the expert by the wife counsel,and further redirect from the husband counsel.
the examination of the expert finished before three.wife counsel asked if she could call her own expert for one quick question on his bill so we have that in evidence and then he could leave.husband counsel then added that she might have a couple a questions for that expert too.but then husband counsel told the court that she did want the wife expert calling him back again to ask him one or two more questions when we get to husband case by asking whatever questions we have now.
at that moment,apparently about in the afternoon,the trial judge interjected i concerned that this case has gone way beyond the time allotted,way beyond.we going to finish at three or i going to mistry this case.
husband counsel protested.she had more evidence your honor,my client needs an opportunity to testify and has not been provided with an opportunity to provide his testimony and that is going to happen in minutes.and after the judge said,all right,husband counsel added,it going to take probably several hours.
the court was firm well,then,this case is going to be mistried.
wife counsel then offered to simply have the evidence of her expert bill made a matter of stipulation based on his written statement.
husband counsel,however,felt that her client was being prejudiced in the total time allocation not that i looking certainly for a do see how that is going to cure the fact that petitioner wife has been given a fair amount of time to try this case,and so far we been given some time,but not as much time,and my client does get to testify he needs to testify and put on his part of the case.
the judge immediately returned to the theme that the whole case had simply been going on too long.counsel,how long have we been going on this case 
wife counsel replied in one word.forever.
the judge responded forever.and i can not see that it going to get finished today.
wife counsel quickly made the point that it would be real disservice to her client if the case were mistried,and argued that the delays were due to the husband antics.she argued in that regard that the husband had tried to delay the case again this morning by bringing in another new report that i have never seen.if we mistry this thing,this is exactly what he wants since that would leave the wife depleted.
the court then inquired about the existence of a support order.there was one a month,being the husband counsel quickly protested that there is certainly blame to go around on the wife side it not fair to point fingers.
the trial judge immediately shifted the focus of the discussion to her own calendar grace,langston,let me tell you both this court is leaving department at the end of the year.there is not another day this year that this case can be heard.i was supposed to go to a seminar today.i cancelled my appearance at that seminar so we can get this case finished.we have not gotten it finished.we have spent more time on than is worth.all i can say to you is it not going to get finished.i not taking it to department for my domestic violence calendar.i have no other choice.i have no other choice.
after ascertaining that husband counsel still had a couple of hours still to go after all,husband had yet to testify,the judge reiterated the facts that there was enough time i do have a couple of hours this year and she had given up a seminar to do the case that day.the judge finished by expressing the thought that perhaps a stipulation might have avoided the time crunch.why there could not have been a stipulation,i do have the foggiest,but what i am saying to you is it is not going to get finished.we ca get there.there is enough time.period.i have no other alternative.
in desperation,wife counsel offered to submit the case then and there,to which the husband counsel retorted that it would be grossly unfair to do that,given that the majority of the time had been consumed with the wife case.
the trial judge apparently speaking to the husband counsel,though perhaps to both then pointed out that she had been liberal with the inordinate amount of objections and i let you go with your objections,but came back to the determination to end at three i am telling you,there is is not two to three hours left.we have seven minutes.that is it.that is it so i have to declare a mistrial.
wife counsel again protested that husband counsel had taken an inordinate amount of time to her expert and her client and reiterated her theme that husband really wanted the case delayed so he can start all over in front of a new judicial officer and get a second bite out of the apple.
at this point the discussion turned to the degree that each side experts might have cooperated with each other,but after husband counsel finished by returning to her theme that it was unfair to give the wife more total time,the court ended the discussion with the court has mistried this case.that is the court ruling.there is no time to finish.
wife counsel then brought this writ proceeding seeking an order commanding the trial court to vacate the mistrial and set the matter for further proceedings to conclude the trial.
this court invited the husband,real party in interest,to informally respond.while husband objected to the characterization made in the petition that he had caused or contributed to the mistrial,the husband did not oppose the wife essential relief of having the mistrial vacated and the case returned to judge pollard to conclude the trial.
iii.discussion 
a.the standard of review 
this is one of those cases where an extended analysis of exactly which standard of review applies is warranted.
there is no specific statute governing mistrials in the code of civil procedure,though that code certainly recognizes that there will be mistrials,and the code thus makes rules to take them into account,code civ,subd.a time requirement to bring case to trial again after mistrial allowing cases where for some reason jury has been prevented from giving a verdict to be again tried immediately defining presumptive date of valuation in eminent domain proceedings when there has been an earlier mistrial.the matter is thus essentially one of common law.
the fundamental idea of a mistrial is that some error has occurred which is too serious to be corrected,and therefore the trial must be terminated,so that proceedings can begin again.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,a mistrial is the termination of a trial prior to completion,on order of the judge,for error too serious to be corrected.code civ,provision for trial to begin immediately again where jury has been prevented from rendering verdict.
because the core idea of a mistrial is the presence of error that can not be corrected,it is natural that,generally speaking,the standard of review will be abuse of discretion.that is,the trial judge,present on the scene,is obviously the best judge of whether any error was so prejudicial to one of the parties as to warrant scrapping proceedings up to that point.whether a particular incident is incurably prejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter,and the trial court is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions.people haskett cal d,citing illinois somerville,d.
despite the discretionary nature of the decision to declare a mistrial,one can detect in our supreme court jurisprudence a substantive preference against them.that is,the high court has narrowly defined the grounds for grants of mistrials,but has emphasized the deferential abuse of discretion standard in ruling on denials of motions for mistrial a trial court should grant a mistrial only when a party chances of receiving a fair trial have been irreparably damaged,and we use the deferential abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court ruling denying a mistrial.people bolden cal th,d,citing people ayala cal th,d,italics added people silva cal th,d,same words as bolden.after all,a mistrial by definition is a species of prophylactic waste of resources in the name of preventing yet further waste of resources.the decision to declare a mistrial is one that essentially scraps a considerable public investment in the form of judge and maybe juror time,and an equivalent private investment in the form of attorney and witness time the waste is justified in the name of a higher good,namely,the prevention of the further waste of resources at the appellate level where,presumably,the error would be corrected by vacating the judgment and sending the case back for retrial anyway.
the word only,and the phrase chances of receiving a fair trial irreparably damaged in the supreme court formulation express a presumptive and commonsense reluctance to allow the waste of resources that mistrials level of scrutiny perhaps a little higher than the most permissive in the law an analogy might be drawn,in this regard,to the standard of review on trial court decisions to set aside defaults.both grants of set aside motions and denials are still tested under the abuse of discretion standard,but the cases have evolved a somewhat stricter standard for review of denials of set aside motions than grants of them.see elston city of turlock cal d,a trial order denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits brill fox cal,although it is true that courts of appeal have shown great reluctance in cases of this kind to disturb the order of the trial court,it is equally true that denials of such relief by the trial court are scanned more carefully than cases where the trial court has granted the relief,to the end that wherever possible cases may be heard on their merits.rogalski nabers cadillac th,d we will more carefully scrutinize an order denying relief than one which permits a trial on the merits.mink superior court th,d source of quotation in rogalski.
the case before us is unusual in that the reason for the mistrial had nothing to do with prejudice to a party.what is clear from the record of proceedings on november is that husband counsel did move for,ask for,or otherwise expressly desire a mistrial.husband counsel merely wanted to complete her client case by calling her client the matter thus comes to us in the posture of the trial judge declaring a mistrial over the wishes of both parties.the mistrial was declared for reasons peculiar to the trial judge own calendar.
in that regard,we examine the substantive law on that point for further clues as to the appropriate standard of review.there are three such clues,and they all point in the same direction.
first,as a matter of the formal standards of judicial administration,there is a rule that every judge shall hear all matters to which he or she is assigned.cal.stds.judicial administration,std.each judge shall hear all assigned matters unless he or she is disqualified 
second,the administrative rule requiring each judge to hear all assigned matters is,if anything,heightened in family law cases.as regards family law assignments,the legislature has specifically declared that all dissolution actions,to the greatest extent possible,shall be assigned to the same superior court department for all purposes,in order that all decisions in a case through final judgment shall be made by the same judicial officer,subd.a,italics added.while the possible within the greatest extent possible formulation certainly indicates that abuse of discretion is the standard,at the same time the words greatest extent possible suggest a bona fide effort to have the same judge hear all decisions through final judgment.possibility is not some cloak of invisibility that fits any size.
third,if the law is,at least,a little more skeptical than usual about grants of mistrials than denials of them,it must surely must be no less skeptical about grants of mistrials for the convenience of the trial court calendar.that is the implication of the rule of european beverage,superior court th,d.european beverage was an ordinary civil case involving the ownership of a corporation,where the trial was bifurcated so that equitable issues of accounting and constructive trust were tried in phase one of the trial,to the court.but after phase one of the trial was completed and before phase two,involving various tort claims,could begin,the judge was transferred to a master calendar department,apparently starting january.the judge thus announced in that he was no longer available to try the case,and the remaining issues would be transferred to another judge.one party then sought a writ of mandate asking that either the transfer to the new judge be quashed,or that a mistrial be declared.the appellate court granted the writ,reasoning that the party had a common law right to a decision from a judge who had heard all the evidence,not just a portion of it.see european beverage,supra,th at,d,in re sullivan cal,a party litigant is entitled to a decision upon the facts of his case from the judge who hears the evidence he can not be compelled to accept a decision upon the facts from another judge.this common law right is ultimately grounded in the common sense idea that it is a denial of due process for a new judge to render a decision without having heard all of the evidence.in re marriage of colombo d,quoting witkin,cal.procedure.ed.judgment.
now,it is true that,given the nature of the petition for writ in european beverage,the appellate court gave the trial court the choice of vacating the transfer of the case to the new judge or declaring a mistrial.european beverage,supra,th at,d.that is,neither party was so concerned with its investment so far into the case that it argued strongly in favor of keeping the one trial judge on the case.the main fear was that another trial judge who had not heard all the case would be rendering the ultimate judgment.that said,the requirement of having one judge hear all the case has its implications for judicial administration.once trial has begun,it is a waste of resources to step off the case,and it is clear from european beverage that the trial judge new,an administrative one at not postulated to be a compelling reason to have a new judge begin all over again.the same may be said here,except that the interest in prevention of waste is stronger.
in harmony with the formulations by the supreme court in bolden and silva,the rule of judicial administration that every judge shall hear all matters assigned,the preference by the legislature in the family code for one judge to hear a family law matter if possible,and the implications of due process as articulated in european beverage,we conclude that while the appropriate standard of review in this case is abuse of discretion,it is abuse of discretion with elevated scrutiny.
b.the merits 
the matter of time 
the common law rules regarding mistrials were forged in the general context of protecting parties against irreparable prejudice,rather than protecting the trial court own institutional interest in managing its time efficiently.the trial court interest in efficient time management of its own time,at least as regards civil cases,is specifically covered by a rule of court cal.rules of court,rule c,which provides that short cause matters that exceed the allotted time are subject to the discretionary decision of the trial judge to declare a mistrial or complete the trial.
the mechanics of rule go like this first short cause matters are defined as five hours in terms of the time estimated for trial by all parties or the court.cal.rules of court,rule a.next,there is a provision to allow some cases to be considered a short cause and thus exempted from requirements of case management review that would otherwise attach.cal.rules of court,rule b.the final subdivision,subdivision c,shows the teeth of the rule,giving the trial judge discretion to declare a mistrial if the five hour limit is exceeded.the language of this final subdivision unambiguously makes the decision a matter of trial court discretion.if a short cause case is not completely tried within five hours,the judge may declare a mistrial or,in the judge discretion,may complete the trial.in the event of a mistrial,the case will be treated as a long cause case and must promptly be set either for a new trial or for a case management conference.in light of this provision,the rutter group family law practice guide advises litigants to prudently err on the side of overestimating time if there is any doubt,which may mean treating the case as a long cause matter when it might otherwise be short cause.hogoboom and king,cal.practice guide the rutter group,underestimations of time can backfire if a case is set for trial as a short cause is not completed within short cause time limits the judge may declare a mistrial to avoid this scenario,prudence suggests the counsel err on the side of overestimating time whenever in doubt.
there is,however,no equivalent rule of court for long cause matters.the implication surely within the bounds of reason and sound trial court are no arbitrary limits on trial time.we hasten to add,of course,that trial courts retain great power to prevent civil trials from taking more time than necessary,the court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will a necessitate undue consumption of time and thereby wasting public resources on the back end too much time rather than the front via a mistrial 
however,some orange county is not among local rules that specifically provide for the problem of litigants in family law cases giving the trial court trial time estimates in long cause matters that are too short.the superior courts of san diego,santa barbara,and santa clara all have local rules which provide for mistrials based on litigants exceeding their own time estimates however,this court is unaware of any local rule which puts maximum time limits on any given family law case,or,independent of time estimates provided by the parties themselves,otherwise allows the trial judge to declare a mistrial if the trial judge determines that the case has exceeded some deadline imposed by the trial judge.
for our purposes here,the salient fact is that judge pollard did not mention anything about the parties failure to adhere to any time estimate that they had previously given assuming,for sake of argument,that that would even be a valid reason to declare a mistrial in orange county where,in contrast with san diego or santa barbara,there is no rule warning litigants of such a result.at the most there was only an oblique mention of the parties exceeding allotted time,and the only referent for that time was the judge own previously stated friday deadline.as this court observed in abbott mandiola th,footnote,d,a trial,unlike grandmaster chess or the last two minutes of a close football game,should not become a race against the clock.
of course,had the parties agreed on a time estimate and it appeared they were going to take two weeks,the trial judge obviously would have been able to take some corrective action.perhaps that corrective action might even include along the lines of the san diego,santa barbara and santa clara local rules declaring a mistrial but this case involved less than even two days of trial parties did even get a half of a half day that friday only a few hours left to go.
the trial judge also expressed a general dissatisfaction with the amount of time the trial was taking in relationship to the amount at issue in the case,but that of course could not by itself justify a mistrial.surely,we have no rule in california that the rich in their divorces get more time for justice than the poor in theirs.moreover,the trial judge acknowledged that she had been liberal in allowing the parties to make objections,but that also could not justify a mistrial.that only showed an admirable willingness on her part to give each side its day in court.if one party had indeed been making frivolous objections for the sake of delay,that problem could have been handled on its own terms,and in any event it is unfair to penalize both litigants if the judge was too liberal in entertaining objections from one side.and finally,as we have stressed above,the record shows that actual trial time had taken less than two days,which on this record could hardly be held to be objectively excessive.
in sum,there is virtually nothing here involving the time qua time aspect of the decision to justify a mistrial.
the matter of the new assignment 
the main reason which the trial judge gave for declaring a mistrial was her new assignment.beginning the new year,she would handle a calendar in domestic violence.the implication of her comments on the record was that somehow her new assignment handling a domestic violence calendar would preclude her from hearing the last few hours of the blumenthal divorce i not taking it to department for my domestic violence calendar.i have no other choice.i have no other choice.
on the surface,the statement that the trial judge had no other choice but to jettison the case upon going to her new courtroom seems dubious.one could hardly imagine a set of circumstances more conducive to completing a particular trial in a new courtroom or new assignment the judge was literally moving over one courtroom from to in the same building transporting the file would have been easy,and resuming the trial in the new courtroom would have posed no inconvenience to anybody.
going beneath the surface,the trial judge statement implies an assumption which is dubious,or at least not supported by the record,namely that somehow the exigencies of the new domestic violence calendar would have crowded out the compl
