bernard shapiro and cora jane chenchark lived together for years,but they never married.over those years,chenchark cooked,cleaned,and managed their household.when they broke up,she filed a palimony suit against him in state court.while the suit was pending,he died.in the context of this tax refund lawsuit filed by shapiro estate,the district court held that chenchark homemaking services did not,as a matter of law,provide sufficient consideration to support a cohabitation contract between shapiro and chenchark,and that therefore,an estate tax deduction for the value of chenchark claim was properly disallowed.because the district court holding was premised upon a misconstruction of nevada law regarding contracts between cohabitating individuals,we reverse.
background 
shapiro and chenchark met in and began dating shortly thereafter.chenchark moved in with shapiro in.they lived together for the next years,but they never married.during the relationship,chenchark provided homemaking services to shapiro,including cooking,cleaning,and managing the household employees,such as the gardener and housekeeper.shapiro paid for chenchark living expenses and provided her with a weekly spending allowance.chenchark contributed no financial assets to the household.
in,after learning that shapiro was involved with another woman,chenchark sued shapiro in nevada state court,claiming breach of express and implied contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and quantum meruit.according to chenchark complaint,she and shapiro had agreed to pool their resources and to share equally in each others assets.
shapiro died on february,while chenchark action was still pending.shapiro estate filed an estate tax return in may and paid in estate tax and transfer tax.the estate continued to defend against chenchark claim,and in september a jury returned a verdict in favor of the estate,specifically finding that shapiro and chenchark did not enter into any express or implied contract.chenchark appealed,and while the appeal was pending the parties settled chenchark claim,along with another lawsuit in which she contested shapiro will,for approximately million.
in june,some time after settling chenchark claim,the estate filed an amended estate tax return seeking,among other adjustments,to deduct million from the value of the taxable estate under a for chenchark claim.based on the amended return,the estate claimed a refund of approximately million.the irs disallowed any deduction for chenchark claim,and only refunded as result of unrelated adjustments.
in august,the estate brought suit in federal court seeking a refund of approximately million.according to the estate complaint,an expert valued chenchark claim at just over million as of the date of shapiro death.the estate later amended its complaint to include an additional claim for relief,seeking a refund for the decrease in property value due to notices of lis pendens recorded by chenchark on shapiro properties during the pendency of her lawsuit.in its amended complaint,the estate sought a total refund of.
the estate and the united states filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled in favor of the united states,holding that,w ithin the uncontested facts,no evidence exists that chenchark ever contributed anything other than love,support,and management of shapiro household to the relationship.these factors do not provide for sufficient consideration to support a contractual agreement.the district court went on to conclude that,because chenchark did not make sufficient contributions to the estate to provide consideration for the support she received from shapiro,there was no contract between them,and the money she sought in the contract action was,in fact,a gift from shapiro.as a gift,chenchark claim against the estate did not qualify as a deduction under,according to the district court.the court further held that the estate was judicially estopped from arguing that shapiro and chenchark entered an employment agreement of sorts,with chenchark homemaking services as consideration,because the estate had taken the opposite position in defending against chenchark lawsuit.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,to determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the lower court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.fed.trade comm r network servs.depot,cir.
we review the district court application of judicial estoppel for abuse of discretion.abercrombie fitch moose creek,cir.
consideration 
in determining the value of the taxable estate for purposes of calculating the amount of estate tax owed,the tax code allows a deduction for claims against the estate as are allowable by the laws of the jurisdiction under which the estate is being administered.a.in the case of claims against the estate that are founded on a promise or agreement,this deduction is limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.id.c a.
here,the district court concluded as a matter of law that chenchark contributions to the years of cooking,cleaning,and other homemaking not constitute sufficient consideration to allow the estate to deduct her claim against it.the district court did not base its ruling on an application of c a requirement that the underlying promise or agreement be contracted for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth instead,the court rejected the estate deduction for chenchark claim based on an incorrect reading of nevada state law regarding contracts between cohabitating partners.the district court erroneously concluded that chenchark did not have a valid contract claim under western states construction,michoff,because her love,support,and homemaking services did not,as a matter of law,provide sufficient consideration to support a contractual agreement.
in recent decades,widespread social acceptance of nonmarital cohabitation has triggered an expansion of cohabitants legal rights.in marvin marvin,cal,a watershed case concerning such rights,the california supreme court held that courts should enforce express or implied contracts between nonmarital partners except when such a contract is inseparably based upon the provision of sexual services.id.at.a dults who voluntarily live together and engage in sexual relations are nonetheless as competent as any other persons to contract respecting their earnings and property rights t hey may agree to pool their earnings and to hold all property acquired during the relationship in accord with the law governing community property.id.at.
in hay hay,the nevada supreme court adopted marvin holding and ruled that unmarried cohabitants may sue to enforce contracts concerning property rights.id.at.even an implied contract to share property,in which the terms of the agreement are manifested by conduct,rather than stated in words,is enforceable.id.the court reaffirmed the right of cohabitants to contract in western states construction.at.in western states construction,the court affirmed the trial court finding that lois michoff and max michoff impliedly agreed to hold their property as though they were married,based on evidence that the couple filed joint tax returns,designated property as community property in their subchapter s election form,and signed a spousal consent form for a partnership.id.at.
here,the district court compared the facts of chenchark and shapiro relationship to that of lois and max michoff in western states construction,and concluded that chenchark did not make sufficient contributions to the estate to provide consideration for the support that she received from shapiro.because chenchark did not provide sufficient consideration,the court held that chenchark did not have a valid contract claim.but the nevada supreme court in western states construction did not consider the amount or type of consideration necessary to support a contractual agreement between,the court just examined lois and max conduct to determine whether their actions supported the conclusion that they intended to share their property as though married.nothing in western states construction supports the district court conclusion that love,support,and management of a household can not,as a matter of law,constitute consideration for a promise to share property under nevada law.
although the nevada supreme court has not addressed the sufficiency of homemaking services as consideration for a contract to share property,california cases have held that a promise to perform homemaking services is adequate to support such a contract.see,chiba greenwald,d,citing marvin,at whorton dillingham,cal rptr.and under arizona law,which,like nevada and california,recognizes the right of unmarried cohabitants to contract to share property,homemaking services may constitute adequate consideration for such a contract.carroll lee.it makes no difference if the parties exchanged unlike services.id.at.given the nevada supreme court adoption of marvin through hay and western states construction,we think it is likely that nevada would join those california and arizona courts in holding that homemaking services can be adequate consideration for a agreement between cohabitants.we therefore disagree with the district court holding that chenchark did not,as a matter of law,provide sufficient consideration to support a contract under nevada law.
the united states argues that chenchark claim is not deductible because it is not supported by adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.we do not disagree with the government point that,under c a,a claim founded on a promise or agreement,like chenchark claim,is only deductible to the extent it was contracted bona fide and for adequate and full consideration in money or money worth but the district court never reached this specific issue.homemaking services such as those provided by chenchark can be quantified and have a value attached to them.our point is simply that these services are not of zero value as a matter of law,as the district court apparently believed.
this is not to say that,even if a factfinder determines that chenchark claim was supported by adequate and full consideration,the estate is necessarily entitled to the full deduction it seeks.rather,the value of chenchark claim is a factual issue that precludes summary judgment.the value of the claim and the corresponding allowable estate tax deduction remains for the district court to determine on remand.whether her claim was worth million as it was eventually settled for or some other amount is for the district court to decide.under this court precedent,the claim must be valued as of the date of shapiro death.see estate of van horne,cir propstra united states,cir.for this reason,chenchark deposition testimony from this quoted by our dissenting irrelevant to the valuation of her claim.chenchark statements were not made until,more than seven years after shapiro death.all that was known at the time of shapiro death was that chenchark had asserted a plausible claim under nevada law.
judicial estoppel 
in addition to holding that the estate could not deduct any amount for chenchark claim because of the lack of consideration,the district court also held that judicial estoppel prohibited the estate from arguing that chenchark homemaking services provided consideration for the alleged agreement between shapiro and chenchark to share equally in each others property.the district court specifically held 
the application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case.the estate is barred from taking inconsistent positions in accordance with the doctrine of judicial estoppel.it can not the value of the suit against it.the value is what it paid for suit in settlement,and no more.
the estate positions in defending against chenchark lawsuit were not inconsistent with any positions it took before the district court in this case.see yanez united states.the estate consistently took the position that a contract claim had in fact been asserted against it,a fact that no one denies.the estate was within its rights to deduct the value of the claim without waiving the right to contest the validity of the claim in state court.reg.b an item may be entered on the return for deduction though its exact amount is not then known,provided it is ascertainable with reasonable certainty,and will be paid.
notices of lis pendens 
in granting the united states motion for summary judgment,the district court did not address the estate claim that it was entitled to a refund as a result of the reduction in property value caused by the notices of lis pendens filed by chenchark on a number of shapiro properties.but it entered judgment against the estate on this claim,along with the rest of the case.on appeal,the estate argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this claim because it was not addressed in the summary judgment motions.
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the estate claim for a refund related to the notices of lis pendens.the estate abandoned this claim by failing to raise it in opposition to the united states motion for complete summary judgment.see shakur schriro,cir we have previously held that a plaintiff has abandoned claims by not raising them in opposition to the defendant motion for summary judgment.quoting jenkins cnty.of riverside,cir.
administrative expenses 
as with the estate claim for a refund related to the notices of lis pendens,the district court did not address the estate claim for a deduction of administrative expenses under a i.also like the lis pendens claim,the estate failed to raise this issue in opposition to the united states motion for summary judgment.but the united states noted in its answering brief that it has no objection to a remand to allow the district court to address the deductibility of administrative expenses.therefore we instruct the district court to address this issue on remand.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on the estate claim that it is entitled to deduct the value of chenchark claim affirm summary judgment on the estate claim for a refund arising out of the notices of lis pendens recorded on shapiro properties by chenchark and remand.
each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.
i agree with the majority disposition of the lis pendens and administrative expenses issues.i therefore concur in parts and of the majority opinion.see op.at.i disagree,however,with the majority analysis and disposition of the primary issue in this appeal,the valuation of the chenchark claim for federal estate tax purposes.i therefore respectfully dissent from part of the majority opinion see op.at.
the majority reverses the district court because its holding was premised upon a misconstruction of nevada law regarding contracts between cohabiting individuals op.at.this case,however,does not turn on issues of state contract law,but on federal tax law,and the estate has raised no genuine issue of material fact as to whether it has met the requirement of the relevant estate tax provision,that the claim underlying its deduction be supported by full consideration in money worth 
the estate tax issue in this case is governed by.although the majority is correct that a allows a deduction for claims against the estate as are allowable by the laws of the jurisdiction under which the estate is being administered,op.at,a valid state law claim is a necessary condition for the deduction,but not necessarily a sufficient one.section also requires that,to be deductible,claims founded on a promise or agreement be limited to the extent that they were contracted for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.c a this requirement is not satisfied merely because a claim is legally binding and enforceable against an estate under state law.taft comm r,see also united states stapf,a deduction for a claim against an estate should not be predicated solely on the finding that a promise or claim is legally enforceable under the state laws governing the validity of contracts and wills.we have gone s
