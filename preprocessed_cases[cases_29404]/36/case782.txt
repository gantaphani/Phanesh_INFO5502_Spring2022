background 
originally came to the attention of riverside county department of public social services dpss in when he was four years old,along with his then year old sister,when mother was arrested on a federal warrant for drug charges following a sweep by law enforcement.a dependency petition was filed alleging neglect and failure to protect due to mother incarceration,along with her history of drug use and mental illness,subd.b,as well as alleging her inability to provide for the children due to her incarceration,and the unknown whereabouts of the fathers of the children after locating and assessing the home of father,the minor was detained in that home on may.on june,at the jurisdiction hearing,was declared a dependent on all the allegations pertaining to mother and was placed with his father with maintenance services.reunification services were ordered for mother.
at the status review hearing held on april,subd.e,the court awarded sole legal and physical custody of to his father,with directions to dismiss the dependency upon the filing of family law orders.however,the following month,dpss filed a reactivated petition when it was learned had been beaten by his father with a belt,leaving welts.the reactivated petition alleged physical abuse by father,subd.a,as well as neglect and failure to protect or provide necessities by both mother and father,subd.b,and an allegation that mother had left the minor without any provision for support,subd.g.the petition also included an allegation under section,subdivision b that the parents have a history with child protective services but failed to benefit from services.
the minor was detained in the home where his older sister was placed.mother informed the social worker that she wanted her aunt considered for relative placement,and indicated that there were no other relatives to consider.however,that aunt had been assessed previously by the relative assessment unit,and her home had been found to be inappropriate for placement 
on september,the juvenile court conducted the combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing.as to the allegations against both parents,the court made true findings that was a child who came within the provisions of section,subdivisions a,b,and g the court then made findings under section,subdivision c and as to mother,and made findings under section,subdivision c as to,before removing custody from both parents.as to mother,no services were ordered because she was in prison for five years,subd.e.
on september,the court conducted the month status review hearing,subd.f the court terminated father reunification services and scheduled a hearing pursuant to section.at the hearing,mother counsel informed the court that was with someone mother approved of,and that she was submitting on the matter being set for a hearing pursuant to section.nevertheless,after the hearing,mother filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition on october.the petition was dismissed on december,for failing to file a writ petition.cal.rules of court,rule c.
on january,mother filed a petition to modify a prior order by way of a jv form for a request to change court order.in support of the petition,mother asserted the existence of changed circumstances,referring to several programs mother had completed while incarcerated.on january,the court continued the section hearing,and conducted a review hearing.in connection with that hearing,mother counsel signed a stipulation re post permanency planning hearing and order on her behalf.among other matters,the stipulation agreed that the extent of mother progress towards alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement has been none.
on april,the court denied mother petition for modification.the court then conducted the section hearing to select and implement the permanent plan of adoption.the mother was present at the hearing,and objected to the proposed termination of parental rights,but did not testify.mother counsel argued in support of mother request for selection of a permanent plan of guardianship.specifically,mother relied on the beneficial relationship,subd.c b ii,and the sibling relationship,subd.c b v exceptions to adoptability.the court found the minor was adoptable and that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to him.the court then terminated parental rights of both parents.on june,mother appealed from the judgment terminating parental rights.
discussion 
the juvenile court was not required to consider placing with mother where she was not a nonoffending parent pursuant to section,subdivision c,and where custody had previously been removed upon a finding of risk which had not been alleviated.
mother asserts that when was initially removed from his father custody at the proceedings on the reactivated dependency petition,she became the nonoffending noncustodial parent entitled to custody,who was able to arrange for care of the minor by family members.she thus asserts that the court failure to consider placement of in her custody,pursuant to section,violated her constitutional rights.she asserts the error is a pure issue of law which may be raised for the first time on appeal despite the failure to challenge the error following the disposition order respecting the reactivated petition.we disagree.
there are three problems with mother argument.first,mother forfeited the issue because she did not request custody at the disposition hearing on the reactivated petition.second,mother was neither a nonoffending nor noncustodial parent where allegations of neglect and failure to protect were made against mother in the reactivated petition,subd.c,and the juvenile court had previously removed custody from her based on a finding of detriment,precluding any consideration for placement pursuant to section.third,because dpss had investigated the only relative suggested by the incarcerated mother whose sentence was then calculated to expire in,and had previously determined that the home was inappropriate,the court was not required to engage in the futile act of considering placing the minor in mother custody.
general legal principles 
section,subdivision a,provides in part that when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.the section goes on to provide that if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a.
the term custody as used in section,refers to the parent right to make decisions pertaining to the child and to have legal possession of the child.in re austin th.placement refers to the address where the child shall live during the dependency proceeding.id.at.thus,under section,subdivision a,the court examines whether it would be detrimental to temporarily place a child with the nonoffending noncustodial parent under subdivision b,the court decides whether that placement should be permanent and whether the court jurisdiction should be terminated.austin,at.
in enacting subdivisions a and b of section,the legislature envisioned a process under subdivision a,the court examines whether it would be detrimental to temporarily place a child with the nonoffending noncustodial parent under subdivision b,the court decides whether that placement should become permanent and whether the court jurisdiction should be terminated.in re austin,supra,th at.where the noncustodial parent does not seek custody,there is no need to address any risk that might arise from placement with him or her.in re terry th.
a nonoffending parent has a constitutionally protected interest in assuming physical custody,as well as a statutory right to do so,in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the parent choices will be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.in re isayah th,citing.
forfeiture 
it is the noncustodial parent request for custody that triggers application of section,subdivision a where the noncustodial parent makes no such request,the statute is not applicable.in re th,superior court th.failure to object to noncompliance with section in the lower court results in forfeiture.in re sabrina th.here,mother did not challenge the jurisdictional allegations against her,and,most importantly,she did not request custody of at the time of the disposition,so the court did not commit any technical violation of section.by failing to request custody,mother forfeited the right to be considered for placement as a noncustodial parent.
further,even if the error could be considered a substantive constitutional violation,as opposed to procedural error see in re wilford th,challenges based on procedural defects or erroneous rulings subject to forfeiture rule,mother failure to object or challenge the failure to consider placement pursuant to section,despite two opportunities to raise the issue in this court on appeal from the disposition hearing on the reactivated petition,and by way of writ following the setting of the section hearing,forfeited any constitutional challenge.yakus united states.a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it in re sheena cal th,constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion.
cloaking the issue in terms of constitutional error does not preserve the issue.
mother was neither nonoffending nor noncustodial,within the meaning of sections,subdivision c,and 
even if the issue is not deemed forfeited,we would not find error because a mother was the subject of a jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision b in the current dependency proceeding,which meant she was not a nonoffending parent within the meaning of section,subdivision c and b the court previous removal order upon a finding of detriment in the prior dependency precluded the court from considering placement with her.
an incarcerated parent has the same right as other parents to be given the opportunity to request custody under section.in re,supra,th at.among the factors in determining detriment are the noncustodial incarcerated parent ability to make appropriate arrangements for the care of the child and the length of that parent incarceration.id.at.if an incarcerated parent can make suitable arrangements for a child care during his or her incarceration,the juvenile court has no basis to take jurisdiction in the case,under section,subdivision g.in re isayah,supra,th at.however,mother was not the type of noncustodial parent for which section was intended to apply where the current jurisdictional finding was made under section,subdivision b,as well as section,subdivision g,and she had previously lost custody due to removal in the earlier dependency upon a finding of detriment.
mother relies heavily on the opinion in in re,supra,th.in that case,the father was a noncustodial parent who was incarcerated at the time the child came into the dependency system as a result of mother neglect and drug use.the only allegation of the petition naming father was one made under section,subdivision g,relating to his incarceration and inability to arrange adequate care for the children.in re,at.at the disposition hearing,custody was removed from both parents pursuant to section,subdivision c,and father was denied services due to his incarceration.in re,at.
on appeal,father argued that because the dependency petition was based only on the conduct of the children mother,he should have been treated as the nonoffending parent and allowed to retain custody of the children under section,subdivision c.in re,supra,th at.the reviewing court agreed,holding that because father was not the custodial parent,the court should have considered the case under section.in re,at.
the present case is distinguishable from in re,supra,where the allegations against mother were not limited to an allegation that mother was incarcerated and unable to arrange the care of the minor.instead,the court made true findings as to two allegations against mother under section,subdivision b.while an incarcerated parent can avoid jurisdiction under section,subdivision g by arranging for his or her child care in re isayah,supra,th at in re aaron d,the same is not true of a parent whose acts or omissions have led to jurisdictional findings under section,subdivision b.the holding of in re does not extend to incarcerated parents who have been the subject of a true finding on any jurisdictional ground other than section,subdivision g.
this case is distinguishable from in re for another reason the juvenile court had previously removed from mother custody in the original dependency proceeding upon a finding of substantial risk of harm,subd.c,and had not subsequently restored custody to her.under section,subdivision a,a finding of detriment precludes placement of a dependent minor with a noncustodial parent.in our view,mother status as a noncustodial parent due to the prior finding of detriment and an involuntary removal order in the original dependency,as well as the court section,subdivision b findings against her in the current dependency,made her ineligible for consideration for placement with her under section.we explain.
section comes into play after a child has been removed from the physical custody of his or her parents under section,subdivision c.subparagraph of section,subdivision c,requires the court to consider allowing a nonoffending parent to retain physical custody so long as that parent or guardian presents a plan acceptable to the court demonstrating that he or she will be able to protect the child from future harm.we interpret the phrase retain physical custody to mean that the parent seeking temporary placement of the child under section must not have suffered a previous loss of custody of the child by a juvenile court order of removal after a finding of detriment.
reading section in light of section,subdivision c,the parent must be both nonoffending and noncustodial parent in order to be entitled for consideration under section,that is,the parent must retain the right to physical custody,and must not have been the subject of a previous detriment finding and removal.in this respect,we disagree with the reviewing court comments in footnote of in re,supra,th at page.in that footnote,the court commented on the fact that reviewing courts have used the phrase nonoffending noncustodial parent as shorthand for a parent with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section.the court goes on to explain that a lthough the phrase nonoffending parent appears in section,subdivision c,it does not appear in the text of section.we believe the better shorthand phrase is simply noncustodial parent.citation.
