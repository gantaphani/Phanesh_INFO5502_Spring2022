defendant annette sweeney sweeney appeals from an order committing her to porterville state hospital pursuant to welfare and institutions code section sweeney was committed for the statutory period of one year after a jury found that she was mentally retarded and dangerous.sweeney makes four contentions the trial court violated her rights to due process and equal protection the trial court violated her right to confront witnesses against her the trial court improperly instructed the jury and the trial court denied her a fair placement hearing by denying her request for a continuance.we agree that the trial court violated sweeney due process rights and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury.we disagree with sweeney contentions regarding equal protection and confrontation.we do not address sweeney argument concerning her request for a continuance.
we note that the maximum period of confinement has expired.therefore,this case is technically moot.we have not been asked to dismiss the appeal on these grounds.the issues addressed in this appeal are of continuing public importance,and such orders will typically expire before an appeal can be heard and thus will evade review.therefore,we will address the issues presented by sweeney however,we dismiss the appeal as moot see conservatorship of david th,d.

discussion 
due process and equal protection.background 
section authorizes a mentally retarded person to be committed to the department of developmental services if he or she is a danger to himself or herself,or others.the definition of dangerous to self or others includes,but is not limited to,a finding of incompetence to stand trial if the defendant has been charged with a felony involving death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.
during pretrial motions,the district attorney argued that sweeney met the definition of dangerous because she had been found incompetent to stand trial,and she had been charged with two felonies that involved great bodily injury or an act which posed a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.sweeney trial attorney argued that the jury should determine whether the charges against sweeney involved death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.welf.the district attorney asserted that such a determination involved a question of law,not fact,and therefore the court should decide whether the charges against sweeney involved violence or a threat of violence.the district attorney contended two charges,willfully and unlawfully using force and violence and inflicting injury upon a peace officer,subd.c,and willfully and unlawfully attempting by means of threats and violence to deter and prevent an executive officer from performing his duties,qualified as charges involving great bodily injury,or a serious threat of bodily harm.
the trial court concluded that the determination of whether a charge involved violence or a threat of violence is a question of law.the court concluded that the penal code section,subdivision c,charge and the penal code section charge met the offense criteria of welfare and institutions code section.
at the hearing on the petition,the district attorney presented the jury with evidence of sweeney dangerous behavior,and argued that sweeney was a danger to herself and to others.
discussion 
a due process 
in an argument that is entwined with her equal protection contention,sweeney asserts that her due process rights were violated when the trial court determined that the charges pending against her involved death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.we agree with sweeney.
in order to commit a person pursuant to section,it must be proven that the person is mentally retarded is dangerous to himself or others and has serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior because of his mental retardation a person can be considered dangerous to himself or others if the person was found mentally incompetent to stand trial on felony charges that involve death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.accordingly,sweeney argument is focused on the element of dangerous to himself or others,and more specifically on the portion of the definition of dangerous that addresses the predicate offense.the essential question posed by sweeney argument is does the court or jury decide if the predicate offense charge involves death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.
the principles governing the resolution of this issue are discussed in people figueroa cal d,figueroa,and people hedgecock cal d,hedgecock in figueroa,the defendant was convicted of selling unqualified securities,in violation of corporations code section.figueroa,at.our supreme court concluded that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that certain corporation promissory notes were securities within the meaning of the law,because the trial court improperly removed an element of the crime from the jury consideration.id.at.the supreme court observed that cases which held that the question of what constitutes a security is a question of law,reserved for the trial court,could not withstand scrutiny under more modern concepts of due process and the right to a jury trial.id.at.the court concluded that due process required the jury,not the court,to find every element of the offense.id.at.
in hedgecock,the court explained figueroa did not abrogate the distinction in determining whether issues should be submitted to the jury.it did suggest,however,that this distinction plays a relatively limited role in view of a defendant constitutional right to have a jury determine the existence of all elements of the offense charged.hedgecock,supra,cal d at.thus,the critical question here is is the violent or assaultive nature of the felony charge an element that must be proven in section commitment proceedings see hedgecock,at.if it is an element,then it matters not whether the issue in question is one of fact or law.due process requires that it be submitted to the jury.people wilkins th,d.
being a danger to himself or herself or to others is an element of section.the definition of dangerous to self or others,in section,includes being charged with a violent or assaultive felony,and being found incompetent to stand trial on that felony charge.accordingly,to the extent a petitioner relies on this definition in proving the element of dangerous to self or others,the violent or assaultive nature of the felony constitutes a of section.in other words,if a trial court were to conclude that a felony charge involves death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person then the only issue left for the jury to determine on the issue of dangerousness is whether the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial on that charge.in effect,the trial court would be determining one portion of the element of dangerousness,which is problematic because no element of the verdict,even an undisputed element,may be determined by the judge.figueroa,supra,cal d at.
a judge duty is to instruct the jury on the definition of dangerous to self or others,and then allow the jury to determine if the defendant meets the criteria.see figueroa,supra,cal d at.for example,part of the definition of sexually violent predator svp is that the person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense,subd.a.the jury instruction for svp commitment proceedings requires the jury to determine if the person has been convicted of committing sexually violent offenses against one or more victims.calcrim.in section proceedings,if the petitioner relies on the definition of dangerousness that entails a finding of incompetence to stand trial on a felony charge that involves violent or assaultive behavior,then the jury should be instructed to determine if the person has been charged with a felony involving death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.
in sum,we conclude the trial court erred when it decided that two of the felony charges pending against sweeney involved death,great bodily injury,or an act which poses a serious threat of bodily harm to another person,because that is a determination that should be made by a jury.we decline to determine whether the trial court error was harmless,because we will dismiss the appeal as moot.
in sweeney argument she contends that the jury determination of whether the felony charges pending against her involved violent or assaultive behavior should have occurred in a kind of prima facie hearing.it is unclear why sweeney is asserting that the jury determination should be made in a pretrial hearing,rather than during the commitment hearing.we conclude that the determination should be made by the jury during the commitment hearing,since it is part of the element of dangerousness,which must be found by the jury at the commitment proceeding.
b equal protection 
sweeney contends that section violates equal protection principles because mentally retarded people are treated differently than mentally ill people.the specific disparity complained of by sweeney is that mentally ill people can have a jury determine the facts of the predicate offenses listed in their commitment petitions at jury trials however,incompetent mentally retarded people are not afforded jury hearings regarding their predicate offenses.
we assume sweeney would concede that section does not violate equal protection,now that we have concluded that due process requires a jury to determine whether the felony offense listed in the commitment petition involves death,great bodily injury,or an act which posed a serious threat of bodily harm to another person.nevertheless,to the extent sweeney is arguing that mentally retarded people are treated differently than the mentally ill,because mentally ill people receive a jury determination on their predicate offense prior to their commitment proceedings,we disagree.
to demonstrate a denial of equal protection,it must first be shown that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.citation.people goslar th,d.
if it is determined that the law treats similarly situated groups different,a second level of analysis is required.if the law in question impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right,it is subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is necessary to further a compelling state interest.people goslar,supra,th at,d.
sweeney was not given a jury determination regarding her predicate felony offenses prior to her commitment proceedings because she was found incompetent.accordingly,when determining whether welfare and institutions code section violates equal protection for purposes of civilly committing people who were not given a jury determination regarding their predicate offenses,we must compare mentally retarded people who have been found incompetent,with mentally ill people who have been found incompetent,because those groups are similarly situated.see conservatorship of hofferber cal d,mentally ill people against whom a judicial determination of criminal conduct has been made are classified separately from those not adjudicated under the criminal justice system see also in re banks d.separating mentally ill people who have been convicted from mentally ill people who are incompetent.
next,we determine if the two groups are treated differently.first we examine the commitment procedures for incompetent mentally ill defendants.when a person is found to be mentally incompetent,then the criminal proceedings against that person must be suspended.when the proceedings are suspended,the person can not be tried or convicted,and the person may be committed for a maximum of three years,subd.a,subd.c.after the commitment period has expired,if the defendant appears to be gravely disabled then conservatorship proceedings must be initiated,subd.c.g ravely disabled means the defendant has been found mentally incompetent the defendant has a felony information or indictment pending against him that alleges an offense involving death,great bodily harm,or a serious threat to the physical of another person and as a result of a mental disorder,the defendant is unable to understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings against him.welf,subd.h b,subd.c.if a person is found to meet this definition of gravely disabled,then the person may be placed in a state hospital or other state licensed facility.welf,subd.a b.
in the foregoing statutory scheme,a gravely disabled person is not given a jury determination regarding his predicate offense prior to the conservatorship proceedings that will lead to the person being housed in a state facility,because the person has been found incompetent and the criminal proceedings were suspended.mentally retarded people who have been found incompetent are treated similarly.
section provides that if a jury determines a person is a danger and is mentally retarded,then the person may be committed to the department of developmental services for one year.in this statute,mentally retarded people,who are incompetent,are not given a jury hearing regarding their predicate offenses prior to their commitment proceedings because of their incompetence,which is the same as gravely disabled people who do not receive a jury hearing prior to conservatorship proceedings,which will lead to them being housed in a state facility.see conservatorship of susan cal th,d,conservatorship proceedings and commitment proceedings are similar.consequently,we conclude there is no disparate treatment between the two groups.due to our conclusion that the groups are not treated differently,we do not reach the strict scrutiny analysis.see in re smith cal th,d,strict scrutiny is applied to equal protection claims involving civil commitment proceedings.
in both her opening and reply briefs,sweeney essentially argues that mentally retarded people are similarly situated to people subject to commitment in svp proceedings welf,mentally disordered offender mdo proceedings,and not guilty by reason of insanity ngi proceedings,and that mentally retarded people are treated differently because they are not given a jury determination regarding their predicate offenses.svp,mdo,and ngi commitment proceedings all follow convictions at criminal trials because the defendants were competent to stand trial.welf,subd.a svp,subd.a mdo,subd.a ngi.
in in re banks this court noted that people who have been found to be incompetent are not similarly situated to people who have been found guilty of criminal acts.in re banks,supra,d at.accordingly,sweeney argument that incompetent people who are subject to section should be given a pretrial hearing similar to the criminal trials that precede svp,mdo,and ngi commitment proceedings only achieves a specious viability.the proper comparison is between criminally charged mentally ill people who are incompetent to stand trial,and criminally charged mentally retarded people who are incompeten
