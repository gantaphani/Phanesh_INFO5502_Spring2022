procedural and factual background 
in july alicia gave birth to christopher,her sixth child she admitted methamphetamine use the week before and the day before delivery.alicia tested positive for methamphetamine,and christopher tested positive for ethanol alcohol.
on july hhsa filed a petition on christopher behalf,alleging alicia substance abuse rendered her unable to provide regular care for him and put him at substantial risk of harm,subd.b.
alicia told a social worker that she had indian ancestry through her mother,who was registered with a tribe in butte,montana.alicia did not have any other information about the tribe or affiliation.at the detention hearing,the court ordered hhsa to notify the blackfeet and cherokee tribes.
alicia also told a social worker that she wanted christopher placed with susan,who also requested the placement.on august hhsa initiated an evaluation of susan for possible placement of christopher with her.susan was listed twice as a suspect on the state child abuse index,which prompted hhsa to undertake a detailed review of its child protective services records regarding susan.susan had eight referrals involving her own children,one of which was substantiated susan also had seven referrals involving her care of her grandchildren see fn,ante,one of which was substantiated for general neglect.in that incident,susan granddaughter was in the bathtub,found a razor and attempted to shave her legs the granddaughter cut herself and was treated at the hospital.the social worker reported that susan did not meet the placement requirements because she had a previous substantiated case with child protective services.
on september alicia appeared with counsel at the jurisdiction hearing,which susan also attended.the court found the indian tribes had been given appropriate notice of the proceedings and that the icwa did not apply alicia asked for a trial.
on october susan telephoned the social worker and left a voice mail message,stating she was going to end her efforts to have christopher placed with her.a transcript of the message read in part this is the hardest thing i ever had to do,i really wanted this baby but i think you were right,the best thing for him would be to go with the family that adopted the twins.
the contested hearing took place on november.after the court made a true finding on christopher petition,the court took judicial notice of the findings and orders in the dependency case files of his siblings.social worker carmen gibson testified that susan was not an appropriate placement because of her child protective services history with her own children and the substantiated referral regarding the shaving incident.gibson considered susan voice mail message on october in forming her opinion.gibson did not receive any other communications from susan about christopher placement after october.gibson already had decided to recommend against placing christopher with susan before she received the october message.
in her testimony,susan acknowledged her october voice mail message,but said she now wanted christopher to be placed with her.susan said that sometime after october she left the social worker a message requesting that christopher be placed with her.susan testified she left the october voice mail message because an hhsa supervisor had told her that if she continued with her efforts to have christopher placed with her,hhsa would remove her other three grandchildren from her home.susan explained she had received a telephone call from a female supervisor about two days before october,but she did not know the supervisor name susan felt threatened by the supervisor call.
susan also testified about the shaving incident involving her granddaughter,explaining that she had just moved that day and that her granddaughter found a razor on the bathroom windowsill.susan had not seen the razor on the windowsill.when she discovered that her granddaughter had injured herself,susan immediately telephoned the social worker and took her granddaughter to the emergency room.
susan spent purchasing items for a nursery for christopher.
in rebuttal,social worker gibson testified she never threatened susan about anything in this case and specifically,that she never telephoned susan,her mother or alicia threatening to remove the guardianship children.gibson had no knowledge that her supervisor,michael weinrick,or any other hhsa supervisor,had contacted susan about christopher placement.to have christopher placed with susan would have required the approval of a section chief because of susan substantiated referral.gibson did not request such a waiver because a request would indicate that she favored placing christopher with susan and believed it would be a good placement.gibson did not believe this would be a good placement for christopher.
the court declared christopher a dependent,removed him from parental custody,placed him in licensed care,ordered that no reunification services be provided to alicia pursuant to section,subdivision b,and set a section hearing.in choosing not to place christopher with susan,the court noted it was disturbing that susan had not visited christopher for more than two months,and it was in christopher best interests to remain in his current placement,a safe place where he had been for four months.the court also did not believe that susan had received a threatening telephone call from an hhsa supervisor.
discussion 
placement of christopher 
alicia contends the court erred by not placing christopher with susan.the contention is without merit.
when a child is removed from his or her parents custody under section,the juvenile court places the care,custody,control,and conduct of the child under the social worker supervision,subd.e.the social worker may place the child in several locations,including the approved home of a relative,subds.e.relatives who request placement of a dependent child are given preferential consideration,subd.a.in determining whether to place the child with the requesting relative,the court and social worker consider the factors enumerated in section,subdivision a the linchpin of a section analysis is whether placement with a relative is in the best interests of the minor.in re stephanie cal th,d.
we review a juvenile court custody placement orders under the abuse of discretion standard of review the court is given wide discretion and its determination will not be disturbed absent a manifest showing of abuse.in re luke th,d in re sarah th,d in re robert th,d.broad deference must be shown to the trial judge.the reviewing court should interfere only if we find that under all the evidence,viewed most favorably in support of the trial court action,no judge could reasonably have made the order that he did.citations.citation.in re robert,supra,th at,d.
as christopher grandmother,susan was eligible for preferential consideration as a relative placement under section.however,preferential consideration under section does not create an evidentiary presumption in favor of a relative,but merely places the relative at the head of the line when the court is determining which placement is in the child best interests.in re sarah,supra,th at,d.in other words,when a child is taken from his parents care and requires placement outside the home,section assures an interested relative that his or her application for placement will be considered before a stranger request.id.at,d see also,subd.c,which states for purposes of this section p referential
