factual and procedural history 
discussion 
tyrone and corinna claim the juvenile court committed reversible error by failing to apply the provisions of the act.both parents argue the record fails to reflect that dss made inquiry into the possible indian status of the minor and notified the proper parties of the pending dependency proceedings.according to both parents,the court was required to conduct the section hearing in accordance with the act.
in,congress passed the act,which is designed to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of indian children from their families and placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture,and by providing for assistance to indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.mississippi choctaw holyfield,d.
to effectuate the purpose of the act,child custody proceeding s involving,among other proceedings,the termination of parental rights to an indian child,are subject to special federal procedures.i iv.termination of parental rights means any action resulting in the termination of the relationship.ii.
among the procedural safeguards imposed by the act is the provision of notice to various parties.section a provides as follows in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or indian custodian and the tribe.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary italics added.
when this notice provision is violated,an indian child,parent,indian custodian,or the indian child tribe may petition the court to invalidate the proceeding.
a major purpose of the act is to protect indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an indian tribe.for purposes of the act,indian child means any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.
in support of their claims,tyrone and corinna rely in part on in re kahlen d.kahlen.in that case,the court stated notice is a key component of the congressional goal to protect and preserve indian tribes and indian families.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under the act irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.specifically,the tribe has the right to obtain jurisdiction over the proceedings by transfer to the tribal court or may intervene in the state court proceedings.without notice,these important rights granted by the act would become meaningless.id.at.
in kahlen,supra,a social services employee spoke with three different groups of miwok indians,attempting to determine the minor status.in granting the writ sought by the mother of the minor,the appellate court held the department had failed to notify the tribe of its right to intervene in the proceedings as required by the act.d at.
the court rejected the department contention that the record showed substantial compliance with the notice provisions of the act.it noted that all pertinent authority plainly required actual notice to the tribe of both the proceedings and of the right to intervene.kahlen,supra,d at,emphasis omitted.mere awareness of the proceedings is not sufficient under the act.id.at.
kahlen,supra,emphasized notice is mandatory,and that ordinarily failure in the juvenile court to secure compliance with the act notice provisions is prejudicial error.the only exceptions lie in situations where the tribe has participated in the proceedings or expressly indicated it has no interest in the proceedings.d at.but see in re junious d,fn.
the kahlen court rejected a suggestion by the department that its noncompliance with the notice provisions of the act was a result of the mother failure to cooperate by not providing the department with the roll number and by not timely communicating her ancestry.d at.as the court pointed out,the act is intended to protect the interests of the tribe as well as those of the minor parents.id.at.moreover,the minor is entitled to the protection of the act irrespective of the actions of the parents.ibid.finally,the court rejected the claim that by her silence the mother waived her rights under the act.ibid.
california rules of court,rule f further references to rules are to the california rules of court,provides in part notice shall be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian or the tribe can not be determined,notice shall be sent to the specified office of the secretary of the interior,which has days to provide notice as required.notice shall be sent whenever there is reason to believe the child may be an indian child,and for every hearing thereafter unless and until it is determined that the child is not an indian child.
rule g provides in part determination of tribal membership or eligibility for membership is made exclusively by the tribe.a tribe determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.
in this case,at the outset of the proceedings dss obtained information that there was indian heritage in the families of tyrone and corinna.tyrone reported that the minor was of cherokee indian ancestry.while subsequent reports and comments in the record suggest the juvenile court and parties were aware of the issue,there is no indication that notice was sent to any cherokee tribe,or to the bureau of indian affairs bia.
the act requires dss to notify the indian child tribe of the proceedings if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved.a.here,the court had reason to know the minor was an indian child of cherokee heritage.the act continues if the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the bia ibid.
the federal register lists the recognized indian entities.that list contains three cherokee entities.those entities are the cherokee nation of oklahoma,the eastern band of cherokee indians of north carolina,and the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians of oklahoma.
this court recently held neither the act nor the various rules,regulations,and case law interpreting it requires a child ser
