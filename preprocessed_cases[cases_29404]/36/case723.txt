discussion 
sufficiency of findings under section,subdivision b 
father argues that insufficient evidence supports the jurisdictional findings against him because his history of domestic violence did not pose a current risk of harm to john because john was never actually at risk of harm by father past conduct john was not present when father beat mother the july incident was isolated and had occurred over a year earlier john reported that both of his parents were very nice john was not a toddler at the time of the hearing,and thus less at risk if he were present during violence between mother and father and mother,whose location was unknown,could not fight with father and thus there was no longer a risk of domestic violence proximate to john.
at the jurisdictional hearing,the dependency court finding that a child is a person described in section must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,subd.a cynthia superior court cal th.we review the dependency court jurisdictional findings for substantial evidence,and review the evidence in the light most favorable to the dependency court findings and draw all reasonable inferences in support of those findings.elijah superior court th.section,subdivision b provides a basis for jurisdiction if the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness caused by the parent inability to provide regular care for the child because of the parent mental illness,developmental disability or substance abuse.in re james th.
a jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision b requires neglectful conduct by the parent in one of the specified forms causation and serious physical harm or illness to the minor,or a substantial risk of such harm or illness.in re rocco th.subdivision b means what it says.before courts and agencies can exert jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,there must be evidence indicating that the child is exposed to a substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness.id.at in re alysha th.
in evaluating risk based upon a single episode of endangering conduct,a juvenile court should consider the nature of the conduct and all surrounding circumstances.it should also consider the present circumstances,which might include,among other things,evidence of the parent current understanding of and attitude toward the past conduct that endangered a child,or participation in educational programs,or other steps taken,by the parent to address the problematic conduct in the interim,and probationary support and supervision already being provided through the criminal courts that would help a parent avoid a recurrence of such an incident.the nature and circumstances of a single incident of harmful or potentially harmful conduct may be sufficient,in a particular case,to establish current risk depending upon present circumstances.in re th.we must have a basis to conclude there is a substantial risk the parent endangering behavior will recur.id.at.
we disagree with father analysis.the parents history of domestic violence evidences an ongoing pattern that,while not yet causing harm to john,presented a very real risk to john physical and emotional health.both parents hit each other verbal altercations were frequent and father engaged in reckless driving with mother in the car.the fact that mother location is not known does not reduce the risk to john because father could engage in angry and violent behavior toward john without mother being present.john age would do little to protect him from father violent outbursts.finally,the severity of the july incident is not lessened by the fact it was isolated and in the past indeed,father was incarcerated for his conduct during that incident that resulted in mother injury.
ii.placement with father as noncustodial parent 
father argues that the dependency court,which proceeded under section in removing john from his custody,erred in failing to apply section because although father was incarcerated at the time,he could have arranged for anna to look after john until father was released from prison.father contends section,which does not explicitly limit its reach to nonoffending parents,therefore provides a noncustodial parent is entitled to placement consideration without regard to whether such parent is offending or nonoffending.conceding that he did not raise the possibility of john placement with him pursuant to section in the dependency court,father argues the issue was nonetheless not forfeited.
forfeiture 
at the outset,a parent failure to raise placement under section in the dependency court forfeits the issue.see,in re th.father did not raise the issue at any of the scheduled and continued jurisdictional and dispositional hearings,thereby forfeiting the issue under in re,at page.nonetheless,father argues the issue was not waived because the claim presents a pure question of fact that can be decided on undisputed facts,citing in re th.further,father asserts that nothing in section requires the parent to raise the issue to be considered for custody,instead the statute directs the court to consider whether there is a noncustodial parent desiring custody.finally,because the trial court used the wrong statutory framework in making findings under section,his trial counsel could not lodge reasonable objections.
we find some merit to father contention that the statutory language,which commands the court to consider a noncustodial parent for placement,precludes forfeiture by the failure to raise the issue in the dependency court.however,the purpose of the forfeiture doctrine is to avoid the situation in which father acknowledges he finds himself here bereft of a factual record on which to make a compelling argument tailored to the requirements of a different statute.in re wilford th.thus,we conclude father forfeited the issue by his failure to raise it in the dependency court,which would have permitted the court to determine the applicability of section and rule on the issue with an adequate record and argument.
nonoffending is a requirement of section 
nonetheless,putting aside father forfeiture of placement under section,we find on the merits that father was not entitled to consideration under section because he was neither nonoffending nor noncustodial.
section,subdivision a,provides in part that w hen a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.the section provides that i f that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child,subd.a.if the parent wants the child placed with him,the court must do so unless there is clear and convincing evidence of detriment.in re marquis th.
under section,subdivision a,the court examines whether it would be detrimental to temporarily place a child with the nonoffending noncustodial parent under subdivision b,the court decides whether that placement should be permanent and whether the court jurisdiction should be terminated.in re austin th.t he legislature envisioned a process under section subdivision a,the court examines whether it would be detrimental to temporarily place a child with the nonoffen
