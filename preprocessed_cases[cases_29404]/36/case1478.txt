this appeal questions the standard,in light of the enactment of welfare and institutions code section for terminating the dependency of a minor who turns years of age.in,when holly was three,the contra costa county social services department department filed a dependency petition that brought her within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.on march,when holly was,the juvenile court vacated dependency and dismissed the dependency petition after finding that the department had met the requirements of section by providing holly with certain resources,and that holly refused to take advantage of most offers of assistance.through her attorney,holly appeals,arguing that despite her often careless attitude toward the benefits she was offered,the court abused its discretion when it terminated jurisdiction because she is still in need of the court assistance.we adhere to the decision in in re robert th,d robert,that jurisdiction should be retained by the juvenile court beyond a dependent birthday only when there is an existing or reasonably foreseeable threat of harm to the child.while the best interest of the child remains the overriding standard,d eciding what is best for a child often poses a question no less ultimate than the purposes and values of life itself.mnookin,in the interest of children advocacy,law reform,and public policy.in light of the indeterminancy of this standard and the autonomy to which a person over is entitled,once a young person has reached majority the juvenile court must give substantial deference to the youth wishes before deciding to retain jurisdiction.we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case and affirm the order dismissing the dependency proceedings.
background 
holly entered the dependency system at the age of three when the department filed a petition under section alleging that she came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court because of her mother drug abuse and related neglect of holly.holly father was no longer living at the time.the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction and placed holly with her paternal grandparents.eventually the court adopted a plan for the grandparents to become holly legal guardians,but for financial reasons the plan was changed to foster care.in,when holly was,her grandmother became too ill to care for her and holly was moved to a group home.approximately two years later,holly grandmother passed away.
over the years,holly earned mostly poor grades in school.when she was,her social worker requested a psychological evaluation.the evaluation revealed that holly was severely behind her peers academically and that she had a serious learning disability.the evaluator also concluded that holly had dysthymic disorder,a type of mood disorder.in october,holly was prescribed prozac,which appeared to alleviate some of her symptoms of depression and hostility.however,holly stopped taking the prozac the next month.
in october,a meeting was scheduled with holly to design an individualized education plan.however,holly reportedly sabotaged her interviews by refusing to respond.she was referred to another program and by may she was in a nonpublic special education setting and performing well.she turned in february and was placed in foster care because the group home planned to discharge her when she turned.in march,she was diagnosed with lupus and kidney disease.in june,she began receiving social security benefits because her father had died before she was and she had moved out of her foster home.by january these payments had been discontinued.
a hearing was scheduled for january,to review holly dependency status.prior to the hearing,the department filed a report and recommended that the petition be dismissed.the report noted that holly had applied for supplemental security income ssi benefits,but that the agency responsible for reviewing her application had reported that the application was closed possibly because she failed to appear for an evaluation the report also observed that holly was reportedly currently living with the grandmother of a friend.finally,the report stated that the department had secured for holly her certified birth certificate,her social security card and a california identification card when she left her foster home.
holly did not appear at the review hearing,but her social worker testified extensively about the difficulties the department was having in getting holly to follow through with services that were offered to her.she testified that the department had set her up several times with job training,and that she dropped out each time that holly obtained a job at the sacramento children home,but lost it because she did not come to work that s he was in a school training program and s he again did not show up that she had refused medication and therapy for her depression and other psychiatric issues and that she had missed many important doctor appointments related to her kidney disease.the social worker also testified that the sacramento children home had taken holly to get her california identification card.
the trial judge initially could not determine whether the department had met its burden of providing holly with the documents and services required by section and continued the hearing,stating that he would ask the department to make holly h.available.i think we need her here in order to determine whether she refusing services or whether she needs to continue services even though she is.when the department objected that it would be difficult or impossible to force holly to appear,the court told holly attorney i not going to put the burden on the department to have h.here.if you feel there any question in your client mind whether she wants continuing services or not,you can invite her to appear on the date we going to set.
prior to the continued hearing date,the department filed an addendum to its report and recommendation.the addendum noted that holly graduated from high school on december.the social worker reported that holly was living in sacramento with her boyfriend that she was receiving some assistance through the sacramento county independent living skills program which would be available to her until she turned that the social worker from the sacramento county program had offered to take holly to get her identification card but that holly refused the offer and that the department had helped her apply for ssi benefits and had offered housing,educational and employment assistance.the social worker recommended that the court f ind that the protection of holly interest no longer requires juvenile court supervision and that it v acate dependency and dismiss petition.
holly did not appear at the continued hearing on march.her attorney told the court that she did not order her here since she is represented by competent counsel,and i do represent her,and she does not have to appear,therefore.when the court expressed its concern that under section holly was required to appear unless she did not wish to do so,her counsel stated that holly was notified of the date.holly attorney argued that there was a continuing risk of harm to holly since her social security benefits had been discontinued,she was not employed,and she had applied for ssi benefits but her application had not yet been processed.the court stated,i appreciate your concerns,but what should the department do that it has not done to meet it appears to me,other than the card where your client has refused to go on two separate appointments,that the department has fulfilled the requirements of,and all i could do would be to continue the case until those requirements have been fulfilled.it does address the harm to the individual,does,per se.the court went on to state that she fails to meet the department halfway.i just do see the department can do any more,and i am going to vacate and dismiss at this point in time.
through her attorney,holly appeals from the order dismissing the petition 
discussion 
we must first decide what standard the trial court is to apply in deciding whether to terminate the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over a dependent child who has turned,and then determine whether the trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed the petition that brought holly within its jurisdiction.robert,supra,th at,d.the burden of persuasion is with the party seeking to terminate jurisdiction,in this case the department.ibid.
while the juvenile court may not acquire jurisdiction over a person who is years of age or older,once it has obtained jurisdiction of a minor it may retain jurisdiction until the dependent child turns.under section,t he court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years.conversely,under section,the dependency petition may be dismissed any time before the minor reaches age if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require the dismissal,and that the parent or guardian of the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation.
jurisdiction is rarely retained through the age of,however,in part due to the extensive efforts to either return the child to the custody of a parent or to implement a permanent plan of adoption or legal guardianship if reunification efforts fail.seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure.another reason jurisdiction is rarely retained past the age of appears in the legislative history of section,which we discuss in detail below.although the juvenile court has the authority to retain jurisdiction over a dependent child until the age of,the reality is that federal funding for foster youth ends at the age of and common practice is for the juvenile court to terminate jurisdiction at that time.rules,off.of floor analysis,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
in,the legislature added section to the welfare and institutions code.section was enacted in response to concerns that dependent children who had reached the age of were being removed from the dependency system before they had adequate skills or resources to support themselves,and evidence that percent of these young persons became homeless within a year after leaving the foster care system.rules,off.of floor analysis,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the youth law center,which sponsored the legislation,posited that h omelessness is not merely a housing issue,but is related to poor education,lack of a support system,estrangement from family,lack of marketable skills,poor employment prospects and lack of community linkages.emancipation of foster youth before they are ready to live independently creates significant to the youth and to the state.ibid.
section provides that before terminating jurisdiction over a child who has reached majority,the county welfare department is required to a ensure that the child is present in court,unless the child does not wish to appear in court,or document efforts by the county welfare department to locate the child when the child is not available and b submit a report verifying that the following information,documents,and services have been provided to the child written information concerning the child dependency case,including his or her family history and placement history,the whereabouts of any siblings under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,directions on how to access the documents the child is entitled to inspect under section,and the date on which the jurisdiction of the juvenile court would be terminated.the following documents,where applicable social security card,certified birth certificate,identification card,as described in section of the vehicle code,death certificate of parent or parents,and proof of citizenship or residence.assistance in completing an application for or assistance in obtaining other health insurance referral to transitional housing,if available,or assistance in securing other housing and assistance in obtaining employment or other financial support.assistance in applying for admission to college or to a vocational training program or other educational institution and in obtaining financial aid,where appropriate.
under section,subdivision c the court has the discretion to continue jurisdiction if it finds that the county welfare department has not met the requirements of subdivision b and that termination of jurisdiction would be harmful to the best interests of the child.if the court determines that continued jurisdiction is warranted pursuant to this section,the continuation shall only be ordered for that period of time necessary for the county welfare department to meet the requirements of subdivision b.subdivision c specifies that the section shall not be construed to limit the discretion of the juvenile court to continue jurisdiction for other reasons.finally,subdivision c also provides that t he court may terminate jurisdiction if the county welfare department has offered the required services,and the child either has refused the services or,after reasonable efforts by the county welfare department,can not be located.the legislative history reveals that this final language was added to clarify that section does not intend to prohibit the juvenile court from terminating jurisdiction if the child is absent or the county welfare department fails to provide the documents and services because the child has refused the services,or the child can not be located after reasonable efforts by the county welfare department.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
robert,supra,is the only reported decision to date addressing the propriety of terminating jurisdiction over a dependent child over but under years of age.although decided prior to the enactment of section,the opinion articulates the standard to be applied in deciding whether to terminate the jurisdiction of the juvenile court after a dependent child turns.robert was placed with his grandparents in foster care so that his grandparents could continue to receive monthly foster care benefits that allowed them to care for him.robert performed well in school and was accepted by the several universities to which he had applied.when robert was about to turn,the social worker recommended that jurisdiction be terminated in light of robert success.robert contested termination,arguing that continuing as a dependent would help defray educational and living expenses.robert,supra,th at,d.robert grandfather told the social worker that termination of state financial aid would make it difficult for them to help robert.the court retained jurisdiction through three more review hearings,receiving testimony from robert at the last one that if the grandparents did not receive foster care funding he would not be able to afford to graduate from college and society would benefit more if he paid higher taxes from increased earnings available to college graduates.the trial court found that continued jurisdiction was necessary because conditions exist which justify jurisdiction under wic 
the court of appeal looked to section for guidance in determining the governing standard.that section provides that the purpose of the laws relating to dependency is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.the court reasoned that i n determining whether to terminate jurisdiction over a child in foster care,the issue to be addressed is the best interest of the child,and concluded that the exercise of jurisdiction must be based upon existing and reasonably foreseeable future harm to the welfare of the child.citation similar factors should come into play in determining whether jurisdiction should extend beyond the age of majority.robert,supra,th at,d,italics added.the court determined that robert did not face existing or reasonably foreseeable future harm within the meaning of section simply because he might not be able to afford to complete his college education,and therefore directed that jurisdiction be terminated.
section does not change the standard set forth in robert,that the exercise of jurisdiction must
