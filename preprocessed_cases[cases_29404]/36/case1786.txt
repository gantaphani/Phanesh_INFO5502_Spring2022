introduction 
following a jury verdict,the trial court terminated the parental rights of jimmy and spring dossey to two of their children.the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment on two grounds,holding that the dosseys were deprived of a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel due to their joint representation by an appointed attorney when there was a conflict of interest between them,and the form of the jury charge violated the dosseys constitutional rights.the texas department of protective and regulatory services petitioned this court to review both holdings.
the texas family code provides that indigent parents who are defendants in the same termination lawsuit are entitled to nonconflicted counsel.b.today we decide the standard for determining whether a conflict of interest exists between parents in a termination suit.we hold that,in deciding whether there is a conflict of interest between parents opposing termination in a single lawsuit,the trial court must determine whether there is a substantial risk that the appointed counsel obligations to one parent would materially and adversely affect his or her obligations to the other parent.applying this standard,we determine that the trial court did not err in finding no conflict of interest between the dosseys.we need not address the question regarding a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel raised sua sponte by the court of appeals.we further hold that the court of appeals erred in reviewing a jury charge complaint that was not preserved in the trial court.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to that court.
ii.factual and procedural background 
jimmy and spring dossey are the married parents of two children,and.in january,the texas department of protective and regulatory services investigated spring regarding an incident in which then fell off a car trunk and fractured his skull.the injury healed,and the department concluded that the incident was an accident.in february,then was seriously scalded in the kitchen sink when spring was the only parent in the house.spring told hospital personnel that the child climbed into the sink and turned on the hot water while she was asleep,but a hospital nurse thought the burns were inconsistent with spring explanation and reported the incident to the department.the department immediately removed both children from the dosseys custody and filed a suit affecting the relationship.see.a a.after a hearing,the trial court granted temporary conservatorship to the department until the dosseys complied with a family reunification plan.
within a month of their children removal,the dosseys retained attorney james ray to represent them.in october,following a hearing requested by ray,the trial court determined that it was in the best interests of the children to return them to their parents pending completion of counseling and other terms of the family reunification plan.however,in february,the court ordered the children removed again based on a finding of immediate danger to their health or safety.while the court order did not specify the basis of this finding,the department affidavit in support of removal cited allegations that jimmy stole a gun,worked as a drug informant for the police,lied to the department about being a drug informant,and downloaded child pornography on a home computer.the department also alleged that both parents were failing to meet the children physical needs.
the original statutory deadline for resolving the suit expired on march.see.a.the court granted a extension of that deadline based on the department assertion that the parents needed more time to complete the family reunification plan before the children should be returned to them.see id.b.in may,the department changed its goal from family reunification to termination and adoption and amended its petition to seek termination of the dosseys parental rights.the petition alleged that termination would be in the children best interests,and that both jimmy and spring had knowingly placed or knowingly allowed their children to remain in conditions or surroundings that endangered the physical or emotional of the children,and engaged in conduct or knowingly placed their children with persons who engaged in conduct that endangered the physical or emotional of the children.see id.d,e.
on june,ray withdrew as counsel because the dosseys could no longer afford to pay him.the dosseys requested that the trial court appoint ray to continue representing them.instead,the trial court appointed attorney gerald villarrial to serve as the dosseys counsel.a month later,jimmy dossey tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana use and was arrested and charged with a class c misdemeanor for assaulting spring in a store parking lot.
jury selection in the termination case began on august,and trial began on august.at a hearing on august,villarrial moved to sever the cases on the ground that he could not adequately represent both clients in the same trial due to a potential for conflict of interest based on the evidence that he anticipated would be offered against each of them.the trial court denied the motion.at the close of evidence in the trial on the merits,villarrial again moved to sever the cases,this time on the ground that an actual conflict of interest had developed.specifically,villarrial argued that the greater weight of the evidence admitted was probative only on grounds for terminating jimmy rights,and if he represented only spring in the case,his strategy would have been to point the finger at jimmy dossey and advise the jury only to terminate his rights.the trial court denied the motion.
in the jury charge,the trial court submitted the two grounds for termination alleged against each parent disjunctively and four questions that required the jury to determine whether the relationship between each parent and each child should be terminated neither villarrial nor the state objected to the form of the charge.by a vote,the jury returned a verdict terminating the parental rights of jimmy and spring to both children.the trial court rendered judgment in accord with the verdict.
on appeal,the dosseys argued that the trial court erred in refusing to appoint separate counsel or to grant separate trials,and that the disjunctive instruction combined with jury questions deprived them of a right to have ten jurors agree on a specific finding supporting termination.a divided court of appeals reversed on both grounds.first,the court of appeals held that a statutory right to counsel in a termination case includes a right that the representation be effective.at.the court concluded that an actual conflict of interest arose between the parents because villarrial could not strongly advocate for one parent due to his ethical obligations to the other.see id.at.next,the court of appeals reviewed the unpreserved complaint of charge error and held that the submission of grounds for termination in the disjunctive combined with the jury questions violates due process in parental rights termination cases.see id.at.the court remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial without reviewing the dosseys other complaints on appeal.see id.at.the department petitioned this court for review.
iii.the conflict of interest claim 
the department first contends that the court of appeals erred in holding there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in parental rights termination cases.we observe as a preliminary matter that the dosseys did not assert in the court of appeals a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.instead,the dosseys argued that the trial court erred in failing to appoint separate counsel or grant separate trials because their interests conflicted the court of appeals sua sponte framed this issue as whether there is a due process right to effective assistance of counsel at trial in parental rights termination cases.see id.at.
preservation 
the essence of the dosseys complaint on appeal is that they were harmed by joint representation at the same trial due to a conflict of interest.we first must determine whether the dosseys preserved this complaint.
at a hearing and after the close of evidence,the dosseys through their appointed counsel moved to sever the cases so that their attorney could represent them one at a time.the department does not dispute that villarrial motion sought separate trials and the dosseys stated the grounds for the motion with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware that they were seeking separate trials as a remedy for a conflict of interest between them.see.a a stating that to preserve an issue for appellate review,the grounds for the ruling must be stated with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint.consequently,we may resolve the dosseys complaint regarding the conflict of interest by reviewing the trial court ruling on the motion for separate trials.
by determining that the dosseys preserved their complaint regarding a right to nonconflicted counsel with a motion for separate trials,we do not condone the notion that ordering separate trials could have remedied villarrial own ethical obligation to avoid a conflict of interest in his joint representation.see.disciplinary prof l conduct b,reprinted in.gov t code,tit,subtit.g,app.a.state bar art.x.in fact,it probably would not.
b.the motion for separate trials 
a trial court may order separate trials to avoid prejudice.see civ.b.here,the dosseys requested separate trials to avoid the prejudice posed by an alleged conflict of interest.in texas,indigent parents have a statutory right to counsel in termination cases.under family code a,a court must appoint counsel to an indigent parent who opposes termination of his or her parental rights.a.in a termination suit against two parents,both may be entitled to appointed counsel.in that circumstance,the statute provides that if the court finds that the interests of the parents are not in conflict,the court may appoint a single attorney ad litem to represent the interests of both parents.id.b.the statute therefore implicitly provides that indigent parents who face termination of their parental rights in the same suit are entitled to nonconflicted counsel 
what constitutes a conflict of interest between parents within the meaning of section b is a question of first impression for this court.typically,courts look to the ethical rules promulgated by the state bar to evaluate conflicts of interest in civil cases.see,mandell wright thomas,applying former texas canon of ethics to conflict of interest claim based on joint representation in a wrongful death action sylvia dallas county child welfare unit,no writ applying former disciplinary rule in re,worth,no writ same fed.deposit ins.united states fire ins,cir applying the disciplinary rules to evaluate a conflict of interest for purposes of a motion to disqualify opposing counsel.generally,ethical rules prohibit an attorney from jointly representing clients when the clients interests are adverse to each other.for instance,texas disciplinary rule of professional conduct b provides that a lawyer shall not represent a person if the representation involves a substantially related matter in which that person interests are materially and directly adverse to another client see.disciplinary prof l conduct b.the restatement of law articulates an almost identical standard,providing that a lawyer in a civil case may not represent two or more clients in a matter if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer representation of one client would be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer duties to another client in the matter restatement third of the law governing lawyers,representing clients with conflicting interests in civil litigation.
consistent with these guidelines,we hold that a trial court must determine whether there is a substantial risk that a lawyer obligations to one parent would materially and adversely affect his or her obligations to the other parent when deciding whether there is a conflict of interest between parents opposing termination in a single suit in evaluating whether there is a substantial risk of a conflict of interest before trial,the trial court should consider the available record to determine the likelihood that the parents positions will be adverse to each other.for example,when reviewing a record of proceedings,the trial court may consider the department allegations in the petition against each parent,evidence adduced during hearings,and the parents statements and positions taken in the course of proceedings.we review a trial court determination of whether there was a conflict of interest for an abuse of discretion.see metro.life ins.syntek fin,allstate ins.hunt.
the dosseys first requested separate trials at a hearing.a review of the record shows no substantial risk that villarrial representation of one parent would materially and adversely affect his representation of the other parent.the petition alleged grounds of endangerment against each of the dosseys.these allegations permitted termination based not only on each parent own conduct endangering the children,but upon each parent knowing exposure of the children to one another endangering conduct.see.d,e.consequently,evidence regarding jimmy conduct could tend to prove the grounds supporting spring termination,and vice versa.at all relevant times before trial,the dosseys were married and living together.they hired one attorney to represent both of them when their children were first removed,and sought appointment of that attorney to represent both of them after he withdrew.the record does not reflect that,at any time before the hearing,either parent blamed the other for conduct related to the termination,or that either would be willing or able to separate from the other to retain custody of the children.because the parents have cited no evidence from the record of an actual conflict between them,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying villarrial motion to sever.
further,the trial court did not err in determining that no actual conflict of interest had arisen when the dosseys renewed their motion after the close of evidence.in fact,the evidence at trial establishes that the dosseys interests were aligned.both parents testified that they were fully aware of the allegations against the other and that they continued to live and work toward reunification together,even after their children were removed.in particular,spring testified that jimmy was a good husband and a good parent,and that the two of them had learned to pull together and try to work through their problems instead of splitting up and going separate ways she asserted this even though she testified that he had hit her maybe three or four times and that she was scared when he stole a handgun and started working as a drug informant.the only evidence suggesting that spring and jimmy interests diverged was spring testimony that she would be willing to leave jimmy if the court terminated only his rights.however,the jury was free to disbelieve that testimony.alternatively,the jury could have concluded that even if she did legally separate from jimmy,there would be no practical way to ensure that spring and jimmy would not reunite or to prevent jimmy from exercising rights over the children.in evaluating whether an actual conflict of interest had arisen,the trial court would have known that these credibility determinations were within the province of the jury.in sum,the dosseys did not establish that their interests conflicted to create a substantial risk that villarrial could not represent effectively each of them in the same trial.
we acknowledge that a potential for conflicts of interest between parents challenging termination may always be present.however,the trial court inquiry under the standard we articulate today is limited to whether there is an actual conflict of interest.we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying villarrial second motion for separate trials based on a conflict of interest 
iv.the jury charge complaint 
in its second complaint,the department contends that the court of appeals erred in holding that the jury charge was fatally defective.the trial court submitted a jury charge with the two statutory grounds alleged against the parents in the disjunctive,and with jury questions regarding whether the relationships should be terminated.see civ.permitting the court to submit questions disjunctively and requiring questions whenever feasible.the court of appeals held that the charge violated the dosseys due process right to have at least ten jurors agree on either or both statutory grounds supporting termination.at.
the department argues that the court of appeals holding contradicts this court holding in texas department of human services,op.on reh g.in,we approved submission of a single question incorporating two statutory grounds for termination of parental rights submitted disjunctively.at.we rejected the court of appeals conclusion that the form of the verdict deprived the parent of the necessary jury agreement on the specific grounds supporting termination,holding that the controlling question in this case was whether the relationship between the mother and each of her two children should be terminated,not what specific ground or grounds under the statute the jury relied on to answer affirmatively the questions posed.id.while the court of appeals in this case states that does not control the resolution of this case,see at referring to the relevant discussion in as dictum,we observe that our courts of appeals are now divided on this issue 
preservation 
the dosseys never objected to the form of the jury charge at trial.under our procedural rules,the failure to raise a complaint at trial to a jury charge waives review of that complaint on appeal.see.civ.the court of appeals nevertheless reviewed the dosseys complaint about the jury charge,relying on its holding in in re,which we reversed on other grounds.at see in re,rev on other grounds.
in,the court of appeals held that fourteenth amendment procedural due process concerns require review of core issues in the jury charge in involuntary termination cases even when the parties failed to object to the charge at the trial court.at.without addressing whether appellate courts could review the unpreserved charge error,this court reversed the court of appeals judgment in because we concluded that the evidence conclusively established one of the grounds for termination,making the alleged charge error harmless.at.unlike the evidence in,the evidence in this case does not conclusively establish the predicate grounds for termination.consequently,this case squarely presents the issue of whether the court of appeals could review the unpreserved charge error.as a rule,we only decide constitutional questions when we can not resolve issues on nonconstitutional grounds accordingly,we first determine whether our law on our rules of procedure and our doctrine of fundamental review of this jury charge complaint.
texas rules on preservation 
our procedural rules state that any complaint to a jury charge is waived unless specifically included in an objection.civ.a.a party must make the trial court aware of the complaint,timely and plainly,and obtain a ruling.state dep t of highways pub.transp.payne.the complaint in this case is that the disjunctive instruction and submission of the jury questions violated the dosseys alleged constitutional rights to have ten jurors agree on the specific statutory findings underlying the verdict.
this court has recently emphasized that complaints of error in submission must be preserved by objection at trial.see harris county smith,a timely objection,plainly informing the court that a specific element of damages should not be included in a question because there is no evidence to support its submission,therefore preserves the error for appellate review.crown life ins.casteel,holding it is harmful error when a question erroneously commingles valid and invalid theories and an objection is timely and specific.in addition,we recently refused to review a complaint based on constitutional error that was not preserved in the trial court.see texas dep t of protective regulatory servs.sherry,constitutional claim on appeal in paternity suit waived by failure to raise complaint at trial citing dreyer greene.
important prudential considerations underscore our rules on preservation.requiring parties to raise complaints at trial conserves judicial resources by giving trial courts an opportunity to correct an error before an appeal proceeds.in re.in addition,our preservation rules promote fairness among litigants.a party should not be permitted to waive,consent to,or neglect to complain about an error at trial and then surprise his opponent on appeal by stating his complaint for the first time.pirtle gregory,per curiam.moreover,we further the goal of accuracy in judicial when lower courts have the opportunity to first consider and rule on error.not only do the parties have the opportunity to develop and refine their arguments,but we have the benefit of other judicial review to focus and further analyze the questions at issue.accordingly,we follow our procedural rules,which bar review of this complaint,unless a recognized exception exists.
c.the doctrine 
a limited exception to our procedural preservation rules is the doctrine.see ramsey dunlop.historically,we have used the term fundamental error to describe situations in which an appellate court may review error that was neither raised in the trial court nor assigned on appeal.see,mccauley consolidated underwriters,per curiam.in light of our strong policy considerations favoring preservation,we have called fundamental error a discredited doctrine.cox johnson,per curiam.
nevertheless,we have employed fundamental error in rare instances to review certain types of unpreserved or unassigned error.first,we have reviewed unassigned error or error not raised by the parties when the record shows on its face that the court lacked jurisdiction.see mccauley,at error is fundamental when the record shows a jurisdictional defect.in addition,we have applied the doctrine to review certain types of error in juvenile delinquency cases.see in re,at reviewing a trial court failure to give mandatory statutory admonishments in a juvenile delinquency proceeding state santana,vacated on other grounds,d,on remand,reviewing the constitutionality of the burden of proof instruction in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.
our application of fundamental error in these last two cases rested on the nature of juvenile delinquency cases.see,at characterizing a juvenile delinquency proceeding as and analyzing the criminal rules on applying fundamental error santana,at observing that juvenile delinquency proceedings are not ordinary civil adversarial proceedings.specifically,in,we explained that it is unwise and problematic to apply one preservation rule in adult,criminal proceedings and another,stricter rule in juvenile cases.at.texas criminal jurisprudence recognizes that certain types of error can be reviewed for the first time on appeal evid.d in a criminal case,nothing in these rules precludes taking notice of fundamental errors affecting substantive rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.see,at describing certain substantive rights that criminal defendants can not forfeit by the failure to preserve error in the trial court citing marin state,en banc.
however,this rationale does not support applying the criminal doctrine to parental rights termination cases.we consider juvenile delinquency cases to be because under the family code,the texas rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases and chapter of the code of criminal procedure govern juvenile delinquency proceedings.c in re.in contrast,our rules of evidence applicable to civil cases and our rules of civil procedure govern termination proceedings.civil rules of evidence apply to suits affecting the relationship except as otherwise provided in re,at determining that texas rule of civil procedure applies to judgment terminating parental rights,at analyzing the application of texas rule of civil procedure to a jury charge complaint in a termination case.accordingly,because termination cases do not apply criminal pro
