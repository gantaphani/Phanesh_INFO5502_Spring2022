section f,captioned equitable relief,provides that under procedures prescribed by the department of the treasury,if taking into account all the facts and circumstances,it is inequitable to hold the individual liable for any unpaid tax or any deficiency and relief is not available to such individual under subsection b or c of section,the department may relieve such individual of such liability.by regulation the treasury has fixed a deadline for filing claims under subsection f of two years from the irs first action to collect the tax by for example issuing a notice of intent to levy on the taxpayer property.b see also irs a.the tax court in a divided opinion invalidated the deadline in the regulation and the internal revenue service appeals.
the taxpayer,cathy lantz,is a financially unsophisticated woman whose husband,a dentist,was arrested for medicare fraud in,convicted,and imprisoned.they had been married for only six years when he was arrested and there is no suggestion that she was aware of,let alone complicit in,his fraud.the irs learned that the joint return the couple had filed had understated their federal income tax liability in the last tax year before his arrest,and the service assessed them more than in additional income tax,penalties,and interest.
in cathy lantz received from the a packet that included a notice of a proposed levy on her and her husband explaining the collection process,alerting the recipient to the possibility of relief,and citing an irs publication explaining the rights of such a spouse.included in the packet was a form for requesting a collection due process hearing.the taxpayer can indicate that she is seeking relief by checking a box on the form and filing an application for such relief.lantz did not respond to the irs communication,however,because her husband from whom she had been estranged since his conviction told her he deal with the matter.he returned the form requesting a collection due process hearing and asked to be sent the application form for seeking relief,explaining that his wife was an innocent spouse.but,assuming he received that form,he died before filing it.
in the irs,unable to collect any of its tax assessment from the husband and by now he was dead,applied the income tax refund for to which lantz would otherwise have been entitled to her joint and now several liability for,which had grown to more than million.unemployed and impecunious,she applied for relief but the irs turned her down because she missed the deadline from the date in on which the service had sent her the notice of intent to file a levy on her and her husband property.the service concedes that were it not for the deadline,lantz would be eligible for relief.but the concession does not bear on the validity of the deadline any statute of limitations will cut off some,and often a great many,meritorious claims.
in invalidating the deadline that the treasury has imposed on claims under subsection f,the tax court noted that each of the two other subsections of that we mentioned,b and c,contains a deadline,b e,c b,while subsection f does not.from this difference the court inferred that congress intended subsection f to have no deadline.the court said that by explicitly creating a limitation in subsections b and c but not subsection f,congress has spoken by its audible silence.

whatever any of this means,the tax court basic thought seems to have been that since some statutes in this case,some provisions of a statute prescribe deadlines,whenever a statute or provision fails to prescribe a deadline,there is none.that is not how statutes that omit a statute of limitations are usually interpreted.courts borrow a statute of limitations from some other statute in order to avoid the absurdity of allowing suits to be filed centuries after the claim on which the suit was based arose.agency holding associates,delcostello int l brotherhood of teamsters,teamsters employers welfare trust of illinois gorman brothers ready mix,cir.they borrow an existing statute of limitations rather than create one because the length of a limitations period is ca reason your way to courts are supposed not to be arbitrary when they are,they get criticized for it.hemmings barian,cir.courts even say that in borrowing a statute of limitations from one statute for use in another they are doing congress will given our longstanding practice of borrowing state law,and the congressional awareness of this practice,we can generally assume that congress intends by its silence that we borrow state law.agency holding associates,supra,at.
agencies,in contrast,being legislative as well as adjudicatory bodies,are not bashful about making up their own deadlines.see,e,johnson gonzales,cir swallows holding,commissioner,cir stearn department of navy,foroglou reno,cir withey perales,cir.and because they are not bashful,and because it is as likely that congress knows this as that it knows that courts like to borrow a statute of limitations when congress does specify one,the fact that congress designated a deadline in two provisions of the same statute and not in a third is not a compelling argument that congress meant to preclude the treasury department from imposing a deadline applicable to cases governed by that third provision.whether the treasury borrowed the limitations period from subsections b and c or simply decided that two years was the right deadline is thus of no consequence either way it was doing nothing unusual.
lantz suggests that because section of the code imposes a deadline on the government right to collect taxes that it is owed,there is a time limit on claims for relief under section f ten so the absurdity of allowing claims under subsection f to be filed until the day of judgment is avoided.but this argument confuses an external circumstance that as a practical matter creates a time limit with a statute of limitations.it is true that if after years from the date of assessment,which itself must take place within three years after the tax return was filed,the irs has not moved to collect the tax by levying on the taxpayer property or wages or sued to collect the tax,it usually has to give up.a,a united states galletti,clark united states,cir.but to call this a statute of limitations for claims under subsection f is like saying that claims for defamation have an outside statute of limitations of years,because the common law rule still in force in many states is that a defamation claim dies with the death of the victim of the defamation,dan dobbs,the law of torts,and according to wikipedia years is the longest life span verified by modern documentation.http visited.
