introduction 
theodora mother appeals from the order terminating her parental rights to her daughter tamika.at the welfare and institutions code section hearing,she attempted to defeat termination of her rights by arguing the regular visitation and contact exception.the trial court asked for and received an offer of proof from her on that issue.the court found the offer insufficient to warrant a contested hearing and,after making all appropriate findings,terminated parental rights.she now contends she has a statutory and constitutional right to a contested hearing so that the trial court committed reversible error per se in requiring her to first make an offer of proof.
we disagree.we adhere to the view we expressed in in re jeanette th,d a parent is entitled to due process at a hearing to terminate parental rights but due process is a flexible concept.applying that principle to this case,we conclude a trial court does not deny due process if it requires a parent to make an offer of proof before it conducts a contested hearing on the issue of whether a parent can discharge his or her burden of establishing a statutory exception to termination of parental rights.we therefore affirm the trial court order.
factual and procedural background 
tamika was born in january.
on november,the los angeles county department of children and family services department filed a section petition alleging mother frequent use of heroin rendered her incapable of taking care of tamika,endangered the child safety,and created a detrimental home environment 
on november,the court sustained the petition based upon mother substance abuse and neglect of her daughter.
on december,the court removed tamika from mother custody and declared her a dependent of the court.the court disposition plan required mother to attend,inter alia,drug rehabilitation and parent education counseling.tamika was placed with a foster parent.mother was permitted to have monitored visits.
department report prepared for the june,judicial review hearing indicated mother was attending an drug treatment program that included drug counseling and random drug testing.mother had weekly monitored visits with tamika,which went smoothly.the court decided to permit mother to have monitored visits on a weekly basis at the drug rehabilitation facility.the court ordered preparation of a supplemental report and continued the matter for a month.
on july,the court ordered department to continue to provide reunification services.the matter was set for a section permanency planning hearing in six months.
the next hearing was conducted on january.unfortunately,mother drug rehabilitation was less than a week prior to the january hearing she relapsed and began using heroin again.the court found reasonable efforts had been made to reunite tamika with mother but that to return tamika to mother custody would create a substantial risk of physical and emotional harm.the court limited mother to monitored visitation.
in the following months,mother unsuccessfully participated in several different drug rehabilitation programs until late april when she entered the sober living home.once mother was in this program,she had three successful monitored visits with tamika.
however,on may,mother left the sober living home without leaving a forwarding address.as of august,mother had not seen tamika for three months.in addition,department had been unable to contact mother.consequently,the court terminated reunification services,ordered department to provide permanent placement services,and set the matter for a section hearing.
because mother whereabouts were unknown,the section hearing was repeatedly continued for more than a year in order to properly notice her.
on june,mother appeared in court.she stated she now lived in denver,colorado,and gave the court her permanent mailing address and phone number.mother attorney requested a contested hearing.the court set the hearing for august,explicitly conditioned upon an offer of proof from mother.the court permitted mother to have monitored contact with tamika.the court told mother you should know that tamika was very worried about you during the period that we did know where you were.and she was coming to court expressing concern about you and where you were.and to be her age and have to be worrying about that,i ca even imagine.but the other thing is the impact that has long range for her has got to be strong.so i do know what tamika desires are today about having contact with you.but she probably going to have to deal with some stuff before she even interested in trying to see about forming a new relationship with you again.
department report prepared for the august section hearing indicated tamika wanted to stay with her foster mother.tamika therapist stated the child feelings for her foster family are very strong and that her adjustment continues to improve as she matures within the security and structure of their home.her calm,thoughtful demeanor points to her confidence that she is accepted,respected,and loved member of the family.department recommended termination of mother parental rights and placement for adoption.
at the august,section hearing,the court asked for an offer of proof in regard to mother request for a contested hearing.mother attorney replied mother has maintained an emotional bond with the minor.she has written the minor several times recently the child is years old she developed a strong bond prior to the removal in of the child from her care.and it would be in the best interests of the minor to continue to have contact with the mother.this is an infant who going to forget the contact and the bond that was developed by the mother and the minor.in response to questions from the court,mother stated she had last visited tamika in february and had written her two letters since then.
the court ruled department has a burden of showing the child is adoptable and anyone who wants to contest has to rebut that and the burden falls to that party,mother.at this point there been no showing that there is any evidence to rebut that.the code is very specific regarding the exception,being that the parent has maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from a continuing relationship.in this situation,the mother has had no contact in one and a half years and has written two letters during that period.and the mother has not stated that tamika wants to continue to have that contact,even if it were sufficient,which it not.so the offer of proof has failed.
turning to the question of terminating mother parental rights,the court ruled based upon the evidence,the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that return to the parent would be detrimental.tamika is adoptable.the parental rights are terminated,she declared free from the care,custody and control of the parent.care,custody and control is transferred to department for the purposes of adoptive planning and placement.
this appeal by mother follows.
