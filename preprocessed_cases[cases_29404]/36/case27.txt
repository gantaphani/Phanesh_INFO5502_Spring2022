abduction of patrick daughter 
appellant lisandro patrick and appellee noelia rivera lopez are the biological parents of,a girl born in puerto rico in.for purposes of this appeal,it is uncontested that before birth,patrick signed an affidavit acknowledging paternity.nevertheless,birth certificate does not list a father.patrick and rivera were unmarried when was born,but they married in puerto rico in june.
patrick and rivera agreed that after the marriage,patrick would move to the united kingdom and that rivera would follow with her children and a child from another father as soon as patrick could set up the family home and earn enough money to pay for the family travel.in january,rivera and her children moved to the united kingdom,where they stayed with patrick.made friends and attended various play groups there,and the family received medical care from england national health service,as well as other public benefits.patrick and rivera applied for a residence card for in june.
in march,rivera absconded to puerto rico with her children.when patrick discovered that rivera had taken her children to puerto rico and did not intend to return to the united kingdom,he filed a petition for the return of in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,opened for signature,hague convention or convention,as well as its implementing statute,the international child abduction remedies act icara,the petition alleged that rivera wrongfully removed from her habitual residence,the united kingdom.
district court proceedings 
on the day that he filed his petition,patrick asked the district court to expedite his case and issue an order to show cause to ensure that rivera would appear in court with.the next business day,the case was assigned to a judge,who immediately issued an order to show cause requiring rivera to appear with at a hearing four days later.the order,however,also required patrick to post a surety bond.patrick moved to vacate the bond requirement,in part on the grounds that article of the hague convention prohibits a court from requiring a bond to guarantee the payment of costs and expenses.patrick pointed out that he was currently unemployed and receiving pro bono legal assistance.in the alternative,he asked the court to reduce the bond to.that same day,the district court issued a minute order in which it refused to vacate the bond requirement but reduced the bond to.at the show cause hearing the next day,the court appointed counsel for rivera,ordered her to remain in puerto rico with,and set an evidentiary hearing.
after a series of scheduling difficulties,the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.in consultation with the parties,the magistrate judge scheduled a trial for october.rivera answered patrick petition,admitting that he is l.father.
on the eve of trial,october,rivera moved to dismiss patrick petition under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.rivera argued in part that removal of a child is wrongful under the hague convention only if it is in breach of a person rights of custody,hague convention,and that patrick had no rights of custody under the convention because he was not registered as father in her birth certificate.the magistrate judge granted rivera motion to dismiss on the ground that patrick never presented his affidavit of paternity to puerto rico vital statistics registry.patrick rivera lopez,civil cvr,wl.patrick timely appealed the dismissal of his petition,as well as the bond requirement.
ii.analysis 
dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b 
patrick first complaint about the dismissal of his petition is procedural rivera filed her motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b long after the deadline for responsive pleadings,and after she had filed her answer.patrick is correct that this motion was untimely because a motion asserting a defense listed in rule b must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.b.instead of deciding the motion under rule b,the district court should have treated it as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.aponte torres,at.
the court reliance on the wrong rule,however,was inconsequential.converting the grounds for a motion from rule b to rule c does not affect our analysis inasmuch as the two motions are ordinarily accorded much the same treatment.id.rule c does not allow for any resolution of contested facts rather,a court may enter judgment on the pleadings only if the uncontested and properly considered facts conclusively establish the movant entitlement to a favorable judgment.id.nothing about the district court judgment suggests that the result would have been different if the court had converted the motion.we will treat rivera motion to dismiss as a motion for judgment on the pleadings,and we will review the district court decision de novo.id.at.
patrick entitlement to relief under the hague convention 
the hague convention and united kingdom law 
the hague convention was adopted in in response to the problem of international child abductions during domestic disputes.the convention seeks to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.abbott abbott,d quoting hague convention.
the convention provides that removal of a child is wrongful when 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention emphasis added.rights of custody include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.id.where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of article the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.id.
the united states has implemented the convention through icara,which authorizes a person who seeks a child return to file a petition in state or federal court.a b.the court shall decide the case in accordance with the convention.id.d.if the child has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention,the child shall be promptly returned,subject to certain exceptions.id.a.
given this framework,patrick must allege facts sufficient to show that he has rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention.hague convention.patrick alleged in his petition that habitual residence is the united kingdom.for purposes of this appeal,rivera does not dispute this allegation.therefore,patrick rights of custody are determined with respect to united kingdom law.
to evaluate patrick rights of custody under united kingdom law,we must follow a trail of statutes.our starting point is the law description of parental responsibility,which patrick and rivera agree is tantamount to rights of custody where a child father and mother were married to each other at the time of his birth,they shall each have parental responsibility for the child.children act,on its face,this provision would appear not to apply to patrick and rivera,who married after birth,but r eferences in this act to a child whose father and mother were married to each other at the time of his birth must be read with section of the family law reform act which extends their meaning.id.that section states that references to a person whose father and mother were married to each other at the time of his birth include references to any person to whom subsection below applies.family law reform act.subsection applies to any person who is a legitimated person within the meaning of section of the legitimacy act.id.that section defines legitimated person to include a person legitimated or recognised as legitimated under section or above,legitimacy act,and section of the legitimacy act provides that 
where the parents of an illegitimate person marry one another and the father of the illegitimate person is not at the time of the marriage domiciled in england and wales but is domiciled in a country by the law of which the illegitimate person became legitimated by virtue of such subsequent marriage,that person,if living,shall in england and wales be recognised as having been so legitimated from the date of the marriage.
id.emphasis added.based on these statutes,we conclude as did the district court that removal was wrongful under the hague convention if became legitimated under puerto rico law by virtue of patrick marriage to rivera 
legitimation under puerto rico law 
for more than a century,puerto rico law has provided that a child born under the same circumstances as is legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents.when spain ceded puerto rico to the united states in,the spanish civil code provided that natural children,defined as children born out of wedlock to parents who could have married each other at the time of conception,may be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents.ex parte hernández martínez.puerto rico civil codes of and contained similar laws.id.at.puerto rico current law is the same,except that it no longer requires that a child parents be eligible to marry each other at the time of the child conception 
the legitimation of children had out of wedlock shall be accomplished by the subsequent reciprocal marriage of the parents provided,that there shall be considered as legitimated children,all children had out of wedlock prior to the approval of this act,whose parents have married each other after the birth of said children.
laws ann.tit,see also id.all children born out of wedlock subsequent to august,shall be natural children,whether or not the parents could have married at the moment when such children were conceived.these children will be legitimized by the subsequent marriage of the parents,to each other.
despite this clear language,the district court held that patrick marriage to rivera did not legitimate under puerto rico law because patrick did not present his affidavit of paternity to the vital statistics registry of puerto rico.the court stated that a child born out of wedlock will not be automatically considered as begotten by a man and woman who later marry,unless they register the child as theirs.patrick,wl,at citing ramos rosario.the court relied on león rosario torres,offic.trans,for the proposition that puerto rico legislative system allows no room for liberal interpretation regarding facts of life recorded in the vital statistics registry of puerto rico and exceptions to the vital statistics registry act of puerto rico shall be construed restrictively.patrick,wl,at.
neither opinion on which the district court relied adequately supports its decision.in ramos,the supreme court of puerto rico decided that a man could represent his minor son in court based on an affidavit of paternity that he filed with the vital statistics registry.at.but the court did not hold that filing the affidavit with the vital statistics registry,as opposed to the mere existence of the affidavit,entitled the father to represent his son,and the opinion says nothing about whether filing the affidavit legitimated the son.in león rosario,when the court stated that the vital statistics registry act must be construed narrowly,it was simply rejecting a claim that the vital statistics registry was required to register a birth that took place in massachusetts.offic.trans.at.
for her part,rivera claims that the supreme court of puerto rico held in ex parte hernández martínez that for a child to be legitimated,both parents must be listed on the child birth certificate.the opposite is true in an opinion that discussed at length the relationship between acknowledgment and legitimation of children,the puerto rico supreme court explained that under the civil code,natural children 
were entitled to be legitimated by a subsequent marriage section of the civil code provided that a natural child might be acknowledged by the father and mother jointly or by either of them alone,either in the record of birth,in a will,or in some other public instrument.
at.in short,the court held that the subsequent marriage of the parents of a natural child legitimizes the child,whether or not the father appears in the record of birth,as long as the child is acknowledged in a public instrument.
the civil code has been superseded by laws that expand the range of ways in which a parent can acknowledge a child.ocasio daz.the supreme court of puerto rico has held that under current law,t he father,or in his default,his heirs,may acknowledge in any way their children,expressly or impliedly,regardless of the dates or circumstances of their births and for all legal purposes.id.at emphasis added.because patrick needed only to acknowledge in any way,his affidavit acknowledging as his daughter sufficed to establish that he is her father.because patrick is father,his marriage to rivera legitimated 
rivera also argues that the supreme court of puerto rico held in castro torres negrón soto,that the subsequent marriage of a child parents gives rise only to a presumption of paternity from which the mother husband can benefit if he is registered as the child father.this holding is inapposite because patrick paternity has been settled in this case patrick alleged in his petition that he is the father of,rivera admitted this allegation in her answer,and no one else has challenged patrick paternity.
in the alternative,rivera argues that can not be legitimated because puerto rico constitution,as well as one of its implementing acts,abolished the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.in,puerto rico ratified its constitution,which guarantees that n o discrimination shall be made on account of race,color,sex,birth,social origin or condition,or political or religious ideas.const.art.ii,emphasis added.later that year,puerto rico enacted act,which provides that a ll children have,with respect to their parents and to the estate left by the latter,the same rights that correspond to legitimate children.laws ann.tit.interpreting these laws,the supreme court of puerto rico held that 
n o judicial declaration of the status of child shall make any pronouncement as to the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the birth of the petitioner nor as to the civil status of his parents.the petitioner shall be simply called child and his progenitors father or mother,as the case may be.
ocasio,at.on the basis of this holding,rivera asks us to conclude that her marriage to patrick did not legitimate under puerto rico law.
although puerto rico has abolished discrimination against children based on the circumstances of their birth,it has not abolished the concept of legitimacy.act reference to the same rights that correspond to legitimate children,laws ann.tit,presupposes that legitimate children still exist in puerto rico.see ocasio,at any judicial declaration of status of child shall acknowledge and decree th
