in this appeal,we are called upon to decide whether a marital property division may be subject to fraudulent transfer law.resolving that issue requires us to harmonize two independent statutory schemes,one that governs fraudulent transfers and another that controls property division on divorce.
after analyzing the relevant statutes and reviewing other persuasive authority,we conclude that a divorcing couple property division may constitute a fraudulent transfer.in reaching that conclusion,we respectfully disagree with our colleagues in the fourth district 
we also determine that there are material fact questions concerning application of the governing statute in this case.we therefore reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment.
facts and procedural history 
danilo reed husband and violeta reed wife,defendants below and respondents here,were married in.
in,husband had an extramarital sexual relationship with appellant rhina mejia plaintiff.plaintiff became pregnant as a result of that liaison.in august,plaintiff brought an action to establish husband paternity of the child that she was carrying.plaintiff gave birth to a daughter in february.husband paternity of the child was later established through genetic testing.
thereafter,husband was ordered to pay child support of per month.on plaintiff motion,the court later increased child support retroactively to per month as a result of the retroactivity of the modification,husband owed a support arrearage,which he paid in installments over time pursuant to an agreement with plaintiff.since then,husband has remained current in his monthly child support obligation.
in may than a month after husband was first ordered to pay child petitioned for dissolution of her marriage to husband.the following day,husband and wife executed a marital settlement agreement msa in connection with the divorce action.among other things,the divided the parties assets and debts.as part of the division of their marital property,husband conveyed his interest in all of the couple various real properties to wife,while she conveyed her interest in husband medical practice to him.the further provided that husband would be solely responsible for his extramarital child support obligation.spousal support was reserved.the was merged into a judgment of dissolution,which was entered in august.
by june,husband abandoned his medical practice.apart from a car and a pension plan,husband has no assets he has little income and lives with his mother in san francisco on a shoestring.
in june,plaintiff recorded a lis pendens,which gave notice of the pendency of plaintiff paternity action against husband,and which affected the real property awarded to wife in the dissolution.wife moved for leave to intervene in the paternity action in order to expunge the lis pendens.plaintiff moved to join wife as a party to the paternity action and sought to restrain her from transferring any of the real property.
the court heard the motions of wife and plaintiff in succession,then issued its findings and order.in that order,the court concluded that wife joinder in the paternity action was unwarranted because husband was current in his support obligations.the court further determined that plaintiff had no standing to challenge husband property transfer to wife.based on those determinations,the court denied plaintiff motion to join wife and it granted wife motion to expunge the lis pendens.that order was entered in october.
the following month,plaintiff filed this action.in her first amended complaint,plaintiff alleged that the marital property division,which was made pursuant to the msa,was a fraudulent transfer by husband to wife that was intended to defraud,hinder,and delay plaintiff in her collection of future child support.the complaint sought to set aside husband real property transfers to wife.
in march,husband and wife each answered plaintiff complaint with general denials and various affirmative defenses.both husband and wife asserted the affirmative defense that the real property transfers were effectuated as part of the parties dissolution judgment.
a year later,husband made a defense summary judgment motion.husband based his motion on the lack of evidence that he harbored any actual fraudulent intent and on proof that he received adequate consideration in the property division.in opposition to the motion,plaintiff submitted evidence,in the form of expert opinion,that husband did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for his real property transfers to wife and that the rendered husband insolvent.neither party explicitly addressed the threshold question of the applicability of fraudulent transfer law to the marital property division,nor did the trial court 
after a hearing in july,the court granted husband summary judgment motion.the court found that it was undisputed that there was no actual intent to defraud and further found that husband was not rendered insolvent by the transfers.the court stated reason for its insolvency ruling was that the future stream of child support payments,being an unmatured debt,could not be valued fairly for purposes of assessing solvency.the formal order granting husband summary judgment motion was entered on july.
thereafter,the parties entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment,which was filed in september.
this timely appeal by plaintiff followed.in response to plaintiff opening brief on appeal,husband filed a respondent brief,in which wife joined.
appealability 
before turning to the merits of the controversy,we first address the threshold issue of whether the judgment is appealable since the question of appealability goes to our jurisdiction citations.olson cory cal d.accord,jennings marralle cal th,d.
as a general proposition,a party may not appeal from a consent judgment.norgart upjohn cal th,d.parties can not create by stipulation appellate jurisdiction where none otherwise exists.don jose restaurant,truck ins.exchange th,d,fn.omitted.but there is an exception for cases in which consent was given solely to facilitate an appeal following adverse determination of a critical issue.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.this is such a case.here,it is apparent from the stipulated judgment that the parties did not intend to settle their dispute fully and finally,but merely to hasten its transfer from the superior court to the court of appeal.id.at,d.
we therefore consider plaintiff appeal on its merits.
we first decide whether marital settlement agreements are subject to the ufta.we then assess whether the record discloses a disputed material fact issue requiring a trial on plaintiff complaint.
discussion 
is a division of marital property subject to the ufta 
to properly address the first question before us,we begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review.we then examine the separate statutory schemes that govern marital property divisions and fraudulent transfers.finally,we consider the interplay between the two statutes.
standard of review.
the issues in this appeal present questions of law involving statutory interpretation.as such,we are not bound by the trial court decision and we conduct an independent review.citation.county of yolo los rios community college dist.th,d.accord,monastra konica business machines,th,d dean superior court th,d.
b.the governing statutes.
the ufta permits defrauded creditors to reach property in the hands of a transferee.see.the applicable provision of the family code protects property transferred to a spouse incident to divorce.neither statute explicitly refers to the other.before attempting to harmonize the two statutory schemes,we review each in turn.
uniform fraudulent transfer act.
in,california adopted the ufta.stats,ch.see generally,witkin,cal.procedure ed.enforcement of judgment.like all fraudulent transfer statutes,california law has its basis in the statute of elizabeth.in re pajaro dunes rental agency.see also ufta pt.ii west laws ann.uniform fraudulent transfer act,prefatory note.and see legislative committee addition,west ed.foll.in the united states,state fraudulent conveyance law in the twentieth century has been expressed through the uniform fraudulent conveyance act ufca,and its successor,the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.in re pajaro dunes rental agency,supra,at.see also,wyzard goller th,d.california repealed the ufca and enacted the ufta in.in re pajaro dunes rental agency,supra,at witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.the ufta carries forward many provisions of the prior law.see,reddy gonzalez th,d.there are a number of differences between the revised statute and its predecessor as well.see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.but none of those differences affects our analysis here.california version of the ufta also varies from the uniform law in a number of respects.see ufta pt.ii west laws,supra,uniform fraudulent transfer act,and ufta pt.ii west laws ann.supp.uniform fraudulent transfer act.see also,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.again,however,none of those variations affects this case.
the ufta proscribes fraudulent conveyances.a fraudulent conveyance is a transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.yaesu electronics tamura th,d.the purpose of the statute is to prevent debtors from placing property which legitimately should be available for the satisfaction of demands of creditors beyond their reach chichester mason.d,construing predecessor statute accord,fross wotton.cal d.this act,like its predecessor and the statute of elizabeth,declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims.legislative committee addition,west,supra,foll.
under the ufta,a transfer is fraudulent,as to both present and future creditors,if it is made w ith actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.such transfers are sometimes referred to as fraudulent in fact.see,scholes lehmann cir.see generally,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.
even in the absence of actual fraudulent intent,a transfer may be fraudulent as to present creditors if the debtor did not receive a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.such constructively fraudulent transfers are sometimes called fraudulent in law.scholes lehmann,supra,at.see generally,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.
defrauded creditors may set aside transfers that are either actually or constructively fraudulent,subd.a monastra konica business machines,supra,th at,d reddy gonzalez,supra,th at,d in re cohen cal.fraud,in the sense of morally culpable conduct,need not be present in either category of fraudulent transfer.in re cohen,supra,at.
on its face,the ufta expansively applies to all transfers,with no explicit exception for transfers incident to a divorce.see,subd.i.
the family code.
the family code was enacted in,operative january.stats,ch.the family code collected and reorganized the major family law statutes,which had been scattered in various codes family code with official comments cal.law revision com.consistent with its legislative directive,the commission did not attempt to make major substantive revisions in the law.ibid.the family code thus continues the substance of the prior family law act,codified at former civil code sections,which dealt with marriage,dissolution,custody,support,property rights during marriage,marital agreements,and property division.family code with official comments cal.law revision com,supra,fn.
a decade before the family code became effective,the legislature overhauled the law governing the liability of marital property on divorce when it enacted the family law act.see former civil code sections,stats,ch,see now,family code sections.see,recommendation relating to liability of marital property for debts cal.law revision com.in the legislature materially altered the postmarital liability of spouses.the legislature determined that,under most circumstances,after a marriage has ended,it is unwise to continue the liability of spouses for community debts incurred by former spouses.dawes rich th,d.consistent with that view,the legislature enacted former civil code section.stats,ch.under that statute,property received in a divorce was not liable for debts of the recipient spouse,unless the recipient was assigned the debt or there was a lien on the property.former civil code section,subd.a,stats,ch.when it first limited the liability of marital property in,the legislature reversed more than a century of law.dawes rich,supra,th at,d.but the legislature did not act in derogation of creditors rights in adopting former civil code section to the contrary,w hen the legislature enacted that statute,it was contemplated that i n allocating the debts to the parties,the court in the dissolution proceeding should take into account the rights of creditors so there will be available sufficient property to satisfy the debt by the person to whom the debt is assigned,provided the net division is equal.lezine security pacific fin.services,cal th,d,quoting recommendation relating to liability of marital property for debts cal.law revision com,supra,fn.omitted.in former civil code section was reenacted without substantive change as family code section.dawes rich,supra,th at,d.see also,in re marriage of braendle th,fn,d.
thus,pursuant to statutes in place since,property received upon dissolution of marriage generally is not liable for debts incurred by the recipient,subd.a.the statute makes two explicit exceptions to the general rule of.first,property awarded to the spouse is liable for debts assigned to the recipient.ibid.second,property remains liable after division for the satisfaction of a lien on that property.ibid.see also,lezine security pacific fin.services,supra,cal th,d.family code section does not explicitly except fraudulent transfers from its operation.
in this case,under the relevant family code provisions,the property awarded to wife on dissolution would not be liable for husband child support obligation.that obligation is treated as a premarital debt incurred by husband,which was properly confirmed to him on dissolution.see.under the general rule of,wife share of the community property received in the divorce is not liable for husband premarital debt,subd.a.and neither of the two statutory exceptions to the general rule applies here husband child support obligation was not assigned to wife,nor did it create a lien on the community property.ibid.
based solely on the applicable family code provision,then,the property awarded to wife in the divorce would not be liable for husband extramarital child support obligation.
interplay between the statutes.
as noted above,the ufta nominally applies to all transfers,making no express exception for transfers incident to a divorce.see,subd.i see also.but the family code provision that protects property in the hands of an appears equally absolute on its face and makes no explicit reference to fraudulent transfers.therefore,in order to determine the statutes proper relationship to each other,and to resolve the question of whether marital property divisions may constitute fraudulent transfers,we must look beyond the four corners of the two statutes.
statutory construction.
we begin our analysis with familiar rules of statutory construction.pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.in determining legislative intent,we first look to the statutory language itself.ibid.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.id.at.thus,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect.moore panish cal d.see also,united farm workers of america agricultural labor relations bd.th,d county of yolo los rios community college,supra,th at,d.in construing a statute,all acts relating to the same subject matter should be read together as if one law and harmonized if possible,even though they may have been passed at different times and regardless of the fact that one of them may deal specifically and in greater detail with a particular subject while the other may not.citations.in re marriage of williams d.where as here two codes are to be construed,they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute.citation.accordingly,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.citation.tripp swoap cal d,overruled on another point in frink prod cal d.
applying the above principles,we start with the language of the two statutes.
as noted above,the ufta uses expansive language,defining transfers to include every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset,subd.i.the ufta expressly excepts from its operation only certain transfers that result from lease terminations or lien enforcement,subd.e.there are no explicit exceptions for transfers incident to a divorce.furthermore,the ufta provides that,unless otherwise expressly provided by statute,other laws of whatever kind which apply to transactions also covered by the fraudulent transfer act supplement that act and do not supplant or supersede it.monastra konica business machines,supra,th at,d,original italics,citing.an expansive reading is consistent with the purpose of the law to protect creditors.chichester mason,supra,d at.
by contrast,the language of family code section is more circumscribed.for one thing,family code section explicitly overrides only the provisions of the chapter in which it is contained that proviso suggests a confined reach for family code section other laws.for another thing,although the statute generally prohibits a creditor resort to property received in a divorce,it provides for reimbursement from the debtor spouse in the event that the creditor in fact reaches the property,subd.b.see also.see generally,recommendation relating to liability of marital property for debt cal.law revision com,supra.the reimbursement provision furthers one of the statute purposes,which is to divide property and debts equitably as between the divorcing spouses.see,in re marriage of williams,supra,d at.and see,et to some extent,the statute emphasis on relations between the spouses at least suggests a limited reach outside the marital context.
we next consider the two statutes with reference to the whole system of law of which each is a part.
the ufta must be construed as part of a uniform system of law,cortez vogt th,d.thus,in interpreting and construing the act,it is appropriate to consult the decisions of other jurisdictions in which the act has been adopted.d creditors rights and remedies,fn.omitted,citing neumeyer crown funding d.disapproved on other grounds in liodas sahadi cal d,fn.see also,fraudulent conveyances,fn.a number of jurisdictions with identical or substantially similar versions of the ufta have concluded that a property division incident to a divorce can constitute a fraudulent conveyance under the ufta.see,dowell dennis.div,creditor may collaterally attack a divorce decree as a fraudulent transfer under the ufta summary judgment for former wife and husband reversed greeninger cromwell,division of marital property on divorce subject to ufta summary judgment for tortfeasor husband and his former wife reversed kardynalski fisher d,judgment for former wife reversed scholes lehmann,supra,at transfer fraudulent in re pilavis,property division subject to ufta,absent bargaining and adequate consideration,federal deposit ins.malin cir,under new york law,separation agreement was a conveyance,but was a purchaser for fair consideration atlantic bank of new york toscanini,same road runner inn,merrill utah,under particular circumstances,property division was not a fraudulent transfer.but compare,britt damson cir,federal court,construing washington law,noted the absence of any state court decision setting aside property division as a fraudulent transfer witbart witbart,after remand,without discussing ufta,state appellate court held that a separation agreement was not a conveyance.the interpretation given this uniform law in other jurisdictions thus suggests that the ufta reach properly extends to marital property divisions.
we next consider family code section with reference to the system of law of which it is a part.broadly speaking,family code section is part of community property law in california.our state community property system generally promotes the maximum protection of creditors rights with minimum procedural burdens,at least during marriage.recommendation relating to liability of marital property for debts cal.law revision com,supra,see also,id.at.more narrowly,section is contained in division of the family code,which governs rights and obligations while married.the overall focus of that division is on the legal relationship between spouses,not on their relationships with third parties that focus suggests a more circumscribed application of section outside the marital relationship.
after applying the primary rules of statutory construction,it appears that the legislature intended an expansive reading of the ufta and a more confined reach for family code section.but we are not satisfied that the primary principles of statutory construction conclusively resolve the question before us.
we therefore turn to secondary rules of interpretation,with resort to extrinsic aids,such as legislative history and,where appropriate,to the use of intrinsic aids,such as maxims,as guides to construction.see,texas commerce bank garamendi th,d.see generally,singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.criteria of interpretation.one such maxim is expressio unis est exclusio alterius the expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed.gikas zolin cal th,d,citing,fair employment housing,supra,cal d,fn.see generally,in re christopher th,d singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,supra,intrinsic aids.in the family code,the legislature expressly referred to fraudulent transfer law in connection with transmutations,while it was silent concerning application of the ufta to marital property divisions on divorce.compare,and.but we are not persuaded that the express reference to the ufta in one section of the family code necessarily implies its exclusion in a subsequent section,lewis nelson sons,clovis unified school dist.th,d prejudgment interest against public entity allowed under both subdivisions of civil code section,even though only subdivision a expressly permits such an award.and,dean superior court,supra,th at,d section of the elections code,which governs local elections,impliedly limits candidate comments about opponent,while section,governing judicial elections,does so expressly.the maxim is no magical incantation,nor does it refer to an immutable rule.estate of banerjee cal d.furthermore,this particular canon of construction typically is applied to statutes that enumerate particular inclusions or exceptions,with the effect that unlisted items are excluded.see,people reed cal th,d,estate of banerjee,supra,cal d at,fn,dean superior court,supra,th at,d united farm workers of america agricultural labor relations,supra,th at,d.there is no statutory enumeration in this case.nor is there any manifest reason to imply exclusion here.in short,this is not a proper case for application of the maxim expressio unis est exclusio alterius as an aid to construction.nor do any other intrinsic aids assist us in construing the statutes at issue here.see generally,singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,supra,intrinsic aids,ch.
with no assistance from intrinsic aids to statutory construction,we look to the legislative history of the statutes.see,texas commerce bank garamendi,supra,th at,d halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.see generally,singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,supra,extrinsic history,ch.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.in examining the legislative history of the ufta,we look both to our state enactment of the law and to the uniform act itself.prior to our state adoption of the ufta,the california state bar weighed in on the proposed law.see,margaret sheneman,the state bar of california business law section mem.to judith harper,legislative representative on bill uniform fraudulent transfer act,april,state bar report.addressing policy considerations,the state bar report said serious consideration needs to be given to the effect of this statute in areas such as leveraged buyouts of businesses,marital property agreements,and foreclosure sales of real property to name a few examples.id.at,italics added.no legislative action was taken to exclude such transfers,however as for the uniform law,the official comment to section mentions various examples of transfers that may be subject to the act,even though they are not amenable to perfection ufta pt.ii west laws,supra,uniform fraudulent transfer act,comment.those examples include the execution of a marital or premarital agreement for the disposition of property owned by the parties to the agreement emphasis added.the history of the ufta thus suggests that the legislature was aware of its possible application to marital property agreements but took no action to avoid that possibility.by contrast,the history of the family code is generally silent regarding fraudulent transfer law,simply continuing the provision making transmutations subject to the ufta furthermore,there were no conforming amendments to the ufta when the family code was enacted,although other statutes were amended to conform to the new code see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,enforcement of judgment.
taken together,the history of the two statutes suggests that the ufta was intended to extend to marital property divisions.but however suggestive of intent the statutes legislative histories may be,they are not dispositive of that question.therefore,we cautiously take the third and final step in statutory construction and apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.halbert lumber,lucky stores,supra,th at,d.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.this step in statutory interpretation requires us to analyze the policy considerations at issue here.
a number of important policies come into play here,some of which are in direct opposition to each other.for example,the policy of protecting defrauded creditors collides with the countervailing policy of protecting innocent.a second set of contravening policy considerations is also present here,which may be summarized as finality versus fairness.thus,the policy of giving effect to a divorcing couple property agreement,and of assuring the finality of a judgment based on that agreement,must be balanced against the countervailing goal of deterring misconduct.in examining this second set of competing policies,we observe that marital property divisions may be set aside in various other circumstances,including state law actions between spouses and federal bankruptcy proceedings.
setting aside property divisions actions between spouses.
at the outset,we acknowledge that marital property agreements have long been favored under the law.property settlement agreements occupy a favored position in the law of this state and are sanctioned by the civil code citations.such agreements are usually made with the advice of counsel after careful negotiations,and the courts,in accord with legislative sanction,prefer agreement rather than litigation.citation.when the parties have finally agreed upon the division of their property,the courts are loath to disturb their agreement except for equitable considerations.a property settlement agreement,therefore,that is not tainted by fraud or compulsion or is not in violation of the confidential relationship of the parties is valid and binding on the court.citations.adams adams cal d,italics added.
despite their favored position in the law,marital settlement agreements that have not been merged into a judgment may be set aside on traditional contract law grounds.in re marriage of egedi th,d.see also,subd.b.in addition,such agreements may be vacated if they are inequitable.in re marriage of egedi,supra,th at,d.
even where a marital settlement agreement has been merged into the dissolution judgment,as in this case,the resulting property division still may be set aside in an action by the defrauded spouse.see,subd.a actual fraud as a ground for setting aside the judgment rubenstein rubenstein th,d in re marriage of stevenot d,in re marriage of braendle,supra,th at,d only a spouse may bring an action under family code section to adjudicate an omitted community asset or liability.in addition to fraud,the legislature has enumerated other statutory grounds for vacating a dissolution judgment.see,subds.b e.the legislature made clear its reasons for doing so the public policy of assuring finality of judgments must be balanced against the public interest in ensuring proper division of marital property,in ensuring sufficient support awards,and in deterring misconduct,subd.c.
thus,under state statutory law,a marital property division may be set aside if it is fraudulent or otherwise invalid as between the divorced spouses.
moreover,even in situations where the property division is valid as between the parties,it may be challenged by affected third parties in some circumstances.see,mcgee allen cal d.one such circumstance is bankruptcy.
setting aside property divisions bankruptcy proceedings.
bankruptcy proceedings are particularly relevant to our analysis because of the close interrelationship between applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and the ufta.see ufta pt.ii west laws,supra,uniform fraudulent transfer act,prefatory note.see also,rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,assem d reading analysis of bill as amended july.see also,supra,fraudulent conveyances,fn.in the first place,the ufta definition of transfer is derived principally from section of the bankruptcy code.legislative committee addition,par,west,supra,foll,see now section of the bankruptcy code.furthermore,there are significant parallels between fraudulent transfer analysis in bankruptcy proceedings and in ufta actions in re united energy cir,in re maddalena,in re pajaro dunes rental agency,supra,at.of particular importance in this case is section of the bankruptcy code,which permits the trustee to avoid fraudulent transfers findings made under of the bankruptcy code are applicable to actions brought under the ufta,because the provisions parallel each other.in re crystal medical products.see also in re gillissie.
significantly,marital property divisions are vulnerable to as fraudulent transfers in bankruptcy proceedings.for purposes of bankruptcy law,it is now well settled that a transfer of property pursuant to a collusive divorce decree or property settlement intended to hinder,delay or defraud creditors or pursuant to a divorce decree or property settlement for inadequate consideration,leaving the debtor insolvent constitutes a transfer as defined under of the bankruptcy code.in re hope,fn.omitted.see also,cases cited therein,id.at,fn.this is true notwithstanding judicial recognition of the inherent conflict between commercial law and family law concepts.see,in re sorlucco,acknowledging the dilemma of trying to apply fraudulent transfer concepts normally applied in commercial settings to the noncommercial context of a divorce proceeding.
under federal bankruptcy law,then,a marital property division may be set aside as a fraudulent transfer.
setting aside property divisions applicability of ufta.
although marital property agreements and judgments may be vacated for the benefit of bankruptcy creditors or defrauded spouses,the question remains whether they may be set aside for the benefit of nonbankruptcy creditors as a fraudulent transfer under state law.to answer that question,we look to california case law for guidance,starting with decisions involving transfers during marriage.
property transfers made during marriage.
a longstanding and unbroken line of california cases holds that property transfers between spouses,if made during marriage,may be subject to under the ufta and its predecessor statutes.see,frankel boyd cal,reddy gonzalez,supra,th,d.
spouses may transfer property during marriage by transmutation.a transmutation is an interspousal transaction or agreement that works a change in the character of the property.citation.in re marriage of campbell th,d.accord,in re marriage of haines th,d.see,married persons may transmute the character of their property by agreement or transfer.by statute,transmutations are subject to the laws governing fraudulent transfers.see also,reddy gonzalez,supra,th,d sanwa bank chang th,d state bd.of equalization woo th,d.
plaintiff argues that marital property transmutations may occur incident to dissolution.we disagree.the statute recognizes transmutations by married persons.we acknowledge that the statutory definition of married persons may include persons who were previously lawfully married to each other,as is appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case.despite that,case law in this area clearly implies that transmutations occur only during an ongoing marriage.see,tompkins bishop d,spouses may transmute property during the marriage,in re marriage of campbell,supra,th at,d transmutations may be made before or during marriage and see,statutory marital property rights may be altered by a premarital or marital agreement,premarital agreement effective upon marriage.the same inference may be drawn from expert family law commentary on the subject.see generally,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,marital agreements are those executed by husband and wife during marriage and affecting marital rights and obligations incident to an ongoing marriage this is a broad category,encompassing,among other things,transmutation agreements altering property status 
at oral argument,plaintiff conceded that transmutations are generally understood to occur in ongoing marriages,but argued that there is no reason a transmutation can not occur upon dissolution.again,we disagree.in doing so,we recognize at least one key distinction between transmutations during marriage and the division of marital property incident to divorce.an agreement to transmute property may be made without consideration.by contrast,as a general rule,agreements dividing marital property on divorce must be supported by consideration see,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.see also,which generally requires an equal division of the community estate.that distinction lends strength to the common understanding of transmutations as occurring in an ongoing marriage.the legislature placement of the provisions on transmutation in the division of the family code entitled rights and obligations during marriage further bolsters that inference.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that property divisions incident to divorce do not constitute transmutations.thus,the unassailable fact that a statute expressly subjects transmutations to fraudulent transfer laws does not definitively resolve the question whether marital property divisions on divorce are likewise subject to the ufta.
division of marital property on divorce.
the opinions in a number of older california cases support the proposition that a divorcing couple property division may constitute a fraudulent transfer.see,mcknight superior court d.award of property to wife on divorce may be set aside as fraudulent transfer mcknight faber d.disapproved on another point in silberg anderson cal d,later appeal in same case summary judgment for wife reversed nicolos grover d.divorcing couple property division successfully challenged as fraudulent conveyance by husband bankruptcy trustee costello poole d.bankruptcy trustee successfully sued to set aside property settlement under california law in re chappel,transfer incident to divorce challenged under both bankruptcy code and california law stearns los angeles city school dist.d.executory agreement to convey to may constitute fraudulent conveyance,carman athearn d,no where defrauded wife reconveyed property on divorce stevenson stevenson d,no in favor of divorcing husband who conveyed property to wife to keep it out of reach of potential tort creditor.we note,however,that those decisions all predate the adoption of family code section and its predecessor thus,at the time the foregoing decisions were rendered,creditors were permitted to reach property in the hands of the spouse.under the current family law statute,that is no longer the case.for that reason,we question the precedential value of these older opinions in resolving the issue before us.
since the adoption of family code section and its predecessor,only one california case has squarely addressed the issue of whether marital property divisions are subject to fraudulent transfer law that case is gagan gouyd,supra,th,d.
in gagan,the fourth district court of appeal held that a transfer of assets provided in a marital settlement agreement is not a fraudulent conveyance.gagan gouyd,supra,th at,d.the court based its determination on several factors.as pertinent here the court first noted the apparent lack of case law support for the proposition that property transfers incident to divorce are subject to fraudulent transfer laws.id.at,d.the court next observed that the debt,apparently the result of the husband tort,was not assigned to the wife as a part of the dissolution proceeding.the wife therefore should not be held liable for the husband intentional tort citation.ibid.finally,the court concluded,as a matter of policy,we believe that to engraft the fraudulent transfer remedies onto a valid and approved marital settlement agreement would result in needlessly complicating the already emotionally laden dissolution process.it might result in the unraveling of a dissolution agreement painstakingly negotiated between the parties and their attorneys.we do not carry the rights of an alleged defrauded creditor that far,absent the express intent by the legislature to do so.plaintiff has provided us with no evidence of such intent.id.at,d.
we respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached in gagan.
to begin with,we do not find any of the stated reasons for the court decision persuasive.the gagan court grounded its decision in part on the parties failure to cite any authority on the issue.but the lack of precedent is not a determinative factor when a question of first impression is involved.the gagan court also relied on the fact that the debt at issue there had been assigned to the husband,the one who incurred it.but the court analysis on that point addresses only the effect of family code section standing alone it fails to consider the interplay between the family code and the ufta.finally,the gagan court rested its decision on policy considerations,particularly its concern that property agreements might unravel in the face of claims by alleged defrauded creditors.but,as we have seen,marital settlements and even judgments are vulnerable in other situations permeated by fraud,a point that the gagan court did not discuss.
in our view,more thorough analysis compels the contrary marital property settlements and judgments are subject to fraudulent transfer laws.we reach that conclusion by applying relevant principles of statutory construction and by considering analogous circumstances in which marital property divisions may be set aside.we do not believe that the legislature intended the family code provisions to operate as a shield for fraud,monastra konica business machines,supra,th at,d compliance with bulk sales act does not shield against ufta liability.if the legislature intends to shield property divisions in dissolution actions from liability under the ufta,it should adopt an express provision to that effect.
as a final point albeit one that is unnecessary to our decision,we observe that the general rule we adopt here is bolstered by policy considerations specific to this case.here,the creditor is owed child support california has a strong public policy in favor of providing adequate child support.see,county of kern castle th,d stewart gomez th,d.that policy is expressed in statutes embodying the statewide uniform child support guideline.see.the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.california strong policy favoring child support also finds expression in other state laws.for example,various statutes elevate child support debts over other obligations.see,child support must be paid before other debts,subd.b child right to support may not be abrogated by parents agreement,child support judgment is exempt from renewal requirement,court may order deposit of assets to secure child support arrearages.recognizing the high regard accorded child support in this state,we are particularly loath to subjugate a child support debt to a potentially fraudulent marital property division.
in sum,we conclude that a creditor may challenge a marital property division as a fraudulent transfer.
ii.is there a material fact question as to whether the marital property division in this case was fraudulent 
standard and scope of review.
since summary judgment involves pure matters of law,we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.buss superior court cal th,d,barton elexsys,th,d.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons for its summary judgment.rubenstein rubenstein,supra,th at,d.we review the ruling,not its rationale.citation.ibid.
in undertaking our independent review of the evidence submitted,we apply the same analysis as the trial court.first,we identify the issues framed by the pleadings.next,we determine whether the moving party has established facts justifying judgment in its favor.finally,if the moving party has carried its initial burden,we decide whether the opposing party has demonstrated the existence of a triable,material fact issue.varni.wine world,th,d.
summary judgment 
a summary judgment motion shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,the moving party must show by admissible evidence that the action has no merit or that there is no defense thereto.code civ,subd.a.a defendant moving for summary judgment meets this burden by presenting evidence demonstrating that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to the action.code civ,subd.o aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,addy bliss glennon th,d.once the defendant makes this showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or defense.code civ,subd.o.see,aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.material facts are those that relate to the issues in the case as framed by the pleadings.juge county of sacramento th,d.the moving party evidence is strictly construed,while that of the opponent is liberally construed.molko holy spirit cal d,murillo rite stuff foods,th,d.
fact questions.
with those principles in mind,we review the evidence presented below in order to determine whether any material factual disputes require trial in this matter,either as to actual fraud or as to constructive fraud.
actual fraud.
transfers made with actual intent to defraud creditors are actionable under civil code section,subdivision a.the question of actual fraudulent intent is always one of fact.bulmash davis cal d,fross wotton,supra,cal d at,neumeyer crown funding,supra,d at.
here,the parties dispute whether husband actually intended to defraud plaintiff,his creditor,when he entered into the marital settlement agreement.neither party offered direct evidence of husband intent.husband submitted a declaration in support of his summary judgment motion,but it contains no express declaration that he lacked fraudulent intent.however,he did declare i feel that the was fair and equitable under all the circumstances.in support of his assertion that the was fair,husband submitted evidence of the value of the couple assets.plaintiff disputed husband claim that the provided a fair and equitable property distribution,citing her expert low appraisal of value for husband medical practice.additionally,in answers to interrogatories,which were part of the record below,plaintiff stated her belief that the marital settlement agreement was executed in response to the child support order and in anticipation of further such orders.plaintiff answers to interrogatories also cited six badges of fraud constituting circumstantial evidence of husband actual fraudulent intent.see legislative committee addition,west,supra,foll.the record contains undisputed evidence of two of those badges of fraud the transfer was to an insider a spouse,and the claim predated the transfer.the evidence below was in conflict as to the other four other claimed badges of fraud the parties disputed whether husband retained control over the transferred property,whether the transfer was of substantially all of husband assets,whether husband received a reasonably equivalent value for the transferred assets,and whether husband became insolvent as a result of the transfer.
on appeal,husband contends that the claimed badges of fraud are not evidence of fraudulent intent and,for that reason,they can not create a material fact dispute.it is certainly true,as husband points out,that the presence of one or more badges of fraud does not create a presumption of fraud.rather,it is merely evidence from which an inference of fraudulent intent may be drawn.legislative committee addition,west,supra,foll.it is equally true that an inference is not evidence.but the summary judgment statute requires the court to consider all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence code civ,subd.c.in ufta actions,p roof of fraudulent intent often consists of inferences from the circumstances surrounding the transaction citation.eddy temkin d,original italics.
of course,w hen opposition to a motion for summary judgment is based on inferences,those inferences must be reasonably deducible from the evidence,and not such as are derived from speculation,conjecture,imagination,or guesswork.citation.joseph di loreto,th,d.relying on that proposition,husband argues that the trial court was justified in refusing to infer actual fraudulent intent from the evidence in this case.we disagree.certainly,we recognize that the mere existence of some badges of fraud does not always raise a triable issue of material fact.see,wyzard goller,supra,th at,d despite the existence of several badges of fraud,no triable issue was raised,because the transfer was a preference in satisfaction of an undisputed antecedent debt.this may be particularly true in the context of marital property divisions,for several reasons.for one thing,where the transfer is incident to a divorce,it will always be to an insider.for another thing,a seeming inequity in the division of property on divorce may not signal fraud where,for example,the spouse receiving the greater share has waived support.see,matter of ottaviano,and cases cited therein release from spousal support obligation can constitute fair consideration for unequal marital property division,in re williams,particular transfer in lieu of spousal support fraudulent.thus the mere existence of one or more badges of fraud in the dissolution context will not always raise a triable material fact question.nevertheless,in the usual in the dissolution context or otherwise,it is for the to weigh and consider the evidentiary value of any badges of fraud.bank of california virtue scheck,d.
and in this case,given the nature of the disputed evidence,a could reasonably infer actual fraudulent intent without resorting to speculation.see,monastra konica business machines,supra,th at,d,joseph di loreto,supra,th at,d.in particular,an inference that the property division was motivated by an intent to put assets out of plaintiff reach may be reasonably drawn from the fact that the was executed less than a month after husband first incurred the child support debt.where the evidence presented in a summary judgment motion raises a reasonable inference,the judge hearing the motion is not permitted to ignore that inference,or to weigh it against other inferences or other evidence.murillo rite stuff foods,supra,th at,d.
as the moving party,husband had the initial burden of showing the lack of an actual intent to defraud plaintiff.assuming he made that showing,the burden then shifted to plaintiff,who submitted evidence of several badges of fraud.in the factual context of this case,plaintiff evidence gives rise to a reasonable inference of husband actual fraudulent intent.that inference,in turn,creates a disputed material fact issue that precludes the grant of summary judgment 
constructive fraud.
in addition to its prohibitions against actual fraud,the ufta prohibits constructive fraud.see,subd.b.as relevant here,existing creditors may seek to avoid transfers by debtors who do not receive reasonably equivalent value in return,and who are either insolvent at the time of the transfer or become insolvent as a result of it.
consideration.
what constitutes a fair consideration is a question of fact citation,and must be determined from the standpoint of the creditor.kirkland risso d,citations omitted decided under the ufca.in analyzing fair consideration or equivalent value,the court compares what the debtor surrendered and received.in re united energy,supra,at stearns los angeles city school,supra,d at.in this case,whether husband received equivalent value in the property division is a material disputed fact,as the trial court recognized and as husband and wife apparently concede.
husband and wife do not concede the existence of a material dispute concerning husband solvency after the property division.
under the ufta definition,a debtor is insolvent if,at fair valuations,the sum of the debtor debts is greater than all of the debtor assets,subd.a.as plaintiff correctly points out,insolvency is measured by a balance sheet test.see,costello poole,supra,d at.schwartz ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments and debts the rutter group.
to determine solvency,the value of a debtor assets and debts are compared.by statutory definition,a debtor assets exclude property that is exempt from judgment enforcement.civ.code,subd.a.retirement accounts are generally exempt.see,code civ,subd.b private pension plans generally exempt from judgment enforcement,subd.a exemptions apply to child support judgments.but see code civ,subd.c,which authorizes trial court proceedings to determine the extent to which the exempt property nevertheless shall be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment,yaesu electronics tamura,supra,th at,d judgment debtor pension plan was not exempt from enforcement because it was not designed and used for retirement purposes.when husband exempt retirement account is excluded,his sole asset is his medical practice.the medical practice had a value as low as at the time of the divorce,according to plaintiff appraisal evidence below.the value of husband medical practice his sole asset is then compared to the value of his obligation his sole debt.wife argues that husband total debt amounts to,his monthly support obligation since support is current.plaintiff argues here,as she did below,that husband total debt is the present value of the entire child support obligation then due,which plaintiff expert opined was between and.the trial court rejected plaintiff argument,determining that the unmatured portion of plaintiff claim could not be fairly valued.wife first defends the trial court determination as a matter of law,pointing to the lack of legal authority to support plaintiff calculations and arguing that plaintiff has suffered no injury since husband has kept his child support payments current.we disagree.the simple answer to wife contention is that the statute expressly recognizes an unmatured,contingent claim as a debt,subds.b,d.wife next defends the trial court determination on the facts,arguing that plaintiff expert erroneously calculated the future stream of payments by assuming a higher monthly support amount than what the court ordered.wife offers her own calculations,which are based on what she claims is the current support order of per month.according to wife calculations,husband total debt amounts to just under.as we noted above,however,plaintiff evidence though disputed by wife indicates that husband sole nonexempt asset may be valued as low as.if husband asset was worth only while the present value of his debt was at least,then he was insolvent.we express no opinion as to the ultimate outcome of the factual dispute concerning the value of husband assets and debts.we merely should be the material facts concerning solvency are in dispute.that factual dispute forecloses summary judgment in this case.
conclusion 
to summarize,as a matter of california law,we conclude that a property division incident to a marital dissolution is subject to creditor claims under the uniform fraudulent transfer act.
in addition,we find that there are material factual disputes on the question of whether the property division in this case constituted a fraudulent transfer under that act,and those disputes preclude summary judgment here.
disposition 
we reverse the judgment,and we remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.
plaintiff shall have costs on appeal.
the fourth district court of appeal reached the opposite conclusion in gagan gouyd th,d.
plaintiff moved to modify support in june.at the same time,plaintiff also sought an order requiring husband to obtain life insurance to secure his future child support payments.the court denied plaintiff request for life insurance without prejudice to later renewal of that motion.that ruling is not at issue in this appeal.
husband summary judgment motion was heard on july,the same day that the fourth district filed its opinion in gagan gouyd,supra,th,d.thus,at the time of the hearing,there was no california authority that expressly excepted marital settlement agreements from the ufta.it appears that the trial court and the parties operated on the assumption that the ufta applied to this case.
