reports abound on the shortage of quality options for california families.rising rates of employment among mothers with young children,initiatives to boost youngsters school readiness,and government recent push to move single mothers from welfare to work continue to spur family demand for organized and preschool programs.jacobson,et,understanding child care demand and supply issues new lessons from los angeles pace at.
for all working families,regardless of income,access to affordable,quality child care is essential.yet millions of families in california,even those who can afford to pay,struggle to find the child care they need.for some,the shortage of care is the main problem,since waiting lists for child care centers and family child care homes are commonplace.for others,the cost of care is a major burden.waiting lists for subsidized child care are especially long,due to insufficient funding.as in and,the supply of licensed care in met only a small fraction of the demand california child care resource referral network,the california child care portfolio at portfolio.
for the vast majority of working families affordable,quality child care services are an indispensable ingredient of every day life.yet the demand in california for such services,particularly for children five years old and younger,far exceeds the supply.under these circumstances contracts for child care services are necessarily affected with a public interest.accordingly,we hold a release of claims that purports to exculpate a child care provider from its own negligence is void as against public policy under tunkl regents of university of california cal d,tunkl.
factual and procedural background 
gavin and his parents sued the ymca of metropolitan los angeles and certain ymca employees for damages arising from an incident of sexual touching between gavin and another child in the ymca child care program.the trial court found a release of claims signed by gavin parents when they enrolled gavin in the program barred their claims for negligence and breach of contract.a jury rejected the family remaining claim.gavin and his parents have appealed,contending the release is unenforceable.we agree.
gavin participation in the ymca child care program 
gavin parents,calvin and annette,both worked full time.in june they enrolled gavin in the child care program at the ymca and,as part of the enrollment process,signed a waiver and release of liability in favor of the ymca.in september,when gavin was not quite four years old,he and emilio were observed in the bathroom at the child care center with their pants down.gavin later told his mother emilio had made him put emilio penis in his mouth.gavin parents subsequently discovered emilio had engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with another boy at the child care center some weeks earlier and had reported being molested by his grandfather.they also learned the ymca had been aware of those facts before the incident between gavin and emilio.
b.the lawsuit against the ymca 
gavin and his parents filed suit against the ymca for breach of contract,negligence fraud and several other intentional torts.the complaint alleged the ymca had knowledge of emilio propensity towards inappropriate sexual conduct and should have taken steps to protect gavin from emilio.
prior to trial,the ymca moved for disposition of issues of law prior to issues of fact.code civ.one of the issues identified was the effect of the release signed by gavin parents on the negligence claims.the trial court granted the motion and requested supplemental briefs on the validity of the release.
the parties stipulated to the following facts with respect to the validity of the release 
gavin attended the ymca child care program from june,to september.on the day of the alleged molestation,gavin was three years and ten months old.
the ymca child care program is accessible to the general public.
the ymca child care program provides a benefit to the general public,specifically the provision of affordable child care.
the child care industry is a regulated industry.
child care is not a recreational activity.
gavin parents left him in the care of ymca and its agents for purposes of child care on a regular basis.
the ymca requires a release and waiver of liability and indemnity agreement which contains the same contractual language to be signed by the parents of all participants in its child care program.
on june,plaintiffs calvin and annette signed the ymca release and waiver of indemnity agreement.
the text of the release was not included in the stipulation,nor was a copy of the release attached to the briefs filed by the parties in the trial court.however,the parties agree the relevant portion of the release provides 
the undersigned,hereby releases,waives,discharges and covenants not to sue the ymca,its directors,officers,employees,and agents hereinafter referred to as releasees from all liability to the undersigned,his personal representatives,assigns,heirs,and next of kin for any loss or damage,and any claim or demands therefor on account of injury to the person or property or resulting in death of the undersigned,whether caused by the negligence of the releasees or otherwise while the undersigned or such children is in,upon,or about the premises or any facilities or equipment therein or participating in the program affiliated with the ymca.
the undersigned hereby agrees to indemnify and save and hold harmless the releasees and each of them from any loss,liability,damage or cost they may incur due to the presence of the undersigned in,upon or about the ymca premises or in any way observing or using any facilities or equipment of the ymca or participating in any program affiliated with the ymca whether caused by the negligence of the releasees or otherwise.
the undersigned hereby assumes full responsibility for and risk of bodily injury,death or property damage due to the negligence of releasee or otherwise while in,about or upon the premises of the ymca while using the premises or any facilities or equipment thereon or participating in any program affiliated with the ymca.
c.the trial court ruling upholding the release 
after briefing and oral argument,the trial court ruled the release was enforceable and not void as against public policy.it therefore dismissed the cause of action for breach of contract and the three causes of action.
ultimately,the court dismissed all of the claims asserted by gavin and all but the fraud cause of action alleged by his parents.the jury then returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the ymca on the remaining claim.judgment was entered on august.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the notice of appeal encompasses the ruling on the ymca release 
gavin and his parents filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered on august.the ymca erroneously contends this notice preserves only the right to appeal from the jury verdict and does not permit appellate review of the trial court ruling on the special defense of the release.
trial on the issue of the release was conducted pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which provides that special defenses not involving the merits of the plaintiff cause of action but constituting a bar to the prosecution thereof may be tried before the trial of any other issue in the case.an order resulting from the trial of a special defense under code of civil procedure section is nonappealable,but is properly challenged on appeal from the final judgment.woodhouse pacific ry.d.
it is only when the decision on the trial of the special defense is that the entire action is barred by a prior judgment that the court is empowered to render judgment for the defendant who has pleaded the special defense.citations.when the court proceeds to try a special defense which does not constitute a bar to the entire action before the trial of any other issue,and the decision on such special defense is in favor of the defendant,the proper procedure is to make a minute order to that effect,proceed to the trial of the remaining issues,make findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues,and render judgment accordingly.in such a case,the decision of the court on the special defense and all rulings on it may be reviewed on appeal from the judgment.citations.people rath packing d.the appeal from the final judgment in this case properly encompassed the ruling on the trial of the special defense of the ymca release.see also california rules of court,rule a anderson th,d sufficiency of notice of appeal should be construed liberally.
standard of review 
the parties agree we should review the ruling of the trial court de novo,relying on ymca of metropolitan los angeles superior court th,d,in which division one of this court considered the same ymca release that is at issue in the present case.division one held that to determine whether the release is invalid,we conduct a de novo examination of the release document.where,as here,no conflicting parol evidence is introduced concerning the interpretation of the document,construction of the instrument is a question of law,and the appellate court will independently construe the writing.citation.citation citation.id.at,d.although ymca of metropolitan los angeles superior court,supra,th,d,involved an appeal after summary judgment,rather than after trial of a special defense,we agree de novo review is appropriate in this case where there were no disputed factual issues resolved in the trial court.
the trial court erred in basing its ruling on the specific facts of the alleged negligence in this case 
the trial court apparently believed its duty was to decide whether the ymca release should be enforced to bar the specific negligence claims raised by gavin and his parents at the hearing on the validity of the release,the trial court stated i have to look at the fact scenario and connect it with the industry involved and whether the waiver would be against public policy as to that particular activity.i have problems with alleged sexual molestation involving a and a.this was error.under tunkl,supra,cal d,determining whether a release of liability affects the public interest,and is thus void as a matter of public policy,requires analysis of the transaction giving rise to the the allegedly negligent conduct by the party invoking the release.id.at.
an agreement exculpating a child care provider from its own negligence is void as against public policy 
civil code section provides,all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.in tunkl,supra,cal d,the supreme court held,under this statute and the cases interpreting it,an exculpatory provision may stand only if it does not involve the public interest.id.at.traditionally the law has looked carefully and with some skepticism at those who attempt to contract away their legal liability for the commission of torts.citation.this general policy of the common law found legislative expression early in california history with the enactment of civil code section this section made it clear a party could not contract away liability for his fraudulent or intentional acts or for his negligent violations of statutory law.less clear was the status of negligent violations of common law standards of care.while acknowledging some conflict in the cases,witkin concludes california now follows the modern view of the restatement of contracts a contract exempting from liability for ordinary negligence is valid where no public interest is involved and no statute expressly prohibits it citation.the converse is also true,however.under civil code section a service provider can not exempt itself from liability even for ordinary negligence if the service it provides implicates the public interest.gardner downtown porsche audi d.gardner.
the tunkl court enumerated six factors to be considered in determining whether an exculpatory contract involves the public interest within the meaning of this rule in placing particular contracts within or without the category of those affected with a public interest,the courts have revealed a rough outline of that type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will be held invalid.thus the attempted but invalid exemption involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics.it concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.fn.omitted.the party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,fn.omitted.which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.fn.omitted.the party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it,or at least for any member coming within certain established standards.fn.omitted.as a result of the essential nature of the service,in the economic setting of the transaction,the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services.fn.omitted.in exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation,fn.omitted and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.fn.omitted.finally,as a result of the transaction,the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller,fn.omitted subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.tunkl,supra,cal d at.each of the tunkl factors is present in this case.
first,child care services are subject to comprehensive public regulation,as the parties acknowledged in their stipulation,california child day care facilities act,health,et child care and development services act,et.
second,without question child care services are of vital importance to the public,and a matter of practical necessity for most working parents in california.health,subd.e the legislature finds t hat good quality child day care services are an essential service for working parents.according to a study by the california child care resources and referral network,percent of children ages and under live in families with two employed parents or an employed single head of household.portfolio,at.for these children and their parents,participation in a child care program is not something that can easily be declined if the provider attaches unsatisfactory conditions to the service contract.see portfolio at as housing costs soar,fewer parents can afford to stay home with small children,yet there is only about one slot in a licensed child care setting for every five children with working parents.this lack of licensed care limits parents options.
in gardner,supra,d at page,we explained this element of the tunkl test appears to boil down to the following question is the service merely an optional item consumers can do without if they do want to waive their rights to recover for negligence or is it something they need enough so they have little choice if the provider attaches a liability disclaimer we then held automobile repair service was a vital,function,based in part on the necessity for californians to have cars to get to and from their places of employment.id.at.child care is certainly no less a vital need for the working parents of california.
third,as the parties stipulated,the ymca child care program is accessible to the general public.the ymca program provides care for any child whose parents wish to avail themselves of the service,subject to established standards such as the parents willingness to pay the fees charged and otherwise cooperate with the ymca.see tunkl,supra,cal d at,hospital selectivity in accepting patients does not negate its public aspect or the public interest in it.
fourth,the essential nature of child care necessarily gives the ymca a decisive advantage in bargaining strength with respect to parents who seek to use its services.see portfolio,at because of the shortage of care everywhere in the state,waiting lists are commonplace securing a slot in a child care program can seem as tough as getting into an ivy league school.al
