the united states and israel are both signatories to the hague convention which was adopted in to address the problem of intercountry child abduction under international law.the convention seeks to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention caused either by the removal of a child from the state of its habitual residence or the refusal to return a child to the state of its habitual residence.hague convention preamble,see mozes mozes,cir.the convention is not directed at kidnappings by strangers,but rather at the unilateral removal or retention of children by parents,guardians or close family members.beaumont mceleavy,the hague convention on international child abduction,cited in mozes,at.the principal objectives of the convention are to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.hague convention,see also silverman silverman,cir en banc silverman ii shalit coppe,cir.

b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.

when deciding whether a child was wrongfully removed under this article,a court must thus determine when the removal or retention took place,what the habitual residence of the child was immediately prior to the removal,whether the removal or retention violated the petitioner custody rights under the law of habitual residence,and whether the petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of the removal.see mozes,at.once it is determined that a child who was habitually residing in a contracting state was wrongfully removed to or retained in another,the convention requires that the country in which the child is located order the return of the child forthwith.hague convention.moreover,until it has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this convention,the authorities of the contracting state responsible for child custody determinations shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody.id.
a case arising from a petition under the hague convention is not a custody proceeding.a united states district court has authority to determine the merits of an abduction claim,but not the merits of the underlying custody claim.shalit,at see b hague convention.the district court is to ascertain only whether the removal or retention of a child was wrongful under the law of the child habitual residence,and if so,to order the return of the child to the place of the habitual residence for the court there to decide the merits of the custody dispute.shalit,at.
