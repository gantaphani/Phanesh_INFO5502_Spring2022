james lynn,appeals from an order directing him to pay spousal support and attorney fees to his,patricia lynn shirey the amount of the support order is identical to the amount of a property settlement james was ordered to pay patricia upon their divorce in.however,this property settlement obligation was subsequently discharged in james bankruptcy in.therefore he contends the support order has,in effect,improperly reinstated the discharged property settlement under the guise of spousal support.while we will conclude the court properly could have considered the discharged debt in reassessing james support obligation,we will reverse the support order because the court failed to also consider the other statutory factors governing its decision.
factual and procedural background 
james and patricia married in and separated over years later in.james petitioned for dissolution,and a judgment was entered later that year as to marital status only.the court reserved ruling on the issues of child support,spousal support,and the distribution of community assets and liabilities.
the court considered the matter of child support in october of.at that time,the couple still had two minor children a son jason living with james,and an son justin living with patricia.james was earning per month working as a driver in the waste disposal business patricia was receiving unemployment benefits of per month while enrolled in a nursing program.based on these figures,the court ordered james to pay child support to patricia for justin,plus arrearages.the court reserved the issue of spousal support.
the court issued another order the following month in regard to the distribution of the marital property.the net effect of the order was to require james to make a property settlement or equalizing payment to patricia in the amount of.the court made no spousal support order.
james did not make the payment.instead,in january of,he filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy act.he listed among his outstanding debts the unpaid property settlement due patricia,which,with the addition of interest,had grown to.this debt was eventually discharged in the bankruptcy.
on october,patricia filed a motion for modification of spousal support asking the court to order james to pay her the original amount of the discharged property settlement in the form of support,at the rate of per month.she based the motion on section of the family code she also requested james be ordered to pay her for her attorney fees.james filed a declaration in opposition to the motion claiming,in general,that the property settlement order had been inequitable.
by this point,patricia was earning per month as a registered nurse,and had monthly expenses,according to her declaration,of.justin,who was then years old,was living with his father.james was earning about per month as a waste disposal driver,and reported his expenses were per month.
at a hearing on december,the court ordered the parties to submit their arguments in writing.in his written opposition,james argued once again that the property settlement had been inequitable because many of the assumptions upon which it was based turned out to be incorrect.he also noted briefly that section applies only to the discharge in bankruptcy of obligations under settlement agreements.patricia,in her written arguments in support of the motion,conceded this last point,but maintained she was entitled to the same amount of support,per month,based on the factors set out in section for determining spousal support.
on march,the court issued the following written order 
pursuant to family code,james pay patricia the amount of as and for spousal support,at the rate of per month,commencing april,and on or before the of each month until paid in full.the court further orders,james pay as and for attorney fees,at the rate of per month,commencing april,and on or before the of each month until paid in full.if any one payment is more than days late then the entire amount will become due and payable and interest will accrue at the legal rate.
notice of entry of the order was filed five days later on march.
also on march,patricia obtained an order assigning of james wages to her every month.on april,james filed an ex parte application to stay the wage assignment order.he maintained the sum of the spousal support and attorney fee orders,when added to his monthly mortgage payment and his obligation to the bankruptcy trustee,would exceed his pay without regard to any of his other living expenses.a hearing on the application for stay was set for may.
on may,james filed a timely notice of appeal from the court spousal support order.there is nothing in the record explaining what happened at the may hearing.
discussion 
property settlement payments ordered in dissolution proceedings to effect the equitable division of community property,as opposed to payments for spousal or child support,are dischargeable in bankruptcy.in re siragusa cir,siragusa a.
it is now firmly established in california law that certain types of debts arising from a division of community property on dissolution are properly dischargeable in bankruptcy a n alimony judgment or a judgment which can properly be construed as being for alimony is not affected by a discharge in bankruptcy.however,it has been squarely held in california that,where the parties have entered into a property settlement agreement whereby payments are thereafter to be made to the wife,not for support but in settlement of property rights,the discharge in bankruptcy of the husband discharges the debt.citations.in re marriage of williams d.williams see generally hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,to.
further,the discharge of a debt in bankruptcy operates as an injunction prohibiting a creditor thereafter from taking any action to collect or recover the debt.siragusa,supra,at williams,supra,d at.thus,for example,the court in a dissolution action may not revive the wife discharged property settlement debt by using it as an offset against the husband periodic payment of retirement benefits to her.williams,supra,d at.
however,the court may consider the discharge in bankruptcy of one spouse property settlement debt as a factor in determining whether to modify that spouse support obligation.siragusa,supra,at.in siragusa,the husband and wife in a divorce action brought in nevada agreed to a division of their marital property that required the husband to pay the wife million in monthly installments to buy her share of a community medical practice.this obligation was reduced to a judgment after the husband defaulted on the payments.the husband filed for bankruptcy before the wife could enforce the judgment,and his property settlement obligation was eventually discharged.but the husband obligation to pay spousal support was not discharged.shortly before the final support payment was due,the wife filed a motion in the divorce court to modify,to increase and extend,the payments on the ground the discharge of the husband property settlement debt amounted to a changed circumstance.the state court granted the wife motion,and the husband appealed.id.at.
the husband also filed a complaint in bankruptcy court claiming the modification violated the standing injunction in title united states code section prohibiting the collection of debts that had been discharged in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court dismissed the complaint based on comity.the district court affirmed the dismissal,as did the appellate court.
the question then before the court was whether the support modification request was indeed an attempt to collect a discharged debt in violation of the federal bankruptcy law a question that arguably would have been within the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to decide.the court held it was not.
nothing in the record suggests that the divorce court was attempting to reinstate the property settlement debt the amount awarded in alimony is not a substitute for the amount of the discharged property settlement.the alimony modification merely takes into account the fact that siragusa would no longer receive the property settlement payments upon which the original alimony was premised.the discharge altered both siragusa need and siragusa ability to pay.siragusa,supra,at.
williams,supra,d,a decision by this court,involved a similar sort of situation,and the application of civil code section,the predecessor to section.the husband and wife in williams entered into a property settlement agreement that required the wife to pay the husband to equalize the division of community property to pay in community debts and to turn over the husband separate property to him.the husband,for his part,was required to pay the wife a portion of his monthly retirement income,and to pay in community debts.the wife failed to comply with any of her obligations before filing for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy discharged her property settlement obligation,as well as her share of the community debts which then fell to the husband to pay.in the meantime,the husband had refused to pay over any part of his retirement income to the wife.she obtained a writ of execution and levied against the husband savings account to recover the arrearages.he moved to vacate the levy on the ground he was entitled to offset his arrearages against her obligations to him the property settlement payment and her share of community debts.the trial court granted the husband motion,and the wife appealed.id.at.
we held,in reliance on civil code former section that the husband could not offset the wife discharged property settlement debt to him against his obligation to pay the wife a portion of his retirement income which also was a form of community property,not spousal support.after reviewing the legislative history of the amendment to civil code section,we said 
thus it is clear that the legislature,in amending civil code section,intended to redress the inequities which could result from a discharge in bankruptcy of community debts assigned to one spouse to the extent it was possible to do so within the limitations imposed by the supremacy of the bankruptcy law.it is possible to readjust the relative position of the spouses by a modification of a spousal support order,taking into consideration the amount of property obligations discharged by one spouse in bankruptcy.there is nothing in the provisions of civil code section nor in the legislative history behind it to suggest that the legislature intended to or believed it could go beyond the scope of that law to reach and modify final property settlements,notwithstanding the inequities which result from discharges in bankruptcy of the type here in question.
we therefore conclude that in the present posture of this case the trial court can not offset its determination of a community debt owed by wife to husband against periodic payments due wife in satisfaction of her community interest in husband retirement income.the statutory authorization to make an adjustment in spousal support is limited to a situation in which a spousal support order is incorporated in the judgment of dissolution subject to modification by the court.this is not such a case,and the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering an offset which,in effect,modified a property settlement without the consent of the parties.williams,supra,d at.see also in re marriage of cohen d.use of husband discharged community debts to offset wife corresponding obligation would violate federal bankruptcy law.
in in re marriage of clements d.clements,by comparison,the judgment of dissolution did incorporate a spousal support order.the husband support obligation in that case took into account the division of community debts between him and his.however,the wife share of the debts was later discharged in bankruptcy,and her creditors looked to the husband for payment.then,when a community asset was sold,the husband asked the court to order the wife to use her share of the proceeds to pay her discharged debts.the family law court granted the request and issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the wife from spending the money in any other way.a few days later,the bankruptcy court dissolved the restraining order,and the wife spent the money for other things.
the family law court order also included a provision permitting the husband to offset any amount he spent to pay the wife former debts against the amount he paid her for support.the wife appealed from this part of the order.the appellate court upheld it.it explained 
it is evident that the debts assigned to wife and the agreement to hold husband harmless on these obligations were in settlement of property rights and were effectively discharged by her bankruptcy.at issue is whether this discharge prevents the state court from decreasing wife spousal support payment to compensate husband for assuming responsibility for these discharged obligations.
there are many factors deemed pertinent by the state of california in establishing an adequate amount of spousal support.indeed,a court can consider everything having a legitimate bearing on present and prospective matters relating to the lives of both parties.citations.some of the circumstances that are applicable to the case at bar are the needs of the parties,the abilities of the parties to meet such needs,property owned,obligations to be met,as well as the ability to earn and actual earnings.citations.
proper grounds may always be presented for the purpose of modifying or revoking an award of spousal support.citation.but the applicant must show the economic situation of the parties has changed since it is the economic relation which is to be affected by the proposed modification.citations.in the instant case,the material change in the economic status of the parties was that the spouse to whom the support had been awarded had significantly reduced her indebtedness through bankruptcy which concomitantly increased the obligations to be met by the nonbankrupt spouse.the fact that a spouse has incurred indebtedness may indicate such a change in his ability to pay support as to authorize a reduction in the amount of support payments.citations.clements,supra,d at.
notably,the court in clements made no mention of civil code former section.one possible explanation for this omission is that the statute permitted the court,in deciding whether to modify a spousal support order,to consider the discharge of one spouse obligations under a settlement agreement.nothing in clements indicates the judgment of dissolution in that case incorporated a marital settlement agreement msa between the parties.
this same language referring to a settlement agreement was carried over into section.civil code section was repealed,and section was enacted in its place,in.stats,ch,and,operative.section provides 
if an obligation under an agreement for settlement of property to a spouse or for support of a spouse is discharged in bankruptcy,the court may make all proper orders for the support of the spouse,as the court determines are just,having regard for the circumstances of the parties and the amount of the obligations under the agreement that are discharged.italics added.
section appears in division of the family code support,part general provisions,chapter support agreements,article spousal support.although the family code does not expressly define msa,several of its provisions contemplate their existence,including section.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,to.an msa commonly provides,among other things,for a division of community assets and debts,and for child and spousal support.id,to.it usually is then merged into the judgment of dissolution,whereupon it ceases to have any independent legal significance the parties rights and obligations are governed by the judgment alone.id.
a party to an msa may waive the right to receive spousal support.
there is no public policy prohibition against a waiver of spousal support.if the spouses separate by agreement,neither owes the other a duty of support unless they otherwise agree,and any right to support after dissolution exists,if at all,only under the terms of the judgment.thus,a voluntary,knowing and intelligent waiver of support in a marital settlement agreement will be e
