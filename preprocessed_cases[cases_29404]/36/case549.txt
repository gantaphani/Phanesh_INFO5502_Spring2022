we consider whether family code section,subdivision c applies retroactively and bars a parent from relying on laches to defend an action to enforce a child support order.we hold that it does and affirm the court of appeal.
facts and procedural background 
in june,a new york court ordered darrin fellows to pay a week in child support to mary ann moyse.over years later,moyse registered the child support order in california.she alleged that fellows had never made support payments and owed her plus interest.fellows sought to vacate the registration asserting,among other things,a laches defense.
the trial court denied fellows motion to vacate,confirmed the registration,and ordered arrearage payments of.the court noted that moyse testified that no child support payments were made,while fellows testified that all child support payments were made.both parties called corroborating witnesses supporting their respective testimony.the court found that fellows failed to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the child support was paid.
the trial court applied section,subdivision c section c,retroactively and disallowed the laches defense.the section,added in,provides in an action to enforce a judgment for child,family,or spousal support,the defendant may raise,and the court may consider,the defense of laches only with respect to any portion of the judgment owed to the state.ibid.although the court determined that fellows had met his burden of proof as to the defense of laches,it concluded that the defense was statutorily unavailable.
the court of appeal affirmed,declining to follow in re marriage of garcia th,d garcia,which held to the contrary.instead,relying on rice clark cal th,d,rice,the court concluded that section of the family code demonstrates a general legislative intent that future family code amendments are to be retroactively applied.the court also noted that the legislature intent to right a perceived injustice dictates the retroactive application of section c.finally,the court concluded that subdivisions f and g of section did not compel a contrary result and that retroactive application did not violate due process.
we granted review to resolve the conflict between garcia,supra,th,d,and the court of appeal opinion here.
ii.discussion 
retroactive application of section c 
if,in light of the lapse of time and other relevant circumstances,a court concludes that a party failure to assert a right has caused prejudice to an adverse party,the court may apply the equitable defense of laches to bar further assertion of the right.nealis carlson d.the parties agree that section c,by its terms,bars the laches defense in a private action to enforce a child support order.they disagree over its application here.we review the retroactive application of the statute de novo.in re marriage of mcclellan th,d.
section c changed existing law 
as a general rule,statutes do not operate retroactively unless the legislature plainly intended them to do so.western security bank superior court cal th,d,western security.nonetheless,a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment.ibid.such a statute may be applied to transactions predating its enactment without being considered retroactive because it is merely a statement of what the law has always been.riley hilton hotels th,d.
in determining whether a statute clarified or changed the law,we give due consideration to the legislature intent in enacting that statute.western security,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature declaration of an existing statute meaning,while not dispositive,is a factor entitled to consideration.mcclung employment development cal th,d,mcclung.we look to the surrounding circumstances as well as the legislature intent when determining whether a statute changed or merely clarified the law.western security,at,d.
here,the legislature intended to change the law.explaining the need for the statute,both the senate rules committee and the senate judiciary committee observed that the equitable defense of laches remains applicable in an action to enforce a support order.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.according to the senate rules committee,the enactment of section c would change that by substantially restricting the laches defense in support enforcement cases.assem.floor analysis,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,italics added.thus,section c would s et forth new statutory restrictions on the use of the common law defense of laches in support enforcement actions.assem.judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.june,italics added.in doing so,it would close a loophole that allow ed child support obligors to evade responsibility for their debts.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.by amending the statute to close the loophole,the legislature sought to change the law.city of west hollywood investment th,d.
a review of the law before the enactment of section c confirms that the statute did effect a change.prior to,judgments for child and spousal support expired within a stated period of years.in re marriage of fogarty rasbeary th,d fogarty.california courts had recognized a laches defense in spousal support cases but held that the defense did not apply to claims for arrearages brought within the statutory enforcement period.see,dimarco dimarco cal d,leiden hudson d.in and,however,the legislature made all support orders enforceable until paid in full,former,now,subd.a.in doing so,the legislature cast some doubt on the viability of the laches defense in support actions.
however,the court in re marriage of plescia th,d plescia,held that the legislative changes in and did not eliminate the laches defense in actions for spousal support arrearages.three years later,the fogarty court followed plescia and recognized laches in actions for child support arrearages.fogarty,supra,th at,d.these precedents were consistently followed until the enactment of section c the legislature may certainly amend a statute to overrule a judicial decision.but,in doing so it changes the law.see mcclung,supra,cal th at,d.
in re marriage of cordero th,d,does not alter our conclusion.the cordero court disagreed with the reasoning of plescia,supra,th,d,and opined that support orders less than years old would not be subject to a laches defense.cordero,at,d.the court acknowledged,however,that its observation was dictum.id.at,fn,d.thus,there is nothing to suggest that the legislature enacted section c in response to any controversy created by cordero on this point.indeed,the legislative history behind section c is replete with references to plescia,fogarty,hamer,dancy,and copeman,but makes no mention of cordero accordingly,we conclude that the legislature enacted section c to change existing law,not to clarify a controversy over its interpretation.
the legislature intended that section c apply retroactively 
before section c became effective on january,a viable laches defense would have barred moyse claim.the statute applies to this case only if the legislature intended to give it retroactive effect.we conclude that it did.
while nothing in the language or legislative history of section c speaks directly to retroactive application,section of the family code provides guidance.the family code was enacted in,and made operative on january,to create a unified statutory scheme.stats,ch,et it drew together a number of statutes scattered throughout various parts of the california codes,and enacted some new provisions.section provides that,in the family code,the term new law describes either the enactment of the family code itself,or future modifications of the code,subd.a a b.the term old law refers to the law in effect before the family code was adopted,subd.a.
section,subdivision c provides subject to the limitations provided in this section,the new law applies on the operative date to all matters governed by the new law,regardless of whether an event occurred or circumstance existed before,on,or after the operative date,including,but
