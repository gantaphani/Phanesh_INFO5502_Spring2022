raphael appellant appeals from an order of the juvenile court denying him presumed father status in the dependency proceeding concerning minor raphael iii raphael.he contends the trial court ruling,based upon a blood test confirming he was not the minor biological father,was erroneous.the minor,who took a position contrary to appellant in the trial court,has changed position on appeal,now arguing in appellant favor.we reverse.
statement of the case and facts 
raphael was born in august.his birth certificate lists his mother as niemaha,age,and his father as appellant,age.
according to appellant declaration,he was in a relationship with niemaha when raphael was conceived,she told him he was the father and he so believed.appellant was at this time in a drug rehabilitation program at walden house.when he was released,appellant went to live with his grandmother,agnes,on duke court in san francisco.niemaha,then four and a half months pregnant,was in a foster home from which she frequently went awol.agnes tried to arrange with the san francisco department of human services department for niemaha to live with her although this effort was unsuccessful,niemaha moved in anyway and lived with appellant throughout her pregnancy.appellant contributed to her financial support,was present at raphael birth in august,was listed as the father on the baby birth certificate,and believed he signed a form at the hospital stating that he was the baby father.when niemaha and raphael left the hospital,they lived with appellant at his grandmother house.appellant contributed financially to raphael support,cared for him,played with him,and took him to doctor appointments.
on october,the department filed a petition alleging that raphael came within the provisions of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b in that his mother was a dependent of the court and was awol with the minor,the mother refused to go to placement,the mother had dropped out of school and had no legal means of support,and t he adult father may be harboring the minor mother and the baby and is not cooperating with this agency in getting the minor mother back into placement.this petition listed the baby father as curtis and the father address as yolanda at the duke court address notice of the hearing was mailed to curtis,yolanda yolanda is appellant mother.the parties failed to appear for a hearing on november and the matter was continued to december,the court minutes indicating that notice had been given to the father,who had failed to appear,and that the mother whereabouts were unknown.notice of this hearing had been addressed to curtis t,yolanda b.the hearing was again continued to january,at which time it was taken off calendar pending service of a warrant.
meanwhile,according to appellant declaration,in december,when raphael was about four months old,appellant was required to return to walden house for an additional five months to complete his diversion program.after days,he was permitted to bring raphael to walden house for visits and spent hours with raphael each saturday.raphael was living with niemaha at her grandmother house.when appellant was released from walden house,raphael was living in oakland with yolanda,who told appellant that niemaha had dropped the baby off.over the next five months,appellant frequently stayed with raphael at yolanda house and sometimes took raphael with him to agnes house niemaha sometimes stayed with them.
appellant was arrested in october and incarcerated at the san francisco jail in san bruno until may.during this time,yolanda brought raphael to visit appellant.upon his release,appellant went to live again at agnes house and continued to live there after she died.yolanda and raphael moved to taylor street in san francisco and appellant spent weekends with them.yolanda also brought raphael to stay overnight with appellant.appellant saw raphael at least three times a week after may.he considered raphael his son,raphael called him daddy,and appellant extended family accepted raphael as his son.
on november,a subsequent petition was filed alleging that raphael came within the provisions of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,in that the mother had given conflicting information as to the minor whereabouts,which were currently unknown the mother left the minor at home alone at night on october,the mother had a history of abandoning her children and on november,had left the minor with the paternal grandmother without making provisions for his ongoing care the mother had not benefited from family preservation services the mother had a history of unstable housing the mother temporarily resided in the home of the grandmother,alberta,and the mother paternal uncle,who was an alleged sexual offender and the mother was a previous dependent of the court.this petition listed the father as romear,subsequently changed to raphael,and his address as yolanda at a taylor street address.
the department report indicated that it received a report on october,from the mother of a friend of niemaha,with whom niemaha had been living,that niemaha had gone out the night before,leaving raphael and his,keandre,with no one to take care of them.on november,the department was contacted by crystal,keandre paternal grandmother,who reported that the baby had been left with her and niemaha had not come to get him.the department report stated that raphael whereabouts were unknown.
in a subsequent report,the department stated that raphael had been located on november,at the home of yolanda yolanda said raphael had been living with her since about november and the social worker placed the child with her.
at a hearing on november,the court detained raphael and approved his placement with yolanda b.the court found notice had been given as required by law and the father had willfully failed to appear for the hearing.the court minutes list raphael father as curtis t.and a subsequent notice concerning rehearing was sent to curtis t.at the duke court address.
at the jurisdictional hearing on december,the court found the allegations of the subsequent petition true.the court minutes listed the father as romear p.in its hearing report,which referred to appellant by his correct name,the department stated that appellant lived in hunter point but used his mother taylor street address as his mailing address.the social worker stated she had contacted appellant at his mailing address but had received no response.it was recommended that raphael remain in the care of yolanda because he was very bonded with her,she had his childcare and medical care in place,and her apartment had ample room.
at a dispositional hearing on january,again in appellant absence,the court continued raphael placement with yolanda on february,the court vacated the findings it had made as to appellant on december,and january.appellant was found to have willfully failed to appear,the petition was amended to allege that the father ability to care for the child was unknown,and this allegation was found true.the record contains the notice of the february,hearing that was mailed to appellant at yolanda address on february.
in the department july,status review report,the social worker related that she had on four occasions asked yolanda to have appellant call to arrange visitation,that yolanda represented she had transmitted these messages,and that appellant had not contacted the worker.notice of the july hearing was mailed to appellant at yolanda address,as was notice of its continuation to september.appellant did not appear at the hearing the dependency and raphael placement were continued.
on february,a supplemental petition was filed alleging that yolanda had failed to provide adequate care for raphael that she had an ongoing substance abuse problem that interfered with her ability to care for the minor that she had an open dependency case regarding her own son,ramone and that there was an open referral regarding yolanda and her and daughters.
on february,with appellant in court,raphael was ordered detained in an emergency shelter.the court ordered paternity testing for appellant.
the department march report indicated that it had recently discovered yolanda had had an open family maintenance case regarding her son ramone since he was returned to her care on october,having been removed for neglect in december.yolanda had signed a statement on november,that she had never been investigated for or involved in child abuse or neglect.on february,the department received its referral regarding yolanda and her children,alleging general neglect of her daughters.the department reported there was evidence that yolanda daughters were providing most of raphael care and that yolanda was struggling with her sobriety,as well as that yolanda was having trouble paying bills and had engaged in welfare fraud by accepting two adult fast passes a month.raphael behavior had reportedly been deteriorating since the end of november,with him displaying aggressiveness toward other children.he had been placed in foster care with keandre,in the home of susan,on february.susan wanted to adopt keandre and stated that she would also give raphael a permanent home.
the social worker reported that she met appellant for the first time on february.appellant asked if raphael could be placed with him.the social worker discussed reunification requirements and appellant stated he had no prior knowledge of them because he had been incarcerated.appellant stated that he lived between the houses of his aunt and his girlfriend and that his son had been visiting him regularly.after raphael removal,appellant had been coming to the department for visits with him.appellant stated in his declaration that he initially was not aware of the dependency proceeding and became involved immediately upon learning of it.
the genetics test ordered by the court excluded appellant as raphael father.
after continuances,the review hearing was set for april.on march,appellant filed a motion for presumed father status,which was opposed by counsel for raphael.on april,the trial court denied appellant motion and sustained the supplemental petition.appellant application for a rehearing on his motion for presumed father status was denied on may.on may,the court terminated reunification services and set a welfare and institutions code section hearing for september.
appellant filed a notice of appeal on may,
our opinion in this matter,which was filed on march,affirmed the judgment.appellant and raphael then each filed petitions for rehearing.we granted rehearing on march,and,reversing the judgment,we now also reverse ourselves.as has been noted,wisdom too often never comes,and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.smith anderson cal d,conc.opn.of mosk,quoting justice rutledge dissent in wolf colorado.
discussion 
family code section provides in pertinent part a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he meets the conditions provided in chapter commencing with section or chapter commencing with section of part or in any of the following subdivisions d he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child the presumption set forth in section,subdivision d,is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a.
only one of the other two means of establishing presumed father status mentioned in section is relevant to this case section et.provides for voluntary declarations of paternity which,when filed with the department of child support services,have the force and effect of a judgment of paternity.in re liam th,d.
appellant and raphael maintain that appellant is raphael presumed father under both section,subdivision d,and section et.the trial court rejected the former contention because it found the presumption of section,subdivision d,rebutted by the genetic test excluding appellant as raphael biological father it rejected the latter contention because it found no evidence a voluntary declaration of paternity had in fact been filed with the required agency.
under section,subdivision d,a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.appellant argues that he fulfilled the requirements of this statute because he lived with raphael mother during her pregnancy,he attended raphael birth and was listed on the birth certificate as raphael father,raphael and the mother lived with appellant at his grandmother home for several months after raphael was born,appellant regularly stayed with raphael at appellant mother home after appellant completed his diversion program and frequently had raphael with him at his grandmother home,and appellant and all his extended family viewed raphael as appellant son.the trial court,without deciding whether the facts supported application of the presumption,accepted the argument of raphael trial counsel that the blood test demonstrating appellant was not raphael biological father precluded appellant from establishing the presumption of paternity or rebutted that presumption.
the trial court relied primarily upon in re olivia d.olivia,which held that a man shown by blood tests not to be the biological father was precluded from establishing presumptive father status under the predecessor statute to section,subdivision d.olivia equated the blood test results with a judgment of paternity,holding that the case was governed by the statutory directive that t he presumption that a man is the natural father of a child is rebutted by a court decree establishing paternity of the child by another man.id.at,see,subd.c.
other courts have since questioned this conclusion.in re jerry th,d jerry disagreed with olivia in our view,section,subdivision c,contemplates a situation in which a man of flesh and blood,as opposed to a mere hypothetical man,is put forward as the father of the child.otherwise,a child could be precluded from having a loving,nurturing relationship with a committed father by a man the child may never even have met,who may be totally uninterested in the child and who can not obtain presumed father status in his own right.previously,the court in comino kelley th,footnote,d comino,had noted we question whether a negative blood test of one man is the equivalent of an affirmative judicial declaration of paternity of another man,but we need not decide the issue here.
it is clear that a man is not required to produce evidence of biological paternity to be declared a presumed father under section.id.at,d construing former.the question in this case,however,is whether biological proof of nonpaternity necessarily precludes presumed father status.
this question was answered in the negative,at least in the context of dependency proceedings,in jerry p.in jerry,the child was removed from the mother custody and placed in foster care shortly after birth the man who believed himself to be the father had held himself out as the baby father from the time he learned of the mother pregnancy,provided support to the mother during her pregnancy,visited the baby every day at the hospital until the baby was moved to the foster home without his knowledge,then visited regularly once he was permitted by the court.blood tests,however,confirmed the man was not the biological father.
in addition to disagreeing with olivia,as described above,jerry followed in re kiana th,d kiana,which had previously interpreted section,subdivision a,as giving the trial court discretion to decide whether proof the presumed father is not the biological father is sufficient to rebut the presumption.jerry,supra,at,d.kiana noted that section,subdivision a,states a presumption of paternity may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.italics added.thus,although the results of genetic testing constitute clear and convincing evidence,it does not follow that such evidence will rebut the presumption in every case.rather,the statute seeks to protect presumptions of paternity,once they have arisen,from being set aside except upon clear and convincing evidence and only in an appropriate case.kiana,supra,at,d jerry supra,at,d.
jerry further questioned whether presumed fatherhood even should be treated as an evidentiary presumption in the dependency context.in dependency cases,presumed fathers are entitled to reunification services while mere biological fathers are not.in re zacharia cal th,d,zacharia.thus,jerry noted that while the primary purpose of section is to establish paternity through presumptions,the purpose of the statute in the dependency context is to determine whether an alleged father has demonstrated sufficient commitment to parental responsibilities to be given the rights to reunification services and custody.jerry,supra,at,d.jerry stated that i t would not make sense to use the categories in section simply to establish an evidentiary presumption a man is a natural father when being a natural father is a step below being a presumed father.id.at,d.additionally,according to jerry,if the role of section in a dependency proceeding was merely to establish an evidentiary presumption a man was the child natural father,a man who was already established to be the child natural father before dependency proceedings commenced could never become a presumed father because a presumption under the statute would be unnecessary.we fail to see the rationality in a system which would confer more rights on a father when his biological tie to the child is unknown than when it is,fn.omitted.jerry noted language in california supreme court cases suggest ing in the dependency context the term presumed father is not an evidentiary term but a term of convenience used to identify a preferred class of fathers by reference to the familial bonds described in section which the legislature has determined reasonably approximate the class of fathers it wishes to benefit in kelsey adoption of kelsey cal th d,the court stated a man parentage of a child may be undisputed and legally proven,but he may nevertheless fail to be a presumed father conversely,even if paternity is denied and legally disproved,a man may be deemed,under some circumstances,to be a presumed father.cal th at,fn.d.although kelsey was an adoption case,it relied on the same categories in section for determining presumed father status as are used in dependency cases.moreover,in zacharia,which was a dependency case,the court noted it is possible for a man to achieve presumed father status,with its attendant rights and duties,without being the biological father.ibid.
other cases also reflect the principle that biology is not necessarily the determining factor with respect to presumed fatherhood.the comino court refused to allow the mother,on appeal,to introduce blood tests she claimed eliminated the probability that the man found to be her child presumed father was his biological father because she had not introduced these tests in the trial court.th at,d.presumed father status had been established under former civil code section,subdivision a now,subd.d,as the man had lived with the mother and child as a family for the two and a half years following birth,supporting the child and sharing care giving responsibilities with the mother.id.at.comino also rejected the mother attempt to defeat the presumed father claim by relying on the conclusive statutory presumption that the child of a wife living with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is a child of the marriage.former,subd.a.although the mother had been married to another man at the time of conception,the marriage was one of convenience to a man with whom she was not sexually involved therefore the court found the policies underlying the presumption would not be served by applying it to a marriage that existed in name only and that the societal concern for the child to have a father would be better served by preserving the child relationship with the only man he had ever known as his father.th at,d.
in dawn superior court cal th,d,dawn,the supreme court held that a man who claimed to be a biological father was not entitled to obtain blood tests to prove his paternity because the mother husband was the presumed father under section,subdivisions a and d.the mother had separated from her husband and begun living with the alleged biological father at the time of conception,but returned to her husband a couple of months later and raised the child with him.
in michelle ronald cal d,the child was conceived while the mother was living with her husband but having an affair with another man,donald.the husband and wife raised the child together for four years,until they ended the marriage,after which time the husband continued his parental relationship with the child.the mother subsequently married donald and they sought to establish his paternity.michelle upheld application of the section presumption in favor of the husband,and denial of a motion for blood tests,because the husband interest in continuing his established relationship with the child and state interest in familial stability and the welfare of the child outweighed donald private interest in establishing paternity and the child interest in a legal determination of her biological parentage.
kiana also involved competing claims of paternity.the mother had been living with kevin when she became pregnant,but a few months later began to live with mario,who was named as father on the birth certificate and who subsequently married the mother.mario had been incarcerated since about the time of the child birth and the child did not recall ever having seen him before the dependency proceedings,which began when she was about years old.kevin had lived with the mother on and off since the child was four years old and treated the child as his own,and the child considered him her father.the trial court denied requests for genetic testing made by kevin and by the agency,determined that both kevin and mario qualified as presumed fathers and held that kevin presumption prevailed because of his relationship with the child.kiana rejected mario argument that the trial court should have required genetic testing because mario had not requested such testing in the trial court,but noted that testing would not in any event be determinative even if mario could raise the issue at this juncture,it would fail because biological paternity by a competing presumptive father does not necessarily defeat a nonbiological father presumption of paternity.kiana,supra,th at,d.
the above cases refused to allow biological evidence to enter the determination of paternity by refusing to permit or require evidence of biological paternity tests.several other cases in which such evidence was presented refused to allow the evidence to control the paternity determination.in steven matthew th,d steven,the mother separated from her husband,matthew,moved in with steven,then conceived the child while on a weekend away with matthew.steven participated in all the preparations for the baby,was listed as father on the birth certificate,and shared all caretaking and concerning the child with the mother.he continued to share custody and support after he separated from the mother some two years after the child birth,including after matthew returned to live with the mother.blood tests confirmed matthew was the child biological father.steven claimed to be the child presumptive father under former civil code section,subdivision a now,subd.d matthew claimed to be the presumptive father under that provision as well as under former civil code section,subdivision a now,subd.a.
steven upheld the trial court determination that the presumption of steven paternity was controlling,despite the blood tests showing matthew was the biological father,because of steven enduring relationship with the child.as section,subdivision b,now provides,former civil code section,subdivision b,then provided that when two or more presumptions conflict,the one which on the facts is founded on the weightier consideration of policy and logic controls.as the steven court explained the paternity presumptions are driven by state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concern for the welfare of the child.the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.susan jack th,d,citing michelle ronald,supra,cal d.the courts have repeatedly held,in applying paternity presumptions,that the extant relationship is to be preserved at the cost of biological ties.michelle ronald,supra,at,alleged biological father abstract interest in establishing paternity not as weighty as the state interest in familial stability and the welfare of the child comino,supra,at,d court refused to apply conclusive presumption of,to deny the child the only father she had ever known.
i n the case of an older child over two years of age the familial relationship between the child and the man purporting to be the child father is considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity.a man who has lived with a child,treating it as his son or daughter,has developed a relationship with the child that should not be lightly dissolved this social relationship is much more important,to the child at least,than a biological relationship of actual paternity susan jack,supra,th at,d,quoting estate of cornelious cal d,steven,supra,at,d.
in susan jack,supra,in the midst of proceedings to dissolve her marriage,the mother sought to establish the paternity of another man.the husband had raised the child as his own the other man disclaimed paternity,relying upon the presumption based on the mother marriage to her husband.although blood tests proved the husband was not the father,the court held he remained the presumed father by virtue of his relationship with the child 
in rodney karen th,d,a man who had had an affair with a married woman sought to establish paternity to her child.although blood tests showed he was the father,the trial court applied the presumption of section to hold that the woman husband was the father,finding the trial court had erred in ordering the blood test because the other man lacked standing to request it.the child had been raised by the husband and wife and had had no contact with the other man.similarly,in miller miller th,d miller,the marital presumption was held to prevail over the claim of the apparent biological father,who did not qualify as a presumed father under any of the statutory tests.the husband had a continuing emotional and financial relationship with the child,and the miller court found the other man interest in establishing paternity insufficient to override the state interests in familial stability and the best interest of the child.id.at,d.
these cases generally reflect a determination that biology is not necessarily determinative of legal paternity,and specifically that social relationships may trump genetics in an appropriate case.in all of the above cases,giving legal recognition to biological paternity would have upset an existing relationship between the presumed father and the child.
other cases,however,align with olivia,supra,in suggesting that genetic tests disproving a presumptive father biological connection to the child are dispositive.in re marriage of moschetta,th,d moschetta involved a surrogacy contract in which a husband and wife agreed to have another woman impregnated with the husband semen.when the husband and wife separated about seven months after the baby was born,each of them as well as the surrogate asserted claims for custody of the child.moschetta held that the surrogate and the husband were the legal parents of the child the wife was not the mother because she had not given birth to the child and was not genetically related to her.id.at,d.the court rejected the argument that the wife should be considered the mother by a id.at,d application of the presumption that a husband is the legal father of his wife child if the couple were married and cohabiting at the time of conception and the husband is not sterile.the argument fails because the presumption is not absolutely conclusive,and may be defeated by blood tests which show that the husband is not the genetic father of the child.the key phrase in california statutory codification of the rule is,except as provided in section.subdivision a of family code section provides that if the conclusions of all the experts,as disclosed by the evidence based on blood tests,is that the husband is not the father of the child,the question of paternity of the husband shall be resolved accordingly.italics in original.genetic parenthood established by blood tests trumps a presumption based on the cohabitation of a married couple.th at,d.
johnson calvert cal th,d,johnson also involved a surrogacy contract,but one in which an embryo created from the egg of a wife and sperm of her husband was implanted in the uterus of another woman who agreed to bear the child for the couple.johnson determined that both women offered acceptable proof of surrogate,that she gave birth to the child,and the wife,that she was genetically related to the resolved the issue in favor of the husband and wife based on the intention reflected in the surrogacy contract that they be the child parents.as relevant to the present case,in its analysis,johnson stated evidence code section now provides that blood testing may be ordered in an action when paternity is a relevant fact.when maternity is disputed,genetic evidence derived from blood testing is likewise admissible,now see,now.the evidence code further provides that if the court finds the conclusions of all the experts,as disclosed by the evidence based on the blood tests,are that the alleged father is not the father of the child,the question of paternity is resolved accordingly,now.by parity of reasoning,blood testing may also be dispositive of the question of maternity.further,there is a rebuttable presumption of paternity hence,maternity as well on the finding of a certain number of genetic markers,now.cal th at,d.
in brian ginger th,d,the child was conceived during a time when the wife was having an affair with brian while continuing to cohabit with her husband,william.during the pregnancy,the wife left her husband and moved in with brian,who attended the birth,was listed as father on the birth certificate and raised the child as his own.after about a year,the wife and brian broke up,but he continued his role as father to the child.the wife then reconciled with william and tried to stop brian from seeing the child.brian sued to establish paternity and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the wife,on the ground that the conclusive presumption of section made the husband the father.brian determined that william and brian each had a claim to presumed father on the basis of the section marital presumption,brian under section,subdivision d,by virtue of his actions toward and relationship with the found unconstitutional the trial court conclusion that section automatically cut off brian rights in noting that it was not yet called upon to weigh the two presumptions against each other under section,subdivision b,the brian court stated and in all likelihood dna tests on remand will probably render that problem moot.dna tests will certainly constitute clear and convincing evidence rebutting any of the presumptions which might favor either brian or william.under subd.a of,a presumption shown by may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.under section,the court may order blood tests at any time on either its own motion or if suggested by any person involved in the case.th at and fn,d,italics in original.
brian thus assumed what moschetta held and johnson suggested,that a presumption of paternity,even the conclusive presumption established by section,would be rebutted by evidence of genetic tests demonstrating another man to be the father of the child.while moschetta and johnson involved maternity rather than paternity,this distinction is irrelevant to their interpretation of the relevant statutes as requiring a decision in accordance with genetic evidence where such evidence has been presented.
all three of these cases,however,involved competing claims of parents who wished to raise the child following the biological tie did not deprive the child of a parent.the same is true of the cases described above that allowed biology to be overridden by existing familial relationships in these cases,refusing to follow the biological tie preserved existing relationships.in the present case,by contrast,there is only one man attempting to establish presumed father status,only one man who has expressed a paternal interest in raphael.according to appellant,raphael mother came to live with him at his grandmother house during her pregnancy she and raphael lived with appellant there for several months after raphael birth appellant cared for,provided for and played with raphael and generally treated raphael as his son appellant continued to have a significant relationship with raphael over the following years appellant and his extended family considered raphael appellant son and raphael considered appellant his father.the trial court did not make factual findings on appellant claim that he qualified as raphael presumed father under section,subdivision d,or on appellant ability to parent raphael at the present time.if appellant assertions are true,however,he received raphael into his home as an infant,openly held raphael out as his son,had a significant relationship with raphael and was regarded by raphael as his father.if this is in fact the case,precluding appellant from establishing presumed father status because of the lack of a biological tie to raphael would defeat an existing relationship without any replacement except the dependency system 
the legislature has declared as a matter of policy that t here is a compelling state interest in establishing paternity for all children,subd.a.in its findings and declarations regarding the system for voluntary declarations of paternity,the legislature stated establishing paternity is the first step toward a child support award,which,in turn,provides children with equal rights and access to benefits,including,but not limited to,social security,health insurance,survivors benefits,military benefits,and inheritance rights.knowledge of family medical history is often necessary for correct medical diagnosis and treatment.additionally,knowing one father is important to a child development.a simple system allowing for establishment of voluntary paternity will result in a significant increase in the ease of establishing paternity,a significant increase in paternity establishment,an increase in the number of children who have greater access to child support and other benefits,and a significant decrease in the time and money required to establish paternity due to the removal of the need for a lengthy and expensive court process to determine and establish paternity and is in the public interest.the legislature has made it perfectly clear that public policy and,we might add,common sense favors,whenever possible,the establishment of legal parenthood with the concomitant responsibility.in re marriage of buzzanca,supra,th at,d.
presumptive paternity based upon a man relationship with a child under section,subdivision d,serves similar interests,albeit not the concern with knowledge of family medical history.as discussed above,the presumptive paternity statutes allow paternity to be established without direct reference to biology.existing case law is clear that a court is not required to examine biological evidence in making a determination of paternity.dawn,supra michelle,supra comino,supra.jerry,steven,kiana,rodney,susan,and miller all stand for the proposition that one man may be found a child presumed father despite evidence that another is the biological father.these cases,however,did not directly discuss the statutory provisions that led moschetta,johnson and brian to view biological evidence as determinative.on the other hand,moschetta,johnson and brian,did not directly hold that biological evidence must be treated as determinative regardless of the facts of a given case.
sections and provide that even the otherwise conclusive marital presumption must give way to biological evidence notwithstanding section,if the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts,as disclosed by the evidence based on blood tests performed pursuant to chapter commencing with section,are that the husband is not the father of the child,the question of paternity of the husband shall be resolved accordingly,subd.a,emphasis added.section authorizes courts to order genetic testing of the mother,child and alleged father in civil actions or proceedings in which paternity is a relevant fact.section,subdivision a,directs that i f the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts,as disclosed by the evidence based upon the tests,are that the alleged father is not the father of the child,the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly.
we are persuaded that cases such as jerry,steven,kiana,rodney,susan,and miller are correct as a matter of social policy.moreover,while these cases at first glance appear inconsistent with the directive of section that paternity determinations be made in accordance with blood test evidence,we are not convinced that the statute requires this result in all circumstances.
the specific language of section is illuminative.section requires the court to resolve a question of paternity in accordance with genetic tests when such tests show that the alleged father is not the father of the child.similarly,section authorizes the trial court to order genetic testing for the mother,child and alleged father.an alleged father is a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see,in re shereece d.notably,sections and do not refer to genetic testing of presumed fathers.accordingly,in our view,these statutes do not authorize courts to order genetic testing of a man who meets the statutory test for presumed fatherhood.it follows that if appellant met that test,the court should not have ordered him to undergo genetic testing,much less allow the evidence of biological to rebut appellant presumed father status.
additionally,section authorizes the court to order genetic testing in a civil action or proceeding in which paternity is a relevant fact.in the present case,prior to the court order and results of the blood tests,no one had suggested appellant was not raphael father and no other man claimed that role in such a situation,where there is a man claiming presumed father status and no indication of another man asserting paternity,we question whether paternity can rightly be considered a relevant fact.appellant either met the statutory test for presumed fatherhood or he did not as noted above,proof of biological fatherhood is not a necessary component of presumed father status.
this view is in accord with that expressed in kiana and jerry regarding the rebuttal of presumptions of paternity under section.as previously noted,kiana focused on the language of section,subdivision a,which states that the presumptions of section may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.th at,d,italics added in kiana kiana read this language to indicate that although the results of genetic testing constitute clear and convincing evidence,it does not follow that such evidence will rebut the presumption in every case.rather,the statute seeks to protect presumptions of paternity,once they have arisen,from being set aside except upon clear and convincing evidence and only in an appropriate case.a s between two men,both of whom qualify as presumptive fathers,biological paternity does not necessarily determine which presumption will prevail under section.th at,d.in a case such as the present,where there is only one man asserting paternity,the case for refusing to make the results of genetic testing determinative in every case is even stronger.see jerry,supra,at,d.
we can discern no policy that would support a requirement of failing to legally recognize a man who has acted as a child only father,regardless of his relationship with the child and desire to accept paternal responsibility,solely because he is determined not to be the biological father.neither the presumed father statutes nor those governing use of genetic tests to determine paternity were developed for use in the dependency context.the presumed father statutes are part of the uniform parentage act,et,which was enacted to eliminate the legal distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children,replacing the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children with the concept of the parent and child relationship.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.whatever role genetic testing may play in resolving disputes between competing fathers,or confirming the financial obligations of fathers who might prefer to ignore their roles,we fail to see what purpose is served by using genetic testing to defeat an existing relationship when there is no biological father seeking to assume care,support and nurturance of the child.in the present case,appellant does not seek to interfere with another man claim of paternity.if appellant assertions are true and if he is presently fit to parent raphael,allowing appellant to take custody of the boy with whom he has shared a relationship would only recognize the reality of appellant role in raphael life the matter must be remanded for the trial court to determine whether appellant meets the statutory definition of a presumed father.
appellant and raphael additionally urge appellant was entitled to presumed father status by virtue of having executed a voluntary declaration of paternity when raphael was born.section,subdivision a,provides u pon the event of a live birth,prior to an unmarried mother leaving any hospital,the person responsible for registering live births under section of the health and safety code shall provide to the natural mother and shall attempt to provide,at the place of birth,to the man identified by the natural mother as the natural father,a voluntary declaration of paternity together with the written materials described in section.staff in the hospital shall witness the signatures of parents signing a voluntary declaration of paternity and shall forward the signed declaration to the department of child support services within days of the date the declaration was signed.a copy of the declaration shall be made available to each of the attesting parents.if the declaration is not registered by the person responsible for registering live births at the hospital,it may be completed by the attesting parents,notarized,and mailed to the department of child support services at any time after the child birth,subd.d.except as provided in sections rescission or motion to set aside declaration,effect of declaration made on or before,and effect of minor declaration,a completed voluntary declaration of paternity,as described in section form requirements,that has been filed with the department of child support services shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.the voluntary declaration of paternity shall be recognized as a basis for the establishment of an order for child custody,visitation,or child support.
no voluntary declaration of paternity is included in the record in this case.appellant stated in his declaration in the trial court that a t the hospital,i wanted to be put on the baby birth certificate as the father.i believe i and neimaha were given a form to sign to say that i was the baby father.i signed it.moreover,appellant and raphael argue that the appearance of appellant name as the father on raphael birth certificate,which does appear in the record,proves appellant signed the voluntary declaration of paternity.health and safety code section,which sets forth the information required to be included in a birth certificate,provides if the parents are not married to each other,the father name shall not be listed on the birth certificate unless the father and the mother sign a voluntary declaration of paternity at the hospital before the birth certificate is prepared.the birth certificate may be amended to add the father name at a later date only if paternity for the child has been established by a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or by the filing of a voluntary declaration of paternity.see,a d i,italics added.
appellant and raphael argue,as appellant did in the trial court,that since health and safety code section prohibits listing an unmarried father on the birth certificate absent a signed voluntary declaration of paternity,the fact that his name appears on the birth certificate demonstrates he in fact signed the certificate.the trial court seemed to accept this logic,acknowledging that appellant said he signed one in the hospital,and the name on the birth certificate indicates he probably did.the trial court rejected the argument,however,because there was no evidence that the voluntary declaration of paternity was filed with the department of child support services as required by section for the voluntary declaration of paternity to have the force of a judgment of paternity.
in our original opinion,we upheld the trial court determination on the theory that appellant,as the party seeking to establish presumed father status,had the burden of providing evidence to support the presumption upon which he relied.in petitions for rehearing,appellant and raphael contend that our conclusion ignored the effect of evidence code section.evidence code section provides it is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed this presumption affect s the burden of proof,meaning that the party against whom it operates has the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact,people martinez cal th,d.
as described above,section,subdivision a,provides that hospital staff shall witness the signatures of parents signing a voluntary declaration of paternity and shall forward the signed declaration to the department of child support services within days of the date the declaration was signed.this statute imposes an official duty on hospital staff to forward signed voluntary declarations of paternity for filing.accordingly,once appellant provided prima facie proof that he signed a voluntary declaration of paternity,as he did by showing his name was on the birth certificate,he was entitled to rely upon the presumption of evidence code section to establish that the document was properly filed,and it was the department burden to disprove this fact.
in its answer to the petitions for rehearing,the department argues any presumption established under evidence code section was rebutted.it points to the paternity inquiry issued by the trial court to the district attorney office,which inquired whether paternity had previously been declared by a court order or judgment.the district attorney office replied no case opened for this child.according to the department,this evidence demonstrates that appellant did not complete a voluntary declaration of paternity because if he had done so,the district attorney office would have opened a support case.while the department assumption is logical enough,it is only an assumption and not proof.had the trial court recognized the application of evidence code section on this issue,it could have made a factual determination whether the evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that a signed and filed voluntary declaration of paternity existed.on remand,the trial court will have an opportunity to reconsider this issue as well 
the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
appellant parental rights were terminated at a hearing on november.respondent,on january,after completion of the briefing on appeal,asked this court to take judicial notice of the termination order and to dismiss the appeal as moot.we take judicial notice of the order but deny the request for dismissal.if the trial court determination that appellant could not be considered raphael presumed father was incorrect,the resulting termination proceedings which occurred without appellant participation could not stand.
