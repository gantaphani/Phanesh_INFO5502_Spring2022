scott appeals orders of the juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c scott contends the court erred when it removed his children from his custody at the disposition hearing without considering whether he could make appropriate arrangements for the children care while incarcerated.
we conclude when a noncustodial parent is incarcerated,the court must proceed under section to determine whether the incarcerated parent desires to assume custody of the child.unlike section,section does not distinguish between an offending and nonoffending parent,and the court applies section without regard to the characterization of the parent as offending or nonoffending.if a noncustodial incarcerated parent seeks custody of the child,the court must determine whether placement with that parent would be detrimental to the child safety,protection,or physical or emotional,subd.a.among the factors in determining detriment are the noncustodial incarcerated parent ability to make appropriate arrangements for the care of the child and the length of that parent incarceration.in re th,in re isayah th,d isayah.
although this record may support a finding that placement with the noncustodial incarcerated father would be detrimental to the children,we decline to make implied findings where the trial court has not considered the appropriate statutory provision.in re marquis th,d marquis.instead,we reverse the dispositional orders as to scott and remand the case to the trial court to consider and make proper findings under section,subdivision a.marquis,at,d.
factual and procedural background 
scott is the presumed father of,and,and alleged father of together,children on january,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed petitions on behalf of the children,who were then seven,five,two and one years old.the petitions alleged the children had suffered,or there was a substantial risk they would suffer,serious physical harm or illness as a result of their mother long history of child neglect and methamphetamine abuse,subd.b.the agency also filed petitions alleging scott and the children mother were incarcerated and unable to arrange adequate care for the children,subd.g.

at the jurisdiction hearing on april,the court admitted the agency reports into evidence.scott did not the social worker or present affirmative evidence.the court granted the agency motion to dismiss the allegations of the petition filed under section,subdivision g because the children mother was no longer incarcerated.the court sustained the petitions under section,subdivision b.
at the disposition hearing,scott contested the agency recommendation to deny reunification services to him.the social worker testified the recommendation was based on the length of scott incarceration,his extensive criminal history,his use of a weapon to commit a crime,his failure to complete and return a prison packet to the social worker and his lack of relationships with the three youngest children.the agency initiated procedures to place the children with a relative who lived out of state.
the court removed the children from parental custody under section,subdivision c,and placed the children in foster care the court offered a plan of reunification services to the children mother,and denied scott reunification services under section,subdivisions b and e.
discussiona.introduction 
scott contends the court erred when it removed the children from his custody under section,subdivision c.he argues because jurisdiction was based only on the conduct of the children mother,he should have been treated as a nonoffending parent and allowed to retain custody of the children under section,subdivision c.scott also contends the court erroneously removed the children from his custody without a showing,by clear and convincing evidence,that he was unable to arrange for the children care while he was incarcerated,subd.c.
the agency contends scott forfeited the right to claim error as a ground for reversal because he did not specifically assert at trial that he was entitled to retain custody of the children under section,subdivision c or,or that the court was required to make findings under section.on the merits,the agency objects to scott characterization of himself as a nonoffending parent and argues section,subdivision c does not apply.instead,the agency maintains that section governs the court determination whether there is sufficient detriment to conclude that placement with the noncustodial parent would be detrimental to the child.the agency acknowledges the court did not proceed under section,subdivision a,but argues the court did not err because scott did not request custody of his children.alternatively,the agency argues evidence of detriment to the children is clear,and any necessary findings under section may be implied from the record.
in response,scott contends the issue before this court is whether section,subdivision c was properly applied.he argues the question is an issue of law that is not forfeited on appeal.scott posits the court could not order the children removal from his physical custody under section,subdivision c,and argues the court erred when it did not proceed under section,subdivision a.scott contends he informed the court he was able to make suitable arrangements for the care of his children during his incarceration,and asserts this statement was the functional equivalent of a request for custody.finally,scott asserts this court can not imply a finding of detriment under section,subdivision a on review.he maintains there is no evidence to support a finding that placement in his care would be detrimental to the children.
forfeiture 
we conclude scott has not forfeited appellate review as to whether the court properly applied section,subdivision c.as a general rule,a new theory may not be presented for the first time on appeal unless it raises only a question of law and can be decided on undisputed facts.piscitelli friedenberg th,d see people superior court zamudio cal th,d.when the facts are not disputed,the effect or legal significance of those facts is a question of law.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,ghirardo.a question of law is not automatically subject to the doctrine of forfeiture.people butler d.ward taggart cal d.
we review applicable legal principles de novo,but apply a deferential standard of review to the court exercise of discretion and resolution of disputed facts.ghirardo,supra,cal th at,d.
c.when the court removes a child from a custodial parent under section,it must first make determinations concerning the noncustodial parent under section 
the dependency statutory framework distinguishes between a parent with whom the child was residing at the time the section petition was initiated custodial parent,and a parent with whom the child was not residing at the time the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section noncustodial parent,subd.c,subd.a.section,subdivision c governs the child removal from the physical custody of a parent it does not,by its terms,encompass the situation of the noncustodial parent.superior court,supra,th at,d.unlike section,section is not a removal statute.in re luke th,d.rather,section governs the child temporary placement with the noncustodial parent and the provision of reunification services to the parents,and also permits the court to grant legal and physical custody of the child to the noncustodial parent,subds.a,b see superior court,supra,at,d.
here,the court ordered the removal of the children from the custody of both parents under section,subdivision c without considering whether the children resided with both parent
