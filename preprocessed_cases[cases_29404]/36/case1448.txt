jeffrey jeffrey or father appeals orders under the welfare and institutions code placing his children,luke and lenay,with their paternal aunt and uncle,rather than with him,pending reunification with the children mother,kathy kathy or mother.he contends the court improperly considered the statutes relating to sibling relationships when making its decision the court ruling violated his substantive due process rights by placing sibling rights over parental rights substantial evidence did not support the finding under section that the children would suffer detriment if placed with him the court abused its discretion by requiring interstate compact on placement of children icpc approval before placing the children with him and the court did not order appropriate reunification services for him.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we reject his arguments except as to the issue of reunification services.the parties agree jeffrey is entitled to appropriate reunification services.accordingly,we reverse the orders in part and direct the court to hold a new dispositional hearing for the limited purpose of ordering an appropriate reunification plan for jeffrey 
factual and procedural background 
jeffrey and kathy had three children from their relationship luke,born in lenay,born in and lindsey,born in.leanna,who is not jeffrey biological daughter,was born in october.leanna viewed jeffrey as her biological father and,during the course of these proceedings,the court granted jeffrey application for de facto father status for leanna.luke and lenay are the only children at issue in this appeal,but we will present facts regarding the other children to provide the context for the court ruling.
in,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed dependency petitions on behalf of the children because lindsey tested positive for drugs at birth and the parents did not comply with a voluntary contract to keep a clean and safe home.as a result of the agency intervention,jeffrey entered alcohol treatment.kathy successfully reunified with the children and apparently became their custodial parent.at some point not clear in the record,kathy and jeffrey ended their relationship.
in march,kathy obtained a restraining order against jeffrey based on allegations he had physically and verbally abused her.some of his abusive behavior was fueled by alcohol.by fall,jeffrey had moved to ohio and appeared to have conquered his alcohol and domestic violence problems.
in april,the agency removed all four children and filed section petitions on behalf of the children after police arrested kathy for drug possession.the petitions alleged failure to protect under section,subdivision b because kathy used methamphetamine,was not providing a home for the children,and had been arrested for possessing illegal drug paraphernalia and jeffrey had been unable to protect and supervise the children.the petitions also alleged no provision for support under section,subdivision g because kathy was incarcerated,jeffrey was,and neither parent was able to arrange appropriate or adequate care.
in two may reports,the agency social worker recommended that the children be placed with jeffrey in ohio.the social worker noted that kathy wanted them to remain in california,but that she had a long history of substance abuse apparently relapsing after five years of sobriety and difficulty providing the children with a stable environment.jeffrey had a job and medical insurance available for the children in ohio,and a large home near an elementary school.he had had weekly telephone contact with the children since he moved to ohio,although at times he was unable to locate the children because of kathy transient lifestyle.when he lost contact with the children,he contacted the agency for assistance and made numerous attempts to locate them.before he moved to ohio,all four children stayed with jeffrey for three weeks in october.
the social worker noted the extremely strong bond between the children,as evidenced by a polinsky children center counselor assessment that it would be detrimental to separate the children.based on the overriding need not to separate the children,as well as jeffrey ability to provide for them,the social worker recommended that the children be sent to reside with jeffrey in ohio upon completion of a favorable icpc.
at a may jurisdictional hearing,each parent represented by counsel submitted to the social worker may reports on the section,subdivision b counts.the court made true findings on those counts,and dismissed the section,subdivision g counts.
in a july addendum report,the social worker modified her recommendation.the children were now living with their paternal aunt and uncle the social worker reported that leanna who was to begin high school in august and lenay age eight did not want to move to ohio.luke age was eager to reside with his father in ohio.lindsey age four was too young to understand.the mother still preferred all the children stay in california,but her second choice was that luke go to his father,that lindsey reside with her at a treatment facility,and that leanna and lenay remain with their aunt and uncle.jeffrey told the social worker he did not want leanna to move to ohio if that would make her unhappy.the social worker recommended that for the next six months the children should be stabilized in their current setting,allowed to visit jeffrey in ohio,and then for those children who wished to reside with him slowly transitioned to his home in ohio.furthermore,should kathy make progress in her recovery,her situation could be reassessed as a potential placement for the children.
in an august report,the social worker again modified her recommendation.on august,lindsey had been reunified with her mother at the treatment facility.in july,luke,lenay,and lindsey visited jeffrey in ohio for two weeks.after the visit to ohio,luke stated that although he wanted to visit his father,he no longer wanted to live with him.luke and lenay both stated they wanted to stay with their aunt and uncle until their mother is able to move from the treatment facility.leanna thought she wanted to live with her mother in the future,but definitely did not want to live with her father in ohio,although she would like to visit him.
the social worker opined that,based on her involvement with the case,the wishes of the children should be followed.she noted that the children are bonded to each other and become depressed when approached with the thought of being separated.ever since they were removed from their mother,the children had repeatedly asked not to be separated.the children depended upon each other for support,love,and security.noting that the mother had made great strides in her treatment,the social worker concluded that moving the children to ohio would be detrimental to them and would cut off the possibility of the mother reunifying as soon as possible.the social worker recommended that leanna,luke,and lenay remain with their paternal aunt and uncle until their mother was able to obtain sober living housing,and that lindsey continue with her mother at the treatment center.
at an august,disposition hearing,the court heard testimony from luke,the social worker,and jeffrey.explaining her opinion that it would be detrimental for the children to reside with their father,the social worker testified that luke cried every time she brought up the subject and that he is extremely connected to his siblings and to his relatives and ca even stand the thought of having to leave them.further,lenay sobbed when discussing her visit with her father,is extremely bonded to leanna,and wants to live with her mother and her siblings.the social worker reiterated her statement in her report that from the inception of the case,all the children have asked of her is not to be separated from each other.
after the presentation of evidence,the court declared the children to be dependents under section,subdivision d and removed leanna,luke,and lenay from kathy custody pursuant to section,subdivision c.lindsey was placed with her mother at the treatment center.the court ordered that leanna,who was not jeffrey biological daughter,be placed with her aunt and uncle because to send her to ohio would seriously impede her mother ability to reunify with her.
the court found jeffrey was a nonoffending,noncustodial parent of luke and lenay within the meaning of section.however,the court found placing luke and lenay with jeffrey in ohio would be detrimental to their emotional because of their significant bond with their siblings.the court observed the raw emotions and true sense of fear of separation from his siblings when luke testified,and emphasized the record would not come anywhere close to revealing the depth of that young man reaction to the prospect of being separated.the court noted that both parents acknowledged that separating the children would have an impact on them,and for that reason jeffrey requested that all four children go with him to ohio,whereas kathy requested that all four of them remain in california.after a lengthy exposition of its observations,the court concluded that the children life experiences had forced them to bond together in a manner that far more significant than a normal sibling bond,and i think it a bond of survival.the court emphasized that the detriment to the children did not arise from any conduct by jeffrey,but arose from the lack of security which would come from separating them from each other.
the court adopted the permanent plan recommended by the agency,that the children be reunified with their mother first lindsey,and then the other three children when the mother obtains transitional housing.pending reunification with the mother,the court ordered that leanna,luke,and lenay be placed with their paternal aunt and uncle in san diego.
the court also noted that if the mother was not able to reunify,it would have to balance this differently even though the same emotional detriment might arise.the court ordered the agency to develop objective criteria to track the progress of reunification with the mother,including such factors as obtaining housing and maintaining sobriety,and to include a plan for interim visitation with jeffrey.
discussion 
placement order 
jeffrey contends the statutes protecting sibling relationships apply only to placement of dependents with nonparents,and thus the trial court improperly invoked those sections in rendering the disposition order denying placement with a parent.he also asserts the trial court ruling placed sibling rights before parental rights in violation of his fundamental right to parent.further,he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the court ruling denying placement with him on the basis that his conduct did not cause any detriment and without any testimony from an expert,the social worker and children opinions regarding placement were insufficient to establish detriment.
statutory framework 
section governs a dependency court initial acquisition of jurisdiction over a child.section,subdivision b provides that jurisdiction exists when a child is at risk to suffer serious physical harm or illness as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child,or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse italics added.section,subdivision c authorizes the court to remove a child from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated if the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence that t here is substantial danger to the physical health,safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the minor or would be if the minor were returned home,and there are no reasonable means by which the minor physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor parents or guardians physical custody.italics added.
section,subdivision a governs placement of a child after the dependency court has acquired jurisdiction of a child.the section provides when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.italics added.
various statutes require the court to consider sibling relationships in rendering placement decisions.section,subdivision a states the legislative intent to ensure the preservation and strengthening of the child family ties by ensuring that when siblings have been removed from their home,the siblings will be placed in foster care together section,subdivision b requires that the agency make a diligent effort in all placements of dependent children,including those with relatives,to develop and maintain sibling relationships section,subdivision i states that where the court has ordered removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section,the court shall consider whether there are any siblings under the court jurisdiction,the nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings,the appropriateness of developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to section,and the impact of the sibling relationships on the child placement and planning for legal permanence.section,subdivision d sets forth detailed requirements on the issue of sibling relationships that must be included in the social worker social study,including a discussion of the nature of the sibling relationships,the appropriateness of maintaining the sibling relationship pursuant to section,an explanation of the efforts made to place the siblings together,and the impact of the sibling relationships on placement and planning for legal permanence.section,subdivision d,specifically instructs the social worker to evaluate such matters as the extent of the bonds between the siblings and whether a sibling expresses a desire to visit or live with his or her sibling.sections and require that this social study discussing sibling relationships be received in evidence and considered by the court before it renders its disposition decision.similarly,section,subdivision a,governing review hearings for dependents in foster care,directs the trial court to consider the same matters as set forth in section,subdivision d,the nature of the sibling relationships,maintenance of the relationship pursuant to section,an evaluation of what efforts are being made to place the siblings together.
consideration of sibling relationships in placement decision 
section,subdivision a requires that the court place a dependent child with a noncustodial,nonoffending parent who requests custody,unless the placement would be detrimental to the child.there is nothing in this section,nor in the statutory scheme set forth above,that expressly or impliedly suggests the court is not permitted to consider sibling relationships as part of its placement determination even when the placement under consideration is with a noncustodial parent.to the contrary,the statutes expressly authorize the court to consider sibling relationships when making its placement decisions.although the consideration of sibling relationships set forth in sections and by their terms are confined to a nonparent placement,sections,subdivision i governing postremoval placement and,subdivision d governing the contents of the social worker social study at disposition hearings are much broader than section.these latter sections require the court to evaluate the appropriateness of maintaining sibling relationships pursuant to section,in nonparent placements,and then,independent of the reference to section,also direct the court to consider the nature and impact of the sibling relationships when making placement orders at the disposition stage.given this broad
