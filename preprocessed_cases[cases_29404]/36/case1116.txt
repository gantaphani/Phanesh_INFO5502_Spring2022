joshua michaely husband appeals from the judgment entered in the dissolution proceeding filed by his former wife,patti michaely wife.we affirm.
factual and procedural summary 
this dissolution case has an extraordinarily long history.the petition was filed on january,after the parties had been married for years.the judgment of dissolution was in august of,but the judgment that is the subject of this appeal,the further judgment on reserved issues,was not entered until august of.the reserved issues were financial issues,and the issues on appeal concern sanctions,in the form of factual findings,which were imposed on husband as the result of his conduct during discovery,in particular his conduct at a deposition.
these are the relevant facts 
wife first took husband deposition in march of.in may of,she noticed another deposition.husband objected,but the court the case was then assigned to judge denner,found that wife had demonstrated good cause for the suspension of code of civil procedure section t,the one deposition rule,in that the issues and facts involved are complicated,and because husband moves monies from entity to entity and the information which wife obtained from husband prior depositions does not provide wife with current information in addition,the parties have lived an extravagant lifestyle,little or no income has been reported on the parties individual income tax returns or the income tax returns of husband for the last several years.therefore,wife should be given an opportunity to complete discovery regarding the means by which husband has been able sustain the marital standard of living without reporting substantial income.
the deposition never took place,delayed by discovery disputes and wife bankruptcy,which was filed in february.the discovery disputes concerned wife august interrogatories,which husband did not fully answer until march,after wife brought a motion to compel november,which resulted in a report august from retired judge saeta,then the discovery referee,and a november court order adopting judge saeta recommendation that husband be compelled to further respond to the vast majority of wife interrogatories and finding,inter alia,that the volume of transactions and documents make this a complex tracing of assets case.
in march of,after wife obtained relief from the bankruptcy stay,she moved for an order discovery.trial was then set for september.judge lachs the case was assigned to any number of judges over the years granted the motion.wife was ordered to pay husband air fare from israel,where he then lived,and a a day per diem.the court also ruled that a discovery referee would preside over the deposition.
as husband repeatedly points out,wife earlier request for additional discovery was denied.in june wife moved for an order to vacate the trial date and to extend discovery.judge denner stayed trial of economic issues until relief from the stay was granted in wife bankruptcy,and denied the request to extend the discovery.
the deposition that judge lachs ordered took place in june.retired judge goldin presided as referee.in september,wife moved for sanctions based on husband document production and his performance at the deposition.hearing on the motion was before judge goldin.it did not take place until february,apparently delayed by husband bankruptcy,which was filed in september.on wife motion,relief from the stay was granted in january.
judge goldin report was signed on october,and filed with the court in november of that year.she found that at the deposition,husband engaged in intentional,pervasive,and egregious evasiveness,was willfully untruthful,and gave inconsistent and contradictory testimony.his conduct at the deposition was the equivalent of refusing to sit for the deposition,in violation of court order.husband failed to produce documents in response to the request for production,did not produce documents he claimed to have produced,claimed that he could not identify documents that he did produce,and intentionally produced voluminous documentation which was not responsive.he had in the past failed to comply with other discovery.his intentionally evasive and obstreperous conduct deprived wife of meaningful discovery.
judge goldin recommended that various facts be established as true husband had management and control over the community estate during the marriage and after the separation he owed a fiduciary duty to wife in the management and control of community assets which he breached and he willfully and maliciously engaged in acts to deprive wife of her share of the community estate.judge goldin recommended that it be established as true that the estate had a value of million on the date of separation,and additionally made a separate finding to that effect,based on the evidence.
judge goldin also recommended that it be established as true that wife needed at least per month in support and that husband could pay that amount,and that husband be precluded from opposing many of wife claims,specifically the claims that he misappropriated a long list of community properties,including real properties,businesses,and insurance policies.
in november,the bankruptcy court hearing husband bankruptcy found that his debts to wife and her lawyers were not dischargeable.the bankruptcy court order recites that that court reviewed judge goldin report,and while it did not give evidentiary effect to the report,it did give such support to the evidence cited therein.the bankruptcy court noted that it had read husband deposition transcript and that of his former associate maureen sowell,and found extensive and persuasive support for judge goldin findings and recommendations.
in june,the court by now,judge sandoz adopted judge goldin report as its own order,finding that the order was necessary to level the playing field and prevent wife from being prejudiced by husband willful and egregious misuse of discovery,and that the imposition of lesser sanctions would not be a sufficient remedy.the court found husband consistent evasion,coupled with his responses which were blatant untruths and not credible,amounted to an egregious abuse of the discovery process.
at trial,husband took the position that sanctions precluded him from introducing evidence on the vast majority of the issues.wife introduced evidence on income that should be imputed to husband from the date of separation,her need for support,and fees.
in the further judgment on reserved issues,the court found that husband breached his fiduciary duty to wife while he had control of community assets,willfully and maliciously engaged in acts to deprive her of her share of the community estate,and perpetrated fraud on her.wife was awarded million,plus interest,plus support of per month,plus attorney fees.
discussion 
the order discovery 
husband first argument is that judge lachs order that he sit for another deposition was an abuse of discretion.husband contends,inter alia,that under code of civil procedure section,he had a right to have discovery end days before trial,that wife failed to meet and confer,and that in any event wife had all the information she needed.husband does not explain why any abuse of discretion on judge lachs part could lead to reversal now.we do not see that it could.husband conduct at the deposition and throughout discovery caused the sanctions.the deposition order itself caused him no harm.we thus need not and do not reach the substance of husband arguments.cal,art.vi.
judge goldin report 
husband next argues that the report was procedurally defective in two ways.first,he argues that the order appointing the referee was invalid under code of civil procedure section,which in provided that the referee must reside in the county in which the action or proceeding is triable husband points out that judge goldin office was in los osos,in san luis obispo county,and argues that it is unreasonable to conclude that she lived in los angeles county,and that the trial court should have investigated the location of her residence.he further argues that he did not learn that judge goldin office was in los osos until she began sending bills and other communications to
