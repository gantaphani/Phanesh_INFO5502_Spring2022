three law enforcement officers,acting on directions from two assistant state attorneys,took stacey morrell child from her home in illinois and gave the child to his putative father pursuant to an ex parte order issued by a new mexico court.in this appeal we must decide if morrell has stated a claim for deprivation,without due process,of a constitutionally protected liberty interest,and if so,whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit.although we hold that morrell allegations are sufficient to state a constitutional claim,we agree with the district court that defendants are entitled to immunity and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
stacey morrell had an affair with john howell while both were assigned to a military base in albuquerque,new mexico.after the affair ended,morrell reconciled with her husband,david,and the couple moved to el paso,texas,where david had been assigned for active duty.in el paso,stacey morrell gave birth to joshua morrell.david morrell was identified as the father on joshua birth certificate.
meanwhile,howell filed a petition to establish paternity,custody,and time sharing in a new mexico court,and on the day before joshua was born in el paso,howell attempted service on morrell by posting a copy of the summons and petition on the premises of her former home in albuquerque.morrell never received that posted notice,and after she failed to enter an appearance,howell moved for a default judgment.at a hearing on howell motion,new mexico judge anne kass ordered that morrell be served by personal service and ordered her to appear in court on the day following service.that order was served on morrell by hand delivery in el paso,and when she failed to appear the next day,judge kass entered the following order 
it is found in open court 
respondent was personally served with an order to appear at the first business day following service.she was personally served on june.she failed to appear at june.
respondent has intentionally been avoiding service of process in this paternity case.
respondent has willfully failed and refused to participate in an orderly process to determine parentage.
it is ordered in open court 
law enforcement authorities are authorized and requested to assist john howell in obtaining physical custody of a male child born on or about.
ii.upon obtaining physical custody,a parentage determination shall be undertaken.it may be undertaken in new mexico or in south carolina as howell decides.
iii.if parentage determination is undertaken in so.carolina or in any other state,new mexico relinquishes jurisdiction to such other state to determine custody,visitation and child support issues.
iv.judgment is entered against stacey morrell in favor of john howell for fees and costs herein of.
after the order was entered,morrell filed a special appearance contesting jurisdiction.at about the same time,david morrell active duty assignment in el paso ended,and the family moved to stacey morrell parents home in indiana while david morrell sought new employment.there,stacey morrell filed a petition to establish paternity,and howell responded with a motion to dismiss,relying on the new mexico court prior assertion of jurisdiction and asserting that he had already commenced another paternity action in south carolina where howell resided.while the indiana action was pending,david morrell secured a job in illinois,and the morrells moved there with joshua.
howell then traveled to illinois and filed the new mexico order with the will county circuit court clerk.howell appeared that same day on an emergency motion before the will county circuit court and requested enforcement of the new mexico order by way of a body attachment a civil writ ordering the seizure of a person.the illinois judge refused to issue the writ without notice to stacey morrell.undeterred,howell went to the will county state attorney office and spoke to defendant judy devriendt,an assistant state attorney.devriendt telephoned the local police and told them to take custody of joshua pursuant to the new mexico order.when the local police went to stacey morrell home,she showed them pleadings from the indiana action.after consulting with their superiors,the police decided not to take custody of joshua and advised howell that they would not take further action without an order from the will county court.
devriendt then consulted defendant philip mock,chief of the state attorney civil division.mock reviewed the new mexico order and the docket sheet from the hearing before the will county circuit court,which showed that the court had denied howell emergency motion for a body attachment.mock then read the illinois uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja.comp.stat,et,which governs the recognition in illinois of custody determinations of other states.he also checked the circuit court computer database to determine whether any other orders or judgments involving these parties had been filed in will county,and directed his subordinates to verify that the new mexico order had not been vacated.mock concluded that the new mexico order was valid and directed devriendt to have the will county sheriff department pick up the child and give him to howell.
defendant richard ackerson,an investigator with the will county sheriff department,was assigned to the case.according to ackerson,devriendt showed him the new mexico order and paperwork from the indiana action,told him that the new mexico order had been validated by an illinois judge,and directed him to arrest morrell if she did not cooperate.acting on her instructions,ackerson and two deputy sheriffs,defendants richard holman and keith ploense,went to the morrells home.as she had when the police visited a few days earlier,morrell showed the sheriff deputies the paperwork from the indiana action.she also asked them to speak by telephone with her lawyer in indiana,who told them that the indiana action had superceded the new mexico order.ackerson replied that he had instructions to serve the new mexico order,which was the only one that had been validated in illinois.morrell gave joshua to the being threatened with arrest if she the deputies gave the infant to howell.howell immediately returned to south carolina with joshua.
later that day,morrell appeared before another judge in will county,who ordered mock to retrieve the baby.joshua was reunited with his mother four days later.
b.the district court proceedings 
morrell filed suit on behalf of herself and joshua claiming a deprivation,without due process,of their liberty interests in familial relations protected by the fourteenth amendment.after discovery,all parties moved for summary judgment.without reaching the question of whether there had been a constitutional violation,the district court held that the deputies were absolutely immune from liability for damages arising from their execution of the court order.with respect to the assistant state attorneys,the court held that reasonable persons in their position would not have known that ordering the child to be seized was unconstitutional,and that they were therefore entitled to qualified immunity from damages.the court therefore granted the defendants motions for summary judgment,denied the plaintiff cross motion for summary judgment,and entered judgment for the defendants.
ii.analysis 
to evaluate defendants claim of qualified immunity under,the court must decide whether plaintiff has stated a claim for violation of her constitutional rights,and if so,whether those rights were clearly established at the time of the violation,such that a reasonable official would understand that what he was doing violates those rights.wilson layne,d mitchell randolph,cir.we first address the constitutionality of the defendants conduct.saucier katz,d pearson ramos,cir.on that question,we are required to determine only whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,state a claim of deprivation.delaney detella,cir see also katz.at.we review the district court judgment de novo.mcgrath gillis,cir.
a.the constitutional violation 
morrell contends that the new mexico court lacked jurisdiction,and that the court order could not be enforced in illinois until morrell received notice and an opportunity to be heard in illinois.her claim is based on a mother liberty interest,protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,in the companionship,care,custody,and control of her child.see lassiter dep t of soc,d brokaw mercer county,cir ellis hamilton,cir to meet the requirements of due process,the state must afford notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.armstrong manzo,d.we have held that,absent exigent circumstances,due process requires a hearing before state officials may remove a child from his home.brokaw,at ellis,at accord hollingsworth hill,cir hurlman rice,cir.
defendants do not claim that there were exigent circumstances that would justify seizing the child before notice and hearing.instead,they argue that morrell constitutional claim fails because of the availability of a hearing in illinois.their argument is based on ellis hamilton,in which we held,with respect to the plaintiffs claim that they were denied due process when various state officials allegedly blocked their efforts to adopt their grandchildren,that due process was not denied because the state provided a variety of remedies by which to correct the officials alleged misbehavior.at.however,ellis is distinguishable because in that case the grandparents acquiesced in the child welfare officials directive to turn the children over,and the children were not as in this case taken from the home without prior notice and under a threat of arrest.see at.moreover,the right of the grandparents in ellis is less compelling than the right of a biological,custodial parent,and therefore lesser procedural protections may be consistent with due process.see weller dep t of soc,cir distinguishing ellis on this basis.
however,the defendants are correct that morrell had actual notice of the new mexico hearing albeit less than hours notice and then had more than four months to either raise her jurisdictional defenses in new mexico or pursue a collateral attack elsewhere before the order was enforced.the question,then,is whether in addition to prejudgment process provided in new mexico,illinois must provide notice and an opportunity to be heard.on this point,morrell argues that a state may not enforce another state order without prior notice and a hearing.she relies on cases holding that a state judgment can not be enforced out of the state by an execution issued within it.mcelmoyle ex rel.bailey cohen,pet.williams north carolina.but these cases do not prescribe the method that a state must use in domesticating another state order the method,as morrell concedes,is determined by the local law of the enforcing state.see baker general motors,d citing mcelmoyle,at,pet.restatement second of conflict of laws the local law of the forum determines the methods by which a judgment of another state is enforced.
morrell next relies on cases holding that the due process clause establishes limits on the rendering state exercise of jurisdiction over,and that judgments entered beyond those limits are void and may not be enforced in that state or in any other,see,williams,at.pennoyer neff,otto,and on the principle that a defendant challenging a court jurisdiction may ignore the court proceedings,risk a default judgment,and resist enforcement in a collateral attack on the first court jurisdiction.see,williams,at.chicago life ins.cherry.thompson whitman,wall.bd.of,sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir united states county of cook,cir observing that the exception from res judicata for collateral attacks challenging jurisdiction is necessary because otherwise a court that lacked jurisdiction could a party to litigate the subject,decide in favor of its own power,and thus block any review of its adjudicatory competence.again,however,these cases do not establish any particular procedure that must be followed by a state asked to enforce another state order,and do not hold that notice and a hearing on the question of the rendering state jurisdiction must in all cases precede enforcement.
closer to the question before us are two supreme court decisions considering what process is due when a creditor seeks to enforce a judgment.in encyclopedia press,the court held that,having received full notice and hearing on the underlying judgment,the debtor was not entitled to further notice before execution of that judgment 
t he established rules of our system of jurisprudence do not require that a defendant who has been granted an opportunity to be heard and has had his day in court,should,after a judgment has been rendered against him,have a further notice and hearing before supplemental proceedings are taken to reach his property in satisfaction of the judgment.thus,in the absence of a statutory requirement,it is not essential that he be given notice before the issuance of an execution against his tangible property after the rendition of the judgment he must take notice of what will follow,no further notice being necessary to advance justice.
id.at.citations omitted.
however,a later case,griffin griffin,appears to narrow the holding in endicott.in griffin,a wife litigated and won an award of alimony,and ten years later,without notice to the husband,she obtained a judgment that alimony payments were in arrears and a writ authorizing execution of that judgment.the court held that the failure to give notice of the later proceedings violated due process,and therefore,that the judgment could not be enforced 
while it is undoubtedly true that the decree,taken with the new york practice on the subject,gave petitioner notice at the time of its entry that further proceedings might be taken to docket in judgment form the obligation to pay installments accruing under the decree,we find in this no ground for saying that due process does not require further notice of the time and place of such further proceedings,inasmuch as they undertook substantially to affect his rights in ways in which the decree did not.
id.at.the court in griffin did not make reference to endicott,but many courts have interpreted griffin as limiting endicott holding that notice and hearing on the underlying judgment serves as constructive notice of all that will follow.see,mccahey investors,cir brown liberty loan of duval,cir see also hanner demarcus,d douglas,dissenting from the dismissal of writ of certiorari on the question of overruling endicott.these cases interpret griffin as holding that,at least as to issues and rights that were not litigated in the underlying judgment,such as defenses to execution on particular assets,endicott does not supply the answer.mccahey,at brown,at see also aacen san juan county sheriff dep t,cir dionne bouley,cir.
viewed in light of griffin,we agree that endicott does not entirely foreclose consideration of whether the due process clause requires notice or other procedures.according to morrell,because she failed to appear in new mexico,she retained her right to collaterally attack jurisdiction elsewhere.as to jurisdiction without which the judgment is void,morrell never had the day in court that was the basis of endicott holding that no further notice was required.
in determining,then,what process if any is due,we must balance the nature of the private interests at stake,the risk of harm from erroneous deprivations,and the government interests affected.see mathews eldridge,d aacen,at mccahey,at finberg sullivan,cir en banc see also weller,at.we believe that the same considerations underlying the recognition of a parent due process right to notice and hearing justify the requirement of notice and some opportunity to object in the enforcing state,at least when the rendering court order is by default.to hold otherwise would force the parent to litigate her jurisdictional objections in any state chosen by an adverse party even if,as morrell asserts was the case here,the state lacked any connection with the child or personal jurisdiction over the parent,or else risk enforcement without notice in another state before she has an opportunity to mount a collater
