gerald lundahl contends the trial court erred in denying his petition to vacate registration of several utah spousal support orders in favor of his former wife,ruth telford.lundahl argues the five utah orders,issued between and,are void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the parties dissolution of marriage in california invested california with exclusive jurisdiction over spousal support.we disagree and affirm.in doing so,we revisit provisions of the revised uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act ruresa permitting concurrent support orders in different jurisdictions for differing amounts.we consider whether ruresa replacement,the uniform interstate family support act uifsa,codified at family code section et establishes a mechanism for settling upon a single order as controlling among multiple spousal support orders,as opposed to child support orders.under uifsa express terms,we conclude there is no provision for a single controlling spousal support order.
facts and procedural background 
lundahl and telford were married in utah in.they later moved to los angeles.after years of marriage and children,lundahl and telford dissolved their marriage in.the judgment of dissolution,issued by the los angeles family court,set child support at per month and spousal support at per month.a paragraph in the decree labeled reservation of jurisdiction stated the court reserves jurisdiction of the matter and as to all such issues as may be necessary to effect the purposes and intent of this order.the decree awarded telford custody of the minor children and she returned to utah.the next year,lundahl alleged problems had developed with his visitation rights.he filed an action in the utah courts,and the visitation issue was apparently resolved 
in,lundahl renewed litigation in los angeles.the matter was transferred to orange county.on august,the orange county court set child support at per month for four children until the eldest emancipated,then for three children until the next eldest emancipated,then per month for two children until one emancipated,and finally per month until the youngest emancipated.the court set spousal support at per month until the eldest child emancipated,whereupon it would increase to until the youngest child emancipated,and then continue at until the death of either party or remarriage of telford.
in,on lundahl motion,the orange county court modified custody by awarding him physical custody of one of the parties minor children.telford did not appear.
in,seeking enforcement of child and spousal support,telford filed in utah the first of several petitions that are the subject of this appeal.lundahl did not appear at a hearing on the court order to show cause on april.the court found lundahl had ceased paying a month in family support and ordered him to resume paying that amount.lundahl appeared at the next hearing on august,and the court set arrears at.neither the monthly family support amount,nor the arrears amount were broken down into separate amounts for child and spousal support.
lundahl again visited the orange county courthouse in,seeking custody of the parties only remaining minor child.the court granted lundahl custody request and terminated his child support obligation.telford did not appear.
the same year,a judgment in the utah court established arrears at through february.lundahl appeared at this hearing.in his written brief,he argued the court had no jurisdiction over support arrearages and in fact california has jurisdiction over this matter.but the court expressly concluded it had jurisdiction.the in arrears ordered by the court was a lump sum it did not distinguish between child and spousal support.
in november,lundahl sought a reduction of spousal support in orange county.telford testified and the matter was continued.she failed to appear at the next hearing,and spousal support was reduced to per month,beginning july.lundahl asserts this is the controlling amount.
in january,lundahl entered into a stipulation with the riverside county district attorney office.he agreed his child support arrears from august through december were,and consented to pay per month towards these arrears.the stipulation,filed in the riverside county superior court,expressly included the per month due under the orange county spousal support order,but did not specify whether any other portion of the arrears was for accrued spousal support or only for delinquent child support 
in april,on telford petition,the utah court set spousal support at per month and arrears at,plus attorney fees of.lundahl did not appear at the hearing on the petition.the court order noted the arrearage was based upon the temporary alimony and child support award of per month,adjusted by deducting the sum of of said amount representing the amount of child support and multiplying the remainder of by the months which have passed since the last judgment,the plaintiff having paid nothing since that time.
telford then attempted to set aside the orange county court spousal support order.in a motion to vacate the order,she claimed misinformation from lundahl counsel caused her to skip the hearing at which spousal support was reduced to.the court rejected her claim of extrinsic fraud or mistake,concluding she was in court on the,she knew of the continued date,she may have misunderstood,i give her the benefit,but i do think there is any extrinsic fraud,or any showing here that she was denied her right to appear in re marriage of lundahl,nonpub.opn.on appeal,telford changed tactics and asserted for the first time the trial court was without in personam or in rem jurisdiction because she made a special appearance and there was no other basis on which the court could assume jurisdiction.ibid.we concluded telford waived the argument,and further noted the record did not establish a special appearance and that,even if it had,the court,pursuant to the dissolution judgment,maintained jurisdiction over the parties and spousal support.id.at.
in february,after a hearing in utah at which lundahl again failed to appear,the utah court entered an order establishing back alimony at,plus interest,as well as in attorney fees.the court order did not specify the period covered by the figure.
on october,the family support division of the orange county district attorney office registered the two utah orders and the,and utah orders for enforcement in california.lundahl subsequently moved to vacate registration on five grounds the utah court lacked personal jurisdiction over him the utah support orders had been vacated,suspended,or modified by a later order the amount of arrears was incorrect some or all of the arrears were not enforceable and laches.in an amended order entered on september,the trial court concluded lundahl presented insufficient evidence to vacate registration on any of these grounds.on lundahl claim that the utah orders were void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the court specifically found the utah court had jurisdiction to make the orders because there was concurrent jurisdiction in both utah and california.the court confirmed registration of each of the utah orders and ordered all stays on enforcement lifted.
the court reserve d on the issue of the amount of arrears owed and a hearing was eventually scheduled for several months later.in an abundance of caution,lundahl appealed the trial court denial of his petition to vacate registration of the utah orders,and also sought a writ of supersedeas to stay enforcement of the registered orders.we denied the petition seeking writ relief.meanwhile,in its ruling denying lundahl petition to vacate registration,the trial court had ordered the district attorney office to use its best efforts to prepare an accounting of arrears and mail it to the parties.on being apprised of lundahl appeal,the trial court deferred the accounting pending our decision in this matter.
jurisdictional claims 
lundahl sole contention on appeal is that the utah orders were void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the parties dissolution in california invested california with exclusive jurisdiction over spousal support.he argues the utah orders were thus unenforceable and the court erred by not vacating registration.section,subdivision,requires registration of a support order to be vacated where a defense to enforcement exists under state law.a void judgment or order is,in legal effect,no judgment,and can not be enforced.rochin pat johnson manufacturing th,d cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll,common defenses to enforcement of a sister state judgment include that the judgment was rendered in excess of jurisdiction.whether california had sole subject matter jurisdiction over spousal support is a question of law that we review de novo.see robbins foothill nissan th,d subject matter jurisdiction is a matter of law.
no reservation of exclusive jurisdiction 
the terms of the california judgment of dissolution do not support lundahl claim it vested the state with exclusive jurisdiction over spousal support.lundahl seizes upon the final paragraph of the judgment of dissolution,labeled reservation of jurisdiction which states the court reserves jurisdiction of the matter and as to all such issues as may be necessary to effect the purposes and intent of this order.the word exclusive is simply not present in this language.we may not insert terms into a document that are not there code civ,and a fortiori,nor may a party.lundahl also relies on our opinion in the prior appeal between the parties in which we concluded the trial court,pursuant to the dissolution judgment,maintained jurisdiction over the parties and spousal support.but the issue there was whether the trial court had jurisdiction,not whether its jurisdiction was exclusive.because the issue was not raised,our opinion did not decide that jurisdiction in california precluded jurisdiction in utah.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,c ases are not authority,of course,for issues not raised or resolved.
no exclusive jurisdiction under ruresa 
lundahl argument under ruresa is similarly without merit.he contends under ruresa,the utah orders are surplusage and do not and can not create greater liabilities than that imposed by the california dissolution court.ruresa was in effect in california at the time of the dissolution through the order reducing spousal support to a month it also covered the,and utah orders,but not the utah arrearages order,which we discuss separately below contrary to lundahl assertion,both utah and california expressly recognize that ruresa sister states may issue independent support orders for differing amounts without having modified,superceded,or nullified each other orders.see,kammersell kammersell utah app,in re marriage of popenhager d.thus,an obligor spouse was confronted with the very real possibility of multiple and perhaps inconsistent orders enforceable against him.in re marriage of straeck d.the court in straeck concluded,while sympathetic to an obligor placed in this dilemma,our reply is that ruresa contemplates and allows this result.accord,kammersell kammersell,supra,at this is currently the view of a majority of jurisdictions that have adopted uresa or ruresa.
this view was grounded in section of ruresa and section of the former uniform act,uresa.as described in detail by an annotation,section of uresa provided that no order of support issued by a court of this state when acting as a responding state shall supersede any other order of support but the amounts for a particular period paid pursuant to either order shall be credited against amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under both.in ruresa,the substance of of uresa was transferred,with slight modification,to,which states that a support order made by a court of this state pursuant to this act does not nullify and is not nullified by a support order made by a court of this state pursuant to any other law or by a support order made by a court of any other state pursuant to a substantially similar act or any other law,regardless of priority of issuance,unless otherwise specifically provided by the court.amounts paid for a particular period pursuant to any support order made by the court of another state shall be credited against the amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under any support order made by the court of this state,construction and effect of provision of uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act that no support order shall supersede or nullify any other order,wl annotation.
notably,ruresa did not distinguish between child support orders and spousal support orders.see uifsa,west ann.supp.foll,under uifsa,a n order for spousal support is treated differently than an order for child support this marks a radical departure from ruresa,which treated spousal and child support orders identically.hence,the principles articulated for ruresa child support orders apply equally to spousal support orders.in particular,a court is not prevented from entering a child support order different from that previously ordered,on the basis that such an award is effective prospectively only,and thus the court is not nullifying or superseding the prior order within the meaning of the provision in such cases,the courts have reasoned that proceedings under the act are de novo,in that the responding court has the authority to make an independent determination regarding the duty of support based on presently existing conditions,that the remedies under the act are in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies,and that the act contemplates that more than one order of support may be outstanding at any given time for the same obligation.annotation,supra,at,fns.deleted.
concisely stated,under ruresa n ew support orders do not nullify,modify,or supersede the original support decree,but instead provide an additional,supplementary or cumulative remedy.citations.amounts paid under one support order are credited against amounts accruing or accrued for the same period under another support order.this latter language necessarily contemplates that two or more support orders may be outstanding and valid at the same time.citations.thus,the authority of the court originally ordering payment is not affected nor is its order modified by an order of the court of the responding state fixing another or different sum.citation.thompson thompson.
this result oftentimes works to the detriment of the obligor,usually the husband,since even if the responding court in a uresa or ruresa proceeding prospectively reduces the amount of support owed,he may still be obligated for the full amount of support as determined by the original child support order,although under the antinullification provision of the act,he will get credit for any amounts paid pursuant to an order made under the act.annotation,supra,at accord,oglesby oglesby utah,reduction of support by washington court did not relieve husband of higher obligation owed under earlier utah divorce decree.because ruresa contemplates that more than one order of support may be outstanding at any given time for the same obligation annotation,supra,at,lundahl argument that the california judgment of dissolution was controlling,and that the subsequent utah support orders were void under ruresa,is simply wrong.
uifsa does not determine controlling order for spousal support 
switching tacks,lundahl next argues that under new provisions in uifsa,which superceded ruresa in utah in and in california in,california family courts retained continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over spousal support.lundahl misreads uifsa.true,uifsa was developed to improve the two prior uniform laws concerning enforcement of family support orders,uresa and the revised uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act ruresa.citation.child support enforcement div.of alaska brenckle.and uifsa aims to cure the problem of conflicting support orders entered by multiple courts,and provides for the exercise of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction by one tribunal over support orders.citation.ibid.construing uifsa in context of child support enforcement action.but as we discuss below,uifsa mechanism for establishing a controlling order applies only to multiple child support orders.see sampson,uniform interstate family support
