christina appeals a judgment terminating her parental rights to her minor son dakota under welfare and institutions code section christina contends her due process rights to maintain her parental status were violated by the lack of a current judicial finding of parental unfitness.christina also challenges the court finding there was not a beneficial relationship exception to termination of parental rights under section,subdivision c a.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
dakota was born in october.when he was four,his mother,christina,married ricky their home life was marred by ricky temper and substance abuse problems.dakota was developmentally delayed and physically aggressive.when dakota was five,he was diagnosed with autism.
after an incident of domestic violence in which ricky physically abused dakota,child protective services in south carolina intervened.the juvenile court allowed christina to retain custody of dakota on condition she not allow dakota to have contact with ricky.christina did not comply with the order.the family left south carolina in late may after the court issued a restraining order.the court issued bench warrants for christina and ricky.
the san diego county health and human services agency agency took dakota into protective custody on july,after dakota,christina and ricky were in a motor vehicle accident.ricky was arrested for driving under the influence and child endangerment.in august,the juvenile court took jurisdiction of dakota based on findings christina inadequately supervised him.dakota was placed in foster care.christina reunification plan required her to attend a weekly domestic violence program,undergo a psychological evaluation,participate in individual psychotherapy and attend classes specifically designed for parents of special needs children.the court gave the agency the discretion to expand christina weekly supervised visitation.
christina showed a genuine interest in reunification.she consistently visited dakota.however,she continued to live with ricky,impeding progress with expanded visitation.after another incident of domestic violence in march,christina initiated divorce proceedings.she began individual counseling in march and a domestic violence program in june.after christina started working,she discontinued individual therapy.she did not attend parenting class.
dakota remained in stable placement in the foster home.he still had outbursts,but in general his behavior improved.dakota enjoyed his weekly visits with his mother.she was patient,gentle and affectionate with him.he responded well to her warmth.dakota sometimes said,i want to go home with mommy and talked about his visits with her when he returned to the foster home.christina and dakota displayed mutual expressions of love,attention and care.the social worker wrote she had never met a parent more unconditional in her affection or more available to her child.
dakota and christina read and played together and went on outings.christina helped dakota with his homework.however,dakota met any form of discipline with hostility.christina was unable to cope with dakota more serious behaviors and relied on the supervising social worker for assistance.christina was a wonderful playmate and set some boundaries,but she did not appear to encourage dakota growth.
by the review hearing,christina had not made substantive progress towards reunification due to her delayed participation in recommended programs.the court terminated services and set a permanency hearing under section for december.the court kept visitation in place,noting it obviously should continue.
due to dakota autism and other developmental delays,the agency assessed him as difficult to adopt.the adoption social worker determined dakota was specifically adoptable and believed it would be possible to identify a family willing to adopt him.christina proposed placing dakota in the home of his maternal uncle in south carolina.in december,all parties agreed to a continuance of the permanency hearing to allow the agency to identify a potential adoptive family and conduct an interstate evaluation of the maternal uncle home.
in march,the agency identified an adoptive home for dakota in michigan.the family had adopted two other special needs children,one diagnosed with autism and the other with mild mental retardation.the prospective adoptive father,was knowledgeable about autism and actively involved with his sons education and support programs.the placement was an exceptional opportunity for dakota.when the agency interviewed dakota uncle,he did not feel capable of caring for dakota as a primary custodian but was willing to let christina and dakota live with him.
the court granted christina requests for a bonding study and a continuance of the permanency hearing.christina filed a petition under section,asking the court to vacate the section hearing and place dakota with her in south carolina under the supervision of his uncle.in may,the court continued the section and section hearings for another two months to allow time for a review of the bonding study,an evaluation of dakota by a specialist in childhood autism,and to meet scheduling requirements of witnesses.all parties stipulated the court could consider evidence presented at the section hearing for its determination under section.
clinical psychologist beatriz heller,found that w ithin the confines of the difficulties in interpersonal relationships that this boy presents,dakota seems to have a significant attachment to his mother.when dakota entered heller office,he immediately stated,i want my mommy.when he saw christina,he joyfully exclaimed,mommy she observed christina act in a comforting,nurturing,soothing,and stimulating manner to her son.dakota responded to her by curbing disorganized activities,stopping perseverative behavior,or becoming engaged in different pursuits.
cynthia norall,a psychologist specializing in the delivery of support services to autistic children,evaluated dakota needs and attachments within the context of his disability.dakota did not maliciously intend to hurt people but he did not know how to interact or communicate.his attention issues were a result of autism rather than attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.despite his difficulties,dakota was a happy and friendly little guy who seems to enjoy being with others.
norall believed dakota would make the transition to an adoptive home with little disruption.due to the nature of autism,she questioned the degree and quality of dakota attachment to christina.dakota could attach to another caregiver if the environment were very structured and if the caregiver could clearly communicate what was expected.norall did not believe adoption would be emotionally detrimental for dakota.
dakota needed a caregiver with access to specialized services to give him the strategies necessary to develop appropriate social skills.these strategies would make the difference in dakota ability to function as an independent adult.the caregiver required the capability when dakota was disruptive to mediate and facilitate his social abilities and replacement behaviors.dakota caregiver had to be able to establish a regular routine and at the same time expose dakota to a variety of experience.norall did not believe christina would be able to meet dakota needs.
the home study and evaluation of the prospective adoptive family was completed in august.christina consented to dakota placement in michigan.she had become homeless and needed to return to her family in south carolina.the court maintained the visitation order and made arrangements for christina to be able to telephone dakota.
by october,christina was living with her brother and wanted dakota to join her.she told the court she had resources available to address dakota developmental needs.the court found that christina did not prove a substantial change in circumstances and denied her section petition.the court requested more information concerning the proposed adoptive placement before deciding dakota permanent plan.
dakota adjusted well to his new home.initially,he displayed some aggressive behavior.disciplinary measures were calm and effective.his partner of years took an active role in parenting.dakota was affectionate with his new family and appeared to enjoy his interactions with the other boys.was adept at gaining services for his children.he arranged comprehensive health care evaluations for dakota.dakota doctor reduced his medication.as a result,dakota was more alert and better able to relay information.he was doing great in school.dakota appeared happy and comfortable in the home.
the court found by clear and convincing evidence that none of the exceptions of section,subdivision c applied to preclude the termination of christina parental rights.the court further found adoption to be in dakota best interests,terminated parental rights and referred dakota for adoptive placement.
discussion 
iprocedural challenge to the court judgment 
christina asserts her due process right to a continued parental relationship with dakota was violated by the lack of a current judicial finding of parental unfitness.she argues the delay from the review hearing to termination of parental rights rendered stale the finding that return of dakota to christina would create a substantial risk of detriment.see,subd.f.we disagree.
the doctrine of forfeiture 
a party forfeits the right to claim error as grounds for reversal on appeal when he or she fails to raise the objection in the trial court.civ.code,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,at in re kevin th,d see in re dakota th,d.forfeiture,also referred to as waiver,applies in juvenile dependency litigation and is intended to prevent a party from standing by silently until the conclusion of the proceedings.in re jessica th,d marlene superior court th,d in re lukas th,d see in re riva d.
christina failed to bring to the court attention her assertion that principles of due process required the court to make a new finding of parental unfitness before proceeding to a permanency hearing.had she done so,the court could have considered her claim and,if it found her due process argument meritorious,determined and applied the appropriate legal standard.a party may not assert theories on appeal which were not raised in the trial court.fretland county of humboldt th,d.christina forfeited the right to assign error on appeal.
christina asserts she may raise a new theory on appeal because the facts on which she bases her claim are not subject to dispute.dieckmeyer redevelopment agency of city of huntington beach th,d mattco forge,arthur young th,d see panopulos maderis cal d.even if the doctrine of forfeiture did not apply,we would reject christina claim she had a due process right to a continued relationship with her son absent a new finding of parental unfitness.because the question is one of law,we review the claimed constitutional violation de novo.
the process that is due 
it is axiomatic that due process guarantees apply to dependency proceedings.ingrid superior court th,d,citing stanley illinois,d santosky kramer,d.the united states supreme court recognizes the concept of due process can not be precisely defined.lassiter department of social services,d lassiter.in deciding requirements of due process,the court evaluates three elements the private interests at stake,the government interest,and the risk the procedures used will lead to an erroneous decision.lassiter,supra,at,citing mathews eldridge,d see also santosky kramer,supra,at.
the private interest at stake in a dependency proceeding is enormous.a parent interest in the companionship,care,custody and management of his or her children is a fundamental civil right.in re cal d.children,too,have a compelling independent interest in belonging to their natural family.adoption of kay d.in addition,each child has a compelling interest to live free from abuse and neglect in a stable,permanent placement with an emotionally committed caregiver.in re david d.the governmental interest in a child welfare is significant.the welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right,but a duty,to protect.in re marilyn cal th,d,citing in re david,supra,d at.and stanley illinois,d.
in dependency proceedings,unless limited exceptions apply,a parent is provided with services designed to reunify the family within a statutory time period.see et the burden remains on the state to show return of the child to the parental home would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child,subd.f,subd.a.if,after the state has made reasonable reunification efforts,the court finds there is not a substantial probability the child safely can be returned home,the court terminates reunification services and sets a permanency hearing under section,subd.g,subd.a.once family reunification is no longer the primary goal,the state interest requires the court to focus on the child placement and,rather than on the parent challenge to custody.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.the focus of dependency proceedings shifts from the parents interest in reunification to the child interest in permanency and stability.id.at,d.by the time a permanency hearing has been set,the child private interest in a safe,permanent placement outweighs the parent interest in preserving a tenuous relationship with the child.in re autumn th,d.
the third element of the due process analysis,the risk of erroneously terminating parental rights,is lessened by the juvenile court prior findings and procedures.a finding under section or,that the court has continued to remove the child from the custody of the parent and has terminated reunification services,shall constitute a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights,subd.c.the california supreme court held that section met due process requirements because the precise and demanding substantive and procedural requirements the petitioning agency must have satisfied before it can propose termination are carefully calculated to constrain judicial discretion,diminish the risk of erroneous findings of parental inadequacy and detriment to the child,and otherwise protect the legitimate interests of the parents.cynthia superior court cal th,d,cynthia.
the risk of erroneous termination of parental rights is also reduced by the parent opportunity to be heard on the issue of reunification prior to the permanency hearing.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d,see.the court previous finding of detriment to the child if returned home is rebuttable.the burden of proof shifts to the parent.in re marilyn,supra,at,d.a parent ability to file a section petition provides an escape mechanism that lessens the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the relationship in the event of a legitimate change in circumstance.in re marilyn,supra,at,d.
christina contends the risk of erroneous termination of parental rights rises to the level of a due process violation unless the court considers the current ability of a parent to safely care for the child.christina further argues that a hearing held under section insufficiently protects her rights because the burden of proof shifts to the parent to prove changed circumstances and away from the state to prove the parent unfit 
christina argues the cynthia court upheld the constitutionality of the statutory scheme,specifically the permanency hearing,because it was based on the assumption the court would hear the matter within days of the hearing from which it was set.cynthia,supra,cal th at,d,see,subd.f,subds.e,g,subd.a.she contends this scheme provide fairness to the parties because the factual basis for the finding of unfitness is fresh,assuring that the decision to terminate parental rights includes a consideration of present circumstances.
we do not agree that the legislature intended the period for setting a permanency hearing to be strictly applied in all circumstances.the legislature has expressly authorized a continuance of the hearing beyond the days when required to locate an adoptive home,subd.c.the maximum time for such a continuance is days,subd.a.here,in december,the court granted a continuance of the permanency hearing in order to identify a home for dakota.
christina also argues section supports her position that the status of the child must be revi
