this is an appeal from an order of the district court dismissing all of the claims asserted in the pro se complaint filed by samuel poole poole,an inmate.poole notice of appeal was not filed on time,apparently because of delay in receiving notice of the entry of the order dismissing his claims.instead of moving to reopen the time to file an appeal under rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure,poole filed a notice of appeal shortly after finally receiving notice.we hold that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.
this case concerns the paternity of a minor who samuel poole claims is his son.in,poole filed what he called a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against several public officials and private individuals,alleging that a series of actions taken in connection with two family law in delaware and the other in his fifth and fourteenth amendment rights by interfering with his access to his son.the district court treated the case as an action filed under and permitted poole to proceed in forma pauperis.the district court then dismissed the claims against two defendants sua sponte for lack of personal jurisdiction,and the court dismissed the claims against the remaining defendants as frivolous pursuant to e b a b.
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we are required to consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction.bender williamsport area school,d.the timeliness of an appeal is a mandatory jurisdictional prerequisite.united states robinson,d.in a civil case,rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure generally requires a notice of appeal to be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.in this case,the order dismissing poole complaint was entered on march,and poole deposited his notice of appeal in his prison internal mail system days later.under appellate rule c,poole notice of appeal is regarded as having been filed upon mailing,but because he did not mail the notice of appeal within days after the relevant order was entered,he did not comply with rule a.
poole argues that his notice of appeal should be regarded as having been filed on time because there was a delay in his receipt of notice from the district court clerk office regarding the entry of the order of dismissal.this delay resulted from poole transfer from one correctional institution to another shortly before the order of dismissal was entered.when poole made his initial filing and until some time in late march,he was incarcerated in the delaware correctional center in smyrna,delaware.when the district court entered the order dismissing poole claims,the clerk of the court apparently sent notice to poole and all of the other parties on that same day.the notice to poole was mailed to the facility in delaware,but by the time it arrived,poole had been transferred to pennsylvania state correctional institution at graterford.the postal service returned the notice to the clerk on april,at which time the clerk faxed an address request to the delaware department of corrections.the clerk received poole new address on april and then mailed a copy of the order to the correct address.poole received the order on may and mailed his notice of appeal three days later.
poole argues that handwritten letters that he sent to the district court and that were received on march and april should have alerted the clerk to his transfer.the first letter was described on the docket sheets as letter to clerk of the court dated by samuel poole re questions regarding habeas corpus.this letter bore poole address at the delaware facility,and in the midst of a discussion of other matters,the letter stated i will be returning to is my max out date and then my detainer come up 
the second letter was described in the docket sheets as letter by plaintiff,received,advising the court he has no pen,paper,or ability to make telephone calls.this handwritten note in its entirety states

by the time this letter was sent and received,the clerk had already mailed notice to poole delaware address,and apparently because this letter did not state expressly that poole address had changed and did not request that the clerk change the address listed on the docket,the letter did not alert the clerk office that the notice sent a few days earlier had been mailed to a facility where poole was no longer housed.
poole argues that his notice of appeal should be regarded as having been filed on time under the reasoning of united states grana,cir.in grana,a criminal case,we held that,in computing the timeliness of filings which are jurisdictional in nature,any delay by prison officials in transmitting notice of a final order or judgment to an incarcerated pro se litigant should be excluded from the computation.id.at.in the present case,poole complains about delay attributable to the clerk office,not prison officials,but poole argues that grana stands for the broad proposition that when official delay interferes with receipt of the notice of appeal,that delay must be subtracted from calculation of time for appeal.appellant br.at quoting grana,at.
poole argument overlooks the significance of the fact that grana was a criminal case.because the present case is civil,the approach that we took in grana is foreclosed by federal rule of civil procedure d and federal rule of appellate procedure a.under civil rule d,a district court clerk must notify all parties not in default i mmediately upon the entry of an order or judgment.the rule goes on to state,however,that l ack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed,except as permitted in rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.appellate rule a,in turn,provides a procedure for reopening the time to file a notice of appeal when the party desiring to appeal does not receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order.in a civil case,therefore,the only way in which a party may obtain relief based on a clerk failure to serve notice of the entry of a judgment or order is via appellate rule a,not via the grana approach.
the grana approach remains viable in criminal cases because the federal rules of criminal procedure do not contain any provision analogous to civil rule d and because appellate rule b,which deals with appeals in criminal cases,does not contain any provision analogous to appellate rule a however,the grana approach can not be used to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case 
the remaining question that we must consider is whether there is any way in which poole can obtain relief under appellate rule a.that rule states 
the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of days after the date when its order to reopen is entered,but only if all the following conditions are satisfied a the motion is filed within days after the judgment or order is entered or within days after the moving party receives notice of the entry,whichever is earlier b the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within days after entry and c the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.
the terms of appellate rule a thus contemplate the filing of a motion to reopen within seven days after notice is received.here,poole concedes that he received notice on may.he thus had until may to move to reopen,but instead of filing a motion to reopen,he simply filed a notice of appeal on may.unless we can construe his notice of appeal as a motion to reopen,he can not qualify for relief under appellate rule a.
our court has not decided whether a pro se notice of appeal may be construed as a motion to reopen under appellate rule a,but we have held that a notice of appeal can not be construed as a motion to extend the time to appeal in a c
