discussiona.jurisdiction 
description of pension plans 
there are two flying tiger pension plans at issue,the fixed plan and the variable plan.the fixed plan is a defined benefit plan and the variable plan was initially established as a defined contribution plan.at trial,respondent expert testified that the variable plan had become more of a hybrid plan than a defined contribution plan.due to a collective bargaining agreement,the variable plan came to be used as a feeder plan to ensure payments under the fixed plan.in other words,if the fixed plan were underfunded,monies from the variable plan could be used to fund the defined benefits payable under the fixed plan.the variable plan was funded by flying tiger contributions.all contributions to the variable plan ceased in,the year the parties separated.
respondent also participated in a federal express pension plan.appellant makes no claim to the benefits under that plan.
the trial court must apportion an employee spouse retirement benefits between the community property interest of the employee spouse and the nonemployee spouse and any separate property interest of the employee spouse alone.citations.in re marriage of lehman cal th,d.it has discretion in the selection of the method of apportionment.ibid.the most commonly used method is the time rule.ibid.under that rule,the community interest in the retirement benefits is determined to be that fraction of retirement assets,the numerator of which represents the length of service during the marriage but before the separation,and the denominator of which represents the total length of service by the.in re marriage of judd d.the issue here is the number of years of service to be utilized as the denominator with respect to each of the two flying tiger pension plans.the parties disagree as to whether the seven years of federal express employment should be included in that number.
the expert opined the seven years of federal express service should be factored in for four reasons respondent employment continued different rates of pay,based on rank,were taken into consideration in the calculation of benefits respondent could not have begun receiving benefits on the date of the merger without suffering an early retirement penalty and the marital dissolution judgment provided the benefits would be divided on retirement,taking total length of employment into consideration.respondent offers an additional reason the investment value of his benefits increased over the period of federal express employment.we address these points one by one.
in applying the time rule,we bear in mind the following where the total number of years served by an is a substantial factor in computing the amount of retirement benefits to be received by that spouse,the community is entitled to have its share based upon the length of service performed on behalf of the community in proportion to the total length of service necessary to earn those benefits.in re marriage of judd,supra,d at.respondent contends the court properly applied this rule to include the seven years of federal express service because the amount of flying tiger pension benefits was directly related to length of employment.in support of this,he avers the flying tiger pension plan documents define years of participation as years of active service.however,the documents which established the pension plans are not a part of the record on appeal.moreover,respondent makes no claim that the plan documents address years of service with a successor employer.in fact,there is no evidence whatsoever the seven years of federal express employment were necessary to earn any portion of the flying tiger pension benefits.
to the contrary,the expert testified the flying tiger pension plans were not merged with the federal express pension plan,and the flying tiger pension benefits were based on respondent flying tiger wages,to the exclusion of his federal express wages.this is consistent with the analysis provided by the pension plan administrator.the administrator printout showing the figures on which the pension benefits were based listed years of continuous service as years,the number of years of flying tiger service exclusive of the years of federal express service.
in calculating the benefit,the administrator took into consideration rank and rate of pay for the last five years of service.this was a critical factor in the court decision to include federal express service in the apportionment formula.what the court overlooked was the fact the administrator took into consideration rank and rate of pay for the last five years of flying tiger service,not federal express service.as shown on the administrator printout,and consistent with respondent testimony at trial,respondent attained the rank of captain on march,while employed with flying tiger.the plan administrator,in evaluating rank and rate of pay for the last five years of premerger service,credited respondent with months of service as captain,based on the dates march,through august,and months of earlier service as first officer.very simply put,neither rank with federal express nor years of service with federal express was relevant to the calculation of the flying tiger pension benefits.
early retirement penalty 
we next consider the issue of the early retirement penalty.the expert considered the years of federal express employment to be an appropriate component of the denominator in part because respondent could not retire at the date of the merger without suffering an early retirement penalty.from this,the expert reasoned,the years of federal express employment served to increase the amount of the flying tiger benefits,because respondent earned more under the flying tiger pension plans by waiting.
but the judge exposed the fallacy of thi
