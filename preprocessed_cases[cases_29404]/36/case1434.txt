appellant ricardo,father of ricardo,ricardo,appeals from a dispositional order declaring his son a dependent and denying him reunification services because the court had terminated reunification services for ricardo,sibling due to appellant failure to reunify with her,and appellant had not subsequently made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to the sibling removal.on appeal,appellant contends there was insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court finding that the indian child welfare act icwa did not apply to ricardo,the allegations of the dependency petition fail to state a cause of action and there is no substantial evidence supporting the jurisdictional finding under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision j the court erred in denying him reunification services,and the court erred in denying him visitation.we agree that there was insufficient evidence to support the court finding of jurisdiction under section,subdivision j.therefore,we will reverse the jurisdictional and dispositional orders.
factual and procedural background 
appellant is the father of born in september,and ricardo,born in june.and ricardo,mother is sara sara is also the mother of and ricardo,half siblings,and 
on september,the kings county human services agency the agency initiated juvenile dependency proceedings over pursuant to section,subdivision b failure to protect,because appellant illegal drug use rendered him incapable or impaired his ability to provide appropriate care and supervision to,and pursuant to subdivision j abuse of sibling,because in april,and had been declared dependent children under subdivisions b and g of section as a result of sara drug abuse,the failure to provide appropriate mental health care for,the unsafe and unsanitary condition of the home,and sara engaging in violent episodes in presence,and that was at risk of the same abuse and neglect 
at the october,hearing,the juvenile court found that came under section,adjudged a dependent,removed her from parental custody,and adopted the report filed on october.by june,and had been returned to sara custody with family maintenance services,while appellant was receiving family reunification services.
on june,the agency detained ricardo,who had been living with sara.on june,the agency filed a petition under section,subdivision j with respect to ricardo.the allegation under subdivision j alleged the children,and were adjudged dependent children of the court on and,having been found to come within provisions of the welfare and institutions code b and g sic as a result of the parent drug abuse,unsanitary home conditions and failure to protect from sexual abuse.the children,and,continue to require the protection of the juvenile court.ricardo,is the sibling of the above mentioned minors and is at risk of the same abuse.
on june,the detention hearing was held on the petition.in the detention report filed that same day,the agency social worker stated that although appellant has previously denied any american indian heritage,ricardo,maternal grandmother,elizabeth,told the social worker on june,that her husband,anthony,may have tribal affiliation since her husband was adopted and the family is unaware of which tribe he may be affiliated with.the social worker noted that the agency had submitted written correspondence to the bureau of indian affairs in the past on sara behalf,and had received a response that the agency had not provided an adequate amount of tribal information,but an soc would be submitted to the bureau of indian affairs with all known information on behalf of ricardo.
the report states that continued detention was needed because t he parents have a past history of drug abuse,domestic violence and neglect,which have sic not been ameliorated and pose a risk to the minor,ricardo.furthermore,ricardo,is a sibling of and who were previous sic removed from the care of her sic parents due to neglect,the parents sic drug use and domestic violence.the report further states t he agency has provided a significant amount of services to both parents in attempts to eliminate the risk to the child and the child older siblings,but it does not list what services were provided.
as supporting evidence,the report stated that social worker kristi bourque had received a referral that appellant was seen entering sara home by using a key,despite a previous court order that appellant was not authorized to be in the home or around the children without an appropriate party supervising the visitation.bourque went to the home with two police officers.upon arrival,bourque noted,and ricardo,were in the home with sara.sara denied appellant was currently in the home,but stated he was at the home earlier in the day to visit ricardo.sara said her mother was present during the visitation to provide supervision.
while in the home,bourque observed men dirty clothes in the laundry pile located in the bathroom and several cans of shaving cream and men deodorant in the medicine cabinet.bourque,apparently with the officers,checked the bedrooms.the first bedroom,which was,was locked.a key was used to open the door no one was present in the room,but bourque saw that the room was very dirty and difficult to navigate through due to the amount of clothes and toys piled everywhere.the next bedroom,which was sara,was also locked.sara stated she used a screwdriver to disengage the lock,but it took her two or three minutes to find one.a noise was heard from inside the room and one of the officers stated that someone was inside.sara denied anyone was in the room.upon entering the room,bourque noted there were men clothing in the closet,a pair of dirty men pants draped on the bed,and appellant hollywood video card was lying on the nightstand.
in the meantime,one of the officers had gone outside.this officer told bourque that he saw a man jumping from sara bedroom window and fleeing on foot.the officers,however,were unable to locate him.the officer ran a criminal background check on appellant,which revealed he had an outstanding warrant in the amount of.the police cited sara on the charge of harboring a fugitive.
bourque spoke with the maternal grandmother,elizabeth,by telephone,and she denied having supervised any visitation earlier that day.sara then told bourque that appellant had a key to her home,but she was unaware of his presence there that day.bourque then took and,who was at her grandfather home,into protective custody.bourque asked about appellant visits to sara home responded that appellant comes to the home approximately two days per week and that her grandmother is only present during these visits if sara has to go somewhere,otherwise the majority of the visits were at her home and consisted of only the children,sara and appellant.
another social worker,gabriel garcia,received a referral that ricardo,was a sibling or half sibling of and,and was at risk of abuse and needed to be placed into protective custody.ricardo,was then placed into protective custody.
the agency submitted on the petition and the detention report.sara counsel submitted on the report,but disagreed with the recommendation.sara counsel argued that detention was inappropriate because most of the information in the detention report involved violation of court orders that did not involve ricardo,so sara failure to comply with those orders was irrelevant to ricardo,case,and the allegation under subdivision j has not pled a prima facie case,since there was no evidence sara was currently abusing drugs or that the home conditions were unsanitary,and no evidence that ricardo,was at risk of sexual abuse.sara counsel stated if ricardo,is not at risk because of any drug abuse,unsanitary home conditions,or sexual abuse,then the agency has not pled a prima facie case,and if there no prima facie case,this child comes within the jurisdiction of the court,must not be a detection sic.there can still be a petition,but the child must be released to the mother.sara counsel further argued there was no information in the detention report to show substantial danger to ricardo,physical health,and therefore requested that the court release ricardo,to sara custody pending a hearing on the petition.following sara counsel argument,appellant counsel stated we submit on the recommendations of the report,although there are several factual disputes from the report and we join sara counsel request that the child not be detained.
the juvenile court ordered ricardo,detained from appellant and sara.with respect to application of the icwa,the court found that it was unknown whether icwa applied,and ordered the appropriate paperwork be filled out and submitted to the bureau of indian affairs.
a report was filed on july.the report stated that t he indian child welfare act does or may apply,and that an soc was submitted to the bureau of indian affairs on,with all known information on behalf of the child,ricardo.regarding ricardo,safety in the home,the report stated the siblings of ricardo,were subjected to sexual abuse,domestic violence,unsanitary living conditions,use of illegal drugs by the parents and neglect.although the parents have been given ample opportunity to address the issues,they have demonstrated that they are unable and unwilling to protect their children or utilize the skills and knowledge provided in the services offered.the of the parents places the minor,ricardo,at risk of abuse and neglect.the report further stated 
the parents,sara and appellant,have previously been provided with a plethora of services which have included parenting education,substance abuse treatment adecc,cornerstone,drug testing,mental health services,codependency counseling,domestic violence counseling and anger management counseling.although the parents did complete some of the case plan components,the knowledge gained did not prove successful in the protection of the children to include ricardo.for further detail regarding specific services,it is respectfully requested that he sic court refer to the detention reports filed and,the reports filed and and the status review reports filed,and.
with respect to reunification services,the agency recommended reunification services not be offered to the parents pursuant to section,subdivision b in regard to ricardo,specifically,the report stated 
sara and appellant have been given an ample opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to cooperate with the court and ameliorate the risk to their children.the agency has provided the family a total of months of child welfare services which have included family reunification services as well as family maintenance services.appellant has failed to successfully reunify with his children and sara,although successfully reunified with her children,has demonstrated that she is unable to protect her children from potential risk.ricardo,is a sibling to the minors and would not benefit from family reunification services with his parents.
the report further explained 
the minor,ricardo,has been placed at risk due to the inability of his mother to protect him.although the agency has made great efforts to assist the parents in eliminating the risk to the siblings of ricardo,sadly they have shown an unwillingness to comply with court orders as well as lack the ability to protect the safety and well being of the minor.it is unrealistic to expect that the parents would benefit from family reunification services on behalf of the minor,ricardo,as their intentions have been clearly demonstrated by their previous with the agency and the court.it is the opinion of the undersigned that it would be in the best interest of the minor,not to provide the parents with family reunification services and instead implement a permanent plan on ricardo,behalf.
on october,a contested hearing began on a section supplemental petition the agency previously filed with respect to and,as well as the june,petition filed with respect to ricardo.the hearing on the section supplemental petition was held first,who was eight years old at the time of the hearing,testified that before she was detained in june,appellant lived with her,her mother,and ricardo.testified that when appellant lived with them,appellant had sexually molested her between and times over the past year by rubbing her private area,which she identified as her crotch area,and putting his finger inside her front private part.testified that sometimes when this happened,appellant was the only adult present with the children.understood that she was removed from her mother because appellant was at the home with ricardo,and without another adult present.
bourque testified about the referral she received on june that appellant was in sara home in violation of a court order prohibiting him from residing at the home of sara and her children.bourque further testified that she and two police officers went to sara home to see if appellant was there.sara mother testified that while she supervised a partial visit at her house during the afternoon of june,she did not supervise a visit at the children home.
social worker diane scissons testified that she first learned of the alleged sexual abuse of on july,when foster mother called and reported that had told her that appellant had done bad things to her.scissons spoke with,who told her about the molestations by appellant and also told her appellant had sodomized her.said she was molested more than times.scissons testified that appellant received family maintenance services beginning in october,and prior to that time appellant was not residing in the home with the children.scissons testified appellant completed an inpatient substance abuse program in march.
foster mother to and following their removal from sara home in june,testified that told her that appellant had molested her.then called child protective services.testified that after the allegations surfaced,she had a little bit of trouble with sharing very detailed things about the molestation to her children.soon after arrived,started noticing engaging in very abnormal behavior,such as constantly taking her clothes and diaper off,and a handful of times,she was found naked on top of a doll,which had also been stripped of its clothes.
sara testified that appellant was not living at her home after the court ordered him out of the home,but she admitted he was at the home for visits when she was the only other adult present.sara knew her mother was supposed to be present when appellant was visiting.sara testified that appellant had been permitted to live in her home from september,to march or april of.sara testified she first learned on july that claimed appellant had molested her.sara learned had genital warts on the day a general examination was performed on sara knew appellant was ordered to leave the home because he was not complying with his case plan.
appellant testified he is father and he feels as if and are his own children.appellant was aware of the court order that required him to have supervised visitations with his children and admitted there were times he visited the children when sara,but not elizabeth,was present.appellant said he had clothes in sara home because he did have enough space for them where he was staying.appellant denied jumping out of the window at sara home on june.he also denied sexually abusing and appellant denied having genital warts,although he had never been tested for them.appellant admitted he was asked to leave the home because he was complying with his case plan,and that in fact he was not complying because he was supposed to drug test and attend a nonoffending program,which he was not doing.
the court found the allegations of the section supplemental petition true and that the previous disposition had not been effective in the protection of the children.the court then proceeded with the hearing on the disposition with respect to the section supplemental petition,hearing testimony from sara therapist.the court then continued the matter to october.
when the hearing continued,sara testified about the treatment and counseling she was receiving,and what steps she was taking to ensure the protection of her children.following argument,the court ordered family maintenance services terminated for sara and family reunification services terminated for appellant,and set a hearing pursuant to section to select a permanent plan for and 
the court then proceeded with the hearing on the petition pertaining to ricardo.the agency entered into evidence the petition filed on june,the detention report filed on june,and the report filed on july.the agency counsel also asked the court to take judicial notice of the documents listed in its request for judicial notice filed on october,which documents county counsel stated were in the court file.the court asked the other parties if there were any objections,and each party responded no.the court then stated t hat will be the order of the court.the agency then rested.
sara counsel stated he would not be presenting any evidence,only argument,and agreed with the court that sara would be proceeding under melinda,giving up her right to the maker of the social study reports.when the court asked what appellant counsel would be doing on his behalf,she responded on behalf of appellant,we are going to submit on the jurisdiction,but contest the disposition with respect to ricardo.i do intend to the maker of the report,nor do i plan to call witnesses.i intend to make an argument to the court.the court then asked if she was presenting the case under melinda appellant counsel responded in the affirmative.the court asked appellant if he understood and gave up the right to the maker of the report,and appellant responded,yes,sir.ricardo,counsel submitted on the report for jurisdiction purposes,and agreed with the agency recommendation regarding disposition.the court then found the allegations of the petition true by a preponderance of the evidence.
the matter proceeded immediately to disposition.the agency asked the court to follow the recommended findings and orders attached to the july report,and argued that neither sara nor appellant should receive reunification services pursuant to section,subdivision b.sara counsel argued that sara should receive reunification services.during this argument,the court asked whether anyone objected to the court considering all of the testimony taken in the hearing on the section supplemental petition.no one objected.appellant counsel argued that he should receive reunification services because ricardo,was not at risk of being sexually abused.ricardo,counsel argued that reunification services should be provided to the mother.
before ruling on the matter,the court stated i want to make one comment here,is that father,for the last months,has not done anything as to the reunification services as to the other children,and now we have the new child here.it appears that we would be starting a new proceeding here if i do grant the reunifciation sic services at all,which i am on the borderline of.the court then made its findings,stating that it had read and considered the social worker report and attachments and all the documents submitted herein.the court further found that icwa does not apply.
the court stated it was going to provide services to sara,but not to appellant because he has done anything in months,and i do see any reason to spend the money on trying to reunify him at this point in time.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that reunification services be provided to the mother because it would be in ricardo,best interest.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that reunification services need not be advised sic to the father pursuant to wic section paragraph ten,that the parents sic failed to successfully reunify the half siblings of the minor.anticipated service sic will be terminated on their behalf.the court also found that appellant had made insignificant progress on the case plan.the court ordered supervised visitation between sara and ricardo,but denied visitation to appellant,finding that visitation with appellant would be detrimental to ricardo.
appellant filed a timely appeal from the orders pertaining to ricardo.
discussion 
appellant contends the petition failed to state a cause of action or,alternatively,the juvenile court jurisdictional finding was not supported by substantial evidence.essentially,he argues that the petition failed to allege,and the evidence was insufficient to establish,that ricardo,was at substantial risk of serious physical harm.we agree with appellant that insufficient evidence was presented at the jurisdictional hearing to support the juvenile court jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision j 
standard of review 
when the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding or order is challenged on appeal,the reviewing court must determine if there is any substantial evidence,that is,evidence which is reasonable,credible,and of solid value to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.in re jason d.in making this determination,all conflicts are to be resolved in favor of the prevailing party,and issues of fact and credibility are questions for the trier of fact.in re steve d.in dependency proceedings,a trial court determination will not be disturbed unless it exceeds the bounds of reason.in re stephanie cal th,d.
at a jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court 
shall first consider whether the minor is a person described by section,and for this purpose,any matter or information relevant and material to the circumstances or acts which are alleged to bring him or her within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court is admissible and may be received in evidence.however,proof by a preponderance of evidence,legally admissible in the trial of civil cases must be adduced to support a finding that the minor is a person described by section.in re sheila th,d.
while evidence of past conduct may be probative of current conditions,the question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.in re rocco th,d,italics omitted.thus previous acts of neglect,standing alone,do not establish a substantial risk of harm there must be some reason beyond mere speculation to believe they will reoccur.in re steve,supra,d at.
initially,we address respondent claim that appellant waived his right to challenge the jurisdictional findings because appellant failed to object to those findings at the jurisdictional hearing.respondent argues that,when appellant counsel submitted the issue of jurisdiction and waived his right to the makers of the social study reports,appellant was agreeing to a jurisdictional finding.respondent is mistaken.this court has held that a parent waives his or her right to challenge a juvenile court order when the parent submits the matter on the social worker recommendation.in re richard th,d.in richard,we explained that a parent submission on the social worker recommendation amounts to an endorsement of the court issuance of findings and orders in accord with the recommendation.ibid.we distinguished that case from cases in which a parent submits a jurisdictional finding on a social worker report.in such a case,the parent does not waive his or her right to challenge the evidence as insufficient to support a jurisdictional finding.ibid.
in the present case,while appellant attorney stated she was going to submit on the jurisdiction,when this statement is read in context,it is apparent that appellant attorney was submitting the matter based on the report,not the recommendations.this is so because his attorney specifically stated that she did not intend to the maker of the report prepared for the hearing or call any witnesses,and the court took appellant waiver of his right of.such a submission acted as consent to allow the court to consider the report as the only evidence in determining whether the allegations in the petition were true.in re richard,supra,th at,d.it did not preclude appellant from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jurisdictional finding on appeal.ibid.consequently,we reject respondent waiver argument.
c.the section,subdivision j finding 
the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over ricardo,pursuant to section,subdivision j,which provides in part 
the child sibling has been abused or neglected,as defined in subdivision a serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally,b substantial risk of serious physical harm or il
