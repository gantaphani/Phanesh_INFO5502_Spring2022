gwynne,a minor,has been a ward of the state since shortly after her birth.when gwynne was just over a year and a half old,the state petitioned the circuit court of cook county to terminate the parental rights of her biological parents and to appoint a guardian with the right to consent to her adoption.following the requisite hearings,the state petition was allowed.both biological parents appealed.the appellate court affirmed.d.we granted the biological mother petition for leave to appeal.for the reasons that follow,we now affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
gwynne was born june.at the time,both of her biological parents were incarcerated.this was not a novel circumstance for either of them.by june of,gwynne father,edward davis,had amassed a significant criminal record,including felony convictions for theft,burglary,aggravated battery,possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver,and retail theft.edward was in jail awaiting trial on an additional felony theft charge when gwynne mother gave birth to her.he was convicted of that offense the following month and sentenced to years in the department of corrections.he began serving that sentence on september.
gwynne mother,detra welch,also sometimes known as jodia or jodi or jody mcmullen,also sometimes known as melissa,also sometimes known as latonya reed,was convicted of retail theft and sentenced to months probation in.she was subsequently found to have violated the terms of her probation and sentenced to days in the cook county department of corrections.in,she pleaded guilty to unlawful delivery of a controlled substance and was sentenced to three years in the illinois department of corrections.she also pleaded guilty to a new charge of retail theft for which she was sentenced to an additional year in the department of corrections.
shortly after detra began serving the sentences imposed for her convictions,she was transferred to a work release program in chicago.while participating in that program,detra escaped from custody by breaking her electronic monitoring device.she remained at large until june,three days before gwynne birth,when she was arrested on new drug charges.
on the eve of gwynne birth,detra was indicted for unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and multiple other drug offenses.detra was subsequently transported from the cook county jail,where she was being held,to the west suburban hospital,where she gave birth to gywnne.a drug abuser,detra transmitted her affliction to her new baby daughter in utero.drug tests administered to gwynne shortly after her birth disclosed the presence of cocaine and opiates in her system.gwynne began experiencing heavy drug withdrawal symptoms for which she required medication.she was later diagnosed with severe developmental deficits attributable to her mother illegal drug use.
detra contact with her new baby was.on june,detra was released from the hospital and taken back to the cook county jail.soon thereafter,she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years in the illinois department of corrections for unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver,one of the new offenses charged in the june indictment.that conviction resulted in detra return to the department of corrections on august.
detra had numerous problems while in prison.between and the end of november,she received a total of inmate disciplinary reports.most arose from minor rule infractions.some were more serious,however,and resulted in her being placed in segregation.the most significant punishment arose from her escape in.as a result of that escape,detra lost a year of credits,received a c grade classification,and was segregated from the prison general population for a full year.the period of disciplinary segregation encompassed most of the first year of gwynne life and carried over into her second.detra was eventually released from the department of corrections in march of,three months before gwynne third birthday.
gwynne is not detra only child.she has three other offspring,judia,now george,now and sade,now.those three children were sent to live with relatives in wisconsin when detra began serving her prison sentences for her drug and theft convictions.the record indicates that judia and sade remained there without incident.george did not.
after his mother was sent to prison,george lived briefly with his maternal grandmother in milwaukee.he soon left there to return to chicago,where he stayed with his maternal uncle,detra brother.the uncle beat george,made him sleep on the floor,and forced him to watch the uncle and the uncle male paramour engage in sexual intercourse.eventually the situation was brought to the attention of authorities,who removed george from the uncle home and placed him in a shelter.
the state was granted temporary custody of george on december,and placed him with his maternal aunt.george apparently remained there until july of,when he fled the state.his whereabouts remained unknown until october of,when a dcfs worker discovered that he had gone back to stay with his maternal grandmother in milwaukee.
while detra was released from the hospital on june,gwynne remained there until july,when she was admitted to the maryville center for medically complex children.in the interim,dcfs was granted temporary custody of the child.on june,when gwynne was days old,the state petitioned the circuit court of cook county pursuant to the juvenile court act of ilcs et west to make her a ward of the court.
after providing notice to the biological parents,the court conducted a temporary custody hearing pursuant to section of the juvenile court act ilcs west.based on that hearing,the court determined that probable cause existed to believe that gwynne was neglected,abused and dependent that there was an immediate and urgent necessity to remove the child from her parents home and that no efforts could reasonably be made at that time to prevent or eliminate the necessity for removing the child from the home.the court therefore ordered that gwynne be removed from the home and granted dcfs temporary custody of her 
the circuit court entered its order placing gwynne in temporary custody on july.an adjudicatory hearing was subsequently held at which the court found that gwynne was a neglected or abused minor within the meaning of section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west because her environment was injurious to her welfare ilcs b west,because she had controlled substances in her system that were not attributable to the medical care administered to her or her mother ilcs c west,and because her parents created a substantial risk of physical injury to her by other than accidental means ilcs ii west.the court further determined that gwynne was a dependent minor as defined by section of the juvenile court act ilcs west.
after making the foregoing findings,the court immediately convened a dispositional hearing pursuant to section of the juvenile court act ilcs west.in a dispositional order entered december,the court found that gwynne mother,detra,was an unfit parent and that both of gwynne parents were unable to care for her.the court determined that reasonable efforts had been made to prevent or eliminate gwynne removal from her home,that appropriate services aimed at family preservation and family reunification had been unsuccessful,and that it was in gwynne best interests that she be removed from the custody of the parents,guardian or custodian.the court therefore adjudged gwynne to be a ward of the court and placed her under the guardianship of dcfs.
through lutheran social services of illinois lssi,gwynne was placed in a specialized foster home.in february of,gwynne was moved to what the record describes as a preadoptive,nonrelative foster home.a report prepared for the court by lssi in may of indicated that the foster mother expressed a desire to adopt gwynne if plans to return her home failed and that gwynne could reasonably expect to remain in the foster parent care until adulthood.
gwynne has now resided with the same foster family for five years,nearly her entire life.the family consists of the foster parents,their biological daughter,and an adopted daughter who has special needs similar to gwynne.both foster parents have undergone extensive training to deal with the type of problems facing gwynne,and the foster mother has a masters degree in early childhood education.
except for the brief period immediately following her birth,gwynne has never been under detra care.the original service plan formulated by dcfs had as its goal the reunification of gwynne with her biological parents.by may of,dcfs regarded the prognosis for attainment of that goal as poor.the father was facing prolonged incarceration,had not availed himself of any of the programs specified in his service plan,and had made no effort to send any cards or gifts to the child.detra remained in disciplinary segregation,a status which precluded her participation in many of the programs specified in her service plan.with respect to the items she could address,including psychological evaluation and counseling,there was no evidence of any participation by her.her efforts with respect to parenting were limited to sending monthly letters to gwynne.based on the foregoing,the parents progress toward the goal of reunification with gwynne was rated unsatisfactory.following a permanency hearing on may,see ilcs west,a new goal was established for the child substitute care pending termination of parental rights.
in november of,the court convened a second permanency hearing to determine gwynne future status.following that hearing,the court entered an order once again setting the appropriate permanency goal for gwynne as substitute care pending court termination of parental rights.approximately two months later,the state petitioned the court pursuant to section of the juvenile court act ilcs west to terminate the parental rights of gwynne parents and to appoint a guardian with the power to consent to her adoption.
a termination petition brought pursuant to section must contain an allegation that the parent is unfit and include the specific statutory grounds on which the charge of unfitness is based.in re.a court may not terminate a parent rights on grounds not charged in the petition.at the same time,however,the state is not required to prove every ground it has alleged for finding a parent unfit.a parent rights may be terminated if even a single alleged ground for unfitness is supported by clear and convincing evidence.in re,at.
the permissible grounds for finding a parent unfit are set forth in section d of the adoption act ilcs d west.as grounds for seeking termination of the parents parental rights in this case,the state alleged that gwynne mother and father had failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern or responsibility as to her welfare ilcs d b west that their criminal convictions rendered them depraved ilcs d i west and that they failed to make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions that were the basis for gwynne removal from them failed to make reasonable progress toward return of the child to them within nine months of when she was adjudged to be a neglected,abused and dependent minor within any month period after that adjudication.see ilcs d m west.with respect to detra alone,the state further alleged that she had been habitually drunk and addicted to drugs other than those prescribed by a physician for at least one year prior to commencement of the proceedings.see ilcs d k west.
the state subsequently filed a supplement to its petition asserting two additional grounds for unfitness.the first,directed at gwynne father,was that gwynne was in the temporary custody or guardianship of dcfs,that the father was presently incarcerated,that prior to his incarceration he had little or no contact with her or provided little or no support for her,and that his incarceration will prevent him from discharging his parental responsibilities for a period in excess of two years after the petition seeking termination of his parental rights was filed.ilcs d r west.the second additional ground was similar to the first,but applied to both parents.it alleged that gwynne was in the temporary custody or guardianship of dcfs,that her parents were both currently incarcerated,that the parents had both been repeatedly incarcerated as a result of criminal convictions,and that their repeated incarceration has prevented them from discharging their parental responsibilities toward gwynne.ilcs d s west.
in march of,while the termination proceedings were still pending,detra was released from prison and placed on parole.a hearing on the state termination petition was ultimately conducted on november,december,and february.during the course of that hearing,the circuit court heard testimony from detra,the lssi social workers assigned to gwynne case,and the social workers supervisor.the court also admitted into evidence numerous exhibits,including records of the parents criminal convictions,the service plans that had been prepared for them,and cards and letters that detra had sent to gwynne.
at the close of evidence,the court heard argument by counsel.the court subsequently ruled that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that gwynne parents were unfit persons within the meaning of sections d b,d i,d m and d s of the adoption act ilcs d b,d i,d m,d s west,as alleged in the state petition.it therefore proceeded to a hearing on the question of whether it was in gwynne best interests that parental rights be terminated.the court answered this question in the affirmative.by order filed may,it terminated the parents parental rights and appointed a guardian with the right to consent to gwynne adoption.see ilcs west.
both parents appealed the circuit court judgment they challenged the court findings regarding both their fitness and gwynne best interests,arguing that those findings were contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.they also asserted that the circuit court acted prematurely when it changed the permanency goal for gwynne from returning home to termination of parental rights.in addition,the father contended that the opinions of one of the state witnesses had not been sufficiently disclosed during discovery and that the circuit court therefore erred when it allowed the state to present that witness testimony at the hearing.d at.
the appellate court rejected all of the father arguments and determined that there was no merit to the parents claim that the circuit court had acted improperly when it changed the permanency goal for gwynne to termination of parental rights.d at.with respect to detra,the appellate court agreed with her claim that she should not have been found unfit under sections d b,d i or d m of the adoption act ilcs d b,d i,d m west.d at.it concluded,however,that the record was sufficient to support the circuit court determination that she was an unfit person within the meaning of section d s of the adoption act ilcs d s west because of her repeated incarceration.d at.the appellate court further concluded that there was adequate support in the record and the law to support the circuit court finding that termination of parental rights was in gwynne best interests.d at.the court therefore affirmed the circuit court judgment.d at.
one member of the appellate court panel dissented from that portion of the opinion which upheld termination of detra parental rights.the dissenting justice was in full agreement that the circuit court should not have found detra unfit under sections d b,d i or d m of the adoption act ilcs d b,d i,d m west.contrary to the majority,however,the dissenting justice would also have set aside,as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence,the circuit court conclusion that detra was an unfit person within the meaning of section d s of the adoption act ilcs d s west based on her repeated incarceration.in the dissenting justice view,efforts made by detra after her release from prison to control her drug addiction,obtain employment as a drug counselor,and maintain an apartment her diligence in attending monthly supervised visits with gwynne and her ability to look after her brother children several times a week made her a role model for addicted mothers undergoing drug treatment.whatever shortcoming detra may have had prior to her release from prison,the dissenting justice wrote,as the person she is now,she is not an unfit parent because of her convictions and incarcerations d at,garcia,dissenting.
gwynne father decided not to challenge the appellate court judgment.detra,however,petitioned this court for leave to appeal.that petition was granted,and detra elected to have the petition stand as her brief.g.briefs were then filed by the state and by the office of the cook county public guardian,acting on behalf of gwynne.in addition,a joint brief was filed by chicago legal advocacy for incarcerated mothers,the legal assistance foundation of metropolitan chicago,loyola childlaw center of loyola university school of law,and companions journeying together,who were granted leave by our court to appear as amici curiae.oral argument was subsequently conducted,and the matter is now before us for a decision on the merits.no issue is raised as to gwynne best interests.the sole question presented is whether detra was properly found to be unfit.
a biological parent right to raise his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest.involuntary termination of parental rights is therefore a drastic measure.where a parent has not consented to relinquishment of his or her parental rights,a court has no power to terminate the parent rights involuntarily except as authorized by statute.in re,at.
a court statutory authority to terminate a parent rights involuntarily and to appoint a guardian with the right to consent to the child adoption is delineated by the language of the juvenile court act ilcs et west and the adoption act ilcs et west.in re,at.under the juvenile court act,parental rights can not be terminated absent the parent consent unless the court first determines,by clear and convincing evidence,that the parent is an unfit person as defined by section d of the adoption act ilcs d west.ilcs west.involuntary termination of a parent rights without a prior showing of unfitness would,in fact,be unconstitutional.in re petition of kirchner.
the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a parent is unfit rests with the state.in re.a trial court determination that a parent unfitness has been established by clear and convincing evidence will not be disturbed on review unless it is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.a court decision regarding a parent fitness is against the manifest weight of the evidence only where the opposite conclusion is clearly apparent.in re.in assessing whether the court decision is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence,a reviewing court must remain mindful that every matter concerning parental fitness is sui generis.see in re cornica,d.each case must therefore be decided on the particular facts and circumstances presented.in re.
as discussed earlier in this opinion,the appellate court in this case rejected as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence all of the grounds on which detra was alleged by the state to be unfit save one repeated incarceration.that basis for lack of fitness is defined in section d s of the adoption act ilcs d s west,which provides that a parent may be found unfit if 
t he child is in the temporary custody of dcfs,the parent is incarcerated at the time the petition or motion for termination of parental rights is filed,the parent has been repeatedly incarcerated as a result of criminal convictions,and the parent repeated incarceration has prevented the parent from discharging his or her parental responsibilities for the child.
there is no dispute that the first three conditions set forth in this statute were satisfied.gwynne was in the temporary custody of dcfs detra,her mother,was incarcerated at the time the petition for termination of her parental rights was filed and detra had been repeatedly incarcerated as a result of criminal convictions.the disagreement in this appeal concerns the existence of the fourth element,whether detra repeated incarceration has prevented her from discharging her parental responsibilities for gwynne.
in assailing the appellate court decision,detra argues that the court analysis effectively read this element out of the law.according to her,the appellate court adopted what amounts to a per se rule under which the mere fact of repeated incarceration is sufficient,in itself,to establish lack of fitness.
had the appellate court actually taken the approach suggested by detra,her concerns would be justified.under the plain and unambiguous language of section d s,repeated incarceration alone will not support a finding that a parent is unfit.the statute specifically requires an additional showing that the repeated incarceration has prevented the parent from discharging his or her parental responsibilities.ilcs d s west.
our court has construed this provision as evincing an intention by the legislature that courts 
consider the overall impact that repeated incarceration may have on the parent ability to discharge his or her parental responsibilities,such as the diminished capacity to provide financial,physical,and emotional support for the child.in re,at.
because this standard looks to the effects of repeated incarceration,there is no requirement that all of the incarcerations have occurred during the child lifetime.incarceration that predates the child birth can also be considered under section d s if it has impeded a parent ability to acquire appropriate life skills or provide the types of physical,mental,moral,material and emotional support children require.in re,at.
contrary to detra claim,the appellate court did not misconstrue the law in this regard.it was mindful of the foregoing principles d at,and applied them.in upholding the finding of unfitness based on repeated incarceration,the court noted the parents terms in prison,but went beyond that,specifically citing testimony by one of the social workers assigned to gwynne case that neither of her parents had been able to provide a stable home,financial or emotional support for the first three years of gwynne young life.d at.
amici argue that in assessing the effects of incarceration on the parents ability to parent,the appellate court improperly focused on the period when detra and gwynne father were still in prison.in amici view,a court can not make a meaningful assessment of the overall impact repeated incarceration has had on a person ability to parent unless it considers the person conduct throughout the period leading up to the hearing on the state petition to terminate.with respect to detra,amici assert that the court should therefore have looked to the efforts she made toward rehabilitation following her release on parole,not simply her conduct while in prison.
the state,for its part,argues that the salient cutoff point for assessing a person fitness under section d s should be the date the petition to terminate is filed.because a parent must be incarcerated at the time the petition is filed for section d s to apply,this construction would necessarily preclude any consideration of anything done by the parent following his or her release from custody.in the state view,a parent postcustody actions should only be considered at the second phase of the termination proceeding dealing with the child best interests the office of the public guardian,appearing on gwynne behalf,shares this view.accordingly,the state and the public guardian argue that the time frame employed by the appellate court in reviewing whether detra was properly declared unfit under section d s of the adoption act was correct.
contrary to the position taken by the state and the public guardian,we do not believe that the date on which the termination petition is filed marks the ending point for assessing the impact repeated incarceration has had on a person ability to parent.consider the language the general assembly has employed.when addressing the effects of incarceration on a person ability to parent,section d s does not speak in the past tense.rather,it asks whether the repeated incarceration has prevented the parent from discharging his or her parental r
