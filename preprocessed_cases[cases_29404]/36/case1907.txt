petitioners jonathan greenfield,jonathan greenfield,hereinafter greenfield,and tenet mary,mary medical center hereinafter mary,seek review of the decision of the fourth district court of appeal in daniels greenfield,so d dca,on the ground that it expressly and directly conflicts with the decision of the fifth district court of appeal in achumba neustein,so d dca,on a question of law.greenfield and mary filed their notices separately,but the two cases have been consolidated in this court.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.as explained below,we approve the decision in daniels greenfield and,accordingly,disapprove the decision in achumba to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.
facts and procedural history 
the conflict issue in this case centers on whether,in a wrongful death action,a survivor claim may be brought on behalf of a child who is alleged to be the decedent biological child but whose mother was married to another man at the time of the child conception and birth.if so,a further question arises as to whether the facts necessary to establish that the child qualifies as a survivor under section,florida statutes,may be determined in a wrongful death action brought under chapter,florida statutes,rather than in a paternity action brought under chapter,florida statutes the fourth district in daniels answered both questions in the affirmative and,as explained below,we agree.
this case arose from a wrongful death action filed by the estate of shea daniels the estate in the circuit court in and for palm beach county in september.daniels committed suicide on september.the complaint filed by daniels mother as personal representative of his estate alleged that he was a psychiatric patient of greenfield and was treated at mary medical center in september.the complaint further alleged,in pertinent part,that daniels was negligently discharged by greenfield and by the hospital without a proper discharge assessment,even though his last assessment by a physician indicated he was possibly suicidal.the complaint sought relief for both the estate and for,a minor child alleged to be the surviving biological son of the decedent and for whom noneconomic damages for loss of consortium were sought.
greenfield filed a motion and amended motion for partial summary judgment alleging that a survivor claim could not properly be brought on behalf of the grounds asserted for summary judgment were that mother was married to someone other than the decedent when was conceived and born,the mother husband paternal rights had not been divested,and the husband was not a party to the estate suit.
at the hearing on the motion for partial summary judgment,the circuit court ruled that 
this is civil court,not the family court.the presumption that the husband is the father is rebuttable in family court not in civil court.as a matter of law,washington the mother husband is the father of the child until the family court says otherwise.
the court granted the motion for partial summary judgment relating to the survivor claims for,citing in the written order the reasons set forth on the record at the hearing.the estate moved the court to rehear the motion,stay the case,and allow the estate to seek a paternity ruling in family court,but the motion was denied.the court entered a final judgment in favor of greenfield and mary medical center as to all of the claims pertaining to,again making reference to the grounds given at the hearing.the estate appealed to the fourth district court of appeal.
the facts set forth in the fourth district decision are stated as follows 
was born to rozine cerine and the decedent,shea daniels.rozine had been married to willie washington in,but they separated in when washington moved away and joined the military.she met shea in may,and was born in september.shea name was listed on the birth certificate as the father.
shea and rozine had a difficult relationship,but he supported rozine and by paying support of per week.he also bought clothes for.his mother,dorothy,visited with on occasion.
rozine filed a petition to determine paternity and for child support against shea in october.shea answered,demanding a dna test,which was ordered but never conducted because shea failed to appear.he was defaulted in the paternity proceeding,but a judgment establishing paternity was never entered.in november,rozine obtained a divorce from willie washington.the record does not contain a copy of the divorce decree.
shea committed suicide in,and his mother brought a wrongful death action on behalf of against a psychiatrist and hospital.both answered and claimed that was not a survivor,because the presumption of legitimacy required that willie washington be deemed shea legal father.thus,could not be a survivor of shea.
during the proceedings,the plaintiff conducted a paternity test which showed that shea was the biological father of.although the court questioned whether such a test should have been authorized,it had granted a continuance for the plaintiff to obtain the test.the test merely confirmed what the birth certificate already recorded.shea was father.
despite the evidence supporting the fact that shea was not only the biological father but also the only father that knew,the court held that because rozine was married to willie washington when was born,the presumption of legitimacy required it to declare as a matter of law that washington was legal father in the wrongful death action.the court granted the motion,excluding as a survivor of his biological father.it also refused a request to abate the wrongful death action to permit a paternity action to be instituted to declare shea paternity of.the personal representative appeals.
daniels,so d at.the fourth district reversed the trial court,explaining 
we begin our own analysis with the statutory text.a survivor includes the child born out of wedlock of a mother,but not the child born out of wedlock of the father unless the father has recognized a responsibility for the child support.stat.the child born can refer only to a biological child.out of wedlock means that the father and mother of the child were not married.thus,the clear meaning of the phrase is that a biological child born to a father not married to the child mother may be a survivor under the wrongful death act if the biological father recognized a responsibility of the child support.the statute does not require a legal determination of paternity.it merely requires recognition by the biological father of a responsibility of support.there is no presumption of legitimacy within the statute which would preclude from his ability to claim loss based upon his survivorship status.thus,the statute appears to benefit the child by permitting recovery from the biological father without undermining the relationship that the child might have with a legal father.under the clear language of the statute,the motion for summary judgment should not have been granted,because is a survivor of shea based upon the evidence of shea support of and the dna test,as well as the birth certificate listing shea as the father.
the fourth district in daniels expressly recognized that achumba held that a child born during a marriage can not maintain a claim as a survivor of a if the decedent is the child biological the status of the mother husband as legal father has not been changed.daniels,so d at citing achumba,so d at.the fifth district in achumba also held that the paternity issue could not be resolved in the wrongful death action.achumba,so d at.the fourth district in daniels disagreed with achumba and adopted the reasoning and holding of the third district in coral gables hospital,veliz,so d dca,which held the opposite 
while recognizing the strong presumption that a child born during a marriage is the legitimate child of the husband,the fourth district in daniels held that i f the presumption has any place in wrongful death survivorship questions,it may be overcome by clear and strong evidence.daniels,so d at emphasis omitted.the fourth district concluded that it is certainly not in the child best interest to blindly apply this presumption to the issue of survivorship in wrongful death proceedings to prevent the personal representative from asserting claims on behalf of for the loss of his father.thus,the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination to be made in the wrongful death action of whether is a survivor of daniels under the provisions of section.id 
standard of review 
the questions presented in this case are pure questions of statutory law.thus,this court review is de novo.kephart hadi,so d.in this analysis,legislative intent is the polestar by which the court is guided,and t o discern legislative intent,a court must look first and foremost at the actual language used in the statute.larimore state,so d.accordingly,we look first to the actual text of the statutory provisions at issue.w hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.holly auld,so d,quoting douglass,mcrainey,so,see also.dep t of envtl.prot.contractpoint.parks,llc,so d.if,however,the language of the statute is ambiguous and capable of different meanings,this court will apply established principles of statutory construction to resolve the ambiguity.barco school bd.of pinellas county,so d,citing gulfstream park racing ass n,tampa bay downs,so d.with these principles in mind,we turn to the statutes at issue.
discussion 
the statutes at issue are found in the florida wrongful death act,which is codified in sections,florida statutes.section,florida statutes,provides that in a wrongful death action,e ach survivor may recover the value of lost support and services from the date of the decedent injury to her or his death,with interest,and the future loss of support and services.stat.minor children may also recover for lost parental companionship,instruction,and guidance and for mental pain and suffering from the date of the injury.stat.section defines survivor to include the decedent children and,when partly or wholly dependent on the decedent for support or services,any blood relatives.stat.that section further states that the definition of survivor 
includes the child born out of wedlock of a mother,but not the child born out of wedlock of the father unless the father has recognized a responsibility for the child support.
stat.the estate contends that the statute refers to the biological father,an interpretation of the statute that was also adopted by the fourth district.conversely,greenfield and mary medical center contend that the reference to father in the statute means the legal father,defined as the husband of the woman who gives birth,if the woman is in fact married at the time.they contend that the decedent must be declared to be the legal father in a separate proceeding before a survivor claim may be brought in a wrongful death action for a child born out of wedlock of the father.the district court concluded that the statute requires only proof that the decedent is the biological father of the child,the father was not married to the mother at the time of the child birth out of wedlock of the father,and the decedent has recognized responsibility for support.
the legislature did not define the word father in chapter.where,as here,the legislature has not defined the words used in a statute,the language should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.school bd.of palm beach county survivors charter schs,so d,alteration in original quoting.neurological injury comp.ass.div.of admin.hearings,so d.it is appropriate to refer to dictionary definitions when construing statutes in order to ascertain the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used there.survivors,so d at quoting barco,so d at.the first definition for father that appears in merriam webster collegiate dictionary is a man who has begotten a child.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.thus,one recognized meaning of the word father is the biological man who has begotten a child.however,as greenfield and mary contend,the word father can also refer to the man who is married to the woman when the child is conceived and born.because section does not define father for purposes of the wrongful death act,and the word appears to be capable of several different meanings,a level of ambiguity exists in the statute that justifies our further investigation into the purpose and intent of the enactment.see barco,so d at.
because we must determine if the phrase out of wedlock of the father contained in section was intended to refer to the biological father of a child born to a man not married to the mother,even though the mother was married to another man at the time of conception and birth,it is necessary to consider the expressed legislative intent in enactment of the wrongful death act.the legislature set forth the intent underlying the florida wrongful death act in section,florida statutes.that provision states 
legislative is the public policy of this state to shift the losses resulting when wrongful death occurs from the survivors of the decedent to the wrongdoer.sections are remedial and shall be liberally construed.
stat.therefore,the intent of the act is to shift the losses of survivors to the wrongdoer.section further mandates that the wrongful death act shall be liberally construed in aid of accomplishing that intent.section requires that for a child to be a survivor of a man who is not married to the mother,the man must have acknowledged the responsibility of support.if the decedent has recognized responsibility for support of the child,that loss falls directly on the is the type of loss that is intended to be shifted to the wrongdoer.
we also take note that prior to the enactment of the florida wrongful death act in,the florida law revision commission undertook a study and in issued its report titled recommendation and report on proposed revision of florida wrongful death and survival statutes in the final recommendation section of the report,the commission recommended that the legislature replace the wrongful death law with a comprehensive wrongful death act that is remedial in nature.the report also recommended that the act be liberally interpreted to further justice,and should allow recovery by survivors including a spouse and all blood relatives dependent in whole or in part upon the decedent.id.at.proposed section of the florida wrongful death act was,in fact,enacted substantially as recommended by the commission.see ch,at,laws of.we note that section of the act provides that blood relatives of the decedent may recover damages if they are partly or wholly dependent on the decedent for support and it is immediately after this reference to blood relatives that section refers to children born out of wedlock of a father who has recognized a responsibility of support.thus,based on the text of the section,the blood tie between the survivor and the decedent is a significant factor in determining who falls within the definition of survivors for purposes of a wrongful death action.
in light of the stated legislative intent underlying the florida wrongful death losses are to be shifted from the survivors to the wrongdoer and that the act is to be liberally construed to effect that in light of the text of section,we conclude that the biological child of a man not married to the mother may claim survivor damages in a wrongful death action so long as it is established that the decedent is the biological parent and that he acknowledged responsibility for support.the fourth district correctly noted that t he statute does not require a legal determination of paternity.it merely requires recognition by the biological father of a responsibility of support.daniels,so d at we agree,and also conclude that a formal declaration of paternity under chapter is not required by section in order for the child to be determined to be a survivor under the wrongful death act 
a second question presented in this case is whether the factual determination of whether is a survivor under section may be made in the wrongful death action.we agree with the fourth district that whet
