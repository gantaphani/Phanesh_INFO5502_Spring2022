background 
factual background 
the mother is a citizen of colombia who,in,entered the united states illegally.the father came to the united states from the dominican republic and became a naturalized citizen in april.the two met while working at a home for the elderly in massachusetts,and they married on december.
in october,the couple daughter,was born in massachusetts.is a citizen of both the united states and colombia.after was born,the family lived together in framingham,massachusetts,for more than two years,but not without incident.by the second year of their marriage,the parents began having frequent arguments.in addition,the mother was stopped for a traffic violation in,prompting concerns that she would be identified as an illegal immigrant and deported.the couple thus agreed that the mother temporarily would move back to colombia.from there,they believed she would have a better chance of obtaining legal residency in the united states.the mother also looked forward to reuniting with her older daughter,from a prior relationship.the parents agreed that the mother would take e.back to colombia with her,and that the mother,and would all move to the united states once the mother obtained legal status.the mother and,who was two years old at the time,moved to colombia on december.
both parents hoped that the time in colombia would be brief lasting approximately seven to nine months and that mother and daughter would be able to return legally to the united states in short order.those hopes were not realized,however,and what was intended to be a short stay in colombia turned into a stay of years.during that time,lived with her mother and grandmother,and she spent time with relatives,friends,classmates,and members of her church.she spoke spanish and attended preschool in colombia.the mother also registered as a colombian citizen so that would have full rights and would be able to leave colombia without any problems.
while the mother and were living in colombia,the father visited once,for five days,in.he never asked that be sent to the united states to see him,but he did speak with her several times a day via telephone and computer throughout the time they were apart.the father also worked on petitions seeking permission for the mother and to enter the united states legally.he filed a petition for the mother in january and for in december.
although petition was granted on december,the mother petition was denied because she had previously entered the united states illegally and therefore was excluded from reentering for ten years.she applied for a waiver of the exclusion,but on march,her application was denied.the mother appealed the denial of waiver on april.
meanwhile,time was running short for to travel to the united states,as her entry visa was set to expire on june.believing that the father would take good care of both girls and that it would improve her chances of obtaining a waiver if both of her daughters were living in the united states,the mother agreed to let both and move to the united states.the father returned to colombia to pick up the girls,and he flew with them back to the united states on may.was approximately years old at the time.
unbeknownst to the mother,however,the father had begun a romantic relationship with another woman,erin mcshane mcshane,in.despite this relationship,and notwithstanding the fact that the immigration attorney he consulted provided no timeline for the granting of the mother petition,the father repeatedly told the mother that he expected her to return to the united states within a matter of months.
when the father and girls arrived in the united states in may,they lived in the father residence in framingham,massachusetts.during the day while the father was at work,the girls video conferenced with their mother and were sometimes cared for by family friends from church.they were also introduced to,the father daughter from a previous marriage,and to mcshane,whom they were told they should not mention to their mother.despite this instruction,by august or september,the mother began to suspect that the father was having an affair.began attending daycare around this time,and the mother periodically called the daycare to speak with teachers.
in december,the father informed the mother that he would be sending back to colombia the mother demanded that he also return,who was then five years old,but the father refused.the mother suspicions of an affair were confirmed when she spoke with upon return to colombia in february.
according to the mother,the father cut off all communication between her and from december until october.he obtained a new phone number in february,filed for divorce on april,and in may of,he moved from framingham to quincy,massachusetts,with and mcshane.the father did not inform the mother of the move or of their new address,thereby interfering with her ability to communicate with her daughter.when began kindergarten at a school in quincy in the fall of,the father did not give the school the mother contact information.
on november,the middlesex probate and family court granted the father uncontested petition for divorce,giving him sole legal and physical custody of.the mother asserts that she did not contest the divorce because she had no opportunity to do so.the father married mcshane after the divorce,and on january,the pair wrote an to the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis asking that the mother immigrant visa petition be terminated.the explained that the parents had divorced and that the father no longer supported the mother request 
procedural background 
in february,the mother contacted the colombia institute of family welfare icbf,interpol,the colombian police,her town mayor,and the media in an effort to secure return.on march,she filed a formal statement with icbf,and on june,she filed an official application under the hague convention.she initiated the present action by filing an emergency petition for return in the district court on may.in that petition,the mother alleged that had been wrongfully retained in the united states by her father since may,when he took from colombia to the united states.
on november,after a hearing,the district court denied the mother petition for return.the court found that the date of retention was december,when the mother demanded return to colombia and the father refused.the district court also found that immediately prior to december,the shared intent and settled purpose of both parties was that live in the united states,as neither parent had intended that abandon her habitual residence there.while the court found that had been acclimatized to colombia by the time that she left in may,it also found that at the time of her retention in december,was acclimatized to the united states.thus,the district court concluded that habitual residence was the united states at the time of her retention,and that her retention was not wrongful under the hague convention.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the crux of the mother argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that place of habitual residence immediately prior to her retention was the united states and not colombia.specifically,she contends that the district court gave too little weight to evidence of acclimatization in colombia and too much weight to evidence that the mother hoped she could one day live with in the united states.
our review of the district court factual findings is deferential,and we will overturn a factual finding only if it hit s us as more than probably wrong it must prompt a strong,unyielding belief,based on the whole of the record,that the judge made a mistake.darín olivero huffman,cir quoting in re,cir.the district court interpretation and application of the hague convention,on the other hand,we review de novo.id.at.as to findings of habitual residence,we defer to the court findings of intent absent clear error,but we review the ultimate determination of habitual residence a mixed question of fact and law de novo.neergaard colón neergaard,wl,at cir.may,citing darín,at.
a.the hague convention 
the hague convention,as implemented by icara,provides for the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state.hague convention,see also abbott abbott,discussing the purpose of the hague convention.article of the hague convention explains that the retention of a child is considered wrongful where the retention is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the retention so long as at the time of retention,those rights were actually exercised or would have been so exercised but for the retention.hague convention.accordingly,a petitioner seeking to prove wrongful retention under the hague convention must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that,at the time immediately prior to the child retention the child habitual residence was the place to which the child return is being sought,the petitioner had custody rights over the child,and the petitioner was exercising his or her custody rights.darín,at.
if a petitioner meets his or her burden of establishing that a child has been wrongfully retained as described in article,and a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful retention to the commencement of judicial or administrative proceedings,the court shall order the return of the child forthwith,hague convention,unless the respondent can establish that an enumerated exception applies,see id.if more than a year has elapsed,the court must still order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.id.
in this case,the only factor in dispute is the first factor whether colombia was habitual residence immediately prior to her retention in the united states in december this factor is critical,because i f the state in which a child is retained was also the child place of habitual residence immediately prior to retention,that retention is not wrongful under the hague convention.neergaard colón,wl,at citation omitted.although the hague convention does not define the term habitual residence,this court has adopted an approach that begins with the parents shared intent or settled purpose regarding their child residence.nicolson pappalardo,cir.as a secondary factor,evidence of a child acclimatization to his or her place of residence may also be relevant.neergaard colón,wl,at.
b.the parents shared intent or settled purpose 
we begin our analysis with the critical issue of shared intent.because young children like lack both the material and psychological means to decide where they will reside,our inquiry focuses on the shared intent or settled purpose of the parents,who are entitled to determine the child place of habitual residence.darín,at.specifically,we must determine the intent of the parents at the latest time that their intent was shared,mota castillo,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,recognizing that the unilateral wishes of one parent alone are not sufficient to change a child habitual residence.neergaard colón,wl,at.
additionally,we must take care to distinguish between the abandonment of a prior habitual residence and the acquisition of a new one.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a person can not acquire a new habitual residence without forming a settled intention to abandon the one left behind.otherwise,one is not habitually residing one is away for a temporary absence of long or short duration.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in this case,the district court noted the parties disagreement as to the existence of a shared intent or settled purpose regarding habitual residence prior to her retention in december.on the one hand,the mother claimed that it was her intention that be with her wherever she lived,while on the other,the father asserted that the parties had always intended for to return to her habitual residence in the united states.after reviewing the parties contentions and all available evidence,the district court determined that it was the shared intent and settled purpose of the parties that live in the united states,and that they did not intend to abandon their habitual residence in the united states in favor of colombia.
the mother takes issue with this finding of shared intent for a number of reasons.she first argues that the district court erred in determining that the parties did not intend to abandon their habitual residence in the united states.while acknowledging that both parents initially intended that stay in colombia be temporary,the mother points out that the requisite shared intent or settled purpose to abandon habitual residence in the united states need not have existed at the time of departure,as it could develop during the course of a stay originally intended to be temporary.ruiz tenorio,cir per curiam.
the mother is certainly correct that the parents need not have intended that habitually reside in colombia at the time they departed the united states,but this does her no favors.even if the mother changed her mind about the nature of time in colombia at some point while they lived there,o ne parent wishes are not sufficient,by themselves,to effect a change in a child habitual residence.darín,at.moreover,nothing in the record suggests that the mother ever intended that time in colombia be anything but temporary prior to the date of the child retention.accordingly,the mother challenge to the district court finding that n either party evidenced an intent to abandon the united states as residence falls flat.
the mother next argues that the district court confused her future hope that the family would live together in the united states with a present,shared intention that live in the united states regardless of whether her mother could follow.she claims that although the district court cited mota,it erred by failing to appreciate that mota analysis of conditional intent applied.we disagree.
in mota,the second circuit held that the district court the mother intended for her daughter to live in the united states only if the mother were able to join her was not clearly erroneous.at.the mother in mota testified that she never intended that her daughter would live permanently in the united states,and that she had only helped smuggle her daughter across the border to allow her father to visit with her for a few hours.id.at.here,however,the mother testimony was of a different nature entirely.specifically,the mother testified that she never discussed the possibility of the father moving to colombia,that both parties agreed in that should be in the united states,and that she agreed that the father could raise in the united states.there is thus ample record support for the district court factual finding that t here was no condition,agreed or otherwise,that e.would return to colombia if the mother could not gain admission into the united states.both parties intended for the separation of daughter and mother to end with the mother return to the united states,not with return to colombia.
by way of rejoinder,the mother asserts that any intent she may have had that habitually reside in the united states was undermined by the father deceit.she points to both the father misrepresentation that it would only take three months to obtain legal entry into the united states and to his secret relationship with mcshane,arguing that the district court failed to address how such false pretenses affecte
