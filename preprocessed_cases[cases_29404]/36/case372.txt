california alliance of child and family services,an association of private,agencies that provide adoption,foster care,and group home services,appeals the summary judgment entered in favor of cliff allenby,the interim director of the california department of social services the state.we must determine whether the state is in compliance with the federal child welfare act cwa mandate that a participating state cover the cost of certain enumerated items for foster care group homes when it pays at a rate that is approximately percent of actual costs adjusted for inflation.the district court concluded that this substantially complies with the cwa.we disagree the natural meaning of cover the cost is to pay in full,not in part.as the state is doing this,we reverse.
the cwa,codified at,was enacted in and creates an scheme whereby states can receive federal funding to assist in the costs associated with raising children who are dependants or wards of the state.to qualify for federal funding,the state agrees to abide by certain requirements.
the state must first submit a plan to the secretary of the united states department of health and human services dhhs.see a.among other things,the plan must provide for foster care maintenance payments in accordance with other provisions of the cwa.a.the state must also designate a state agency to administer the plan once approved,and must agree to amend its plan to comply with any changes made to the cwa or other applicable federal law.a d.
the cwa further provides that any state with an approved plan shall make foster care maintenance payments on behalf of each qualifying child.a.the phrase foster care maintenance payments is defined as 
payments to cover the cost of and the cost of providing food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,reasonable travel to the child home for visitation,and reasonable travel for the child to remain in the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement.in the case of institutional care,such term shall include the reasonable costs of administration and operation of such institution as are necessarily required to provide the items described in the preceding sentence.
california has created its own statutory scheme in an attempt to comply with the cwa it has designated the california department of social services cdss as the agency responsible for administering california cwa plan.see cal.welf,a.the plan calls for cdss to pay foster care providers on a per child per month rate in return for the care and supervision of the child placed with them.cal.welf.a.care and supervision is defined in such a way that it substantially mirrors the federal definition of foster care maintenance payments.it covers food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,and reasonable travel to the child home for visitation.cal.welf.b.
california uses the rate classification level system rcl to determine the amount of the foster care maintenance payments it makes.see cal.welf.the rcl uses a point system that classifies group homes in fourteen categories the funding they receive depends on the category.see cal.welf.b,d f.a group home rcl is based on the level of care and services that the group home operator projects will be provided during the period of time for which the rate is being established,cal.welf.e,and payments are made on a per child,per month basis,cal.welf.a.the rates were initially made effective on july,relying on data from a study of calendar year costs and since then reflect adjustments made,starting with the fiscal year,based on the california necessities index cni.see cal.welf.c.the cni is a weighted average of changes in various costs of living for consumers,including food,clothing,fuel,utilities,rent and transportation.see,cal.welf.a.thus,these annual adjustments reflect any increase or decrease in the cost of living,as measured by one constant calculation of inflation the cni.see id.beginning with the fiscal year,the california statute has provided that the standardized schedule of rates for group homes shall be adjusted annually by an amount equal to the cni computed pursuant to section,subject to the availability of funds.the resultant amounts shall constitute the new standardized schedule of rates.cal.welf.g 
the alliance accepts the state system for calculating costs to be covered,but takes issue with the state underfunding of foster care maintenance payments as a result of having failed to adjust the standardized schedule of rates by an amount equal to the cni since.accordingly,it brought this action,asserting that the state is violating cwa mandate to cover costs,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under.
after discovery,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.in a joint statement of undisputed facts they agreed that since the inception of the rcl,the payment schedule has increased by approximately percent that since the fiscal year,the actual costs incurred by group homes for the care and supervision of children has increased by more than percent and that the cni has increased by approximately percent since the fiscal year.the state admits that as of,it was making foster care maintenance payments at an amount approximately percent of what they would have been had it made yearly cni adjustments.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state.the court concluded that the state based its initial reimbursement standard on the statutory criteria mandated by the federal statute.although the court recognized that the standard rate schedule could become so out of sync with the cost of items listed in the cwa that the california system would be in violation of federal law,it concluded that the process for determining foster care payment rates remains substantially compliant given that today,the rcl provides for about percent of the costs associated with those items.finally,the court held that the cwa does not prohibit the state from taking budgetary considerations into account 
we review the district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.fichman media center,cir internal citation omitted see also.c.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and 
the threshold question in this case is what the cwa actually mandates the state to do.section a provides that the state shall make foster care maintenance payments on behalf of each qualifying child that is,payments to cover the cost of and the cost of providing various daily living expenses,a.we therefore must answer two questions what does it mean to cover costs and how are costs defined we address each question in turn.
in determining what it means to cover costs,we look to the relevant statute for context.in interpreting a statute,we first look to the plain meaning of its text.see paul revere insurance group united states,cir.absent a definition in the statute itself,in attempting to divine the meaning of a particular word we generally use the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.wilderness society fish wildlife service,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted see united states smith,cir.here,the term cover and the phrase cover the costs are both left undefined by the cwa.in these circumstances,consulting common dictionary definitions is the usual course.see wilderness society,at.
various dictionaries indicate that to cover in the context of costs means an amount sufficient to pay all the costs.see,concise oxford english dictionary catherine soanes angus stevenson,oxford.press of money be enough to pay a cost there are grants to cover the cost of materials for loft insulation webster third new international dictionary merriam webster to be adequate to defray or compensate.this comports with the common understanding of what it means to cover the cost.for example,we normally understand an obligation to maintain sufficient funds in a bank account to cover checks as requiring us to provide enough money in reserve to offset the amount of the check.eighty percent of the amount wo do.on the other hand,it is easy to imagine an alternate scenario where cover is qualified.for example,parents might tell their child they will help cover the cost of college.in such a scenario,the common understanding would be that the parents will cover some,but not all,of their child expenses.but here,because the cwa leaves cover unqualified,the common understanding is that it must refer to meeting all the costs of food,clothing,shelter.see a.
the question then becomes one of measuring the cost of those covered items.while the cwa identifies the types of items that must be covered,it does not prescribe any particular metric to measure the cost of those items.each state develops its own plan.california uses the rcl system to make this determination.at the time it implemented its cwa plan,the state looked to calendar year costs from a pilot study for the various items,see cal.welf.c,and created separate levels for different group homes based on the care and services that the group home operator projects will be provided during the period of time for which the rate is being established,cal.welf.e.the california statute moreover provides for yearly adjustments in the proper rcl calculation,tied to the cni in other words,it makes sure if the cost of certain items rise or fall,the rcl takes that change in cost into account.see cal.welf.a,c.thus,california decided that the original rcl,as adjusted by the cni each year,is the cost of the basket of items the cwa requires to be covered.it is undisputed that the state is no longer paying this amount rather,it is paying somewhere in the neighborhood of percent of the amount.in other words,the cwa requires california to cover the cost of certain items and california has developed a formula to determine what those items cost,but is now only partially covering the cost of those items.this runs afoul of the cwa mandate.
the state arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.it points out that the provision for a cni adjustment in its cwa plan is subject to availability of funds.however,the state disavows relying on this out in this case its brief represents that california is not using lack of funds as an excuse to avoid complying with the act.in any event,the state developed no record to support the possibility that it skipped a yearly cni adjustment for lack of funds.consequently,we decline both parties invitation to express an opinion on whether availability of funds is a proper limitation under the cwa on the obligation to cover costs.
the state emphasizes that the cwa does not mandate covering actual costs,which is true.however,this is a strawman as the alliance does not contend that the state must cover every dime spent on the care of foster children.rather,its position is that the state is not paying the amount the state itself treats as costs that is,the rcl as adjusted each year in accordance with the cni and this is what falls short of complying with the cwa.
the state notes that its plan has been approved by dhhs.while also true,the record leaves us unable to say what if any significance this has.for instance,the parties indicated at argument that dhhs approves only the structure of california plan,and does not audit what the state pays.beyond this we have been alerted to no action or opinion by dhhs to which we would owe deference.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d skidmore swift.
in sum,the cwa does not set rates or tell states how they are supposed to cover costs.it does not require states to apply an index such as the cni,or to adopt any particular system for arriving at the amount to be reimbursed.but the cwa does direct participating states to make foster care maintenance payments that cover the cost of listed items such as food,clothing,and shelter.nothing required california to opt in to the cwa program,but once it agreed to take federal dollars,it is bound to comply with federally imposed conditions.missouri child care ass cross,cir quoting pennhurst state sch.hospital halderman,d.in our judgment those conditions are clear the state must pay for the cost of listed items.a.and to do so,under the system the state chose to follow,it must make yearly cni adjustments or some other inflationary adjustment to account for the rise or fall in its standardized schedule of rates.
the alliance and the state dispute whether california is in substantial compliance with the cwa as a general rule,a state that accepts federal funds with conditions attached must strictly comply with those conditions substantial compliance will not be good enough.see withrow concannon,cir requiring strict compliance with a requirement in federal regulations of a review hearing within a number of days.the cwa plainly attaches the condition that participating states shall cover the listed costs.this said,dhhs regulations indicate that the federal government is willing to accept substantial compliance at least in some circumstances.see,c.and it makes sense that compliance can not,as a practical matter,invariably be strict.thus,california system necessarily averages costs across each of the fourteen categories by which it classifies group homes,and the cni is just a proxy for actual increases or decreases in cost.likewise,that the state definition of covered items for foster care maintenance payments does not precisely mirror the federal statute does not make it noncompliant.compare a,with cal.welf.b.the state plan generally tracks the federal definition of daily living expenses,making the state substantially compliant.beyond this,however,we have difficulty seeing how payment of approximately percent of the costs of providing the listed items can qualify as substantial compliance.the federal objective is for those costs to be covered.as percent is even close,and the state makes no serious argument that it is,we hold that its foster care maintenance payments do not substantially comply with the cwa.
because the state is not covering the costs required by the cwa,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment to the state and denying summary judgment to the alliance.there are no factual disputes in this case and therefore,the alliance is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we remand to the district court to determine the proper scope of declaratory and injunctive relief.
reversed and remanded.
i agree that the district court grant of summary judgment should be reversed and remanded but for different reasons than delineated in the majority opinion.
initially,the majority characterizes the child welfare act cwa,as having a mandate that a participating state cover the cost of certain enumerated items for children foster care homes.see a.it then seems to suggest that it is adopting the natural meaning of the term cover the cost which is to pay in full,not in part.the majority also states that because the cwa leaves cover unqualified,the common understanding is that it must refer to meeting all the costs of food,clothing,shelter,emphasis added.later,the majority indicates that it is acceptable under the cwa for a state to create a plan which allows for an estimate of the enumerated costs for various categories of foster care providers such as the rate classification level or rcl herein and to pay such estimates where the plan also has a provision for annual adjustments such as the california necessities index or cni herein.i agree with the latter conclusion but can not concur with the initial ones.more importantly,i differ with the majority in regards to the issues which need to be ruled upon in this appeal.
it is not necessary to decide what cover the cost means under the cwa or for this court to determine whether substantial compliance with the cwa cost requirements suffices in order to resolve this appeal.further,discretion warrants that we not do so herein.rather,because the state plan requires annual cni adjustments and california clearly has not fully complied with that requirement or obtained relief from that obligat
