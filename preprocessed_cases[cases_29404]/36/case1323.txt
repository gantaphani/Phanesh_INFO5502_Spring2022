this appeal questions the standard for determining the right of a minor to oppose a permanent plan for the adoption of his or her sibling on the ground that the adoption would substantially interfere with the sibling relationship.welf,subd.c e.in in re celine cal th,d,celine,our supreme court held that the sibling relationship exception permits the trial court to consider possible detriment to the child being considered for adoption,but not a sibling of that child.here,two minors whose four siblings have been authorized to proceed to adoption appeal from the denial of their request under section,subdivision b to be heard on the applicability of the sibling relationship exception at the permanency placement hearing.we conclude that a request to be heard under section,subdivision b should be granted if a sibling complies with section,subdivision b and demonstrates a close relationship with the minor being considered for adoption,but that the trial court failure to grant a request to be heard in this case gave rise to no prejudice.
background 
on april,the alameda county social services agency the agency filed a petition under section,subdivision b for six half brothers and sisters whose ages at that time were,and.the petition alleged previous referrals in san francisco county for neglect by the mother.the detention report filed the next day stated that on april,the mother and the children were staying at a shelter in hayward because they were being physically abused by the alleged father of one of the children.mother left the shelter at that morning and told the shelter staff that she would return by that afternoon.when mother had not returned by that evening,the shelter staff referred the children to the agency.
the mother was not present at the detention hearing on april,and the children were retained in the custody of the agency.hector,the oldest,and the three youngest children were placed together in one foster home.jose and the were placed in a separate foster home because it was not possible to find a single home to accommodate all six children.on april,the social worker prepared a disposition report indicating that the mother agreed the children should remain in their foster homes until she could improve her situation.on may,the court adopted the social worker recommendations.
in the following months,the children visited with their mother and with each other.the children reportedly enjoyed the time spent with each other.hector and three youngest children adapted well to their foster home.jose and the had to be moved three times,but eventually were placed in a supportive home.
the mother participated only sporadically in reunification services,and on april,the social worker filed a report that recommended terminating reunification services and setting a permanency planning hearing under section for hector and the three youngest children.the social worker had concluded that these four children could be adopted.the social worker also concluded that jose would be adoptable but needed further treatment for his emotional problems before he could be adopted,and that the was adoptable but that placing him for adoption at that point would interfere with his sibling relationship with jose.
a contested review hearing took place in june through august.the court found no substantial probability that the children would be returned to the mother,terminated services,and set a hearing pursuant to section for december,for hector and the three youngest children.
on october,the public defender office,which had been representing all of the children,declared a conflict of interest because jose and the objected to the planned adoption while hector supported it.the three youngest children were too young to express an opinion.jose and the then filed a petition under section,subdivision b to participate in the section hearing as the siblings of the children who were the subject of that hearing.in that petition,they contended that the adoption of the four other siblings would substantially interfere with their sibling relationship.jose and the also requested that,if the court chose adoption as the permanent plan,the visitation order already in place,which allowed the children to visit regularly,be continued until they too were adopted.finally,they asked that the court and the parties explore the possibility of sibling visitation as part of a postadoption contract agreement under section,subdivision a.
on december,the court heard the petition of jose and the.the court denied the petition without comment,and the two timely appealed.on april,the court held the section hearing and terminated parental rights as to hector and the three youngest children.at that hearing the court rejected a request by counsel for jose and the to make orders regarding postadoption visitation.the two children separately appealed from the order terminating parental rights as to the other four children and this court consolidated the two appeals.
discussion 
sibling participation in the termination hearing 
in juvenile dependency proceedings,when reunification efforts fail,as they have in this case,the court must terminate reunification efforts and set the matter for a hearing pursuant to section for the selection and implementation of a permanent plan.cynthia superior court cal th,d.the first choice for permanency,if possible,must be to terminate parental rights and order that the child be placed for adoption we thus see that if the child is adoptable adoption is the norm.indeed,the court must order adoption and its necessary consequence,termination of parental rights,unless one of the circumstances specified in section,subdivision c provides a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child the statutory exceptions merely permit the court,in exceptional circumstances citation,to choose an option other than the norm,which remains adoption.celine,supra,cal th at,d.
one of the five statutory justifications for refraining from terminating parental rights and placing adoptable children in adoptive homes is the sibling relationship exception.under section,subdivision c e,the court must weigh whether t here would be substantial interference with a child sibling relationship,taking into consideration the nature and extent of the relationship,including,but not limited to,whether the child was raised with a sibling in the same home,whether the child shared significant common experiences or has existing close and strong bonds with a sibling,and whether ongoing contact is in the child best interest,including the child emotional interest,as compared to the benefit of legal permanence through adoption.when considering the sibling relationship exception,the concern is the best interests of the child being considered for adoption,not the interests of that child siblings.t he court may reject adoption under this sibling relationship exception only if it finds adoption would be detrimental to the child whose welfare is being considered.it may not prevent a child from being adopted solely because of the effect the adoption may have on a sibling.celine,supra,cal th at,d.
there is no dispute that hector and the three youngest children are adoptable.jose and the wished to oppose the adoption by asserting the sibling relationship exception at the section hearing.a parent whose parental rights will be terminated has standing to assert this exception in re th,d as undoubtedly does the minor who is being considered for adoption.siblings who are not the subject of the termination hearing,even if they are also the subject of the dependency proceedings,have no such automatic right.see seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure ed.dependency,a.
in order to be entitled to appear at the section hearing for the four other siblings and to assert the sibling relationship exception,jose and the properly petitioned the court under section,subdivision b.subdivision b was added to section in stats,ch.section formerly addressed solely motions to modify orders that the juvenile court had already entered,now covered in subdivision a.what is now subdivision c addresses procedures with respect to motions under both subdivisions a and b.while these procedures apply in a straightforward manner to motions to modify existing orders,their application to some motions authorized by subdivision b is problematic.the same can be said with respect to rule of the california rules of court,which specifies standards and procedures for deciding a petition for modification.the rule refers to all of section and there is no other rule for a motion under subdivision b,but much of rule sensibly applies only to an application to modify an existing order.
section,subdivision b provides any person,including a child who is a dependent of the juvenile court,may petition the court to assert a relationship as a sibling to a child who is,or is the subject of a petition for adjudication as,a dependent of the juvenile court,and may request visitation with the dependent child,placement with or near the dependent child,or consideration when determining or implementing a case plan or permanent plan for the dependent child or make any other request for an order which may be shown to be in the best interest of the dependent child the petition shall be verified and shall set forth the following through which parent he or she is related to the dependent child.whether he or she is related to the dependent child by blood,adoption,or affinity.the request or order that the petitioner is seeking.why that request or order is in the best interest of the dependent child.italics added.
subdivision c of section provides if it appears that the best interests of the child may be promoted by recognition of a sibling relationship,the court shall order that a noticed hearing be held as is true of motions under section,subdivision a,most applications authorized by subdivision b such as a request for visitation or placement with the dependent child,if granted,thereby become operative and affect the treatment of the minor in some respect.hence,if the petition makes the necessary prima facie showing,subdivision c requires that a hearing be held on the application.i f the petition presents any evidence that a hearing would promote the best interests of the child,the court will order the hearing.in re jasmon cal th,d,quoting in re heather d.since the request for consideration when determining a permanent plan for the dependent child seeks merely the right to be heard,if the section,subdivision b petition makes the necessary prima facie showing,the court and the parties may consider it more expedient to grant the petition and defer consideration of the strength of the sibling relationship to the section hearing 
while a sibling of the child proposed for adoption thus must obtain an order pursuant to section to become entitled to participate in the section hearing,the statute is not perfectly clear as to what the nonadoptive sibling must establish to be entitled to such an order.according to subdivision b,the verified petition must set forth w hy the request or order is in the best interest of the dependent child.under subdivision c,a noticed hearing must be held i f it appears that the best interests of the child may be promoted by recognition of a sibling relationship.according to one practice guide,for a sibling to have standing to assert the sibling exception should apply to prevent the termination of parental rights of the dependent child whose case is before the court,the sibling must first prove under b c that allowing the sibling to litigate the sibling exception is in the best interest of the dependent child that is before the court.seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure,supra,dependency,a.
none of these articulations is particularly helpful.in order for the nonadoptive sibling to obtain the right to be heard,it should not be necessary to prove that detriment to the adoptive child from disrupting the sibling relationship would be so substantial that adoption is not in the best interests of that child.that is the ultimate question to be determined at the section hearing.the nonadoptive sibling need not prove that he or she will prevail in opposing the adoption in order to obtain the right to participate in the hearing.the petitioning sibling need show only that there is a sufficient bond with the adoptive child that the best interests of that child require full consideration of the impact of interfering with that relationship before a decision is reached on the permanency plan.
an appropriate understanding of what the court should consider in passing on such a petition under section,subdivision b begins with recognition of the two distinct but interrelated issues that are presented when the sibling relationship exception is asserted at the section hearing.under section,subdivision c e,the court is directed first to determine whether terminating parental rights would substantially interfere with the sibling relationship by evaluating the nature and extent of the relationship,including whether the child and sibling were raised in the same house,shared significant common experiences or have existing close and strong bonds.citation.if the court determines terminating parental rights would substantially interfere with the sibling relationship,the court is then directed to weigh the child best interest in continuing that sibling relationship against the benefit the child would receive by the permanency of adoption.in re,supra,th at,d.the petition of a nonadoptive sibling under section,subdivision b raises only the first of these two questions.
section,subdivision b is but one of the numerous additions that have been made to the welfare and institutions code since recognizing the importance of sibling relationships to the psychological health of dependent children and of the need to preserve such relationships whenever possible,subd.d,subd.i,subd.c e,see generally,schwartz,siblings torn apart no more mcgeorge.as the legislature noted in amending section,by sprinkling language requiring consideration of the sibling relationship over the many statutes governing different stages of dependency proceedings,proponents hope that the goal of preserving and strengthening the child family ties will be fulfilled.com.on judiciary,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
yet,n ot all sibling relationships are strong or healthy.schwartz,siblings torn apart no more,supra,mcgeorge.at.t he existence of a brother or sister does not guarantee a sibling relationship.williams,sibling rights to visitation a relationship too valuable to be denied.many siblings have a relationship with each other,but would not suffer detriment if that relationship ended.if the relationship is not sufficiently significant to cause detriment on termination,there is no substantial interference with that relationship.to determine the significance of the sibling relationship,the court considers the nonexclusive factors set forth in section,subdivision c e.in re,supra,th at,d.
the section,subdivision b petition does not call upon the court to weigh the detriment of interfering with the sibling relationship against the advantages to the adoptive dependent of adoption,but merely to determine whether there is a sufficiently close relationship between the siblings that the nonadoptive sibling should be permitted to urge consideration of this factor when a permanency plan for the adoptive child is considered at the section hearing.as with other petitions under section,the petition should be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency.cal.rules of court,rule a see also in re marilyn cal th,d,in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d.if a separate hearing is conducted pursuant to subdivision c of section,the hearing should be confined to whether there are sibling bonds that will be adversely affected by an adoption,without anticipating the balancing of conflicting interests that will occur at the section hearing.
in amending section to recognize sibling relationships,the legislature took into account the fact that under juvenile law,many young people who are removed from their parents due to abuse and neglect are also inadvertently separated from their siblin
