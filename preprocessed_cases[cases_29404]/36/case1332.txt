introduction 
this case illustrates the sort of unexpected complications that can arise from the living trusts which are hawked so aggressively these days.the bottom line here is that the casual use of a living trust as a quickie estate planning device meant that a husband was worth a lot less than his second wife thought he was worth when she married him.unbeknownst to her,the husband erstwhile assets had already been tied up for the first wife children because of an overly broad clause involving how the trust would hold title.as we explain below,the import of that clause is that it meant that removing an asset from the trust required than just taking title in one own name.we will therefore affirm a judgment which requires the second wife to pay over assets that she thought were the husband,and later thought were hers,to the first wife children.
ii.background 
in,during the course of a long marriage,george and barbara husband first a revocable living trust with both spouses acting as their own trustees.the trust would,however,become irrevocable with the death of one of the original trustors.upon that death,the trust was to be split into two trusts a family trust consisting of the maximum amount of assets that would pass to the estate of the trustor free of estate tax and a marital trust for the remainder.george and barbara son william heaps and frank ciotti would join the survivor as of the family trust,but the surviving spouse would remain sole trustee of the marital trust.the trust also provided that the surviving spouse would have the right to an annual principal invasion of the assets of the family trust,up to the greater of percent of the assets or.however,to make that invasion,the trust section to be specific required the surviving spouse to first make such request on or before december of each year only.
this case concerns the only important asset put into that trust,a residence on circle haven owned by george and barbara at the time the trust agreement was made.title to the circle haven property was transferred to the trust via quitclaim deed in.the quitclaim deed transferring the property to the trust was,however,never recorded.it was just given to george and barbara attorney.
barbara would live another nine years,and die in.but four years before her death in,george and barbara sold the circle haven property for.in return for the circle haven property,george and barbara got back a note and an deed of trust in the amount of,title to which was taken as joint tenants.
of course,taking title as joint tenants was,in retrospect,to be expected since the quitclaim deed to the trust was never recorded,the buyers of the circle haven property would have no reason to expect to receive title from the trust.as far as the buyers were concerned,title was directly in the names of george and barbara as joint tenants.
there is no question that on barbara death the trust became irrevocable.the question on which this case turns is,rather,whether the proceeds from the sale of the circle haven property were still in the trust as of barbara death in.
if those proceeds were property of george and barbara individually,then the actions of george and his second wife mary ann,whom he married a few months after barbara death in february,were perfectly legitimate.those actions were these in,george and his second wife mary ann created their own family trust,and executed a quitclaim deed to transfer any interest in the circle haven property and in the trust deed received in return for that property to that new trust.what more,after george died in fact,during the pendency of this very ann transferred all the assets from the trust to her own revocable trust.
however,if the proceeds were still in the trust,the and transfers were,in effect,conversions of property not belonging to george or mary ann.for what it is worth,there is no evidence in the record that george himself ever treated the trust as having any force or validity after barbara death.
iii.terms of the trust 
two clauses in particular bear on the question of whether,by taking title as joint tenants,george and barbara took the proceeds of the circle haven property out of the trust.we now quote them verbatim 
first is the portion of the trust agreement involving amendment 
section amendment and revocation 
at any time during the joint lives of the trustors,jointly as to community property and individually as to his or her own separate property,trustors may,by a duly executed instrument,
a amend this trust agreement including its technical provisions in any manner 
b revoke this trust agreement in part or in whole,in which latter event any and all trust properties shall forthwith revert to such trustor free of trust.such instrument of amendment or revocation shall be effective immediately upon its proper execution by trustor s,but until a copy has been received by a trustee,that trustee shall not incur any liability or responsibility either i for failing to act in accordance with such instrument or ii for acting in accordance with the provisions of this trust agreement without regard to such instrument.emphasis added.
second is the portion of the trust agreement concerning holding title 
section manner of holding title 
the trustee may hold securities or other property held by trustee in trust pursuant to this declaration in trustee name as trustee under this declaration,in trustee own name without a designation showing it to be trustee under this declaration,in the name of trustee nominee,or the trustee may hold such securities unregistered in such condition that ownership will pay by delivery.emphasis added.
iv.discussion 
a.the terms of the trust agreement require something more to take property out of the trust than a mere change in title 
the basic rule governing the interpretation of these clauses is exceedingly simple the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other,emphasis added.
at oral argument,counsel for mary ann eloquently argued that pulling assets out of living trusts should not be difficult for people who are both the trustees and beneficiaries of such a trust.and that idea certainly makes sense in the abstract,and dovetails nicely with her central legal theory,which is that merely by taking title to the proceeds as joint tenants,george and first wife barbara were exercising the power they necessarily had to pull assets out of the trust.
but the theory fails because the only way we can give effect to every part is to interpret the trust agreement to require,when assets are being withdrawn from the trust,in addition to merely taking title in a form that would be in some name other than the trust.
the first clause,section,is fairly prosaic.a duly executed instrument was needed to amend the trust.since george and barbara were their own trustees,presumably a signed memo to themselves purporting to amend the trust would have been sufficient 
but the second clause,section,is a landmine,ostensibly buried in the trust agreement to make it easy and convenient for the trust to hold in the end,too easy and convenient.by saying that title to trust property could be held in any way,it necessarily meant that selling an asset and taking title in a name other than that of the trust would not,by itself,take the property out of the trust.the whole point of section is that title could be taken in the name of the trustors as distinct from the trust itself and the property would still be in the trust.
by the same token,the fact that after barbara death george simply ignored the trust he had entered into with barbara could not take the circle haven proceeds out of the trust.after all,section was obviously put in the trust so that it would be easy to ignore the existence of the trust and still maintain assets in it.but there is a price to be paid for such convenience.in computerese,section made remain in trust the default setting.some affirmative action beyond merely a change in form of title on the part of the trustors was required to click off that default.
having determined that the placement of assets wit
