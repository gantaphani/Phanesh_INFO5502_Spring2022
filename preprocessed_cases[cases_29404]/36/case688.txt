factual and procedural background 
in,the trial court ordered father to pay mother per month in child support for their son.in,mother moved with their son from california to texas.in or about,father moved from california to nevada.
on january,father filed a request to modify the amount of his child support payments based on his reduced income.mother opposed his request for modification,arguing the matter should be heard in the state of their son residence,texas because none of the parties lived in california.
at the hearing on father modification request,father appeared telephonically and was represented by counsel,mother appeared telephonically in propria persona,and department appeared as an intervenor.department counsel stated the first issue for the court was whether the court had continuing,exclusive jurisdiction in the case.she argued that because mother,father,and their son no longer resided in california,the trial court did not have jurisdiction under section,subdivision a,to modify the original child support order.she suggested father could have the original child support order registered in texas and then seek its modification.however,the trial court,noting the original child support order was a california order,stated it continues to have jurisdiction,until another state assumes jurisdiction.you do leave a party without a forum.it further stated it clear that california should continue to have it.but it does.that is it should be in someone else jurisdiction.but someone needs to take that affirmative step,whether mother,father,or department.i assume it the father,since he the payor the court then proceeded to hear arguments on the merits of father request for modification.based on the evidence,the court issued an order order modifying the original child support order,reducing father child support obligation to per month,effective february.department timely filed a notice of appeal challenging the order.
discussion 
iuifsa and section 
this appeal involves the application of section california adoption of of the uifsa to the undisputed facts relevant to this appeal.we begin by reviewing the relevant provisions of section,the uifsa,and applicable regulations.the uniform interstate family support act pt.i b west laws ann.interstate fam.support act,et.uifsa,which has been adopted by all states,governs the procedures for establishing,enforcing and modifying child support orders in cases in which more than one state is involved.the version of the uifsa took effect in california on august.see,et together with the federal full faith and credit for child support orders act ffccsoa,the uifsa ensures that in every case only one state exercises jurisdiction over child support at any given time.in re marriage of crosby grooms th,fn.omitted.
the cornerstone of the uifsa is the concept of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction,codified in california as section.stone davis th.uifsa was designed to ensure that only one state at a time would have jurisdiction to make and modify a child support order.t he central jurisdictional feature of uifsa is the concept of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.under uifsa,a court that makes a valid child support order retains exclusive jurisdiction to modify the order as long as the requirements for continuing,exclusive jurisdiction remain fulfilled.the court of another state may enforce a child support order registered in that state,but may not modify it unless the decree state has lost its continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.knabe brister,supra,th at.
regarding continuing,exclusive jurisdiction,section provides in pertinent part 
a a tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order 
as long as this state remains the residence of the obligor,the individual obligee,or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued or 
until all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consents with the tribunal of this state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.
b a tribunal of this state issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this state may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter italics added.
section is california adoption of section of the uifsa.the drafter comment to the version of section of the uifsa states in pertinent part 
this section is perhaps the most crucial provision in uifsa t he issuing tribunal retains continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order,except in very narrowly defined circumstances.as long as one of the individual parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state,and as long as the parties do not agree to the contrary,the issuing tribunal has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over its order which in practical terms means that it may modify its order 
the other side of the coin follows logically.just as subsection a defines the retention of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction,by clear implication the subsection also defines how jurisdiction to modify may be lost.that is,if all the relevant persons the obligor,the individual obligee,and the child have permanently left the issuing state,the issuing state no longer has an appropriate nexus with the parties or child to justify exercise of jurisdiction to modify.further,the issuing tribunal has no current information about the factual circumstances of anyone involved,and the taxpayers of that state have no reason to expend public funds on the process 
according to the logical implication of subsection a,the issuing state may also lose its continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify if the parties consent in writing for another state to assume jurisdiction to modify even though one of the parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state pt.ib west laws,supra,interstate fam.support act,comment to,italics added.
continuing,exclusive jurisdiction in this case 
department contends the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by issuing the order modifying the original child support order.it argues that because father,mother,and their son no longer resided in california at the time of father modification request and the court issuance of the order,the court did not have continuing,exclusive jurisdiction under section and therefore could not modify the original child support order.father has not filed a respondent brief opposing department position.we decide this appeal based on the appellant opening brief,the record on appeal,and our independent research regarding applicable law.
based on our review of section,the uifsa and comments thereto,other statutes and regulations,and relevant case law,we conclude the trial court acted in excess of its authority under section by modifying the original child support order.the court did not have continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify the original child support order after the individual parties and their child moved to other states and did not consent in writing to california continuing jurisdiction or authority over the case.
section,subdivision a,provides that a california court has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order as long as this state remains the residence of the obligor,the individual obligee,or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued or until all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consents with the tribunal of this state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction,subd.a,italics added.
the proper interpretation of section is a question of law,which we conduct de novo.stone davis,supra,th at people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th.the basic rules for statutory construction are established.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin with the plain language of the statute,affording the words of the provision their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context,because the language employed in the legislature enactment generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citations.the plain meaning controls if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language.citation.if,however,the statutory language may reasonably be given more than one interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.people cornett cal th.
applying the above rules for statutory construction,we first look to the language of section to determine its meaning.because section is written as is of the uifsa using the disjunctive or,there appear to be two alternative situations in which a california court will no longer have continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify an original child support order.first,by negative implication,a california court will not have jurisdiction if all of the individual parties and the child reside in other states,subd.a.second,the court will not have jurisdiction if at least one individual party or the child resides in california,but all of the individual parties,mother and father file a written consent with the california court agreeing that a court of another state will have continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify the original child support order,subd.a.based on our reading of section,the above interpretation appears to be the most logical interpretation of its language.nevertheless,to the extent that statutory language is ambiguous,we conclude the legislative intent underlying section,including the intent that its provisions be consistent with the uifsa and,presumably,with other states interpretations,supports our interpretation that a california court does not have continuing,exclusive jurisdiction within the meaning of section if all the individual parties and the child reside in other states,and all of the individual parties have not consented in writing to a california court assuming continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.because the record in this case does not show the existence of any written consent,we focus on the effect of the parties not residing in california on a california court continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify a child support order.
section represents california adoption of the version of section of the uifsa.the drafters comment to that uifsa section provides evidence of the legislative intent underlying section,stating t he issuing tribunal retains continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order,except in very narrowly defined circumstances.as long as one of the individual parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state,and as long as the parties do not agree to the contrary,the issuing tribunal has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over its order which in practical terms means that it may modify its order.pt.ib west laws,supra,interstate fam.support act,comment to,italics added.it further states b y clear implication subsection a also defines how jurisdiction to modify may be lost.that is,if all the relevant persons the obligor,the individual obligee,and the child have permanently left the issuing state,the issuing state no longer has an appropriate nexus with the parties or child to justify exercise of jurisdiction to modify.pt.ib west laws,supra,interstate fam.support act,comment to,italics added.the comment further notes t he issuing state may also lose its continuing,exclusive jurisdiction to modify if the parties consent in writing for another state to assume jurisdiction to modify even though one of the parties or the child continues to reside in the issuing state pt.ib west laws,supra,interstate fam.support act,comment to.accordingly,the drafters of the uifsa intended section to provide that continuing,exclusive jurisdiction would necessarily be lost by the state issuing the original child support order when all of the relevant persons,obligor,obligee,and child have moved out of the issuing state,california and reside in other states.
additional evidence of the uifsa drafters interpretation of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction is shown in their prefatory notes to the uifsa 
except for narrowly defined fact circumstances,under uifsa the only tribunal that can modify a support order is the one having continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the order.but,if the parties no longer reside in the issuing state,or if they agree in writing that another tribunal may assume modification jurisdiction,a tribunal with personal jurisdiction over the parties,has jurisdiction to modify citations.except for modification by agreement or when the parties have all moved to the same new state,the party petitioning for modification must submit himself or herself to the forum state where the respondent resides.pt.ib west laws,supra,interstate fam.support act,prefatory note,pt,italics added.
we conclude the legislature,by adopting the version of section of the uifsa,intended that section language would be interpreted in the same manner as the uifsa drafters intended the language of section of the uifsa to be interpreted.therefore,the uifsa drafters comments support our interpretation of section.
the federal full faith and credit for child support orders act ffccsoa,also supports our interpretation of section as well as the drafters interpretation of of the uifsa.to provide for the recognition and enforcement of other states child support orders,congress enacted the ffccsoa requiring that states give full faith and credit to those child support orders issued by state courts that had continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over child support at the time.a,f,g.that law provides that a state court shall not modify a child support order made by a court of another state unless it complies with the law requirements.a.it provides that a court may modify a child support order of another state court if that court has jurisdiction pursuant to i and the court of the other state no longer has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction of the child support order because that state no longer is the child state or the residence of any individual contestant or each individual contestant has filed written consent with the state of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction for a court of another state to modify the order and assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the order.e,italics added.that law further provides if there is no individual contestant or child residing in the issuing state,the party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify,or to modify and enforce,a child support order issued in another state shall register that order in a state with jurisdiction over the nonmovant for the purpose of modification.i.those provisions of the ffccsoa show congress intended full faith and credit be given only to modifications of child support orders of state courts with continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the case.furthermore,congress intended that a state court would not have such continuing,exclusive jurisdiction after the individual contestants and the child are no longer residents of that state.e.therefore,the ffccsoa supports our interpretation of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction as used in section,subdiv
