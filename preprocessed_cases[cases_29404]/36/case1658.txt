this case revolves around the interpretation and application of adoption of kelsey cal th,d.
when jaime was and annie was,they lived together for about a month.after annie became pregnant with jaime child,she moved back in with her parents.annie wanted to place the child for adoption.jaime wanted to keep the child to that end,he filed a paternity petition.when annie gave birth,she placed daniele with robert and tracy,who filed an adoption petition bethany christian services,the adoption agency,filed a petition to terminate jaime parental rights.
if a man is the presumed father of a child,the child can not be adopted without his consent,subd.a,unless the trial court finds,on statutorily specified grounds,that he is unfit,subd.b.if,however,he is not a presumed father of a child,the child can be adopted without his consent,and his parental rights can be terminated,unless the court determines it is in the child best interest for him to retain his parental rights,subd.b.jaime did not qualify as daniele presumed father.
in kelsey,however,our supreme court held that a biological father has a constitutionally cognizable opportunity interest in developing a relationship with his child.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.the biological connection between father and child is unique and worthy of constitutional protection if the father grasps the opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship,at,d.accordingly,this statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers to the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child best interest.if an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent,at,d.
the trial court ruled that,under kelsey,jaime had a constitutionally protected interest in an opportunity to form a relationship with daniele,and therefore the adoption could not proceed without jaime consent.the then filed a guardianship petition instead.the trial court found that granting either jaime or annie custody of daniele would be detrimental to her,and that granting the custody of daniele would be in her best interest.nevertheless,it ruled that,under kelsey,jaime constitutionally protected interest required it to balance the detriment to the child against the preference for placement with a biological parent.on this basis,it denied the guardianship petition.after a further custody hearing,it granted temporary custody to annie 
the trial court finding that jaime qualified for constitutional protection under kelsey is supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we will affirm its order denying the adoption petition.
the trial court ruling that jaime constitutional protection precluded it from granting the guardianship petition based on detriment alone was erroneous.accordingly,in the published portion of this opinion,we will reverse the order denying the guardianship petition.
procedural background 
in april,bethany christian services gave jaime notice that annie was planning to place the child for adoption.on may,jaime filed a paternity petition in los angeles county superior court.
on september,jaime filed an order to show cause osc in the paternity proceeding,seeking custody visitation.the osc was set for hearing on october.
on september,the filed an adoption petition in riverside county superior court.jaime first learned daniele had in fact been born when his attorney called him to tell him about the adoption proceeding.
on september,jaime filed an ex parte application in the adoption proceeding,seeking immediate custody.the trial court denied the application because the matter was pending before the court in los angeles county.
on october,pursuant to stipulation,the paternity proceeding was transferred to riverside county.as a result,jaime pending custody osc went off calendar.
on october,jaime filed a new osc for custody visitation.on november,the trial court continued the hearing on the osc it directed counsel to discuss visitation outside of the courtroom.the refused to agree to visitation.on december,the trial court consolidated the paternity proceeding with the adoption proceeding it denied visitation and continued the hearing on jaime osc.
on december,the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on jaime paternity petition and on the petition to terminate his parental rights.on december,it ruled that jaime was daniele father and that his consent was necessary for her adoption.
the trial court denial of the guardianship petition 
the contend the trial court erred by denying their guardianship petition.
additional factual and procedural background.
additional evidence.
on january,annie filed a petition for the appointment of the as guardians for daniele.on march through,the trial court held a joint evidentiary hearing on both jaime custody osc and the guardianship petition 
the called kenneth fineman as their expert witness.fineman was a psychologist specializing in child custody.he had had clinical experience with teenagers and adults who had been taken from a parent at the age of seven months or less.
he testified that daniele was attached to the,who were her psychological parents.she was also attached to the other children,as her siblings.removing a child of daniele age then seven months from his or her psychological parents would cause an attachment disorder.
a ttachment disorder has short and effects t he effects generally are broken down into three phases,the acute phase where the child suffers extreme separation anxiety,the second stage where the child suffers significant despair,and the final stage where the child becomes quite detached and has significant difficulty making new attachments.
t he effects involv e initially acute anxiety on the part of the child,confusion,significant fear of the new unfamiliar surroundings that the child is brought into.oftentimes it described as the child is out of his or her mind with fright.they cry,they shake the crib,they throw themselves around.
they then move on to the next phase which is the phase of despair where they show signs of helplessness,hopelessness,there a decrease in their physical movements,a deep mourning is quite apparent.they become quite apathetic in their contact with others.they tend to make very little demands initially,and ultimately they have great difficulty in interacting at least initially with whomever they with.they show significant grief,psychosocial retardation,avoidance of others,gastrointestinal disturbances,depressed mood,withdrawal,anxiety,anger,physical illness,meaning they become much more prone than the average child to become physically ill.
they become more accident prone than the average child,and the research shows that they have an increased disposition toward infectious disease and an increased susceptibility to trauma,meaning they have become basically a vulnerable child.
t he effects a re most apparent in late childhood or in adolescence,and that when we see basically a child who has a loss of trust 
inability to form close relationships is the main problem which affects them throughout their life,including young adulthood when they trying to make marital type bonds.they become,especially in childhood and adolescence,attention seeking,very restless,disobedient,unpopular with peers,they have difficulty becoming independent.they develop an excessive distrust in people in general 
they expect rejection.some of them show some subnormal intelligence t hey seem to test below their potential.they very apathetic kids in adolescence,and they seem to have a predisposition toward depressive illness 
fineman concluded,i t would be extremely detrimental to the child to be removed from the custody.
jaime called diane dehaven as his expert witness.she was a licensed marriage and family therapist with a master degree.she had never testified as an expert before.she was familiar with research regarding infant attachment and attachment disorder.however,she had not done any clinical work regarding infant attachment,and she had not studied any children with attachment disorder.she had worked with young adults who had been in disrupted adoptions.she had seen children who had been separated from their psychological parents maybe just a couple of times.
in dehaven opinion,a child who had already formed an attachment with one caregiver probably would not suffer from attachment disorder if transferred to a different caregiver.t he child will be able to form new attachments.t here going to be a little bit of distress i f the child is emotionally healthy and attached and going into a warm and nurturing environment,the distress would probably be minor at best and.obviously if there was some untoward event that occurred,some major trauma that occurred,some significant change in circumstance that occurred,of course,it possible,but generally speaking,a child who has securely attached is not necessarily a candidate for attachment disorder.
the introduced evidence intended to show that jaime had had a criminal sexual relationship with a then girl,was affiliated with a gang,was an alien who was likely to be deported,used alcohol and marijuana regularly,had abused annie,and had had only three visits with daniele,during which he did not interact well with her.jaime presented contrary evidence.the trial court found the evidence unpersuasive to the extent they have attempted to show jaime unfitness as a basis for their contention of detriment,the have failed to sustain their burden of proof.the do not challenge this finding.
the trial court ruling.
on april,the trial court denied the guardianship petition.in a careful and detailed written ruling,it explained 
the bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that an award of custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that placement with the proposed guardians is in the best interest of the child.
fineman testimony establishes,and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence,that removing daniele from the custody of the would be significantly detrimental to her.
the contend that zachary states the controlling law.if they are correct,their petition should be granted,regardless of the nature,extent and timeliness of jaime efforts to obtain custody.
zachary is similar on its facts to the present case in several important respects.the court did not find the father to be unfit,nor did it fault the father for the delay in arriving at a final judgment,during which time attachment occurred.the sole reason for the conclusion that removal of the child would be detrimental was harm stemming from removal from a stable placement.
the issue squarely raised,and not addressed by the zachary court perhaps because of the duration of the placement,is whether the constitutional protection afforded the parental relationship of a father with his child may always be defeated if the process consumes enough time so that the child forms an attachment to the prospective guardian,thus establishing a detriment if the child is removed.
the correctly contend that jaime is not a presumed father,but only a biological father,under california law.the kelsey decision supports that contention,but holds further that constitutional standards require the rights of a biological father who passes the kelsey test to be equivalent to those of the mother and,by logical extension,those of a presumed father.jaime has objected to adoption by the,and the court has sustained his objection.the have not shown why he should now be treated differently from a presumed father,or whether,at this stage,the distinction between a presumed father and a biological father is meaningful at all.
the court in kelsey framed the issue it decided as follows is the state important interest in the well being of a child born out of wedlock substantially furthered by allowing the mother to deny the child biological father an opportunity to form a relationship with the child that would give the father the same statutory rights as the mother or a presumed father in deciding whether the child will be adopted by third parties emphasis added.the decision answers the question in the negative.
it is true that the kelsey court was deciding whether a biological father who passes the test has a right to prohibit an adoption of his child.the court expressly avoided deciding whether he had a right to custody.however,it would be strange indeed if,having vindicated his constitutionally protected right to an opportunity to form a relationship with the child,he were ineluctably faced with the impossibility,through any efforts of his own,of ever gaining physical custody or of sharing legal custody with the mother.
the courts are required to give great weight to the permanent and stable placement of a child.there are instances,however,in which that priority must be considered with others.although there is ample room for improvement by the judiciary and the bar,it is certain that cases such as this one take time to prepare,try and decide.it is unacceptable to allow the time consumed by the process itself to dictate the result.
here,the preference for placement with a biological parent outweighs the detriment to the child.fns.omitted.
in appointing a guardian of the person for a child,the trial court must follow family code sections at and et,relating to child custody,subd.b.the ordinary standard of decision in a custody matter is the best interest of the child.under the parental preference doctrine,however,an award of custody to a nonparent as against a parent can not be made based on the child best interest alone in addition,it must be supported by an express finding that parental custody would be detrimental to the child and that finding must be supported by evidence showing that parental custody would actually harm the child.in re cal d,see also,at.the parental preference doctrine has been codified in family code section,which provides that a court can not award custody to a nonparent unless it finds that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the best interest of the child.
here,the trial court found that removing daniele from the custody would be significantly detrimental to her.although it did not make an explicit separate finding regarding her best interest,it did find that,if guardianship of zachary,supra,th,d were controlling,it would have to grant the guardianship petition.this necessarily implies a finding that leaving her in the custody was in her best interest.indeed,the very finding of detriment also necessarily implies such a finding.see in re zacharia cal th,d,finding of substantial risk of detriment from return to father custody indicated trial court would not have found return to father custody was in child best interests.thus,under statute,it should have granted the guardianship petition.it declined to do so,however,based on kelsey and the constitutional protection afforded the parental relationship of a father with his child in essence,it ruled california guardianship statutes unconstitutional as applied.
the trial court,to its credit,acknowledged that kelsey itself did not decide whether or when a kelsey father is entitled to custody.rather,kelsey stated t he sole question before us is whether petitioner has a right to withhold his consent to the adoption of his biological child.we decide no issue as to the custody of the child if the trial court concludes that petitioner has a right to withhold consent,that decision will bear only on the question of whether the adoption will proceed.even if petitioner has a right to withhold his consent and chooses to prevent the adoption,there will remain the question of the child custody.that question is not before us,and we express no view on it.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court reasoned,however,it would be strange indeed if,having vindicated hi
