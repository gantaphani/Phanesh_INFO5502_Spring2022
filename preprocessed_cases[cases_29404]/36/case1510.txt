these two consolidated cases address hearings conducted on may,and august,and denial of a welfare and institutions code section petition case no,addresses the hearing of may and denial of the section petition.case no.addresses the hearing of august.the juvenile court denied a request by appellant,diana,to contest continued placement of her son,josiah,at the status review hearing of may,conducted pursuant to section.diana had also raised the issue of visitation with her son but the matter was continued,ultimately until the hearing of august,when the court again denied appellant a contested hearing.on may,the juvenile court summarily denied the section petition filed by diana 
section,subdivision e,provides that a parent whose parental rights have not been terminated has the right to contest the issue of continued care.it follows that the juvenile court erred in denying petitioner request for a contested hearing on may.because the issue of visitation addressed at the august hearing was to have originally been heard in connection with the may hearing,we also conclude appellant has a right to a contested hearing on that issue.finally,because appellant section petition addressed similar issues to those raised at the may hearing,we conclude the order summarily denying that petition should also be set aside.
this is the fourth time we revisit this difficult case to address the merits of orders made by the juvenile court.to aid in understanding of this matter,we review the four prior matters.
in the first appeal,we discussed the background giving rise to this case.josiah,born november,was diagnosed as having a number of medical problems scoliosis,a systolic heart murmur,an atrial septal defect,an inguinal hernia and probable gastroesophagal reflux.he suffered from several pulmonary problems,including chronic lung disease.hospitalized since birth,josiah was discharged to the care of appellant at age two months and five days,weighing about nine pounds and on oxygen.
in march,the department of children and family services dcfs was contacted,and it was reported that appellant refused to allow home health care nurses into her home to assess and monitor josiah.
on june,josiah was admitted to northridge hospital for failure to thrive,dehydration and vomiting.when willa olsen,josiah primary care physician,told appellant that josiah was suffering from dehydration,appellant confirmed that josiah had not received fluids for over hours.the dehydration was intensified by the fact that appellant gave josiah a prescribed diuretic the morning of the hospitalization.appellant behavior throughout josiah hospitalization was described as bizarre,manic,hyperverbal.when appellant fed josiah during this hospitalization,he frequently gagged and cried.but when hospital staff fed josiah,it was reported that he fed well.on more than one occasion,appellant attempted to stop,frustrate or intervene during hospital staff feedings of josiah.
dcfs filed a petition pursuant to section,subdivisions b,c,e,g and i.it was alleged that appellant failed to obtain critical medical treatment for her son,failed to schedule cardiology appointments,failed to cooperate with home nurse visits,and demonstrated many emotional problems limiting her ability to care for josiah.on june,josiah was ordered placed in shelter care upon his release from the hospital.appellant was to have monitored visits at least once a week and was allowed to contact the caretakers to inquire about josiah medical needs not more than once a week.josiah was released to foster mother grete,a registered pediatric nurse.
on november,the juvenile court sustained the allegations of the petition.it orally made a finding that appellant bizarre behaviors prevented her from caring for or understanding and cooperating with josiah medical needs,which resulted in willful cruelty being inflicted on josiah.it concluded that if it had been for the intervention of other parties,this minor probably would not be with us today.the court ordered appellant to undergo a psychological evaluation pursuant to evidence code section before addressing dispositional issues.
the psychiatric evaluation was done by ronald fairbanks.he reported that appellant was slow to respond to significant questions and answered them in a calculated manner.he concluded that appellant blamed everyone but herself for josiah problems and that her psychological composition,that is,compulsive histrionic and narcissistic suggest that she is so that she may have a difficult time being a giving parent.he recommended frequent monitored visits of less than four hours and would only recommend reunification if appellant would accept counseling and begin to accept responsibility for some of josiah problems.
on march,appellant moved to reopen her case for the purpose of submitting a letter dated february,written by marvin ament,a professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of gastroenterology and nutrition at the ucla school of medicine.the court granted appellant motion to reopen her case but denied her request to accept the letter into evidence.the court concluded that information in the letter was irrelevant at the dispositional phase of the case,was untimely,and the letter lacked foundation.it then issued its dispositional order finding that josiah was a dependent of the court.it ordered that josiah custody be removed from appellant,reunification services be provided to appellant,and that appellant attend a parent education program and receive individual counseling.it also ordered that necessary medical treatment be afforded to josiah and that appellant could participate in the medical appointments.it granted appellant one visit with josiah each weekend as long as the visit did not conflict with his medical appointments.
in our unpublished opinion of august,no,we affirmed the jurisdictional and dispositional orders of the trial court.
on april,the attorney representing josiah sought a ex parte restraining order against appellant.the application was supported by a letter signed by the minor foster parent,grete v.she complained that on various occasions appellant and appellant parents were hostile and vindictive toward her,that appellant made false accusations about her to the police and others,and that appellant trespassed on her property and took unauthorized photographs.appellant appeared,without counsel,and objected to the application on the ground she was not given proper notice and that the application was supported only by hearsay information.the juvenile court granted the application and entered restraining orders valid for one year against appellant and appellant parents.it set an order to show cause for hearing on june.except for the original letter written by grete,no further evidence was submitted to support the application.on june,at appellant request,the matter was continued to june.on this latter date,the court affirmed the original restraining orders over appellant objection and issued additional restraining orders.these orders were the subject of the second appeal,no.
we reversed the restraining orders finding that the application was void because it was supported only by a conclusory,argumentative,handwritten letter,not signed under oath,and containing few evidentiary facts.
on october,family reunification services were terminated and josiah was ordered into a permanent plan of foster care.he was placed in a confidential medical foster home in riverside county.in unpublished opinion no,filed may,we affirmed the juvenile court order terminating reunification services and providing for foster care for josiah.
the fourth appeal was in case no.seeking review of orders made by the juvenile court on may.the issue addressed on appeal was violation of appellant due process rights she had been expelled from the courtroom at the beginning of the hearing.we quote from a portion of our unpublished opinion for further background 
the hearing at issue was scheduled to address three matters review of the permanent plan previously adopted extension of an order restraining appellant from interfering with the caretakers of josiah and appellant counsel motion to be relieved as counsel for appellant.we quote verbatim from the first two and pages of the reporter transcript to set up our discussion

cushing it on the record,s.thank you.
the court get out of this courtroom.
the mother i have a right to speak.this is slander.and i have a right to address the court.
the mother exited the courtroom.
the proceedings then went forward without any participation by appellant.at no time did the presiding officer return appellant to the courtroom to address the court,as she had requested.
after appellant ejection,the court first addressed the plan and ordered that it be continued with all previous orders in full force and effect.it then granted the request to extend the restraining order.finally,the court denied counsel request to be relieved as appellant counsel.in doing so,the court identified one of the obvious problems with the request was that it would allow appellant to proceed in pro per.it noted based upon outbursts in this court and the outburst today in this court by the mother,it would be impossible for this court to proceed in that manner.it simply would not be appropriate under the circumstances because you just wo be able to get the business of this case done with her representing herself.opinion no.
we reversed the orders of the juvenile court.because we face a similar issue in the two consolidated appeals before us now,we quote from our discussion in that opinion 
the result in this case is dictated by appellant ejection from the courtroom,after which she was given no right to address the court.

presiding judicial officers have great power to enforce order in their presence and to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings.code civ,subd.a.but that power is not absolute.it is subject to review for abuse of discretion.people miller d,cert,appeal dismissed,d.
we understand and can sympathize with the trial court regarding the fact that appellant can be difficult at times.but the record does not demonstrate that appellant conduct at this hearing was improper.she merely wanted to address the court herself.this is especially significant in light of the fact that appellant counsel had moved to be relieved and had not been able to have a meaningful conversation with appellant to understand appellant position on each of the issues then before the court.excluding appellant from the courtroom left her without any effective advocate in the courtroom.opinion.
we turn now to the facts leading up to these consolidated appeals.
on january,the court entered an order permitting appellant to visit the minor twice a month at a setting.the trial court stated that if two consecutive visits were missed,all visits would cease until the next court date.two consecutive visits were missed and dcfs took the position that appellant had forfeited her right to visitation until the next hearing date of april.
dcfs filed a status review report for a review hearing scheduled for april.it reflected that josiah had been removed from his prior placement and had been placed in a new foster home because of what was termed appellant continued inappropriate behavior.the prior foster mother informed the social worker that she would have liked to adopt josiah,but that she feared for her safety if she were to do so.it noted that josiah had thrived since placement with the new foster parents.the report also stated that josiah placement into a special education program had been delayed approximately three months because of reported difficulties involving lack of appellant cooperation in the process.because of these problems,on april,the court had ordered appellant educational rights with regard to josiah be limited and that the school district appoint an educational surrogate on behalf of josiah.included with this report was one from nurse vicki carrera discussing josiah medical condition and treatment.
on april,the juvenile court continued the matter,including the no visitation order,to may for a contested hearing.
dcfs filed a motion,which was set for hearing on may,seeking to limit appellant parental involvement in josiah education and educational planning.the motion was supported by a declaration of school psychologist darlene listing problems she had in attempting to deal with appellant.
on may,appellant told the court that she had not received the report prepared by dcfs for the april hearing.she was concerned that she may have lost the opportunity to bring in new evidence or file a section petition.appellant trial attorney objected to the findings in the april report and requested that appellant be allowed an evidentiary hearing.the juvenile court denied the request,telling appellant it intended only to continue the plan of foster care.it further stated i f there a change and your parental rights were proposed to be terminated,you would have the opportunity to present your evidence at that hearing.the juvenile court ordered that foster care remain as the permanent plan and continued the motion filed by dcfs to june.appellant apparently received a copy of the april report at this hearing.
on may,appellant filed a section petition seeking modification of the juvenile court jurisdiction and disposition orders,and requesting the return of josiah to her custody.she also asked the court to make an order allowing her to have her own medical expert examine josiah and to review all medical records from foster care.she argued that the report of nurse carrera,referenced in the april dcfs report,established that josiah was continuing to have problems similar to when he was in appellant custody.she argued this was new evidence which supported her position that it was not her care,or lack thereof,which threatened josiah.as additional support,she relied upon the letter from ament she had previously proffered to the court.she stated that ament had concluded that josiah failure to thrive was caused by his chronic lung disease and the minor heart condition.she acknowledged that her prior proffer of this evidence was rejected at the dispositional hearing as untimely,but maintained it was still the truth and that rejection of ament report was caused by her ineffective assistance.she asserted that other medical experts backed up ament evaluation of josiah failure to thrive as organic in nature.she also claimed that josiah had suffered detriment while in the protective custody of dcfs and that josiah best interests would be served by his return to her custody.
on may,without giving any factual reason for its decision,the court summarily denied appellant section petition.
dcfs filed an interim review report for the hearing of june.it addressed a visitation which had taken place on june,at a mcdonald restaurant in moreno valley.based on factual information contained in the report about what occurred during the visitation,dcfs recommended that appellant be allowed no more than one hourly monitored visitation per month.
appellant filed a written objection to the june report and recommendation along with a declaration from her father,who had accompanied her on the visitation,challenging and contradicting the facts set out in the dcfs report.
the june hearing was continued to august.the court made an interim order limiting monitored visitation to once a month for two hours with dcfs trying to facilitate visitation for weekends.
dcfs filed an interim review report for the august hearing.it set out further problems relating to visitation and contact with appellant that had occurred since june.the report noted that josiah continued to receive excellent care in his foster home.it also opined that appellant behavior over the past month is a continuation of her refusal to cooperate with csw children social worker attempts to arrange visitation appellant difficult behavior has been consistent during the fourteen months this csw has carried this case appellant behavior is not consistent with that of a parent who is sincerely interested in visiting her child,nor is it consistent with a parent whose primary focus is the overall over her child,as was evident during her visit with josiah on this csw feels that it would be in the best interest of the child if appellant visitation rights be rescinded until the next scheduled hearing of.the report recommended that the matter be continued to november,for a judicial review hearing and a dcfs report to reassess josiah adoptability.
appellant counsel requested a contested hearing on the contents of the june report.the court denied the request stating it was going to receive appellant documents into evidence.it then stated it would continue the prior existing visitation order in full force and effect.at this point appellant spoke up i did not see my son.they cancelled the visits.and your visitation order of once a has not been complied.and i sorry for interrupting,but nobody seems to care that this is a child that also has a right to visitation.i have seen him once in the last eight months.italics added.the court replied and you know what once again you losing sight of the big picture.you have to make it happen.there was an effort to give you the weekend visits that i ordered and because,i guess,of a desire that you must control it and you must dictate the details,it did happen.but nevertheless,i am not going to restrict the visits any further.they are to continue.italics added.
appellant filed a notice of appeal in case no.on june.she filed a notice of appeal in case no.on august.we consolidated the matters for hearing.
discussion 
the planning review hearing of may 
respondent filed a motion to dismiss appeal no.on the ground that at later hearings the juvenile court afforded appellant an opportunity to participate in contested hearings.we denied the motion for two reasons it was not clear from the motion whether the later hearings addressed the same issues appellant desired to address on may and we felt the need to address what we perceive to be ongoing problems between the juvenile court and appellant.we conclude that the issue is not moot,especially in light of the court denial of a contested hearing on august.
section addresses the subject of planning reviews.specifically,subdivisions d and e are pertinent here.subdivision d states if the child is in a placement other than the home of a legal guardian and jurisdiction has not been dismissed,the status of the child shall be reviewed at least every six months the court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.
subdivision e of section generally requires that in conducting the review pursuant to subdivision d,the court address multiple factors concerning the welfare of the child,including the appropriateness of the placement,the parent progress toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating foster care,and the likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home,placed for adoption,legal guardianship,or in another planned permanent living arrangement.subdivision e also provides unless their parental rights have been permanently terminated,the parent or parents of the child are entitled to receive notice of,and participate in,those hearings.it shall be presumed that continued care is in the best interests of the child,unless the parent or parents prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.in those cases,the court may order that further reunification services to return the child to a safe home environment be provided to the parent or parents for a period not to exceed six months.italics added.
the right of a parent to a contested hearing at the postpermanency planning review was affirmed in in re kelly th,d.there,the father of the minor requested a contested hearing on the issue of visitation.the trial court denied the request and reduced the father visitation rights.the court of appeal reversed and remanded the matter with direction that the juvenile court conduct a contested hearing.
specifically addressing the language of section,subdivision e,the court states 
as appellant has argued,subdivision e of section expressly entitles the parents of a minor in foster care to notice of and participation in the status review hearing.notice of that hearing must include notice to the parent of any proposed departmental modifications to existing juvenile court orders.moreover,to participate in the hearing connotes involvement as a party to the proceeding,one essential aspect of which is the reasonable expectation that parents could challenge departmental proposals and proposed court modifications.
it is true that,by the time the juvenile court conducts a status review hearing,the minor is in a placement other than with the parents.however,that situation is not necessarily a permanent one.as subdivision e provides,a parent has the opportunity to demonstrate that additional efforts at reunification will promote the best interests of the minor.in such a case,the court may order further reunification services for the parent,subd.e.thus,it is possible that parent and child could be reunited.in re kelly,supra,th at,d.
the court then turned to the concern,apparently expressed by the human services department,that allowing contested hearings may bog down the dependency process.review hearings are
