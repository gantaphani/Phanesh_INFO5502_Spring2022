this appeal arises from the trial court denial of a petition by the appellants grandparents for a probate guardianship over appellants.family code section prohibits a court from granting custody of a minor to a person who is not the child parent and over the parent objection without first finding that granting custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child and granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the child best interest,subd.a.detriment to the child must be supported by clear and convincing evidence,subd.b.
however,family code section provides an alternative way to establish detriment to the child.detriment to the child also includes the harm of removing the child from his stable placement with a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of the child parent and has fulfilled the child physical and psychological needs for care and affection,and has done so for a substantial period of time,subd.c.if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person to whom custody may be given is such a person,that finding establishes a rebuttable presumption that custody of the child with that nonparent is in the child best interest and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child,subd.d.
in denying the grandparents petition for guardianship of the children,that is,the appellants,the trial court determined the grandparents did not qualify for the stable placement rebuttable presumption because appellants had not been abandoned to the grandparents,a prerequisite of the statute,according to the trial court.it also determined the grandparents did not show by clear and convincing evidence that custody with them was in appellants best interest and custody with the parent would be detrimental.
the appellants claim the trial court ruling is a misinterpretation of law,and its conclusion of no detriment an abuse of discretion.we agree the trial court has misinterpreted the stable placement provision,and we reverse and remand on that basis.the stable placement provision of family code section is not dependent on the child first being abandoned with the nonparent.
family history 
objector ann marie vaughan and her former husband,evan vaughan,met as teens.they were together off and on for approximately six years prior to their marriage in.during that time,two children,appellants here,were born to them son avery in and daughter honey bear in.the family lived in many locations,including weaverville and hyampom in trinity county,humboldt county,and hawaii.at times,they lived a existence,often living in a tent in the woods without visible means of support and with no electricity or modern conveniences.evan suffers from bipolar disorder.
there is a significant history of domestic violence between ann marie and evan.in,evan was convicted of misdemeanor cohabitant abuse.after his arrest for that crime,he and ann marie separated,then reconciled and married.later that year,however,evan was charged with more than felony counts of kidnapping,spousal rape,and assault against ann marie,as well as child endangerment.ann marie claimed the children witnessed the attack.
ann marie filed for dissolution of marriage from evan after the incident and moved to humboldt county.she obtained sole legal and physical custody of the children.over the next two years,she moved the family a number of times.
during,she and the children participated in therapy with a licensed clinical social worker,teri vodden.ann marie sought the therapy,known as parent child interaction therapy pcit,to address behavioral issues in avery.vodden also treated the children for stress caused by witnessing the violence ostensibly perpetrated by their father on their mother.
also in,ann marie was diagnosed as having stress disorder ptsd and affective personality disorder.it was also noted in her medical records that she had mild substance abuse problems.she chose not to undergo treatment for any of these problems.
while ann marie had sole custody of the children,evan mother and stepfather,petitioners patti jeanne hereafter patti and mark stuart,were granted supervised visitations with the children as part of the dissolution proceeding.the visitations,however,were not consistent in part because ann marie did not always take the children to the visits.ann marie grew increasingly distrustful of the stuarts and their motives.she ultimately obtained a restraining order against them.she believed they were stalking her and the children,and that they had an unfavorable attitude towards her because of the criminal charges she raised against their son.she also was registered with a program of the california secretary of state known as safe at home,through which she was applying to change her and the children family name for safety reasons.
in early,evan was acquitted of all charges against him except for misdemeanor counts of assault and battery.the acquittal was very difficult for ann marie to accept.she became anxious and fearful,and she decided she needed help.on february,she checked herself into a mental health facility.but before doing so,she arranged through a friend of hers and coworkers of petitioner patti stuart to have patti pick up the children.she thought she was going to need only a few days to feel better,and thus assumed patti would have the children only for that time and then bring them back to her.once the children were with the stuarts,ann marie checked herself in.
the mental health center determined ann marie qualified for an involuntary hold under welfare and institutions code section,but she had gone there voluntarily and her stay was documented as such.she was diagnosed with ptsd and a major depressive disorder.however,she checked herself out of the facility the following day,february,against medical advice.doctors were concerned because she had refused medication,she had a poor understanding of her illness,and she had not previously received psychiatric help or treatment.
but on the next day,february,she again checked herself in and was admitted as a voluntary.she tested positive for marijuana and an opiate.she admitted smoking marijuana,for which she had a doctor recommendation,but denied taking an opiate.this time she was diagnosed with ptsd and panic disorder.at discharge,she accepted medication and agreed to seek ongoing treatment.
petition for guardianship 
meanwhile,on february,the day after they received avery and honey bear,the stuarts filed a request for,and were granted temporary custody of the children.on april,they filed petitions for guardianship and temporary guardianship.they alleged guardianship was necessary because both ann marie and evan were unsuitable to be custodial parents.they claimed ann marie has untreated mental health needs that have led to violent mood swings,substance abuse,and cruelty toward the children.the also claimed evan had a prolonged separation from the children due to his incarceration pending his trial,lack of means of support,and mental health difficulties which rendered him unsuitable as a custodial parent at that time.ann marie opposed the guardianship.
temporary guardianship was granted on may.the matter next came up for hearing on june.the hearing was continued and held intermittently from then through may.during that time,the stuarts maintained custody of the children as temporary guardians.
the court received testimony from ann marie and the stuarts.the court also received oral and written testimony from court investigators and mediators,and and private mental health professionals.
in her testimony,ann marie acknowledged she suffers from ptsd,and she admitted using marijuana pursuant to a medical recommendation to alleviate the symptoms of her disorder.she stated her disorder had no effect on her ability to care for her children.she also was actively in therapy.
ann marie stated avery was having behavior problems when she separated from her husband.however,the pcit therapy had been very effective,and avery had become less aggressive with his sister and had developed a clearer idea of physical boundaries.avery was very nice to honey bear,was a good big brother,and looked out for her.
patti stuart testified she has worked as a teacher for years,the last of which as a special education teacher.she stated the children were doing well in the stuarts care.both children were involved in preschool and sports activities,and avery had begun taking guitar lessons.patti and her husband mark were able to spend time with the children,as she had reduced her work schedule to three days a week and mark worked only from august to october.he operated a water truck business for servicing wildfires.
patti had concerns about avery behavior when he first moved into her home.avery wanted to everybody and used his toys to kill.he also asked mark and patti to check on him every two minutes while he slept.these characteristics had subsided by the time of trial,and avery seemed more comfortable.
patti also noticed avery constantly attempted to protect and physically care for his younger sister,honey bear.patti referred to this as parentification,something she had seen in her years of teaching.this behavior by avery had subsided somewhat,but he still felt it was his job to take care of honey bear and believed she was not safe unless he was taking care of her.
patti stated that when ann marie asked her and mark,patti husband,to take the children when she checked herself into a mental health facility in february,she did not tell them how long she wanted them to care for the children.patti said they had no idea how long it would be.patti described ann marie request as a miracle,since ann marie had denied them visitation as much as possible over the preceding two years.
mark stuart testified at the hearing,and his testimony was consistent with his wife patti testimony.
kathy anthonijsz is a trial court investigator who investigated the stuarts petition for guardianship.she recommended the petition be granted.she voiced concern over ann marie and evan emotional stability.although ann marie appeared to be making progress,the children had just recently begun to feel safe and cared for in the custody of the stuarts.the stuarts had also been taking the children to therapy for several months,and to remove avery from his therapist and community support system would likely be detrimental to his emotional well being.the children appeared healthy and happy,and the stuarts interacted appropriately with them.
sylvia green,a court mediator in the dissolution proceeding between ann marie and evan,recommended the children be placed in the care of the stuarts.from her investigation,it appeared the stuarts focus had been the children well being.it was apparent to green that ann marie had been traumatized in her life,and her judgment had been severely lacking.her continual habit of moving from place to place,her inconsistent stability and her recent hospitalization all caused undue stress and disruption to the children.ann marie had,however,participated in supervised visitation since the stuarts gained custody and by all reports demonstrated good parenting skills.
carol kramer,a clinical psychologist,was appointed by the court to assist in the custody determination.kramer concluded it was in the children best interest to remain in the care of the stuarts.she diagnosed ann marie as having generalized anxiety disorder,ptsd,and obsessive compulsive personality disorder with histrionic and paranoid personality features.much of these problems could be traced to ann marie childhood,described by kramer as a fairly impoverished,psychologically,emotionally and materially,childhood.
kramer testified that avery suffered from privation,that of not having had safe,nurturing,supportive parenting.privation explained avery assertive and unsafe behavior.that this behavior had improved during the time he lived with the stuarts suggested avery responded well to the structure they provided.
kramer explained her custody recommendation g iven that avery particularly needs a fair amount of remedial,restorative kind of plotting,concerned,consistent action through mental health counseling,i believe that the children are better off with the paternal grandparents the stuarts.and i in part believing that according to the guidelines,i believe ann marie falls into the category of a person who is in very high conflict a portion of the time in interrelationships,particularly with the family.
kramer stated if the children were returned to ann marie,we would see a perpetuation of the kinds of issues that avery displays at the moment.in her opinion,without a very tight structure around him,avery would begin to display symptoms of conduct disorder by the age of eight to years old.
when asked if her opinion would be different if there was a change of circumstances involving ann marie,kramer said i have no doubt that ann marie is undeniably interested in these kids and that she loves them.so if there were a tight arrangement indicating that ann marie would pursue the type of mental health that would allow her to accept that coming out of her own childhood she has certain deficits in terms of structure and function,in terms of her personality,and she understood the ways in which that could impact her impact on other people,she came to understand some of that and she had some courses in parenting that would allow her to have the skills to be present,then i think that she could take care of the kids.
deborah klein is a trinity county mental health clinician and the children therapist while they stayed with the stuarts.she recommended the children not be returned to the lifestyle from which they came.it was that lifestyle that was driving the children emotional instability.avery acted out in play therapy in a way that was rough and unsafe.he could not control himself so as not to risk harm to himself or others.in her opinion,this resulted from avery not receiving proper discipline and care and not having his basic needs met since a very early age.
avery also was in the habit of parenting honey bear,a behavior that occurred because no one else was being a parent.klein believed avery was responding to therapy,but it would be a long process to change behavior he had learned at a very early age.
david wilson,a clinical psychologist,was appointed by the court to make an assessment of the proposed guardianship.he was selected because he had no prior knowledge of any of the parties or of the dispute.his investigation was limited to reviewing the petition for guardianship and interviewing ann marie,the stuarts,and the children.
in his written report,wilson concluded there would be some detriment to the children if they were returned to ann marie at this time.ann marie has significant emotional and mental health problems associated with her ptsd that are likely to interfere with her ability to be fully present for her children and provide for their care.there are also indications she has personality disorder problems arising from her upbringing that make it difficult for her to establish and maintain stability in her life and provide a safe,secure,and nurturing environment for her children.
however,wilson noted ann marie had been taking steps to put her life together.she was in individual therapy with marriage and family therapist jennifer merrill,she was awarded disability benefits that provide her with a minimum income,she had secured stable housing,and she was not involved in a relationship with a man.she also claimed she had quit using marijuana.
from this,wilson concluded ann marie has made substantial progress toward resolving her emotional and mental health problems.she is just not quite there yet.he proposed the matter be resolved through a family unification plan,instead of a guardianship,that would ultimately result in ann marie gaining custody of her children.
at the hearing,wilson backed off his diagnosis somewhat.after writing his report,he spoke with ann marie therapist,jennifer merrill.merrill did not diagnose ann marie with personality disorder.wilson said he would defer to merrill opinion,as she knew ann marie far better than he.
nevertheless,wilson continued to believe it would be detrimental to the children if they were returned to ann marie custody.at the time he saw ann marie,she had not visited the children for two months.such an abrupt change would not be good for the children.he also continued to believe she needed to work on her ptsd so she could better care for the children.
wilson did not believe ann marie disorder was equivalent to that found in a child welfare case,where there is endangerment of the children by negligent sic or abuse or such as that,but more applied to the term detriment in the sense of harm.
the court asked wilson how many parents who are presently caring for their children were in a worse condition than ann marie.wilson replied that based on his years of experience serving on the welfare team in shasta county that staffs all cases of child neglect and abuse,ann marie had never really met that threshold that would come before his team to sustain a charge of neglect or abuse.
the court stated all parties would agree the children were better off and were thriving in the stuarts home.the real question before it,however,was whether there would be any harm to the children if they were returned to ann marie that day.wilson said he would hope there would be an orderly transition,b ut as far as would the children be in danger if returned to their mother,being neglected or abused,i do think so.
trial court decision 
by written judgment dated august,the trial court denied the stuarts petition for guardianship.it first determined the stuarts did not qualify for guardianship under the stable placement provisions of family code section,subdivision c.it agreed the stuarts had provided a stable environment and had assumed the role of parent on a basis for a substantial period of time.however,it interpreted subdivision c as applying only when the parents abandon their children with family or friends for a lengthy period of time and then years later file an action to have the de facto parents return the children.the court ruled this was not such a case,and thus the stuarts could not come within the meaning of subdivision c.
the court next determined the stuarts had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that returning the children to ann marie would be detrimental to them,part of the showing required under family code section to grant custody to a nonparent when not proceeding under the stable placement provision.it did not give credence to kramer and klein testimony claiming there would be detriment,particularly to avery,if the children were returned.it relied on ann marie testimony and that of her friend that while avery was in ann marie custody,he did not exhibit the anxiety,parentification,or violent play reported by the experts and by the stuarts,and that he was an young boy.
the court also relied on wilson opinion that,in essence,had this been a child protective services matter,there was not sufficient detriment to the children to justify removing them from ann marie.the court acknowledged that comparing the issues and standards between probate guardianships and dependency matters could be argued as comparing apples and oranges,but it nonetheless found a certain appeal to wilson opinion when viewing this matter as a dependency action.
the children appeal from the trial court judgment.they argue the court abused its discretion by determining the stable placement provision of family code section,subdivision c,required a showing that the children had been abandoned to the stuarts before it applied and determining the lack of detriment to the children by relying on ann marie fitness rather than harm to the children,on an unsubstantiated finding that avery had no problem behaviors,and on wilson opinion that the level of detriment to the children if returned to ann marie did not rise to the level of detriment in a dependency case.
discussion 
istandard of review 
the resolution of a legal dispute involves three steps establishing the facts determining the applicable law and applying the law to the facts.guardianship of th,d.the first step,determining the relevant facts,is committed to the trier of the facts and is reviewed on appeal with deference to the factfinder decision by applying the venerable substantial evidence test.citations.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the trial court decision,resolving all conflicts in the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in support of that court findings.citation.in short,we review the evidence but do not weigh it we defer to the trial court findings to the extent they are supported by substantial evidence.citations.ibid.
with respect to the second step in the resolution process,determining the applicable law,we independently review all issues of law raised by the parties.guardianship of,supra,th at,d.
the third step,applying the law to the facts,is reviewed in this circumstance under the deferential clearly erroneous standard of review.guardianship of,supra,th at,d.the issue of custody is one committed to the discretion of the trial court.citations.only in an exceptional case,in which the record so strongly supported a party claim to custody that a denial of that claim by the trial court would constitute an abuse of discretion may an appellate court itself decide who should be granted custody in re cal d,see,subd.b.
the children first ground of appeal,challenging the trial court interpretation of the stable placement provisions of family code section,subdivision c,although styled as an abuse of discretion argument,in fact raises an argument of law regarding the statute interpretation.we take up that question de novo.
the second ground of appeal,challenging the court determination of a lack of detriment if the children were returned to ann marie,is a challenge to the court discretion.because we reverse on the children first ground of appeal,we need not reach the second.
interpretation and application of family law code section,subdivision c 
the children argue the trial court erred as a matter of law when it determined the stable placement provisions of family code section,subdivision c,did not apply because ann marie had not abandoned the children to the stuarts.they claim the court impermissibly imposed an objective criterion abandonment of the children on its decisionmaking process,contrary to the legislature expressed intent that courts exercise great flexibility in deciding custody matters.this,the children argue,led the court to rely on ann marie intentions,instead of the children best interests,to determine their custody.
we conclude the children are correct.the trial court misapplied the stable placement provisions of family code section,subdivision c.whether the children were abandoned to the stuarts was not a relevant consideration.
legal background 
before proceeding,we recite a recent discussion by our supreme court of the law dealing with probate guardianships.this custodial arrangement originated in the law governing the administration of decedents estates,but it has not been restricted to orphans.long before the advent of the dependency statutes,probate guardianships were instituted when conditions were shown to be such,by reason of the mental and moral limitations or delinquency of parents,that to allow the child to continue in their custody would be to endanger the child permanent welfare.in re imperatrice cal.in such cases,courts recognized that the right of the parent to custody must give way,its preservation being of less importance than the health,safety,morals,and general welfare of the child.imperatrice,at.
after the passage of the juvenile dependency statutes,probate guardianships have continued to provide an alternative placement for children who can not safely remain with their parents.see weisz mccormick,supra,cal.women stud.at.the differences between probate guardianships and dependency proceedings are significant.id.at.probate guardianships are not initiated by the state,but by private parties,typically family members.they do not entail proof of specific statutory grounds demonstrating substantial risk of harm to the child,as is required in dependency proceedings.see welf,guardianship of stephen th,d.unlike dependency cases,they are not regularly supervised by the court and a social services agency.no governmental entity is a party to the pr
