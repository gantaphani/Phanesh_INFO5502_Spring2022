family code section,subdivision a,provides a transmutation of real or personal property is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made,joined in,consented to,or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected.the issues we address in the published portion of this opinion are whether a grant deed signed by a husband transferring his separate property interest in real property to himself and his wife as joint tenants satisfies the express declaration requirement of section,subdivision a and whether an unsigned computer printout,entitled dmv vehicle registration information,reflecting that an automobile,which was previously registered in the husband name alone,was reregistered in the names of the husband or the wife,satisfies the requirements for a valid transmutation under section,subdivision a.we hold that the grant deed in this case satisfied the express declaration requirement of section,subdivision a,since it contained on its face a clear and unambiguous expression of intent to transfer the real property interest.because the subject real property was validly transmuted into property held in joint tenancy,it became the wife separate property upon the husband death and,therefore,was properly excluded from the husband probate estate.we further hold,however,that the dmv printout did not satisfy the requirements for a valid transmutation under the subject statute and,therefore,the automobile should have been included in the probate estate as the husband separate property.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we reject the claim that the husband gift of his separate property jewelry to the wife was invalid under the transmutation writing requirements of section,subdivision a.thus,we reverse the judgment as to the vehicle,but affirm it in all other respects.

discussion 
i.the real property.
relying on estate of macdonald cal d,macdonald,dozier contends that the grant deed purporting to transmute everett separate interest in the berkeley property into an interest owned as joint tenants by everett and evelyn does not satisfy the express declaration requirement of section,subdivision a,because it does not contain language expressly stat ing that the characterization or ownership of the property was being changed.evelyn responds that the real property is presumed to be held in joint tenancy,as described in the grant deed,and,therefore,is excluded from probate under probate code section,subdivision b.
