the trial court dismissed marla harding request for order to show cause for modification of a texas child support order because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the federal full faith and credit for child support orders act ffccsoa,title united states code section,and the complementary state statute,the california uniform interstate family support act,et she argues that the ffccsoa and the state law are unconstitutional because they infringe upon what is traditionally a local issue.she also argues there is insufficient evidence that respondent remains a texas resident for either law to apply and preclude the court from having jurisdiction.we conclude there is no constitutional infirmity and that sufficient evidence supports the trial court determination that respondent is a texas resident.we accordingly affirm.
appellant and respondent were divorced in texas in and appellant was awarded child support for the parties two children.appellant and the children later moved to california.respondent claimed his residence remained in texas,although he also has a residence in missouri,his place of employment.
on july,appellant filed a statement for registration of foreign support order in the los angeles county superior court.in her declaration in support of the statement,appellant declared that respondent last known residence was in texas.in august,appellant filed a motion for modification of child support.
on october,respondent moved to quash and strike petitioner motion for modification of child support with the notation that he was making a special appearance.in support of the motion,respondent declared in writing,i have been a resident of texas continuously since.i am registered to vote in texas,i own a car in texas,my car is registered in texas,i own a home in texas,i pay property taxes in texas,and have not had a primary residence other than in texas since i moved to texas from new jersey in.all of my child and spousal support obligations have been timely paid through a texas wage assignment order.respondent further declared that aside from his children and his former spouse presence in california,respondent has no connections with california.in addition,respondent declared that he has a teenage daughter from a prior marriage who has lived with him in texas for approximately six years,he has a fiancée who lives in texas with him,and all evidence of his income and expenses,as well as his ability to pay support,is in texas or at the missouri headquarters of his employer.
he also filed a declaration from tina mueller,his employer senior relocation coordinator.the declaration states that the employer provided relocation services to employees transferred to jobs increasing their commutes by miles,and the term relocation refers to an employee relocation to a different or new position with the employer.mueller declared that respondent employer records reflect that his address is in texas,and that respondent used the company relocation services to buy a condominium in missouri for his use while in missouri.respondent did not utilize relocation services to sell his residence in texas.
on october,respondent filed a response to appellant original motion to modify and termed it a special appearance.he checked off the portion of the form stating he did not consent to the order requested,and wrote,the court does not have jurisdiction to modify the texas order.
on november,the trial court granted appellant request to conduct discovery on the issue of respondent place of residence.
respondent also propounded discovery but limited it to the issue of his residence which was the key determination in connection with the issue of jurisdiction.
on april,the trial court determined that respondent resides in texas,and not missouri,as contended by appellant.the court found that respondent did not make a general appearance in this matter.all responsive papers filed on behalf of the respondent are marked special appearance.there is no authority to support petitioner contention that the propounding of discovery about the jurisdictional issues in this case will constitute a general appearance.because the court found that the parties older child was conceived in california,the court found sufficient contact between respondent and the state to confer personal jurisdiction over respondent.the court concluded that it therefore may exercise jurisdiction to modify the child support order issued by the state of texas only as to the child who was conceived in this state.the court then set the matter for a status conference for the purpose of setting a hearing on appellant motion to modify support.
respondent filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial to vacate the trial court april order.
on may,after hearing argument on the motion for new trial,the trial court reversed itself.it concluded that respondent is a texas resident registered to vote in texas,has a texas driver license,owns a car which is registered in texas,pays property taxes in texas,has a teenager from a prior marriage who lives with him in texas,has a fiancée who lives with him in texas and has an ez tag account in texas.it also noted that respondent child and spousal support obligations were paid through a texas wage assignment order,and respondent payroll and bank statements and many of his credit card statements were sent to respondent texas address.it concluded that the facts sufficiently support respondent contention that he lives in texas,notwithstanding that he spends time outside of the state of texas,owns property in missouri,and has an office in missouri.based on these findings,it concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under united states code section and under california family code sections et.it entered an order granting respondent motion for a new trial,vacated the portion of its april,order finding that the court had subject matter jurisdiction to modify the parties texas child support order,and dismissed appellant motion to modify child support.
discussion 
the main issue here is the constitutionality of the ffccsoa,which we now address.
subdivision a of united states code section sets forth the general rule that each state shall enforce other states child support orders,and shall not seek or make a modification of such an order except in accordance with subsections e,f,and i.
subdivision e of section authorizes a state court to modify another state child support order if the court has jurisdiction to make such a child support order pursuant to subsection i and a the court of the other state no longer has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction of the child support order because that state no longer is the child state or the residence of any individual contestant or b each individual contestant has filed written consent with the state of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction for a court of another state to modify the order and assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the order.
subdivision f,as applicable,provides if only court has issued a child support order,the order of that court must be recognized.
subdivision i provides if there is no individual contestant or child residing in the issuing state,the party seeking to modify a child support order issued in another state shall register that order in a state with jurisdiction over the nonmovant for the purpose of modification.
also relevant is subdivision d of section,which concerns continuing jurisdiction.this subdivision states a court of a state that has made a child support order consistently with this section has continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the order if the state is the residence of any individual contestant unless the court of another state,acting in accordance with subsections e and f,has made a modification of the order.italics added.
as appellant notes,congress declared in that it was enacting section to deal with the lack of uniformity of child support laws from different states.appellant quotes an excerpt from the congressional findings that the nonuniform laws,among other things,encouraged noncustodial parents to relocate from the states where the original support orders were made,placing a burden on interstate travel and communication and the custodial parent which is time consuming,and disruptive of occupations and commercial activity and results in inequities in child support payment s levels that are based solely on the noncustodial parent choice of residence.appellant argues that the ffccsoa does not consider the contingency here,where the minor children and custodial parent move from the state where the child support order was originally issued and contends that w isdom,therefore,dictates that consideration of these matters should be local rather than national and,indeed,the more local the better.appellant further maintains that the ffccsoa failure to distinguish between the different circumstances that arise when the obligor and the obligee leave the state where the order was originally entered creates such a manifest injustice that it can not withstand constitutional scrutiny.
acknowledging that the constitutionality of the ffccsoa was upheld in kilroy superior court th,d and paton brill ohio app.dist ohio app d,appellant argues these cases should not be followed in light of the more recent decision of united states morrison,d.
relying on united states lopez,d,morrison,upheld a federal appellate court judgment striking down a federal statute as unconstitutional.at.in morrison,a female student at virginia polytechnic institute sued two male students in federal district court,alleging that their assault and repeated rape of her violated united states code section,part of the violence against women act of.id.at.the district court dismissed the female student complaint on the ground that congress lacked authority to enact section under either the commerce clause of the united states constitution or section of the fourteenth amendment.ibid.the court of appeals upheld the district court conclusion that congress lacked constitutional authority to enact the civil remedy of section.id.at.
the united states supreme court explained that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds.united states morrison,supra,at.the court adopted the following holding from lopez where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce,legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.citation.id.at.lopez review of commerce clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity substantial effects on interstate commerce,the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor.id.at.accordingly,since crimes of violence are not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity,section was not justified under the commerce clause.id.at.
the morrison court further held that the statute at issue there could not be considered a constitutional exercise of congress remedial power under section of the fourteenth amendment.united states morrison,supra,at.it explained that section authorizes congress to enforce by appropriate legislation the constitutional guarantee against state deprivation of a person life,liberty,or property,without due process of law and against the denial of a person equal protection of the laws.id.at.the court pointed out that section is not aimed at proscribing discrimination by officials which the fourteenth amendment might not itself proscribe it is directed not at any state or state actor,but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.id.at.accordingly,congress power under does not extend to the enactment of.id.at.
lopez held that congress exceeded its authority to regulate commerce in enacting the school zones act of,united states code section,subdivision q a.this statute made it a federal offense for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows,or has reasonable cause to believe,is a school zone.citation.the act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.united states lopez,supra,at.section q is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms.section q is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.it can not,therefore,be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,which viewed in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.id.at,fn.omitted.
unlike the ffccsoa,the federal law at issue in morrison concerned a crime between people in the same state,and thus clearly did not involve commerce across state lines.in contrast,the ffccsoa concerns child support payments ordered in one state and sent to another state therefore,by its very nature it concerns a regulated activity which substantially affects interstate commerce.
we agree with respondent that kilroy is on point.the respondent there sought to restrain the california trial court from proceeding with a hearing on an order to show cause concerning a potential modification of a georgia child support decree.kilroy superior court,supra,th at,d.the appellate court agreed with the respondent that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the support order because of the ffccsoa.ibid.the respondent former spouse,who sought to modify the child support order in california,argued that the ffccsoa is unconstitutional because it can not be sustained as a congressional regulation of interstate commerce and it is an improper federal command to state government.id.at,d.in contrast to the facts in lopez,supra,the kilroy court held that s upport payments between parents in different states substantially affects interstate commerce.to begin with,such regular transfers of money between residents for purposes of supporting children in different states involves interstate commerce further,we conclude child support payments is economic activity which substantially affects interstate commerce.id.at,d,italics in original.in enacting the full faith and credit for child support act,the congress found that the lack of uniformity caused the following impacts noncustodial parents were thereby encouraged to move to another state the movement of noncustodial parents increased interstate travel and communication that was necessary to secure enforcement of child support orders the increased time and expenses involved in securing enforcement of support orders were disruptive of occupations and commercial activity the movement of noncustodial parents to a new state has resulted in massive arrearages nationwide there was an ongoing avoidance of child support obligations by noncustodial parents there was the resulting excessive relitigation of child support orders the excessive relitigation resulted in conflicting orders,confusion,a waste of judicial resources,and loss of public confidence in the courts the deprivation of liberty and property without due process of law and burdens on commerce among the states.citation.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
like appellant,the in kilroy argued that the ffccsoa violates the tenth amendment of the united states constitution.kilroy superior court,supra,th at,d.the tenth amendment of the united states constitution states,the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the states,are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people.at the outset,we note that the united states supreme court has only invalidated federal laws because they are invasive of reserved state powers on the rarest of occasions.id.at,d.u nder the supremacy clause,insofar as the full faith and credit for child support orders act requires california to give deference to the georgia order,there is no violation of the tenth amendment.this we conclude is particularly true given the fact that the authority to adopt general laws which enforce full faith and credit of state court judgments is a specified power of the congress.id.at,d.becaus
