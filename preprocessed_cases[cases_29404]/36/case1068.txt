as a result of devastating brain injuries allegedly inflicted nonaccidentally on cyrus,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed dependency petitions in the juvenile court on behalf of cyrus and his sister,jenna n.after the detention hearing,but before cyrus was adjudged a dependent of the court,the medical professionals treating cyrus recommended the court authorize removal of his temporary breathing tube and issue a do not attempt resuscitation dnar order in the event cyrus was unable to breathe on his own.following a noticed hearing,and over the objections of cyrus parents,the court issued both orders.
we conclude the court had the authority to issue an order permitting removal of the breathing tube because a dependency petition had been filed,the evidence showed the treatment was medically necessary and the court properly balanced cyrus interests against those of his parents.however,we further conclude the court had no authority to issue a dnar order because cyrus had not been adjudged a dependent and the court had not conducted a full evidentiary hearing at which it made findings by clear and convincing evidence.absent true findings made at a jurisdiction hearing,the court authority was limited to ordering medical care that would sustain or improve cyrus condition and did not extend to decisions to withdraw or withhold life sustaining medical treatment.

although the parents were informed cyrus brain injuries were,they arrived at children hospital between one and two hours after cyrus arrived by ambulance,saying they got lost.when national city police detectives took home for an interview and reenactment of the incident later that day,they noticed the apartment smelled strongly of cleaning solution and appeared to have just been cleaned.the police arrested on charges of felony child abuse,who was at work when cyrus injuries occurred,refuses to believe caused cyrus injuries.posted bail for and she has returned to the family home.the district attorney has filed felony child abuse charges against

on september,a hospital bioethics consultation team,consisting of a doctor,nurse and social worker,met with the parents regarding cyrus medical treatment plan.the consultation report noted cyrus was neurologically devastated with no reasonable hope of returning to normal or his previous level of functioning.the team reported cyrus existence has become a one,not a biographical one,in that he lacks current and projected social interpersonal relationships and intellectual life consciousness and interaction spheres of living.in the team opinion,curative options had been exhausted and further medical treatment offered no benefit to cyrus other than sustaining his organic life.the team recommended against medical treatment,which would require frequent and invasive procedures for the rest of cyrus life.the parents,however,want ongoing efforts for cyrus because they hope he may survive on his own and have a miraculous recovery.the team recommended appointment of a guardian ad litem for medical decisions medical guardian based on the parents potential conflict of interest and their inability to make decisions in cyrus best interests.
at the request of counsel appointed for cyrus in the dependency proceeding,the court heard argument on the appointment of a medical guardian.the parents received notice of the hearing and were present with counsel.the court denied request for a contested hearing,suspended the parents rights to make medical decisions for cyrus and directed a medical guardian be appointed.
on october,the date set for the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the court entertained the medical guardian requests for an order to remove cyrus breathing tube and issuance of a dnar directive the evidence before the court consisted of the medical guardian report,her points and authorities supporting her requests for the court orders,the hospital bioethics consultation report and several medical reports,including results of a recent brain scan.the medical guardian stated cyrus brain function continues to deteriorate.she explained cyrus doctors recommend removing his temporary breathing tube because of the physical discomfort and risk of infection from having the tube remain in place.she further reported cyrus had been medically ready for removal of the temporary breathing tube for more than two weeks,and the doctors believed there is a very high likelihood cyrus will breathe independently if extubated.however,because there is a possibility cyrus will not breathe independently,the doctors will not remove the breathing tube without a medical directive regarding resuscitation efforts.consequently,the medical guardian argued,it was in cyrus best interests for the court to authorize a dnar order in conjunction with removal of the breathing tube.cyrus counsel and agency agreed with the medical guardian position.the parents,who were present with counsel,opposed the requests without submitting any evidence.they argued the court could not make the requested orders because cyrus had not yet been adjudged a dependent.
after considering the documentary evidence presented and hearing argument of counsel,the court granted the medical guardian requests for an order allowing extubation and a dnar directive.it found an order allowing extubation was medically necessary and in cyrus best interests and further found a dnar directive was in cyrus best interests.the court set an evidentiary hearing for october to address any further medical issues,including the status of cyrus medical condition following extubation and whether to continue the dnar order.the court issued a stay of its orders to allow a writ petition to be filed,and set a contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing for november and.
