a mother appeals from orders terminating her parental rights and denying a welfare and institutions code section petition seeking reinstatement of family reunification services based on the juvenile court failure to enforce a visitation order,and effectively delegating sole discretion over visitation to her estranged son.we conclude the juvenile court erroneously abdicated its authority by delegating discretion over visitation to a third party,and abused its discretion in denying the section petition seeking to rectify that error.for that reason,the orders terminating parental rights and denying the petition are reversed.
factual and procedural background 
in november,a dependency petition was filed regarding hunter his mother,appellant charmaine,had been fighting with her boyfriend when she saw police officers and fled,leaving hunter alone and without provisions in a filthy hotel room.in february,the petition was sustained on one count each of domestic violence and an unsafe home environment,subd.b.hunter was placed with his maternal grandmother,and his parents were given reunification services 
charmaine made substantial progress and,in may,hunter was returned to her care.the progress was.in june,charmaine was incarcerated on charges of felony conspiracy and receiving stolen property.hunter remained with his maternal grandmother.respondent department of children and family services dcfs reinstituted reunification services while charmaine was incarcerated.charmaine and hunter maintained contact while she was in prison.during the period hunter lived with his maternal grandmother,charmaine and hunter maintained the loving close relationship they had shared since hunter birth.
in november,hunter maternal grandmother told dcfs she could no longer care for him.hunter was placed with his paternal grandmother,dyan,where he remains.charmaine continued communicating with hunter through monthly letters,which he enjoyed receiving.
charmaine complied with her case plan and completed a number of programs while in prison.however,by may,the juvenile court found the maximum period for reunification services had expired,and charmaine remained unable to care for hunter due to her incarceration.charmaine was released from prison in july,and began living in a rehabilitation center where she was required to stay for a year.hunter spoke with charmaine a few times on the phone after her release,but began refusing to accept her calls.while he still enjoyed receiving his mother letters,he did not write back.hunter was in individual counseling at that time.he told his therapist he did not miss his parents and felt safe and comfortable living with his paternal grandmother.hunter was angry with charmaine for breaking so many promises to him,and was tired of her lying to him.he was afraid he would be exposed to more abuse and neglect if his mother took him to live with her.reunification services were terminated in july,and a section hearing was scheduled.the court ordered dcfs to set up visitation for charmaine as can be arranged through her program.
with charmaine consent,dyan was appointed hunter legal guardian at the selection and implementation hearing in october.hunter was still participating in individual therapy,but continued to refuse to speak with or write his mother.hunter also refused to visit her,despite efforts by dcfs,his paternal relatives and his therapist to get him to do so.hunter was upset with his mother who lied and asked him too many questions.he consistently told dcfs i do want to see her,nobody can make me do something i do want to do.hunter was adamant he did not want to live with charmaine.
over the course of the next few months,charmaine remained sober and employed,and made every effort to remain stable and productive.she persevered in her efforts to visit hunter,who refused almost all contact with her.for a planning hearing in late april,dcfs reported hunter was still angry at charmaine because of what she did,and was not interested in having any relationship with his mother.hunter therapist,whom the child had seen for individual counseling sessions since april,told dcfs he simply did not want to have visits with his mother.she said hunter felt safe and protected by his grandmother,and was afraid he would lose the stability he has gained and was not willing to risk his safety.hunter mostly refused even to speak about his mother.however,in one session in which he was asked about charmaine,he lashed out at the therapist in an uncharacteristic and extremely angry manner.the therapist opined that hunter reaction was triggered by trauma he had suffered living with charmaine.hunter also refused to attend joint therapy with charmaine.in all other respects,hunter was thriving in his grandmother care.he said he loved dyan and wanted to be sure she would permanently care for him.hunter told dcfs he was afraid charmaine would try to take him back to live with her,and he had nothing but bad memories of life with his mother.dcfs reported dyan was willing to pursue adoption.
at the april hearing,charmaine attorney informed the court charmaine had not seen her son in about months and wanted to visit him in a therapeutic or any other setting.hunter attorney assured the court his client refusal to visit with charmaine was not coming from someone else,and requested the court take it slow with regard to visitation.the court noted it had a visitation order in place,but said that as a practical matter we certainly not going to force a child who is just absolutely refusing to visit.the court ordered dcfs to discuss the matter with hunter therapist in an attempt to move the issue forward at an appropriate pace,so joint counseling could take place.the court noted it may well be that at some point we have to just move forward with the visitation,not leave it in hunter hands.however,the court declared it was not yet inclined to put that pressure on hunter.
the next review hearing was held in late october.charmaine had continued to pursue her efforts to visit talk to her son.hunter,however,remained resolute.he steadfastly refused all contact with his mother,repeatedly telling dcfs he never wants to see or talk to her again he refused to accept gifts charmaine sent him,saying he did want anything from his mother except for her to leave him alone.in other respects,hunter was doing quite well.he was performing above his grade level at school,and was a candidate for the school gifted program.he had an extroverted,personality,actively participated in classroom discussions and remained closely bonded to dyan,with whom he wanted to live forever.dyan told dcfs that,even after he was adopted,she would ensure hunter was able to see his mother and sister whenever he wanted to.hunter had stopped seeing his first therapist for insurance reasons.dyan was looking for a new one.
at the hearing,charmaine attorney informed the court that charmaine was still experiencing difficulty obtaining visits with hunter,wanted help from dcfs,and asked the court again to change its orders to enable her to get joint therapy with her son.the court refused the request.a section hearing on the new permanent plan of adoption was set for april 
dyan home study was completed in october.in the intervening months,hunter steadfastly continued to refuse all contact with charmaine,with the exception of one visit in january arranged by hunter paternal grandfather,the reports of which were decidedly mixed.hunter continued to thrive in dyan care.the two had a strong emotional bond.hunter felt safe with and protected by dyan,and he wanted her to adopt him.hunter new therapist said he continued to have extreme trust issues.after june,hunter refused to participate in individual therapy.he threw away any cards and letters his mother sent,and would not listen to her phone messages.at a hearing on august,charmaine and her attorney noted charmaine still had not seen her son,and attempted to obtain visitation joint therapy with hunter.the child attorney objected,stating past visits had proven quite hurtful to hunter,who had asked that he not have any contact with his mother.the court did not respond to or make any
