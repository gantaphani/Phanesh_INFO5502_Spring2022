ronald,biological father of the minor,appeals from the judgment of disposition.welf,further undesignated statutory references are to this code.appellant contends the juvenile court erred in failing to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity executed by another man find he was a presumed father under adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey and require compliance with newly enacted section,subdivision e,relating to notice under the indian child welfare act icwa et.we affirm.
in september,the department of social services dss removed the minor,who tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana at birth,from the mother custody.appellant was incarcerated at the time for failure to register as a sex offender.dss filed a petition alleging the minor and his were at risk of physical harm due to the mother substance abuse problems and because the mother allowed appellant,who had a criminal history of violence,sex offenses and drugs,to stay in the home the court ordered the minor detained.
from the outset of the proceedings,the mother identified appellant as the biological father of the minor but said that signed a declaration of paternity and is identified as the minor father on the birth certificate.although the minor was the result of a planned pregnancy with appellant,the mother took these steps to protect the minor from appellant when she discovered his status as a registered sex offender.
upon being sent notice of proceedings,appellant completed a parental notification of indian status identifying possible cherokee heritage.he also completed a statement regarding paternity in which he indicated he did not know if he is the father of the minor,but requested testing to determine whether he is.
dss sent notice of the proceedings to the cherokee tribes.the cherokee nation responded that the minor could not be traced in tribal records and will not be considered an indian as defined by the icwa.the eastern band of cherokee indians responded that the minor is not considered an indian child in relation to that tribe.the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians responded that t here is no evidence that the minor is descendants sic from anyone on the keetoowah roll.therefore,he is not eligible for enrollment and the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians in oklahoma will not intervene in this case.the confederated tribes of the grand ronde community of oregon responded that the minor did not qualify for membership.
appellant was released from custody and attended the jurisdictional hearing on december.the court ordered paternity testing,took judicial notice of an order permitting appellant to have visitation with his other minor child,sustained the petition and set disposition hearing.the court also found,based on the report of the tribes responses,that the icwa did not apply to the case.
an addendum report in february stated that appellant had completed paternity testing but no services were recommended because he was only a biological father and another man,qualified as a presumed father.the report noted that,although appellant attended the mother first sonogram,he was not otherwise a part of the pregnancy and did not support the mother while she was pregnant.due to his prior incarceration and the dependency proceeding,appellant had no relationship with the minor.
a second addendum stated that paternity testing showed appellant is the biological father of the minor.the addendum also detailed appellant contact with dss beginning in november when appellant was released from custody.in december,appellant brought clothes and blankets for the minor to the dss office.in january,appellant spoke to the social worker and in february,dropped off a disposable camera so the foster parent could take photographs of the minor for him.during one conversation with appellant,the social worker had the impression he was seeking presumed father status to improve his position in a parole appeal which related to his other child.when asked about this,appellant denied the motivation.in a letter attached to the report,appellant stated he had many more contacts with the social worker than had been reported.copies of the delivered service logs which reflected all contacts between appellant and the social worker were attached to the addendum.
according to the addendum,appellant parole officer told the social worker that appellant minimized his sex offenses and sex offender status.appellant most recent parole violation was for being in the home of a female minor.
the addendum also addressed the status of,the presumed father who had been with the mother during her pregnancy and was present for the minor birth.although aware he had no biological connection to the minor,held the minor out as his own child and intended to marry the mother.
at the hearing,appellant counsel made an offer of proof that,if called,appellant would testify he had an ongoing relationship with the mother before she became pregnant the pregnancy was planned he intended to assume a parental role before he was arrested upon his release he brought clothing and blankets for the minor,sent cards,and provided a camera for photographs he completed paternity testing he participated in a substance abuse assessment and was found not to need treatment he completed a parenting class he previously lived with his now son and has visitation rights and he believes it is in the best interests of the minor to override the declaration of paternity.
the court acknowledged the existence of the visitation order for appellant other child but found the bare fact of the order was not persuasive since the circumstances under which it was entered were unknown.the court relied upon all the facts,including appellant presence at the first sonogram and his status as a registered sex offender.however,the court also found that despite the planned pregnancy,appellant did nothing to assure his status as the minor father and concluded appellant had not taken the necessary steps to be more than a mere biological father.that fact and appellant background led the court to find that it would not be in the minor best interest to offer appellant services.the court adjudged the minor a dependent,reiterated that the icwa did not apply,and adopted a reunification plan for the mother and the presumed father.
discussion 
appellant contends the court erred in failing to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity.
the voluntary declaration of paternity vdp is a means by which a man who is identified as the natural father by the unmarried natural mother may assert paternity.the legislature enacted the statutes creating the declaration process to further the state interest in establishing paternity for all children and provide a means of establishing paternity which avoided the need for a lengthy and expensive court process.once signed and filed with child support services,the vdp has the effect of a judgment and is a conclusive presumption of paternity.
the vdp is subject to being set aside if genetic testing establishes that someone other that the declarant father is the biological father of the minor unless the court finds that setting aside the declaration is not in the minor best interest,subd.b.a motion for genetic testing under family code section may be brought only by the mother,the declarant father or the local child support agency in any action which determines custody of the minor,subd.b a.additionally,either parent may file a motion to set aside the paternity judgment resulting from the vdp pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subd.c.in determining whether to set aside a vdp,the court retains the power to act as a court of equity,subd.c.
a judgment of paternity based upon a vdp may also be set aside on a motion by the mother,the previously established father,or the child if genetic testing indicates the previously established father is not the biological father of the child,subd.a.however,even if genetic testing shows the previously established father is not the biological father,the court may deny a motion to vacate the judgment if doing so is in the best interest of the child.
