in the legislature enacted probate code section,making it easier for children in probate guardianships to be adopted by their guardians.stats,ch,hereafter,section.section authorizes the termination of parental rights when the guardianship has continued for at least two years,and the court finds that adoption by the guardian would be in the child best interest.in this case,a mother whose rights were terminated under section contends the statute is unconstitutional on its face because it allows the fundamental rights of parenthood to be extinguished without a showing that the parent is currently unfit,or that termination of parental rights is the alternative least detrimental to the child.
we hold that section is facially constitutional.generally,due process requires some showing of parental unfitness before rights are terminated,to protect the parent fundamental interest in child custody.however,it is settled that a showing of current unfitness is not always necessary when a court terminates parental rights.section applies to parents whose custody rights have been suspended during a probate guardianship.a termination proceeding under this statute occurs only when the parent has failed to exercise any custodial responsibility for a period,with the possible exception of visitation.in this context,it would make little sense to require a showing that the parent is currently unfit.as guardianship continues for an extended period,the child develops an interest in a stable,continuing placement,and the guardian acquires a recognized interest in the care and custody of the child.section appropriately requires the court to balance all the familial interests in deciding what is best for the child.the least detrimental alternative standard invoked by mother is effectively included in the determination of the child best interest.
mother also claims it was improper to apply section retroactively in this case,because she had relied on preexisting law governing the termination of parental rights when she agreed to place her child in guardianship,two years before the statute was enacted.we conclude that in the circumstances of this case,the trial court application of section was consistent with due process and with the transitional provisions of probate code section,subdivision h.as we explain,trial courts have discretion to determine on a basis whether to apply section to a guardianship in existence on its effective date.
background 
ann was born in march.mother was a heroin addict with a lengthy criminal record.ann father was also a drug user.the parents relationship was unstable.in october and december,father sister and her husband,respondents and,cared for ann while mother was in rehabilitation programs.in september,mother threatened suicide and the police found ann in mother apartment,with other drug users.father briefly assumed custody but quickly proved incapable of caring for ann.the applied for guardianship.
in october,mother stipulated to a temporary guardianship without visitation,and agreed to enroll in a rehabilitation program.in december,both parents consented to a permanent guardianship,without visitation for mother.mother continued using drugs.in april,she pleaded guilty to a theft charge and received a prison sentence.
before she negotiated the guilty plea,mother considered allowing the to adopt ann,motivated by the possibility that she would be charged with a third strike and sentenced to a lengthy term.however,after the charges were resolved,she refused to consent to an adoption.the filed an adoption petition in may.mother objected in a letter from prison to the trial court in july.father filed his consent several months later.in january,the sought to terminate mother parental rights on the grounds of abandonment,and conviction of a felony demonstrating parental unfitness.
a probation officer prepared a social report for the court.the officer had interviewed mother,who claimed the thwarted her attempts to maintain contact with ann while mother was incarcerated.mother wanted her family to remain intact.ann half siblings,ages and,were in a guardianship with mother sister.mother said that child protective services was not pursuing adoption of those children because of her bond with them.she planned to enroll in a drug treatment program upon her release from prison,and said she had completed parenting and anger management programs.
the officer also interviewed,the prospective adoptive mother.she and had been married for almost years.she owned a hair salon,and he worked as a warehouseman.she reported that her brother ann father was currently in custody due to his drug use.said that while she was initially very supportive of mother,she had no choice but to take custody of ann because of mother continued drug use,arrests,and failures in rehabilitation programs.was concerned about ann and the stress caused by the uncertainty of the current situation.
the report concluded that while mother criminal history alone did not necessarily make her a bad parent,her continued substance abuse was a significant issue.ann appeared to be thriving in the nurturing environment.the officer recommended termination of mother parental rights.however,the court rejected that recommendation.relying on in re jacklyn th,d,it found that mother could not be deemed to have abandoned ann because she had been deprived of custody by judicial decree.it also concluded that mother criminal record was insufficient to establish her unfitness to assume custody in the future.
in february,the same month the court issued its decision,mother was released from prison and entered a drug treatment program.shortly thereafter,the filed a new petition to terminate her parental rights under section,which took effect on january.stats,ch.they alleged that they had been ann guardians since december,that their adoption petition was pending,and that adoption was in the child best interest.
in response,mother contended that section unconstitutionally interferes with parents substantive due process right to the care,custody,and control of their children that the statute should not be applied to her retroactively and that removal from her custody and control would not be in ann best interest.
the court received two reports on the matter.an adoption study conducted by a social worker in july concluded it would be extremely detrimental to ann if she were not permanently placed with the.ann was a friendly,normal child who called the mama and papa.their home was large and comfortable.ann had no relationship with her biological parents and little contact with her half siblings.the were open to visitation with the half siblings once the adoption was finalized.
the same conclusion was reached by a licensed family therapist who submitted a report in march.ann was fully bonded to the,after a painful separation from mother at the age of months.she was developing appropriately and about to begin kindergarten.a major change in her primary attachments would be stressful,and adoption by the would be in her best interest.the therapist recommended no visitation with mother and the half siblings until ann was at least years old.at that point,if ann demonstrated a consistent interest or need to meet them,and mother and the half siblings were properly prepared with reunification counseling,visitation might be undertaken.the therapist noted that mother had never completed a full course of residential drug treatment,and was living with her sister.she did appear to be trying to turn her life around and claimed to be meeting her parole requirements.she had not seen ann for over three years.
the court heard testimony from the therapist as well as from,one half sibling,and mother.it found that the evidence supported the findings and conclusions of the social worker and the therapist.it noted that mother was not in a position to take custody of the minor and could not say when she would be in a position to take custody.she sought only visitation,but there was uncontroverted evidence that visitation was not in ann best interest.finding by clear and convincing evidence that adoption by the would be in ann best interest,the court terminated mother parental rights.
the court of appeal affirmed,rejecting mother constitutional claims and her argument that section should not be applied to her retroactively.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
probate guardianship 
a brief review of probate guardianship is in order.this custodial arrangement originated in the law governing the administration of decedents estates,but it has not been restricted to orphans.long before the advent of the dependency statutes,probate guardianships were instituted when conditions were shown to be such,by reason of the mental and moral limitations or delinquency of parents,that to allow the child to continue in their custody would be to endanger the child permanent welfare.in re imperatrice cal.in such cases,courts recognized that the right of the parent to custody must give way,its preservation being of less importance than the health,safety,morals,and general welfare of the child.imperatrice,at.
after the passage of the juvenile dependency statutes,probate guardianships have continued to provide an alternative placement for children who can not safely remain with their parents.see weisz mccormick,supra.women stud.at.the differences between probate guardianships and dependency proceedings are significant.id.at.probate guardianships are not initiated by the state,but by private parties,typically family members.they do not entail proof of specific statutory grounds demonstrating substantial risk of harm to the child,as is required in dependency proceedings.see welf,guardianship of stephen th,d.unlike dependency cases,they are not regularly supervised by the court and a social services agency.no governmental entity is a party to the proceedings.it is the family members and the guardians who determine,with court approval,whether a guardianship is established,and thereafter whether parent and child will be reunited,or the guardianship continued,or an adoption sought under section.
a relative or other person on behalf of the minor,or the minor if years of age or older,may file a petition for the appointment of a guardian,subd.a.the probate court may appoint a guardian if it appears necessary or convenient,subd.a.an investigation into the circumstances of the proposed guardianship may be conducted,though the court may waive the investigation,subd.a.a probate guardianship is often established with parental consent,as in this case.see,in re charlotte cal th,d,guardianship of th,d guardianship of kassandra th,d guardianship of d.a parent who objects to guardianship is entitled to notice and a hearing.
early authorities held that in contested guardianship cases,parents were entitled to retain custody unless affirmatively found unfit.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate,citing cases.however,the unfitness standard fell out of favor and the best interest of the child,as determined under the custody statutes,became the controlling consideration.in re cal d,guardianship of marino d.the probate code now specifies that the appointment of a guardian is governed by the family code chapters beginning with sections and,subd.b.
family code section,subdivision a declares that the health,safety,and welfare of children shall be the court primary concern in determining the best interest of children when making any orders regarding the physical or legal custody or visitation of children.under family code section,subdivision a,parents are first in the order of preference for a grant of custody,but the court and the family are allowed the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child,subd.b.before granting custody to a nonparent over parental objection,the court must find clear and convincing evidence that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the best interest of the child,subds.a b.
in,the legislature added subdivisions to family code section emphasizing the importance of a stable home environment for the child.stats,ch.it specified that detriment to the child includes the harm of removal from a stable placement of a child with a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of his or her parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.a finding of detriment does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents,subd.c.and,if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person to whom custody may be given is a person described in subdivision c,this finding shall constitute a finding that the custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child absent a showing by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary,subd.d.thus,the legislature has determined that the critical finding of detriment to the child does not necessarily turn on parental unfitness.it may be based on the prospect that a successful,established custodial arrangement would be disrupted.see guardianship of,supra,th at,d.
when the court appoints a guardian,the authority of the parent ceases,subd.a.the court has discretion to grant visitation guardianship of martha d,but otherwise parental rights are completely suspended for the duration of a probate guardianship guardianship of stephen,supra,th at,d.the guardian assumes the care,custody,and control of the child,subd.a.there is no periodic court review of the placement,as there is in dependency proceedings.stephen,at,d.nor is the parent given the reunification services that the county provides to parents of dependent children.guardianship of kaylee th,d.
unless ended by court order,the guardianship continues until the child attains majority or dies,subd.a.the court may terminate the guardianship on a petition by the guardian,a parent,or the child,based on the child best interest.the fitness of the parent to assume custody is not a controlling consideration.guardianship of,supra,th at,d.
section authorizes the termination of parental rights after two years of probate guardianship,if adoption by the guardian is in the child best interest an analysis prepared by senate judiciary committee staff notes that under preexisting law,a guardian seeking to adopt without the consent of the child parents was required to proceed under the provisions of family code section et com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the analysis explains this bill would create yet another avenue for a guardian where the child has been in the custody of the guardian for a long time and the parent or parents are not likely to reclaim the child but the parent or parents do not fall under one of the categories covered by existing law.
the situation that this bill intends to cover,for example,is where one parent can not be found,and the other voluntarily gave the child to the guardian in a written guardianship agreement that may or may not have been entered in a formal court proceeding.years later it became apparent that the child has bonded with the guardians as parents,but since the birth parents visited occasionally,abandonment could not be established.another example given by the sponsor is where a drug addicted mother gives the child in guardianship,hoping to get herself rehabilitated but repeatedly fail s,creating a situation where the child is in the custody of the guardian for years without being in the foster care system.the sponsor contends that in either case,a guardian should be able to adopt the child without having to obtain consent or prove neglect,abandonment,or the mental disorder or mental illness of the parent who gave them sic guardianship in the first place.
given the other avenues left available,the sponsor believes that creating this new provision applicable only under the limited circumstances would allow a child to remain in and be adopted into a loving home in which he or she has been living.adoption would take away any fear that someday his or her birth parent or parents would come back to reclaim him or her,analysis of bill,supra,at.
the committee analysis summarized the intent of the proposed legislation as follows to institute a new procedure for the court to terminate parental rights when a child has been in the custody of a guardian for at least two years but there is no basis for the termination of parental rights except that it would be in the best interest of the child to be adopted by the guardian,analysis of bill,supra,at.the experience of the parties here demonstrates the effect of the new procedure.the were unable to adopt ann under former law requiring a showing of parental unfitness.section,however,allowed the court to terminate mother parental rights based on ann best interest.
facial constitutionality 
mother raises a facial challenge to the constitutionality of section.she does not contend the statute is invalid based on any aspect of her particular circumstances,except in her retroactivity argument.see pt,post.the standard governing facial challenges has been a matter of some debate,within both this court and the united states supreme court.see,zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners cal th,d,and cases cited therein united states booker,fn,d dis.opn.of stevens,kolender lawson,fn,d.here,mother claims section is unconstitutional in all cases.thus,she attempts to meet the strictest requirement for establishing facial unconstitutionality,asserting that the statute inevitably pose s a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.pacific legal foundation brown cal d.
we hold that the statute passes muster,not only under the strictest test but also under the more lenient standard sometimes applied mother fails to establish that section conflicts with due process in the generality or great majority of cases.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th,d,see also,zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners,supra,cal th at,d,chicago morales,fn,d plur.opn.of stevens.
mother argues that section is unconstitutional because it permits the termination of parental rights based only on the child best interest.she contends due process requires a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is presently unfit,or that terminating parental rights is the least detrimental alternative for the child.her claims are based on a parent fundamental interest in the companionship,care,custody,and management of his or her children.stanley illinois,d see also in re,supra,cal d at.it is noteworthy,however,that while mother invokes the due process protections courts have developed to protect this interest,she is not seeking to obtain the interest here.neither she nor any other parent in a section proceeding has or stands to gain the companionship,care,custody,or management of the child.if mother defeats the effort to terminate her parental rights,the guardianship continues and those rights remain in a state of suspension.
the only aspect of mother challenge that requires extended discussion is the parental unfitness criterion.regarding the standard of proof,mother does not dispute that clear and convincing evidence is required by statute for the findings specified in section it is the nature of those findings to which she objects.similarly,while mother insists that an order terminating parental rights must be based on present circumstances,there is no question that section requires the court to consider the current situation of the child,the guardians,and the parent.mother quarrel is with the kind of circumstances the court is directed to examine.
the least detrimental alternative formulation advocated by mother also collapses upon examination.t he least detrimental alternative standard is but a more precise formulation of the best interest of the child standard.in re rico d.see also,adoption of michael d,superseded by statute on another point,as noted in in re mario d.some courts have favored this alternative as a way to focus attention on current circumstances,and prevent speculation about possible future events that might tend to subordinate the child interests to those of adult claimants.adoption of michelle d.see in re angelia cal d.however,the least detrimental alternative has never supplanted the best interest of the child standard.in any event,whichever alternative the court deems least detrimental for the child at a section hearing will necessarily be the alternative that would serve the child best interest 
mother attempts to link the least detrimental alternative standard with parental unfitness,relying on in re carmaleta cal d,a case arising under the dependency statutes.but the carmaleta court made a point of distinguishing parental unfitness from detriment to the child.id.at,see also in re,supra,cal d at.moreover,the court discussed statutory grounds of parental unfitness,without elevating them to constitutional requirements.carmaleta,at.
the gravamen of mother claims is that section violates due process by failing to require a finding of parental unfitness before the court frees a child for adoption.it is settled,however,that such a finding is not an invariable constitutional requirement when parental rights are terminated.quilloin walcott,d quilloin establishes the principle.there,an unwed father sought to block his son adoption by the mother husband.although the child had frequently visited his father and occasionally received presents from him,the boy had always lived with his mother.the mother married when the child was two years old the adoption petition was filed when he was.the trial court granted the petition,denied the father requests for legitimation and visitation,and rejected his challenge to the constitutionality of statutes that gave him no right to object to the adoption.it based its decision on the child best interest,without finding that the father would be an unfit parent.quilloin,at.
the supreme court unanimously concluded that the father constitutional rights were not infringed.we have little doubt that the due process clause would be offended i f a state were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family,over the objections of the parents and their children,without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children best interest.smith organization of foster families,d stewart,concurring in judgment.but this is not a case in which the unwed father at any time had,or sought,actual or legal custody of his child.nor is this a case in which the proposed adoption would place the child with a new set of parents with whom the child had never before lived.rather,the result of the adoption in this case is to give full recognition to a family unit already in existence,a result desired by all concerned,except appellant.whatever might be required in other situations,we can not say that the state was required in this situation to find anything more than that the adoption,and denial of legitimation,were in the best interests of the child.quilloin,supra,at.accord,lehr robertson,fn,d.
quilloin demonstrates that the best interest of the child is a constitutionally permissible basis for terminating parental rights in some circumstances.clearly,the rights of a father like quilloin could be terminated under section without violating due process.because mother fails to show that section conflicts with constitutional requirements all cases,the statute must be deemed facially constitutional under the strict standard we applied in pacific legal foundation brown,supra,cal d at page.
nor do mother arguments persuade us that section is unconstitutional under the alternate standard set out in cases such as san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th,d.she fails to show that in the generality or great majority of cases id.at,d,a parent whose child has remained in a guardianship for two or more years is entitled to insist that his or her unfitness be proven when the guardian seeks to adopt the child.due process requires a showing of unfitness before termination of parental rights in order to protect the integrity of a natural family,one in which there is a custodial relationship between parent and child.quilloin,supra,at.see also lehr robertson,supra,at.in re heather th,fn,d.in troxel granville,d,the high court reaffirmed that this requirement derives from a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.id.at.plur.opn.of.s o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children,is fit,there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family id.at.
thus,some showing of unfitness is called for when a custodial parent faces termination of his or her rights.quilloin,supra,at.in that circumstance,there is no dispute that the best interest of the child would not be a constitutionally sufficient standard for terminating parental rights.even if it were shown that a particular couple desirous of adopting a child would best provide for the child welfare,the child would nonetheless not be removed from the custody of its parents so long as they were providing for the child adequately.reno flores,d,citing quilloin,supra,at.however,section has no application to custodial parents.it affects only parents whose rights have been suspended for an extended period of probate guardianship.
in limited circumstances,this court has held that the best interest of the child can not justify terminating the rights of a parent who has demonstrated a full commitment to parental responsibility,but whose efforts to secure custody have been thwarted.in adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey,we reviewed a statutory scheme permitting the termination of an unwed father parental rights if adoption were in the child best interest,even though the mother had prevented the father from receiving the child into his home and establishing the status of presumed father.id.at,d.we concluded that i f an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.id.at,d.however,we emphasized that the father would be deprived of his constitutional right if but only if he demonstrated the necessary commitment to his parental responsibilities.id.at,d,see also lehr robertson,supra,at.otherwise,the statutory best interest of the child standard would be constitutionally sufficient.kelsey,at,d.
mother relies on kelsey,but falls well short of establishing that in the generality or great majority of cases section violates the due process rights of parents who have demonstrated a full commitment to their responsibilities.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at,d.termination of parental rights and adoption by a guardian can occur only when the parent has surrendered custody to the guardian and exercised no parental care or control for at least two years,subd.a.a prolonged guardianship,during which all parental rights and custodial responsibilities are suspended,with the possible exception of visitation rights,is generally inconsistent with a full commitment to parental,financial,and otherwise.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.
there are imaginable scenarios in which a fully responsible parent might find it necessary to place a child in guardianship and,despite maintaining a parental commitment as full as the circumstances permit,eventually face a termination proceeding under section.mother posits the plight of a single mother in the national guard,called to duty overseas,and unable to reclaim custody for two years.however,we may not invalidate a statute simply because in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may arise.california teachers state of california cal th,d,see also zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners,supra,cal th at,d.we note that section requires the court to consider all factors relating to the best interest of the child,which would include the circumstances leading to guardianship,the parent efforts to maintain contact with the child,any exigencies that might hamper those efforts,and other evidence of commitment to parental responsibilities,subd.a.we also note that section is open to constitutional challenge as applied to particular parents.see in re charlotte,supra,cal th,d.
mother relies on a number of dependency cases from this court and the united states supreme court to support her claim that a finding of parental unfitness is constitutionally required in a section proceeding.her authorities do not support that conclusion 
as discussed above,quilloin and kelsey establish that in a private adoption proceeding,parental rights may sometimes be terminated without any prior judicial finding of parental unfitness.quilloin,supra,at.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.a section proceeding is brought to permit a private adoption by the guardian.dependency proceedings are fundamentally different.unlike probate guardianships,they are ongoing court proceedings involving a series of interrelated hearings governed by a comprehensive statutory scheme.see cynthia superior court cal th,d,in re marilyn cal th,d.the state is not a party to a probate guardianship,and its resources are not pitted against the parent.compare santosky kramer,d.nor does the state assume jurisdiction over the child and proceed toward family reunification or an alternative permanent placement,as in dependency cases.rather,probate guardianship is a private custody arrangement,approved but not supervised by the court.the state initiates no proceedings and carries no burden to prove anything.it performs only a judicial role.see guardianship of simpson th,d guardianship of kassandra,supra,th at,d.
furthermore,the dependency cases cited by mother are consistent with quilloin and kelsey in that they employ the parental unfitness standard to protect the parent custodial rights,rather than to govern decisions made about the child placement after a period of removal from parental custody.thus,in stanley illinois,supra,d,the high court struck down a statute allowing the state to take custody from an unmarried father after the death of the children mother,based on a presumption that he was an unfit parent.id.at.the court held that due process guaranteed the father a hearing on his fitness when the issue at stake is the dismemberment of his family.id.at.section,by contrast,establishes no presumption and does not separate the child from parental custody the family is dismembered not at the time of a section hearing,but at least two years earlier when the guardianship is established.at the outset of a probate guardianship,the parent interest in maintaining custody is protected by the parental preference doctrine codified in family code section,subd.b.
the constitutional sufficiency of the protections provided to parents by family code section is not before us in this case.that statute was not applied by the trial court,because mother consented to the establishment of the guardianship.she restricts her challenge to probate code section,and the parties have briefed no constitutional issues surrounding the parental preference doctrine as it now stands under california law similarly,though a parent ability to recover custody from the guardian is a critical factor in the running of the period prescribed by section,we have no occasion to consider the constitutionality of probate code section,which makes the best interest of the child the sole criterion for terminating a guardianship.mother never sought to terminate the guardianship in this case,and no due process issues arising under probate code section have been addressed by the parties we leave the constitutional questions involved in these contexts for cases where they are squarely presented.
for our purposes here,the relevant teaching of the dependency cases is that a finding of parental unfitness is not necessarily required at the point when parental rights are terminated.in a dependency proceeding,due process is satisfied if unfitness is established at an earlier stage,and parental rights terminated later based on the child best interest.cynthia superior court,supra,cal th at,d,santosky kramer,supra,at.mother places great reliance on a footnote in cynthia discussing an earlier california statutory scheme that required clear and convincing evidence of parental fault in termination proceedings.the cynthia court noted that under the former statutes,the clear and convincing evidence standard was appropriate in light of the fact that this is a separate proceeding in which specific findings of fault or detriment are required.cynthia,at,fn,d,see in re angelia,supra,cal d at,in re carmaleta,supra,cal d at.mother argues that a section proceeding is likewise a separate proceeding in which a finding of parental fault is required.
the analogy does not hold.the findings of fault discussed in the cynthia footnote were prescribed by statute.due process does not require such findings to be simultaneous with the termination of parental rights.in another case involving the former statutory scheme,we recognized that the equivalent of a finding of unfitness is necessary at some point in the proceedings as a matter of due process before parental rights may be terminated.in re jasmon cal th,d,italics added.whether the guardianship statutes afford sufficient protection to parental rights in advance of a section hearing is a question beyond the scope of this case.but it is clear that the parental fitness standard,which protects parents interest in child custody,is not necessarily required at a section hearing.by that stage,the family unit has ceased to exist and the parent entitlement to custody is not at issue.it would be anomalous to require proof in every case,by clear and convincing evidence,that a mother or father who has had no custodial responsibilities for two or more years is currently an unfit parent.
we emphasize that our holding is a narrow one,limited to mother contention that due process demands a finding of parental unfitness at a section hearing.parents are entitled to fundamentally fair procedures in proceedings to terminate their rights,whether or not they have custody of their children and whether it is the state or a private party that moves to sever the parental bond.the fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,custody,and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child even when blood relationships are strained,parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.if anything,persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs.santosky kramer,supra,at.see in re sade cal th,d.however,the procedural standards governing proceedings to terminate parental rights are not invariable.the nature and stage of the proceeding,and the passage of time without parental custody,may make a difference.
after years of guardianship,the child has a fully developed interest in a stable,continuing,and permanent placement with a fully committed caregiver.guardianship of kassandra,supra,th at,d see also,in re sade,supra,cal th at,d,in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d,in re daniel th,d.the guardian,after fulfilling a parental role for an extended period,has also developed substantial interests that the law recognizes.in re kieshia cal th,d,in re,supra,cal d at,subds.c d smith organization of foster families,supra,at,and fn.the parental unfitness criterion urged by mother fails to account for these competing interests,whereas the best interest of the child standard allows the court to appropriately balance all the relevant factors arising from the child family relationships,subd.a see marilyn,at,d,in re angelia,supra,cal d at.
accordingly,we hold that section is not unconstitutional on its face for failing to require a finding of present parental unfitness.
retroactivity 
mother contends the trial court erred by applying section retroactively.respondents,the,note that a statute does not operate retroactively merely because its application depends on preexisting facts or conditions.western security bank superior court cal th,d.they argue that the trial court simply applied the statute to the existing circumstances.however,a statute is retroactive if it substantially changes the legal effect of past events.kizer hanna cal d,see western security bank,at,d.that is plainly the case here.
mother agreed to temporary guardianship in october and permanent guardianship in december.in,the sought to terminate mother parental rights on grounds provided in the family code.they were unsuccessful.after section took effect on january,the promptly filed a petition under the new statute.the court terminated mother parental rights in june.thus,section substantially changed the legal effect of the guardianship that was established two years before the statute operative date.
in the trial court,mother relied on the general rule that a statute does not operate retroactively unless the legislature plainly intended it to do so.western security bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see also in re marriage of fellows cal th,d.however,as noted by the court of appeal,the legislature has clearly expressed its intention that amendments to the probate code apply on their effective date regardless of prior events,with limited exceptions.probate code section,subdivision c provides subject to the limitations provided in this section,a new law applies on the operative date to all matters governed by the new law,regardless of whether an event occurred or circumstance existed before,on,or after the operative date,including,but not limited to,creation of a fiduciary relationship,death of a person,commencement of a proceeding,making of an order,or taking of an action.the manifest purpose of this provision is to make legislative improvements in probate law applicable on their operative date whenever possible.rice clark cal th,d.
mother now claims she is protected by the limitation provided in subdivision h of probate code section if a party shows,and the court determines,that application of a particular provision of the new law would substantially interfere with the rights of the parties or other interested persons in connection with an event that occurred or circumstance that existed before the operative date,the court may,notwithstanding this section or the new law,apply either the new law or the old law to the extent reasonably necessary to mitigate the substantial interference.although mother failed to invoke this exception below,her arguments are essentially the same as the due process claims she raised in the trial court,and which she renews in this court.mother contends she was entitled to rely on the state of the law governing termination of parental rights at the time she consented to the guardianship.for the preexisting statutory grounds,see fn,ante.she notes that she filed a declaration in the trial court stating had probate code section existed at the time i was contemplating a guardianship,i probably would not have entered into one.
the provisions of probate code section,subdivision h comport with due process by allowing a party affected by a new statute to show why,under the circumstances presented,justice requires the application of former law see in re marriage of fellows,supra,cal th at,d,applying parallel terms of,subd.h.in weighing such a claim,we consider the significance of the state interest served by the law,the importance of the retroactive application of the law to the effectuation of that interest,the extent of reliance upon the former law,the legitimacy of that reliance,the extent of actions taken on the basis of that reliance,and the extent to which the retroactive application of the new law would disrupt those actions.in re marriage of bouquet cal d,see fellows,at,d.
the interests served by section are substantial affording children in probate guardianships the opportunity to enjoy permanent adoptive homes with familiar caretakers,and giving willing guardians the chance to become adoptive parents.here,retroactive application is important to provide ann and the with the benefits of adoption.on the other hand,little weight attaches to mother claim that she probably would not have consented to the guardianship had she known it might lead to the termination of her parental rights.as the c
