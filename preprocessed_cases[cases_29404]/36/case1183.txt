in a prior appeal kathleen balcof challenged a judgment holding that a writing she and her husband,ralph balcof,signed during marriage did not constitute a transmutation of certain of his property interests to those of hers we held that the writing satisfied the requirements for a transmutation of ralph interest in the marital residence and percent of the stock in his separate property corporation.however,we observed that ralph had been precluded from presenting evidence to the effect that he was under duress when he signed the writing.consequently,we reversed and remanded the matter to give him an opportunity to present his evidence and to make his arguments concerning the enforceability of the otherwise valid transmutation.on remand,the trial court held that the transmutation document was unenforceable due to both duress and undue influence.
kathleen appeals,challenging the judgment on a plethora of grounds.we hold that the trial court did not exceed the scope of this court instructions on remand,and furthermore,that retrial was not precluded either because of a judicial admission on ralph part or because of case law concerning the use of extrinsic evidence.we also hold that substantial evidence supports the trial court findings on both duress and undue influence.in addition,the trial court did not err in receiving the testimony of attorney brenda agren,the tape recording of a discussion between kathleen and the children,or the stipulated evidence that kathleen struck ralph in the face in front of the children.finally,the statement of decision was not inadequate and the motion for new trial was properly denied.we affirm the judgment and the order denying the new trial motion.
ralph and kathleen were married in.they had two children,born in and,respectively.in october,ralph and kathleen signed a writing concerning their marital residence and a portion of the stock in ralph separate property corporation.they separated three or four months later.ralph filed a petition for dissolution in january.their marriage was dissolved as to status only on december.
the court bifurcated the trial proceedings pertaining to the effect of the october writing.the first issue to be tried was whether the writing constituted a transmutation of ralph community property interest in the marital residence and percent of his stock in his separate property corporation,to kathleen as her separate property.the second item to be tried,provided that the october writing were held to be a transmutation,was whether there were any defenses to the enforcement of the writing.
after a trial on the first issue,the court held that the october writing was ineffective to transmute property from that of ralph to that of kathleen.given this,there was never any trial pertaining to ralph defenses to the enforceability of the october writing.kathleen appealed from the judgment to the effect that the october writing was not a transmutation.
on appeal,we held that the october writing satisfied the transmutation requirements of family code section.however,we observed that ralph had never had his opportunity to raise his claim of duress,so we remanded the matter for further trial proceedings.
on remand,the trial court entered judgment in favor of ralph,holding that the october writing was unenforceable due to duress and undue influence.it thereafter denied kathleen new trial motion.kathleen again appeals.
discussiona.background 
the following background information is taken directly from the prior opinion 
prenuptial agreement 
shortly before their marriage,the parties signed a prenuptial agreement,the validity of which is not an issue in this matter.as disclosed in the exhibits to the agreement,ralph then owned property worth several million dollars,including more than million in bolcof plastic materials,stock kathleen assets were minimal.
under the prenuptial agreement,the parties agreed that ralph would transfer the bulk of his property into a separate property trust and that kathleen would not acquire any interest in that property or in the trust during the course of the marriage.in short,she would never acquire any interest in bolcof plastic materials,even to the extent the value of the corporation might increase due to the efforts of ralph during the marriage.however,ralph agreed to transfer two life insurance policies he owned to himself and kathleen as community property.also,ralph and kathleen agreed that if they were still living together as man and wife upon ralph death,kathleen would receive the marital dwelling,free and clear of debt,plus.
at the time the prenuptial agreement was signed,the parties had not yet acquired the property located on pelican drive,which was purchased after marriage and was not placed in the trust.
transmutation document 
the parties have stipulated that in october,while they were in a room together at an inn,ralph penned a writing which is the subject matter of this dispute.that writing provides as follows i,ralph balcof deed over all interest in our house at pelican interest stock in bolcof plastic materials.this will be legal by dec.then appear the signatures of each of kathleen and ralph.immediately thereafter is written i will pay a day penlty sic if sic this is not done by dec.
stipulated judgment 
in the march,judgment on reserved issues,the court divided certain of the assets between the parties and ordered the payment of spousal and child support,pursuant to their stipulated judgment.
ralph stipulated to pay kathleen the sum of per month in spousal support while she was living in the marital dwelling.after she vacated the dwelling,ralph was required to pay her per month,until the first to occur of the death of either party,kathleen remarriage,or june.the judgment contains a provision for the payment of an additional in spousal support for a time period that can not be ascertained due to the fact a portion of the copy of the judgment as contained in the record is illegible.in addition,the judgment addressed the provision of cobra medical insurance coverage for kathleen.
ralph also stipulated to pay child support in the amount of per month for his daughter,kelsey,and per month for his son,andrew.he further committed to provide health insurance for the children.
in addition,ralph stipulated to maintain an initial sum of in life insurance,decreasing by each year,with respect to spousal support.he also agreed to maintain in life insurance with respect to child support.
the court awarded ralph the marital dwelling,with an assigned value of million,as his sole and separate property.in addition,it awarded ralph half of the miscellaneous personal property,furniture and furnishings the parties acquired during marriage,half of the parties three wells fargo checking accounts,and half of the community interest in the bolcof plastic materials.plan and trust.

in addition to the foregoing,the judgment recited that kathleen had indicated that she might file an appeal with respect to the characterization of the marital dwelling and the bolcof plastic materials,business.the parties reserved the right to assert different values for those assets and to argue that the amount of the equalization payment was incorrect,depending on the outcome of any appeal.
in the april,judgment on reserved issues,ralph was awarded the following items as his sole and separate property any and all shares of bolcof plastic materials,common stock any and all shares of.com common stock any and all shares of bolcof plastic materials southeast,common stock any and all interest in azusa packaging,a california general partnership certain real property located in azusa and certain real property located in fontana.
on remand,the trial court held that the april,judgment on reserved issues would remain in full force and effect.
kathleen arguments 
introduction 
kathleen has chosen to wage a wide ranging attack on many fronts.she claims retrial was precluded because of a judicial admission on ralph part the case should not have been remanded because of case law concerning the use of extrinsic evidence the trial court exceeded the scope of the this court instructions on remand the trial court findings on duress were not supported by the evidence ralph waived his right to rescind the october writing due to duress ralph ratified the october writing the trial court erred in receiving the testimony of attorney agren into evidence the trial court erred in receiving a tape recording into evidence the evidence that kathleen struck ralph in the face in front of the children was irrelevant and prejudicial the statement of decision was inadequate and the motion for new trial should not have been denied.we address these arguments in turn.
prior opinion 
kathleen levels a tardy attack on this court opinion in the prior appeal.she says that the case never should have been remanded at all,for two reasons.first,she says that ralph conceded,in an october,memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to motion to certify judgment,that the court had bifurcated for early hearing the issue of the validity and enforceability of a handwritten document and that f ollowing full hearing on the matter the court ruled the document was ineffective as a transmutation of any interest in the real property or the stock.she says this wording constitutes a concession that the enforceability of the transmutation document was already resolved by the trial court and that the doctrine of judicial admission bars a remand for a trial on defenses to the enforceability of the writing.second,kathleen says that the case should not have been remanded because case law see,estate of macdonald cal d,encourages courts to resolve transmutation issues without resort to extrinsic evidence.
kathleen arguments challenging this court prior opinion come too late.the opinion is a final decision of this court and we have no power to review it.cal.rules of court,rules b,a woodridge escondido property owners nielsen th,d.under the law of the case doctrine,the decision of an appellate court,stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.citation.yu signet th,d.if kathleen believed that this court had made an error in ordering a remand,her remedy was to bring a petition for rehearing on the matter.cal.rules of court,rule.furthermore,we are not persuaded either that ralph imprecise wording in his october,memorandum of points and authorities constituted a waiver of defenses to enforcement,or that estate of macdonald,supra,cal d,would make consideration of defenses inappropriate.but we need not resolve either of these issues.the prior decision of this court is final and the trial court did not err in following the remand instructions.
scope of remand 
in our prior opinion,we stated kathleen balcof appeals from a judgment holding that a writing she and her husband,ralph balcof,signed during marriage did not constitute a transmutation of certain of his property interests to those of hers.we agree with kathleen that the writing contained an express declaration of a change in ownership with respect to certain real property and stock holdings,and that it was a valid transmutation as to those items.however,the writing did not constitute a present transmutation of penalties in the amount of per day,which would accrue,if at all,only on the happening of a future event.in addition,we observe that ralph was precluded from presenting evidence to the effect that he was under duress when he signed the writing,so the matter must be remanded to give him an opportunity to present his evidence and to make his arguments concerning the enforceability of the otherwise valid transmutation.we reverse and remand.footnote omitted.
according to kathleen,when this court referenced ralph argument concerning duress,we meant to limit the remand to that issue exclusively.she further contends that,because the trial court actions exceeded the scope of the instructions on remand,those actions are void.she reads our remand instructions too narrowly.
the remand was intended to give ralph an opportunity to present his evidence and to make his arguments concerning the enforceability of the otherwise valid transmutation.although it was anticipated that the arguments concerning enforceability would include arguments on duress,which ralph had mentioned specifically,there was no intention to exclude any other arguments ralph might make with respect to enforceability,such as undue influence.the court correctly understood the instructions on remand and did not err by permitting the presentation of evidence and argument on undue influence.
undue influence 
aside from contending that the trial court should not have considered undue influence at all,kathleen makes little argument concerning that defense.in its statement of decision,the trial court held that kathleen exerted undue influence on ralph in order to obtain the october writing.ralph asserts that this holding was correct.we agree.
according to family code section,subdivision b,husbands and wives are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other if one spouse secures an advantage from an interspousal transaction,a statutory presumption arises under section that the advantaged spouse exercised undue influence and the transaction will be set aside.citation.in re marriage of mathews th,d see also in re marriage of delaney th,d.generally,a spouse obtains an advantage if that spouse position is improved,he or she obtains a favorable opportunity,or otherwise gains,benefits,or profits.citation.in re marriage of mathews,supra,th at,d.
in this case,kathleen secured an advantage through the october writing,because she obtained a percent interest in ralph separate property corporation as well has his share of the marital residence.see in re marriage of delaney,supra,th at,d.therefore,the statutory presumption arose that she exercised undue influence against ralph in obtaining his signature on the october writing,and that the writing should be set aside.in re marriage of mathews,supra,th at,d in re marriage of delaney,supra,th at,d.
the burden of rebutting the presumption of undue influence was on kathleen,as the spouse who acquired an advantage or benefit from the transaction.citation.in re marriage of mathews,supra,th at,d.consequently,it was her burden to establish ralph signing of the october writing was freely and voluntarily made,with full knowledge of all the facts,and with a complete understanding of its effect of making the shares of stock and the marital residence separate property.citation.ibid.it was her burden to rebut the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at,d.substantial evidence supports the trial court implied finding that kathleen did not rebut the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at,d standard of review is substantial evidence,of proof by preponderance of evidence.
the trial court found that t he writing was a transaction between the parties,which arose out of their confidential relationship as spouses and was not made at arms length.it also found that kathleen gained an advantage over ralph by virtue of the writing,in that it transferred assets to her which she did not previously own.in addition,the court stated,in its statement of decision.kathleen threatened ralph with divorce and the obstruction of his relationship with their children if he did not prepare the writing.kathleen harangued and berated ralph during the marriage in an effort to force him to modify the parties prenuptial agreement to provide more security for her.the berating included several incidents where kathleen physically struck ralph.kathleen screamed at ralph for at least minutes immediately preceding his writing the october writing,which screaming included threats of divorce and obstructing ralph relationship with the minor children if he did not make the writing.ralph reasonably believed kathleen threats,and that she intended to follow through with her threats.these threats alone or coupled with his state of mind resulting from the many prior episodes of verbal and physical abuse,constituted duress which resulted in his making the writing.further,kathleen subjected ralph to a continuous barrage of yelling and threats of divorce and obstructing ralph relationship with the minor children in the parties hotel room from the time he started the writing until he was initially finished.thereafter,kathleen barrage of threats continued until ralph wrote an additional penalty clause,which he did at her insistence.coupled with the prior history of kathleen haranguing and berating ralph concerning the prenuptial agreement,the threats to take his children away from him immediately before he made the writing,unless he made the writing,constituted duress.
the threats also constituted undue influence,inasmuch as his execution of the document was not freely and voluntarily made.in re marriage of mathews,supra,th at,d see also in re marriage of baltins d.consent is not free when obtained through duress,menace,or undue influence.he executed the document as a reaction to kathleen continued yelling and screaming and out of fear that she would otherwise block him from having a continued relationship with his children.
ralph testimony at trial provided substantial evidence of kathleen striking him on occasion,and from time to time screaming at him and threatening to disrupt his relationship with his children if he did not provide her with the property she demanded.it also provided substantial evidence that,on the date of the october writing,she yelled and screamed at him and threatened him until he complied with her demand to write what she told him to right then and there.free and voluntary are not words that appropriately describe his actions on the date in question.
moreover,ralph testified that he broke down and wrote what kathleen dictated to him.he further testified that he did not know the legal effect of the words he was writing and that he did not have an opportunity to discuss their legal effect with counsel.his testimony on these points provided substantial evidence that he did not sign the october writing with a complete understanding of the effect of doing so.in re marriage of mathews,supra,th at,d in re marriage of baltins,supra,d at.lack of independent advice a factor to be weighed in determining if party acted voluntarily and with understanding of transaction.
true enough,kathleen testified contrarily to ralph,both about the circumstances surrounding the execution of the october writing,and about whether she had the habit of striking him,screaming at him,and threatening to undermine his relationship with his children.given the conflicts in the respective testimony of kathleen and ralph,it is clear that one of them was lying.the trial court found as to the events at the time the october writing was made,ralph testimony was credible,but kathleen testimony was not.
the power of a reviewing court begins and ends with a determination of whether there is in the record substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which supports the result reached and we must also assume in favor of the determination below the existence of every fact which the trier of facts could have reasonably deduced from the evidence.citation.in re marriage of gonzalez d.substantial evidence supports the trial court determination that ralph version of events was more credible,that ralph did not freely and voluntarily execute that october writing,that ralph did not understand the legal significance of his execution of the writing,and that kathleen did not meet her burden to rebut the presumption of undue influence by a preponderance of the evidence.consequently,we hold the october writing is unenforceable as the product of undue influence.
a introduction 
kathleen argues at length that ralph did not prove duress.as a technical point,this is a matter we need not address,inasmuch as the october was unenforceable as a result of undue influence.however,we nonetheless choose to address her concerns.
b burden of proof 
kathleen says that ralph was required to show duress by clear and convincing evidence.she supports her argument with a citation to stevenson stevenson d.that case was decided before evidence code section became operative in.stats,ch.as at least one commentator has observed,e arly decisions require proof of the existence of duress with reasonable certainty by clear,cogent and convincing evidence,but these decisions no longer have vitality following the supreme court decision liodas sahadi cal d,rejecting the application of a burden of proof in excess of a preponderance of the evidence in fraud cases.there is no statutory or logical basis for imposition of a higher level of proof for duress than for fraud.schwing,cal.affirmative defenses ed,fns.omitted see also weiner fleischman cal d,in re marriage of peters th,d.
evidence code section provides for three burdens of proof except as otherwise provided by law,issues of fact are determined by a preponderance of the evidence.citation.in re marriage of peters,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.the degree of burden of proof applied in a particular situation is an expression of the degree of confidence society wishes to require of the resolution of a question of fact.citation.the burden of proof thus serves to allocate the risk of error between the parties,and varies in proportion to the gravity of the consequences of an erroneous resolution.citations.preponderance of the evidence results in the roughly equal sharing of the risk of error.citation.to impose any higher burden of proof demonstrates a preference for one side interests.citation.generally,facts are subject to a higher burden of proof only where particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake citations.ibid.
w hen we compare the risk of the loss of an economic interest with the interests at stake in cases applying the clear and convincing standard,it falls short.all involve interests more substantial than the mere loss of money.citations.in re marriage of peters,supra,th at,d.because the interests at stake in the case before us are the same for both parties and the interests involved are economic,the parties should share the risk of error roughly equally.the preponderance of the evidence standard is sufficient.id.at,d.
based on the same evidence noted in our discussion of undue influence,ralph met his burden to demonstrate duress,by a preponderance of the evidence.kathleen disagrees.
c free will 
in addition to pointing to the portions of her testimony that conflict with his,kathleen,again citing older case law see,burke gould cal,says that there was no duress because kathleen did not commit any unlawful act or subject ralph to confinement in order to get his signature.however,t he stringent definition of duress contained in civil code section,codifying the early common law rule,has been relaxed.citations.under the modern rule,d uress,which includes whatever destroys one free agency and constrains him or her to do what is against his or her will,may be exercised by threats,importunity or any species of mental coercion citation citation.it is shown where a party intentionally used threats or pressure to induce action or nonaction to the other party detriment.citation.citations.the coercion must induce the assent of the coerced party,who has no reasonable alternative to succumbing.citation.in re marriage of baltins,supra,d at,fns.omitted.
in this case,ralph free will was constrained by kathleen threats to deny him access to his children.kathleen disagrees,saying that any threat to deny ralph access to the children could hardly constitute duress,inasmuch as child custody and visitation matters are resolved by the courts.she emphasizes that ralph,as a successful businessman,had access to lawyers and should have known better than to be frightened at the suggestion that she somehow could have thwarted his rights to see his children.however,as ralph testified,he did not discuss kathleen threats with legal counsel until after the date he was constrained to execute the october writing.moreover,it is not for one parent to fail to comply with court custody or visitation orders or to engage in efforts to scuttle the relationship between the children and the other parent.as a practical matter,the courts are to undo the damage done by infighting parents.
it is true,as kathleen suggests,that the facts of the case before us are not as egregious as those in the case of in re marriage of gonzalez,supra,d,wherein the husband threatened to remove the children to another country and even intimated that he might have the wife killed.however,that does not mean that the degree of coercion in the case before us was not sufficient to rise to the level of duress.kathleen aimed at ralph most vulnerable spot when she threatened to interfere with his relationship with the children.in re marriage of baltins,supra,d at.
it is also true,as kathleen states,that ralph admitted he was not actually afraid for his physical safety on account of kathleen physical abuse of him.the fact that he did not expect to wind up in the hospital the next time she struck him does not,however,mean that her abuse did not have a cumulative and real effect on his mental state.
d failure to rescind 
continuing on,kathleen asserts that ralph is precluded from obtaining relief on the ground of duress,because he failed to promptly rescind the october writing in support of that assertion,she cites a number of old cases concerning rescission of fully or partially performed contracts based on fraud,primarily cases having to do with real estate transactions.see,fabian alphonzo bell d,campbell title guarantee.these cases,founded on civil code section,are inapposite.
kathleen omits to address the underlying statute,which provides subject to section,to effect a rescission a party to the contract must,promptly upon discovering the facts which entitle him to rescind if he is free from duress,menace,undue influence or disability,and is aware of his right to rescind a give notice of rescission to the party as to whom he rescinds and b restore to the other party everything of value which he has received from him under the contract or offer to restore the same upon condition that the other party do likewise,unless the latter is unable or positively refuses to do so.civil code section states in part that w hen relief based on rescission is claimed in an action or proceeding,such relief shall not be denied because of delay in giving notice of rescission unless such delay has been substantially prejudicial to the other party.
a plain reading of civil code section indicates that the party seeking to rescind must do so promptly,as long as he or she is free from duress,menace or undue influence or disability.in this case,the duress continued after the date of the october writing,so that the requirement to rescind promptly was held in abeyance.moreover,under civil code section,any delay on ralph part to promptly provide kathleen with notice of rescission would not preclude relief,unless kathleen were substantially prejudiced by the delay.kathleen does not explain what prejudice she suffered.
the only case that kathleen cites that bears any similarity to the case before us is clanton clanton d.in that case,the husband and wife entered into a property settlement agreement concerning the division of parcels of real property,and items of personal property,including oil leases and subleases,and stocks and bonds.id.at.the husband subsequently filed a complaint for divorce and annulment of the property settlement agreement.ibid.the trial court sustained a demurrer to the cause of action for annulment of the property settlement agreement.ibid.the appellate court affirmed.id.at.
the appellate court in clanton stated that the case was none other than one for rescission of the fully performed property settlement agreement.clanton clanton,supra,d at.it noted that the agreement had been effectuated by duly executed conveyances,presumably at or about the time of the execution of the agreement.id.at.the court further noted that the husband had not offered to restore the wife to her share of the properties he had acquired pursuant to the agreement,and,additionally,that he had delayed for a period of months in bringing his action.id.at.the court concluded that the husband neglect to act promptly is fatal to his right to rescind.not even the slightest effort was made to excuse the delay it is to be assumed that the wife had been dealing with her share of the property as her own and that the husband had been doing likewise.during this long period of time each party had had the advantages and had suffered the disadvantages consequent upon their agreement the elapse of time inevitably brings changed conditions with resulting advantages and disadvantages to the respective parties,and obstacles arise which make it difficult,if not impossible,to restore the parties to their former status,a desideratum of rescission which distinguishes it from other forms of relief.id.at.
there is no reason why clanton clanton,supra,d,should compel a reversal in the case before us.no properties were transferred pursuant to the october writing,so neither party has suffered advantages or disadvantages based upon a transfer.moreover,despite kathleen protestations,there was no lengthy delay in challenging the writing.it was signed in october and ralph filed his petition for dissolution of marriage in january,asserting therein that his separate property was defined by the prenuptial agreement.property ownership and division then became a matter for court determination.kathleen simply has not convinced us that laws pertaining to the rescission of fully performed contracts should apply to preclude ralph from challenging the enforceability of the october writing in this context.
e ratification 
finally,kathleen argues that ralph ratified the october writing.she claims that the evidence of ratification includes ralph failure to rescind,a list,a car transfer,and meetings with attorney mitchell schwary.we have already discussed the significance of the lack of rescission and need not belabor that point.we address kathleen other items in turn.
the record contains an undated and unsigned handwritten list of eight action items.the items pertained to a trust,life insurance,title to the house,stock options,alimony,title to cars,profit sharing,and notification of kathleen when actions were completed.the parties gave conflicting testimony as to the date and significance of this list.kathleen testified that ralph,of his own volition,made the list towards the end of december.ralph,on the other hand,testified that he wrote the list in the summer of a t kathleen insistence,during one of h er yelling sprees.he stated that kathleen wanted him to do everything and then show her that he had done everything.ralph further testified that he did not take most of the actions on the list,but that he did put a jaguar in her name in december.
resolving the conflicting evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment akins state of california th,d,it would appear the list is evidence not of a ratification of the october writing,but rather of a precursor to it.that is,ralph wrote out the list in the summer of,during one of kathleen earlier yelling sprees and by october kathleen was so angry that he had not taken the actions itemized on the list that she engaged in another yelling spree until he wrote out the terms of the october writing,including a penalty clause in case he did not get the job done this time.furthermore,the transfer of the jaguar to kathleen in is not evidence of a ratification of the october writing,which does not mention the jaguar.rather,it is only evidence that ralph finally acquiesced to performing one of the items on the list.
ralph testified that he went to attorney schw
