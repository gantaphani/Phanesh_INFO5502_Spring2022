in this dependency case,the trial court found it had jurisdiction over jesusa and awarded presumed father status to her stepfather.her biological father,heriberto,appeals from these orders which were entered after hearings held while he was incarcerated in a california prison.heriberto contends holding the jurisdictional and presumed father hearings in his absence violated his statutory right to be present and his due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard.he also contends the trial court erred on the merits when,after determining he was the biological father,it awarded presumed father status to the stepfather.we affirm the order determining presumed father status but reverse the order determining jurisdiction because heriberto was denied his right under penal code section,subdivision d to be present at the jurisdictional hearing.
facts and proceedings below 
the dependency petition.the department of children and family services filed a petition alleging jesusa had been exposed to violent confrontations between her mother and her father,heriberto c.in the most recent episode,heriberto struck and raped the child mother resulting in the mother hospitalization.the petition further alleged heriberto has a long history of violent and aggressive behavior,a history of alcohol abuse and is a current user of alcohol which renders him incapable of providing regular care for the child.jurisdiction was alleged under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a and b based on the mother failure to take action to protect jesusa from exposure to these violent episodes and heriberto inability to care for jesusa due to his alcoholism.
the detention hearing.heriberto was in jail at the time of the detention hearing and did not appear.paul appeared and testified that at the time of jesusa birth he was married to her mother but they were not living together and he did not claim to be jesusa biological father.he further testified he is still married to the mother and they have five children in common who live with him.the trial court ordered jesusa detained and placed with her stepfather,paul b.the court set a date for heriberto arraignment on the petition and another date for a conference and paternity hearing to determine paul presumed father status finally,the court issued an order under penal code section directing the los angeles county sheriff to transport heriberto from jail to the arraignment and other proceedings.
heriberto arraignment.the sheriff brought heriberto to his arraignment on the petition and the trial court appointed counsel to represent him.heriberto denied the allegations in the petition and informed the court he would seek presumed father status.
the conference.the sheriff again transported heriberto to court for the conference and presumed father hearing.at the conference,jesusa mother proposed to plead no contest to the petition.heriberto objected.he pointed out the allegations the mother failed to protect jesusa implied there was something to protect her from and that issue goes to the heart of the father case.the trial court accepted this argument,set the matter for a contested jurisdictional hearing,and continued the presumed father hearing to the date set for the jurisdictional hearing.in doing so,the court advised heriberto counsel you may want to consider having him file a declaration.the court ordered the county sheriff to transport heriberto to the hearings.
the jurisdictional and paternity hearings.heriberto was not present for the jurisdictional and paternity hearings.his counsel advised the court heriberto had been transferred out of los angeles county to a state prison in kern county.counsel also informed the court he had received a letter from heriberto in which his client stated he wished to be present for the proceedings and requested the matters be continued until he could be brought in.the trial court denied the request for a continuance and,over the objection of heriberto counsel,proceeded to adjudicate the presumed father and jurisdictional issues.
on the issue of presumed father status,the trial court found heriberto to be jesusa biological father.the court also found both heriberto and paul qualified as statutorily presumed fathers but concluded paul presumption was founded on weightier considerations of policy and logic.therefore,the court awarded paul status as jesusa presumed father.
on the jurisdiction issue,the court dismissed the allegations relating to heriberto alcoholism and permitted the department to make certain amendments to the remaining allegations.the court sustained the petition as amended.
heriberto filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
i.the trial court did not err in determining presumed father status without affording heriberto the opportunity to present his live testimony.
heriberto was incarcerated throughout the dependency proceedings.pursuant to the trial court orders under penal code section,which we discuss below,the los angeles county sheriff transported heriberto to all the proceedings except the contested presumed father and jurisdictional hearings.heriberto was not present for these hearings because sometime before their scheduled date he had been transferred to kern state prison and was no longer within the jurisdiction of the los angeles county sheriff.
counsel for heriberto objected to proceeding with the paternity hearing in his client absence.he argued a continuance should be granted for several reasons.heriberto testimony was necessary to respond to the mother claim he had not held himself out as jesusa father he had not discussed the presumed father issue with heriberto earlier because he expected heriberto to be present to discuss the issue the day of the hearing.heriberto had written him a letter stating he would like to be here.finally,counsel reminded the court it had impliedly found heriberto presence at the hearing to be necessary when it ordered the county sheriff to transport him there.
the trial court denied heriberto request to continue the hearing.the court commented it understood the issue of presumed father status would be fully decided on the briefs and argument on the briefs.no testimony to be taken.the court also advised heriberto counsel that in deciding the presumed father issue the court was not going to rely on the mother statements heriberto had failed to hold himself out as jesusa father.for this reason,the court concluded,it would seem to have him come to help you address those issues is not necessary since i wo use those factors at all in rendering my decision.
heriberto argues the trial court failure to provide him an opportunity to testify at the presumed father hearing was an abuse of the court discretion under penal code section and denied him his due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard.we disagree.
penal code section provides that upon request a prisoner has the right to be present at any proceeding brought under welfare and institutions code section to adjudicate the prisoner child a dependent child of the court and any proceeding brought under welfare and institutions code section to terminate the prisoner parental rights the statute further provides i n any other action or proceeding in which a prisoner parental rights are subject to adjudication the trial court may order the prisoner production before the court plainly,a hearing to determine presumed father status falls within the discretionary portion of the statute 
heriberto does not deny an order for his attendance at the hearing was within the trial court discretion.rather,he argues once the trial court exercised its discretion to order his attendance at the hearing it was error to proceed without him.the court should have granted a short continuance so the warden of kern state prison could be ordered to transport him to the proceeding in order to testify.
heriberto argument assumes his presence at the hearing would have entitled him to testify.not so.under the rules of court for dependency cases,t he court may make its determination of paternity or nonpaternity based on the testimony,declarations,or statements of the mother and alleged father.thus,the trial court had no obligation to receive heriberto live testimony even if he had been present at the hearing.this is especially so where the court had previously advised heriberto if he wished to present testimony he should do so through a declaration.
it is beyond dispute a biological father has a due process right to establish his status as a presumed father and in doing so he is entitled to a meaningful opportunity to be heard.in this case,however,heriberto has not shown the trial court denied him a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of presumed father status.he was represented by counsel at the hearing well in advance of the hearing he received the social workers reports which contained all the evidence the trial court relied on in determining the presumed father issue.thus,heriberto had ample time before the hearing to prepare a declaration setting out facts supporting his claim to presumed fatherhood and challenging contrary evidence contained in the social workers reports furthermore,the trial court did not base its decision denying him presumed father status on the statements by the mother which he sought to contest at the hearing.instead,the court assumed for purposes of its decision heriberto had taken jesusa into his home and held her out as his natural child.
we conclude heriberto has no basis for contending the trial court denied him his statutory or constitutional rights at the hearing to determine presumed father status.
ii.the trial court did not err in declaring paul b.the presumed father of jesusa.
it is undisputed paul and heriberto both qualify as presumed fathers under family code section.paul qualifies as a presumed father because he and jesusa mother were married to each other at the time of jesusa birth heriberto qualifies as a presumed father because he received jesusa into his home and held her out as his natural child 
family code section,subdivision c,however,states any presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.the trial court adjudged heriberto to be the biological father of jesusa.therefore,heriberto contends,paul b presumed fatherhood was rebutted as a matter of law under family code section,subdivision c.we are not persuaded by this argument because we question its underlying premise that in the context of dependency proceedings presumed fatherhood should be treated as an evidentiary presumption rather than as a rule of substantive law.
the primary purpose of family code section,a part of the uniform parentage act,is to establish a child natural father through a series of rebuttable presumptions in dependency proceedings,however,the purpose of section is not to establish paternity.rather,its purpose is to determine whether the man in question has demonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities to be afforded rights not afforded to natural rights to reunification services and custody of the child for this reason,we conclude that in dependency proceedings the term presumed father does not denote a presumption of fatherhood in the evidentiary sense and presumed father status is not rebutted by evidence someone else is the natural father.
the supreme court decisions in kelsey and zacharia and the statutory scheme itself support our conclusion.
on several occasions our supreme court has observed presumed father status,when used to connote a father with financial and social ties to the child,is unrelated to natural father status.in kelsey the court stated a man parentage of a child may be undisputed and legally proven,but he may nevertheless fail to be a presumed father conversely,even if paternity is denied and legally disproved,a man may be deemed,under some circumstances,to be a presumed father.although kelsey was an adoption case,it relied on the same categories in section for determining presumed father status as are used in dependency cases.moreover,in zacharia,which was a dependency case,the court noted it is possible for a man to achieve presumed father status,with its attendant rights and duties,without being the biological father.the court observations suggest in the dependency context the term presumed father is not an evidentiary term but a term of convenience used to identify a preferred class of fathers by reference to the familial bonds described in section which the legislature has determined reasonably approximate the class of fathers it wishes to benefit 
the conclusion presumptive fatherhood is not an evidentiary presumption in the dependency context is also clear from the fact that in dependency proceedings a presumed father has greater rights than a natural father.it would not make sense to use the categories in section simply to establish an evidentiary presumption a man is a natural father when,in the dependency context,being a natural father is a step below being a presumed father.
moreover,if the role of section in a dependency proceeding was merely to establish an evidentiary presumption a man was the child natural father,a man who was already established to be the child natural father before dependency proceedings commenced logically could never become a presumed father because a presumption under the statute would be unnecessary we fail to see the rationality in a system which would confer more rights on a father when his biological tie to the child is unknown than when it is.
we conclude,therefore,paul presumed fatherhood was not rebutted by the trial court decision heriberto is jesusa natural father.as a result,we are left with two conflicting presumptions one favoring heriberto and one favoring paul 
where two or more conflicting presumptions arise under family code section,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.the trial court found awarding presumed father status to paul best comported with the state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and the welfare of the child.the court noted the mother and paul were married and the mother sought refuge with paul after heriberto allegedly beat and raped her.regardless of whether the mother allegations of assault and rape were true,the court found the fact the mother went to paul for aid and comfort demonstrated an important bond between them which would benefit jesusa.in addition,paul was a career military officer,had stable employment,and had never been convicted of a crime.he was the father of and had custody of jesusa and.jesusa had spent considerable time in paul home even before the juvenile court placed her there and had developed a bond with paul and her siblings.the court also found paul has assumed the parental rights and particularly assumed the parental responsibilities of this young child.
for the reasons stated above,we find no error in awarding presumed father status to paul,jesusa,over heriberto,the child biological father.
iii.the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it adjudicated the dependency petition in heriberto absence.
after the trial court determined the presumed father issue the court proceeded to try the jurisdictional issue.heriberto was not present for the reasons explained above,and the trial court again overruled his counsel objection to proceeding in his absence.based on the social workers reports,which incorporated reports from the los angeles county sheriff,the long beach police department,and statements by heriberto,the trial court found a factual basis to find true and sustain the petition by the preponderance of the evidence.
heriberto appeals the finding of jurisdiction contending the trial court failure to provide him an opportunity to appear and testify at the jurisdictional hearing denied him his due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard and his right under penal code section to be physically present at the hearing.we conclude that under penal code section heriberto had an absolute right to be present at the hearing and the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it proceeded without him 
a.the trial court did not deny heriberto his due process right to a meaningful opportunity
