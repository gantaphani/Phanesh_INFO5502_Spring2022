a minor girl minor,appeals from the juvenile court dispositional order granting reunification services to her mother,mother.despite evidence that mother mental illness might make her incapable of reunifying with minor,the court concluded it had no authority to deny services,because mother would not submit to a psychological evaluation as required for denial of services under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.
we conclude a juvenile court has the authority to deny services to a parent who refuses to comply with a valid court order for a psychological evaluation.we reverse the order granting services and remand to give the court and parties an opportunity to determine how they wish to proceed in light of our decision.
factual and procedural backgrounda.dependency petition and detention hearing 
minor was born in january.in march,the riverside county department of public social services dpss filed a dependency petition regarding minor.the petition alleged mother had inflicted serious physical harm on minor,causing a nosebleed and a bruise to her forehead mother was mentally ill and unable to protect minor and minor father could not be located and provided no support for minor.the petition included a police report showing that mother had been arrested for corporal injury to a child,for causing the injuries to minor.
dpss report for the detention hearing stated that at the time mother was arrested,a police officer stated she was incoherent and unable to be interviewed.a maternal aunt who was at the scene said the family had been trying to get mother some mental health help for a long time,to no avail.according to the aunt,mother said things that did not make sense.mother had been trying to prevent relatives from touching minor because she thought this would kill minor.mother also had been saying that t he demons were coming and that she was trying to protect her daughter.mother referred to the relatives and to herself as dead.
the day after the petition was filed,the court ordered minor removed from mother custody.it also authorized a psychological evaluation of mother,to be confidential,and ordered reunification services and visitation for mother.
jurisdictional hearing 
the court set a jurisdictional hearing for april.dpss report for the hearing stated mother had been released on bail after her arrest but had been returned to custody when she failed to appear for a settlement conference in march.when the social worker interviewed mother at the jail in april,mother had a disconnected look on her face.she stated,i am tired of these devil games.she also said,you ca believe anything breanna says,she is dead.when the social worker asked her who breanna was,mother got a disconnected look on her face and said she did not want to talk anymore.
mother mother told the social worker that mother was depressed and acted like she was schizophrenic.she said mother was not in her right state of mind.
the social worker also spoke with minor shelter parents.the shelter mother reported that minor had said,m y mom slapped me.later,minor told the social worker,m y mommy does not like me.
the court continued the jurisdictional hearing to may for receipt of psychological reports.dpss requested two psychological evaluations of mother.however,a question arose whether the evaluations could be performed without mother agreement.
in may,dpss requested a further continuance to obtain the results of a psychological examination of mother.the court again continued the hearing,to june.it also appointed a guardian ad litem for mother.
dpss report for the june jurisdictional hearing recommended mother receive reunification services.however,dpss reported mother was refusing to receive psychological services and had refused to complete psychological evaluations.a doctor had reported that mother refused to leave her cell and refused to speak with him.
in june,the court set the jurisdictional hearing as a contested matter for july.at the july hearing,the court found true all of the jurisdictional allegations of the petition,including the allegation that mother suffered from mental health problems that endangered minor safety and.
dispositional hearing 
following the jurisdictional findings,the court conducted a dispositional hearing.it granted custody of minor to dpss,for placement in a foster home,relative home,or suitable facility.the court ordered no reunification services to minor alleged father,whom dpss had never been able to locate.
counsel for minor argued the court should deny services to mother as well,pending her participation in a psychological evaluation.all parties had stipulated mother had continuously refused to submit to an evaluation.counsel argued that,if a psychological evaluation showed mother mental illness made her unable to benefit from reunification services,the court could deny services pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b hereafter section b.mother should not be allowed to benefit from her refusal to cooperate by receiving services to which she might not be entitled.
counsel for dpss stated dpss wished it could join in counsel for minor argument,but it could not because there was no provision in the statutes for denying services to mother based on her refusal to be evaluated.therefore,dpss recommended services be granted to mother.
the court ruled t he court does not feel that it has the jurisdiction to take the leap of finding that mother failure to comply with the court ordered testing renders her incapable of benefiting from reunification services in this matter although a person has not cooperated in participating in the evaluation where the court ordered such an assessment to be made,the l egislature has not given us the tools to jump to the next level from finding that the person is incapable.this is possibly an area where the l egislature should act and indicate that the court can make such an inference based on the parent failure to participate in the examination,but i think lacking the underlying facts for the court to make a factual finding that b sic exists by clear and convincing evidence,i just do think the court can go there,and therefore,services are offered to the mother.
discussiona.denial of reunification services under section b 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a provides that whenever a child is removed from a parent custody,the juvenile court shall order reunification services for the parents e xcept as provided in subdivision b subdivision b of section provides that services need not be provided when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that any of enumerated circumstances is true.
we are concerned in this case with section b,which states that services need not be provided where the parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability that is described in chapter commencing with section of part of division of the family code and that renders him or her incapable of utilizing those services.
family code section is part of the chapter of the family code referred to in welfare and institutions code section b.section provides that a proceeding may be brought,outside of the dependency context,to free a child from parental custody and control where the parent or parents are mentally disabled and are likely to remain so in the foreseeable future,subd.b.section defines mentally disabled to mean that a parent or parents suffer a mental incapacity or disorder that renders the parent or parents unable to care for and control the child adequately,subd.a.
family code section,subdivision c requires that a finding of mental disability be supported by the evidence of any two experts,each of whom must be a psychiatrist or psychologist meeting educational and experience requirements.welfare and institutions code section b does not expressly state that it incorporates the requirement of two expert opinions.however,courts have found that it does.see,in re joy th,d linda superior court th,d curtis superior court th,d.
thus it can be seen that mother refusal to submit to a psychological evaluation placed the court in an untenable position it could not,without evaluations from two experts,find mother was suffering from a mental disability as described in family code section,subdivision c.therefore,it could not,under welfare and institutions code section b,find she was incapable of utilizing reunification services and deny services to her on that basis.the court accordingly believed it was bound to offer services to mother,notwithstanding the evidence suggesting denial of services under section b might be shown to be appropriate if a psychological evaluation were obtained.
disentitlement doctrine 
in macpherson macpherson cal d,a father removed his children from california to mexico in violation of a divorce decree.his former wife obtained a judgment requiring him to pay her attorney fees and costs incurred in trying to locate the children.the supreme court held the father violation of the divorce decree precluded him from appealing from the judgment awarding fees and costs,stating a party to an action can not,with right or reason,ask the aid and assistance of a court in hearing his demands while he stands in an attitude of contempt to legal orders and processes of the courts of this state.citations.id.at.
the principle that a court may refuse assistance to a party who fails to comply with a court order has been applied in a dependency proceeding.in in re kamelia th,d,a father absconded with his daughter,a dependent child whom the juvenile court had placed in a foster home.citing macpherson macpherson,supra,cal d,the court held the father was barred by the doctrine of disentitlement from appealing from the placement order.it found the father conduct undermined and frustrated the entire purpose of the dependency law by making it virtually impossible for the court to extend its protection to the child at a completely unknown location.the father was entirely responsible for paralyzing the court ability to implement the procedures intended to benefit the interests of the dependent minor.in re kamelia at,d.the court further held the father was precluded from seeking the assistance of the court even though he had not initiated the dependency proceeding that led to the order he violated.id.at,d see also in re guardianship of melissa th,d grandparents could not appeal from denial of their guardianship petition where they had caused minor to be removed to bahamas in violation of court order adoption of jacob th,d disentitlement doctrine barred mother who had abducted child from contesting stepmother petition to terminate mother parental rights to other child.
although the above decisions involved abduction of children,the principle they articulate extends to other kinds of conduct.in particular,it extends to conduct that,as in this case,frustrates the ability of another party to obtain information it needs to protect its own legal rights.in tms,aihara th,d,judgment debtors refused to comply with a court order to answer postjudgment interrogatories designed to secure information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment against them.the court dismissed their appeal from the judgment,holding it had the inherent power to do so without a judgment of contempt.id.at,d.
mother refusal to participate in a psychological evaluation in this case is comparable to the conduct of the parties in the above cases,which was held to bar their right to seek the assistance of the courts.mother conduct makes it impossible for the court to perform its obligation to determine,pursuant to section b,whether her mental disability renders her incapable of utilizing reunification services.mother conduct also interferes with the legal rights of minor.if mother is,in fact,incapable of utilizing services,minor is entitled to have her case proceed to the permanency planning stage without the delay of months or more that must be afforded if reunification services are provided to mother.see welf,subds.a,f.while this may not seem a long period of time to an adult,it can be a lifetime to a young child.in re marilyn cal th,d.mother,like the offending father in kamelia,is entirely responsible for paralyzing the court ability to implement the procedures intended to benefit the interests of the dependent minor.in re kamelia,supra,th at,d.
the legislature could not have intended this result when it enacted section b.the requirement of two expert evaluations incorporated into that provision implicitly assumes a cooperative parent who will submit to the evaluations.where,as here,the parent is not cooperative,a court has the inherent power under the disentitlement doctrine to bar that parent from seeking further assistance from the court,including the provision of reunification services.the legislature could not have intended otherwise.
application of the disentitlement doctrine is particularly appropriate in the context of reunification services.reunification services are a benefit,and there is no constitutional entitlement to these services.in re joshua th,d.if,as the decisions discussed above hold,a party can be precluded by its contumacious conduct from exercising its statutory right of appeal,the rule of preclusion should apply equally to mother right under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a to receive reunification services.mother should not be permitted to create a classic catch situation in which the court must extend her services because it can not determine whether,in fact,she is actually entitled to them.
intent to interfere 
mother argues application of the disentitlement doctrine requires a showing of mens rea,that the offending party had the specific intent to undermine,defy,or impede the court,and there was no showing she had that intent.we do not find in the decisions applying the disentitlement doctrine any such requirement.in fact,as dpss points out,in the cases involving child abduction the offending parties whereabouts were unknown,so their actual mental states could not be determined.and courts have repeatedly stated that application of the disentitlement doctrine is appropriate notwithstanding the fact the offending party has not been found in contempt of court.guardianship of melissa,supra,th,d tms,aihara,supra,th,d see also adoption of jacob,supra,th,d court noted juvenile court had not found mother in contempt,but applied disentitlement doctrine nonetheless.
it is true that in the above cases there was no suggestion the offending parties suffered from mental disability,as there is in this case.but even where a party mental condition is in doubt,the courts have held he or she can properly be required to submit to a psychological evaluation and to suffer adverse consequences in the event of a refusal.in baqleh superior court th,d,defense counsel raised the issue whether the defendant was competent to stand trial.the court held the trial court had the authority to order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric psychological examination by prosecution experts.id.at,d.it further held that if the defendant refused to submit the court could impose an issue sanction,an order that the issues to which the examination related be taken as established in favor of the prosecution.id.at,d see code civ,subd.b,subd.f.
in people carpenter cal th,d,after the defense presented expert testimony about the defendant mental condition in the penalty phase of a capital prosecution,the court ordered the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by the prosecution expert.the defendant refused to talk to the examiner.the court instructed the jury that if it found the defendant refusal was willful,it could consider that when weighing the defense expert testimony.the supreme court held the instruction was proper,stating defendant had no right to refuse to cooperate with the psychologist,so the jury could properly consider his refusal.citation.the jury could properly infer that defendant wanted only his experts,not others,to evaluate him,an inference relevant to its consideration of all the evidence of his mental condition.id.at,d.
neither of these decisions required a finding that the defendant acted with the specific intent to impede the court before he could suffer adverse consequences for not submitting to an evaluation.the instruction a
