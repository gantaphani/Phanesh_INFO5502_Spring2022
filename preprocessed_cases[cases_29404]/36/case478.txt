this appeal requires us to consider competing claims to the proceeds of two annuity contracts issued by teachers insurance and annuity association and college retirement equities fund.the annuitant,dale bryner,died in.dale,marilyn stillman,asserted that she was entitled to the annuity benefits because she was the beneficiary designated in the contracts.marilyn claim conflicted with the claim of erin jun bryner,dale daughter from his subsequent marriage to yaeko bryner.erin based her claim on a amendment to utah uniform probate code,utah code ann,which revokes upon divorce a designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of an annuity or similar asset.
sought interpleader relief under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the claimants filed for summary judgment.ruling that the amendment did not apply because the beneficiary designations and divorce occurred before,the district court awarded marilyn the annuity benefits.erin and yaeko appeal.our jurisdiction arises under.
we vacate the district court rulings on the summary judgment motions and remand for further proceedings.we hold that applies even when the beneficiary designation and divorce predate the statute effective date.section is a rule of construction,and utah code ann.provides that rules of construction in the amendments apply to documents executed before july.we also hold that application of in this case does not violate the contract clause of the united states constitution or the comparable utah constitutional provision.
background 
in dale purchased two annuities from.at the time of this purchase,dale was married to marilyn,and the couple had two who now takes the name nicolas bryner caravaglia and patrick.under the annuity contracts issued to dale,a designated beneficiary would receive death benefits if the annuitant died before annuity payments began.dale named marilyn stillman as the primary beneficiary and his children as the contingent beneficiaries.
in dale and marilyn divorced.their divorce decree did not refer to the annuities.the next year dale married yaeko.they had one child,erin,born in.in,and again in,dale purchased new annuity contracts,naming yaeko as the primary beneficiary and erin as the contingent beneficiary.after learning that he had cancer,dale made a will in january in which he left all his property to yaeko and designated erin as the contingent beneficiary.the will specifically stated that dale was not providing for nicolas and patrick,the children from his marriage to marilyn.patrick had actually predeceased dale,but dale apparently did not have certain knowledge of this event.
dale died in february.a year later marilyn and nicolas filed suit against in federal district court.their complaint alleged that marilyn is entitled to the proceeds from the annuities dale had purchased in,because dale had designated marilyn as the beneficiary of the annuities and had never changed this designation using the procedures outlined in the annuity contracts.among the forms of relief sought by marilyn and nicolas was a declaration stating 
that the annuities are valid and enforceable,that stillman is the properly designated primary beneficiary under the annuities,that no one other than the plaintiffs in this case has any right to or interest in the benefits of the annuities,and that must immediately disburse the benefits of annuities to stillman in the manner directed by her for the benefit of herself and plaintiff nicolas bryner caravaglia 
filed a counterclaim for interpleader under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,noting that yaeko and erin had also asserted entitlement to the annuity benefits,and naming as defendants marilyn,nicolas,yaeko,and erin.the district court entered an order granting request for leave to deposit the proceeds of the annuities with the court and to be dismissed from the action.
erin then filed a,seeking a declaration that she and nicolas are the true beneficiaries of the annuity benefits and that she is entitled to the proceeds.the further requested that the court declare that marilyn is entitled to nothing from the annuities.
the two sets of and nicolas appellees on one side,and erin and yaeko appellants on the for summary judgment.the parties agreed that there were no disputed questions of material fact.following a hearing the court entered an order granting appellees motion and denying appellants motion.the court ruled that marilyn stillman is solely entitled to all of the proceeds of the annuities and that yaeko bryner and erin jun bryner are entitled to take nothing under the contracts.app.at.appellants filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,which the court denied.they then filed this appeal.
because this is a diversity case,we apply the substantive law of utah.we follow federal law,however,regarding the standard for granting summary judgment.eck parke,davis,cir.given that the parties agreed that there are no disputed issues of material fact and moved for summary judgment,we must examine whether either party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.this requires a de novo review of the legal determinations of the district court.employee trs.of eighth dist.pension fund employer trs.of eighth dist.pension fund,cir internal citations omitted.
ii.discussion 
application of 
until,t he general rule in utah was that divorce alone does not terminate a former spouse rights as a survivor beneficiary of an insurance policy,ira,or retirement benefits estate of anello mcqueen,utah.u nless a property settlement or divorce decree evidence d a clear intent to the contrary,a divorce did not change the former spouse status as the survivor beneficiary.id.
in,however,the utah legislature enacted a statute which creates essentially the opposite presumption.utah code.ann.states 
except as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument,a court order,or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate made between the divorced individuals before or after the marriage,divorce,or annulment,the divorce or annulment of a marriage 
a revokes any revocable 
i disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to his former spouse in a governing instrument 
the utah uniform probate code generally defines governing instrument to encompass a number of documents,including a deed,will,trust,and insurance or annuity policy.for purposes of,a g overning instrument is a governing instrument executed by the divorced individual before the divorce d.under,p rovisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section 
the utah legislature modeled this statute on of the uniform probate code.see terry kogan and michael thomson,piercing the facade of utah improved elective share statute,utah,in,the utah legislature adopted major amendments to the utah uniform probate code,in an attempt to align the state code with the latest version of the uniform probate code,adopted by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws in.such provisions reflect a recognition that the property owner is unlikely to wish to benefit her former spouse and,had she thought about it,probably would have revoked the beneficiary designation.gary spitko,the expressive function of succession law and the merits of inclusion.
this appeal turns on whether the rule set forth in applies to marilyn designation as the beneficiary of the annuities purchased in.appellees contend that applying would have an improper retroactive effect,because the provision would govern naming of marilyn as the beneficiary,as well as dale and marilyn occurred prior to the statute enactment in.appellants counter that under the provisions of the probate code,a rule of construction such as applies regardless of the date of the beneficiary designation.they further argue that there is no retroactivity issue here because marilyn expectancy interest in the annuity proceeds would have become a vested right only upon dale event that occurred after the enactment of the statute.
a few words about retroactivity will help frame our discussion of the parties arguments.courts generally construe statutes to avoid retroactive application.t he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.landgraf usi film,d see also norman singer,sutherland statutory construction at hereinafter sutherland there is general consensus that notice or warning of the rule should be given in advance of the actions whose effects are to be judged.utah courts have,unsurprisingly,adopted a presumption against retroactivity in statutory construction,see madsen borthick,utah and the presumption has been codified by the legislature,see utah code ann.no part of these revised statutes is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.
the principal difficulty in applying the nonretroactivity presumption is in determining what constitutes retroactivity in a particular context.to determine whether a statute is being applied retroactively,it is necessary to compare two dates the date the statute went into effect and the date of the activity to which the statute applies.the effective date of a statute is rarely an issue.but arguments abound about what activity is targeted by the statute.consider,for example,the application of a new rule of evidence in a trial.is such an application retroactive if the events at issue in the trial proof of which may be affected by the new evidentiary rule predate the rule enactment or if the lawsuit was filed before the rule enactment or is the rule as long as it applies only to trials conducted after its enactment 
no one has succeeded in formulating a test for retroactivity that performs well in all contexts.see landgraf,at.any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases,and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.as a leading authority on statutory construction has explained,judicial opinions are full of standards which purport to govern decision concerning the legality of retroactive application of new law.sutherland,supra,at.all these various formulations,however,reflect a common core.see landgraf,at.elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d scalia,concurring the presumption of nonretroactivity gives effect to enduring notions of what is fair,and thus accords with what legislators almost always intend.sutherland,supra,at judicial attempts to explain whether protection against retroactive interference will be extended disclose that elementary considerations of fairness and justice govern the decision.fairness concerns,by the way,rarely counsel application of decisions.see generally melvin eisenberg,the nature of the common law discussing prospective overruling.
against this background,we consider the retroactivity issue in this case whether the provision set forth in,a provision enacted in,can operate to revoke marilyn designation as beneficiary,when both the conduct giving rise to the designation the purchase of the annuity contracts in and the conduct giving rise to its potential revocation the divorce occurred many years before the legislation was passed,but the event that vested the parties rights dale death postdated the enactment.
appellants maintain that two provisions of the utah uniform probate code authorize the application of here.first,the contains the following provision,enacted in connection with the code initial adoption in any rule of construction or presumption provided in this code applies to instruments executed and accounts opened before the effective date unless there is a clear indication of a contrary intent.utah code ann.e.the also includes a similar statement applying to the code provisions adopted in which include.section states,any rule of construction or presumption provided in these provisions applies to governing instruments executed before july,unless there is a finding of a contrary intent.because specifically addresses the amendments,we restrict our attention to it.hall utah state of,utah w hen two statutory provisions conflict in their operation,the provision more specific in application governs over the more general provision.
under,if the rule of is a rule of construction,then it applies to the governing instruments in this designations of the beneficiaries of the two annuities.of course,to the extent that the legislature has spoken through its enactments regarding the application of a statute,the presumption against retroactivity is ineffective.the presumption is not irrebuttable.see landgraf,at.t he court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.if congress has done so,there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.nevertheless,consideration of nonretroactivity principles can inform our understanding of whether the legislature has indeed spoken with respect to the matter at issue.we therefore turn to an examination of the meaning of rule of construction in light of nonretroactivity principles.
rules of construction tell us how to construe legal documents.see lewis simes,handbook of the law of future interests at ed.the word construction may be defined as the process of ascertaining the meaning of a written instrument in the light of the circumstances of its execution and in accordance with judicial standards and assumptions.the appropriate rule of construction depends on the nature of the document.for example,construction of contracts is generally guided by the objective theory of is important is what the language of the document conveys to reasonable people in the circumstances,not what a party to the agreement privately intended.see,restatement second of contracts cmt.b explaining that by defining the existence of a promise according to the manifestation of intention,the restatement adopts an external or objective standard for interpreting conduct it means the external expression of intention as distinguished from undisclosed intention.
in contrast,in the law of donative transfers the modern approach is to give effect to what the donor intended,regardless of how precisely that intent was expressed in the operative document.the drafters of the revisions to article ii of the uniform probate code,upon which the utah revisions are based,noted that the revisions were an attempt to respond to several developments in probate law,including the decline of formalism in favor of policies.prefatory note to revised article ii,uniform probate code at.thus,in the law of donative transfers,rules of construction aid in determining and giving effect to the donor intention or probable intention restatement third of property wills other donative transfers cmt.a see id.cmt.g in the absence of evidence that establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the particular donor intention differs from common intention,ambiguities are resolved to the extent possible by construing the document to accord with common intention.
the application of an rule of construction to a preexisting document does not raise the fairness concerns underlying the presumption against retroactivity.when a rule of construction reflects a donor probable intent,applying that rule does not disrupt settled expectations.to the contrary,applying the rule should result in a construction of the instrument that conforms with the donor expectations.statement of the joint editorial board for uniform probate code regarding the constitutionality of changes in default rules as applied to documents at hereinafter statement of joint editorial board the distinctive attribute of default rules is that they represent an attempt to protect rather than defeat the decedent reliance.moreover,a rule of construction is not insuperable it can be overcome by a clear expression of contrary intent.to be sure,if a rule of construction from one presumption to the opposite may be unfair to apply the new presumption to someone who organized his or her affairs in reliance on the former presumption.but that difficulty is ameliorated if the person has time to make the necessary adjustments after the new presumption becomes effective.
in our view,the provision set forth in is a rule of construction,and thus falls within coverage of the provision.the reasons for applying rules of construction to preexisting documents apply in the case of.the statute attempts to effectuate the intention of the donor.the uniform probate code provision on which is modeled derives from the recognition that when spouses are sufficiently unhappy with each other that they obtain a divorce,neither is likely to want to transfer his or her property to the survivor on death.statement of joint editorial board,supra,at.statutes reflect the legislative judgment that when the transferor leaves unaltered a will or trust or insurance beneficiary designation in favor of an,this failure to designate substitute takers more likely than not represents inattention rather than intention.id.at.thus,attributes an intent to the donor based on an assessment of a typical donor intention.we also note that this statutory attribution of intent is rebuttable.it applies e xcept as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument such as an annuity contract,a court order,or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate utah code ann.
applying to the annuity beneficiary designations does not raise the concerns addressed by the presumption against retroactivity.dale had the right to change beneficiaries at any time during his lifetime.the purpose of the was to effectuate his intent at the time of his death.there is no unfairness in presuming that his desires if he had stopped to consider them regarding the beneficiaries changed when he was divorced.of course,it is theoretically possible that dale wished to maintain marilyn as his beneficiary and that his reason for not making this desire explicit is that he was relying on the presumption in utah law that his designation would continue after the divorce.but as long as we are considering theoretical possibilities,one who was familiar with case law is likely also to know of the statute,and dale had sufficient time to adjust to the statutory reversal of presumptions.indeed,dale met with a lawyer and prepared a new not only marilyn but also his children by enactment of the amendments.
appellees suggest that should not be treated as a rule of construction because of the provision placement within the organizational scheme of the chapter,part of the code is entitled rules of construction for governing instruments.another part,part,contains the rules of construction for wills.the utah legislature did not place the provision in part,but instead placed it in part,entitled general provisions.appellees argue that w ere the statute indeed a rule of construction,the legislature surely would have so indicated,and included the rule where it allegedly belongs,with the code rules of construction for governing instruments in part seven.aple.br.at.therefore,they conclude,the provision reference to rules of construction can not be interpreted as extending to the rule in.
we disagree with appellees analysis.by its terms,the provision in does not limit its scope to rules of construction set forth within part.it does not state that a ny rule of construction or presumption provided in part applies to governing instruments executed before july,section instead uses broader language,referring to a ny rule of construction or presumption provided in these provisions the word provisions undoubtedly refers to all provisions added by the amendments.
furthermore,the language of itself implies that it is intended to apply to provisions that do not appear in parts and.section states any rule of construction or presumption provided in these provisions applies to governing instruments executed before july,unless there is a finding of a contrary intent.emphasis added.the phrase unless there is a finding of a contrary intent is superfluous when addressing provisions in parts and because all those provisions are dependent on the absence of a finding of contrary intent.see in the absence of a finding of a contrary intention,the rules of construction in this part control the construction of a will.id.in the absence of a finding of a contrary intention,the rules of construction in this part control the construction of a governing instrument.unless we assume that the last nine words of were added as a mere rhetorical would be contrary to proper statutory construction,see united states brown,cir court should refrain from construing a statute so as to render words superfluous this provision must apply to provisions not included in parts or.
we draw additional support for our view that is a rule of construction from an article by lawrence waggoner,director of research and chief reporter for the uniform probate code.as previously noted,the is modeled on the uniform probate code.like the utah version of the code,the uniform probate code devotes two parts to rules of construction article ii,part contains the rules of construction applicable only to wills and part contains the rules of construction applicable to wills and other governing instruments.also like the utah code,the uniform probate code places the provision in part part containing general provisions concerning probate and nonprobate transfers.if appellees analysis of the organization of utah probate code were correct,it would also apply to the organization of the uniform probate provision could not be a rule of construction,because it is not included within one of the parts expressly labeled rules of construction.but in an article addressing the revisions to the uniform probate code,professor waggoner describes the rule set forth in as a rule of construction that should apply to documents predating the provision enactment.see lawrence waggoner,spousal rights in our society the revised uniform probate code,real prop.prob.tr,see also id.at noting the joint editorial board view that merely establishes a rule of construction.professor waggoner view is entitled to particular respect because of his prominent role in drafting the uniform probate code as well as the imprimatur given his article by the commentary to uniform probate code,which states that t he theory of this section is discussed in waggoner article.comment to at.
appellees also argue that this case presents a timing issue other than whether a statute extends to documents predating the statute enactment.they contend that the date of a couple divorce,relative to the statute effective date,is also relevant in determining whether it is proper to apply.appellees suggest that one of the grounds supporting that a decedent can avoid automatic by making contrary provisions in a divorce decree,aple.br.at undercut if the statute is applied retroactively to divorces obtained decades before the statute was passed.id.
appellees argument does not withstand analysis.consider who would wish to provide in the divorce decree or property settlement that the former spouse is entitled to remain the beneficiary of the annuity.we first consider the wishes of the annuitant,although dale wishes do not appear to be appellees principal interest.it would be remarkable if the annuitant would have wished to have his future freedom of choice restricted by having the beneficiary mandated in,say,the divorce decree.of course,there is a possibility that even after divorce the annuitant would wish to retain the former spouse as beneficiary but that could be accomplished any time after divorce with a revocable designation of the former spouse.moreover,even if that were the annuitant desire,the enactment of changed nothing in that regard.even under former law the annuitant would have had freedom to change the beneficiary absent a restriction in the divorce decree or property settlement agreement.thus,the annuitant can not claim that it would be unfair to apply just because it is now too late to place a beneficiary designation in the divorce decree.
the still less ground for complaint.if the beneficiary wanted the beneficiary designation to be irrevocable,the beneficiary would have had the same incentive under former law as under to impose that condition in the divorce decree or property settleme
