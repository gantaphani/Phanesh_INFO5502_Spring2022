introduction 
the california supreme court held,in le francois goel cal th,d,le francois,that even when code of civil procedure section section precludes a party from moving for reconsideration,a trial court has inherent authority to correct an erroneous ruling on its own motion.in this marital dissolution case,the trial judge denied a motion filed by the wife.she promptly filed a motion for reconsideration.the trial judge determined that the motion did not in fact meet the requirements of section,but also that his earlier ruling had been erroneous.accordingly,the judge reversed himself,and granted the relief sought by the wife.
we conclude that the trial court inherent authority to correct its errors applies even when the trial court was prompted to reconsider its prior ruling by a motion filed in violation of section.because that is what occurred in the present case,we affirm the trial court order.
facts and procedural background 
appellant aubin barthold aubin and respondent catherine barthold kay were married in may,and separated in june aubin filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage in july.after the separation,kay remained in the community property family home in piedmont,while aubin moved first to san francisco and then to seattle.in february,they entered into a marital settlement agreement msa,which was incorporated into a judgment.the msa provided that the family home would be sold,and the proceeds distributed between the parties.because aubin was anxious to realize the proceeds from the sale as soon as possible,the msa included provisions giving kay incentives to cooperate in getting the house sold quickly.
specifically,the msa,as originally drafted,provided that kay would receive certain sums from aubin share of the sale proceeds if kay signed both the msa and the listing agreement by march,the listing bonus and the parties accepted an offer to purchase the home by may,the signing bonus.a handwritten addendum to the listing bonus clause provided that the listing bonus would only be payable if the property is listed in the mls multiple listing service by march,unless that listing is delayed at the suggestion of the broker.in that case,either party may apply to the court for an order requiring the listing.capitalization in original.the handwritten addendum was inserted by kay attorney,with aubin consent,just before the msa was signed by the parties.
kay moved out of the home by the end of february,and on march,informed aubin that she had done so the home was not listed in the mls until after march,however.after the home was sold,the parties agreed that kay was entitled to the signing bonus,under an extension of the deadline to which aubin had agreed,but disagreed as to her entitlement to the listing bonus.kay therefore filed a motion seeking to establish her right to the listing bonus.
kay declaration in support of the motion asserted that i am entitled by the msa to the listing bonus if i signed all of the documents for the listing by march,and the listing was delayed at the suggestion of the broker.i met both those conditions.she stated that aubin had come to california on march to move his possessions out of the house,but had left town on march without completing the task.she averred that at that point,it was obvious that the house could not be listed by the target date of march,and our broker had no choice but to suggest that the listing be delayed.she explained that at aubin request,she and their sons had moved some of the rest of aubin possessions between march and march,and that a fter that the broker decided she had to postpone the listing even further.finally,kay argued that i did everything i could to get this house sold expeditiously.the delay was entirely the responsibility of aubin and the broker made sensible decisions to postpone the listing in view of aubin failure to perform the work he was supposed to do.
in his opposition to kay motion,aubin took the position that the handwritten addendum to the msa was intended to require kay to get court permission for any delay in listing the house,if she wished to recover the listing bonus despite the delay.he noted that no such permission had been obtained either from him or from the court,and also averred that the broker had never suggested to him that the deadline for listing the home be extended,and that neither the broker nor kay attorney had ever contacted him or his attorney about extending it.he also outlined the steps he had taken,on short notice,to remove his belongings from the house during the first two weeks of march.he argued kay evidence that the broker recommended the listing delay was insufficient,but did not produce any evidence that the broker had not actually made such a recommendation.instead,the principal argument in his memorandum of points and authorities was that the broker recommendation was not sufficient to preserve kay right to the listing bonus unless one of the parties requested and obtained court approval for the delay.
in his order filed july,the trial judge rejected aubin position that kay was under an obligation to go to court to seek permission to have the listing delayed.accordingly,the judge identified as the real question the issue whether the listing was in fact delayed at the broker suggestion.on this question,the judge characterized kay statement in her declaration that the broker had no choice but to suggest that the listing be delayed as constituting weasel words that do not say directly that the broker suggested anything.accordingly,since no declaration from the broker had been submitted,and kay could not bring herself to swear under oath that the broker suggested the delay,the court declined to find that the broker did so,and ruled that kay was not entitled to the listing bonus.
on july,kay filed a motion for reconsideration under section.in support of the motion,kay filed a declaration explaining that she had not realized,when she filed her original declaration,that there would be any dispute that the broker had in fact suggested the listing delay.she also supplied a declaration from the broker verifying that the delay was at the broker recommendation,because the home was not ready for showing and sale by march.
in his opposition to kay motion,aubin argued that kay had presented no new or different facts,and that to the extent she had presented new evidence,she had provided no satisfactory explanation for her failure to present it with the original motion.aubin also submitted a declaration reiterating that the broker had never suggested or even mentioned to him that the listing date should be postponed.he also contended that kay should be sanctioned for filing the motion under section,subdivision d.
in his order filed september,the trial judge stated at the outset that w hen i ruled on this case in july,i completely missed the most important point.at that time the parties were not seriously contesting whether the real estate broker had asked to have the listing delayed.now that i realize the true situation,kay somewhat oblique statement in her declaration does make sense.he went on to say that he had reread aubin opposition to the original motion,and that the thrust of aubin argument at that time was not that the broker had failed to make the recommendation,but that kay had not sought a court order authorizing the delay.
the remaining body of the trial judge order of september,reads as follows although a party who makes a motion under s ection must strictly follow the requirements of that section in bringing the motion,the court has inherent authority to correct a mistaken ruling if this is done before the ruling becomes final.so,if the court clearly made a mistake in interpreting what the parties were contending at an earlier hearing,the injustice can be fixed.see darling,hall rae kritt th,d i find that there never was a legitimate dispute about whether the broker had recommended that the listing be delayed.i do not buy the suggestion made at the last hearing that there really was a genuine dispute about this.as to the issue that the parties were actually arguing at the july kay had to apply to the court for an order extending the listing or else the delay would not be excuse d my answer is no.she did not have to go to court to be excused from the delay as long as the broker had recommended it.
the court concluded by ordering that the motion for reconsideration is granted.kay is entitled to the listing bonus.neither party is awarded attorney fees or sanctions with regard to this matter.on november,aubin filed a timely notice of appeal from this order 
discussion 
as both parties to this appeal recognize,the controlling california supreme court case on the issue of a trial court authority to reconsider an order on its own motion is le francois,supra,cal th,d.in le francois,the defendants motion for summary judgment was denied.more than a year later,some of the same defendants moved for summary judgment on the same grounds,and this time,a different judge granted the motion.the supreme court granted review to resolve a conflict between the courts of appeal regarding whether a trial court could reverse its own earlier ruling on a motion under its inherent power,despite language in section,subdivision e,purporting to deprive courts of jurisdiction to do so the court concluded that section,as well as a similar provision in the summary judgment statute,subd.f the reconsideration statutes,would violate separation of powers principles unless they were interpreted to prohibit a party from making renewed motions not based on new facts or law,but not to limit a court ability to reconsider its previous interim orders on its own motion,as long as it gives the parties notice that it may do so and a reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.le francois,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original see also id.at,d.
nonetheless,the supreme court reversed,because in the case before it,the record reflected that the second judge had not acted on his own motion,but rather,had granted the defendants renewed summary judgment motion even though that motion did not comply with the reconsideration statutes.le francois,supra,cal th at,d.in reaching this result,the court explained that w e can not prevent a party from communicating the view to a court that it should reconsider a prior ruling,and that it should not matter whether the judge has an unprovoked flash of understanding in the middle of the night citation or acts in response to a party suggestion.if a court believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous,it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief.id.at,d.
in this case,although the trial court reconsideration of its earlier order was not the result of an unprovoked flash of understanding on the part of the judge,it clearly was intended to correct an order that the court had come to believe was erroneous.while ordinarily that should end the analysis,aubin refers to the next paragraph of the supreme court opinion in le francois,where the court noted that u nless the requirements of the reconsideration statutes are satisfied,any action to reconsider a prior interim order must formally begin with the court on its own motion.le francois,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.because the trial court action was prompted by kay motion for reconsideration,which the order stated was being granted,aubin argues that the reconsideration did not formally begin with the court on its own motion.
in response,kay points out that despite the wording of the order,it is clear that the judge was firmly convinced he had made an error,and intended,by his order granting reconsideration,to correct that error.moreover,the judge recognized the problem posed by section and expressly relied on the court inherent authority in changing its earlier ruling.thus,kay relies on the supreme court statement in le francois that it does not matter how the trial court came to believe its order was wrong.le francois,supra,cal th at,d.
we conclude that le francois simply requires that the trial court reconsider a prior ruling based on its own realization that the ruling was erroneous,and not based upon a determination that the motion to reconsider should itself be granted on its merits.aubin contends that even so,the trial judge went beyond what is permitted by le francois,in that he did not reverse himself solely because his prior ruling was in error,but instead took into consideration the new evidence submitted with kay motion for reconsideration.
we do not find any factual support in the record for this contention.moreover,while it is true that the judge order stated that the motion for reconsideration was being granted,in context,it is clear that the judge intent was to grant reconsideration on the court own motion.the court based its decision to reconsider on the court inherent authority to do so,once it realized that a mistake had been made.kay motion for reconsideration was brought on the new evidence that the broker had agreed to the delay in listing,and the motion was supported by a declaration from the broker to that effect.however,the judge stated that the basis for his ruling was his rereading of the papers submitted with the original motion,and the order did not rely on or even mention kay additional evidence.the evidence submitted with the original motion is clearly sufficient to support the court ultimate ruling that kay was entitled to the listing bonus,and aubin does not argue otherwise on appeal in light of these circumstances,we conclude that in stating that kay motion for reconsideration was granted,the court simply meant that it was providing the relief sought by the motion,and did not mean to say that it was granting the motion itself.
nonetheless,aubin argues that an order granting reconsideration must be reversed if its issuance was prompted by the filing of a motion for reconsideration that did not meet the requirements of the reconsideration statutes.we disagree.there is nothing in the supreme court opinion in le francois that justifies this conclusion.to the contrary,an examination of the result in le francois provides support for the opposite conclusion.although the court reversed the order granting summary judgment on reconsideration,it also declined to hold that the case had to go to trial.instead,it expressly stated that o n remand,nothing prohibits the court from reconsidering its previous ruling on its own motion,a point on which we express no opinion.id.at,d,italics in original,fn.omitted.thus,it is clear that a party filing of a motion for reconsideration in violation of the reconsideration statutes does not erect a permanent,insurmountable barrier to reconsideration by the trial court on its own motion.
furthermore,both of the cases on which aubin relies in support of his argument to the contrary are distinguishable.in kerns cse ins.group th,d kerns,the defendant insurer filed a motion for summary judgment that was denied by the law and motion judge.id.at,d.when the case was assigned to a different judge for trial,the parties waived jury trial,and stipulated that the parties could file for summary judgment or summary adjudication.the defendant then simply refiled its original summary judgment motion,verbatim,without any additional evidence or argument.id.at,d.the trial judge granted the motion,and the plaintiff appealed.
the court of appeal reviewed the case law regarding whether section was issue that had not yet been resolved by the supreme court at that agreed with those courts that had held that trial courts have the inherent power to reconsider and correct their own interim decisions in order to achieve substantial justice.citations.kerns,supra,th at,d.nonetheless,the court reversed the trial court order granting summary judgment,because a s applied to the circumstances of this which the law and motion judge previous denial of summary judgment was clearly put in issue not on the trial court own motion but instead by the defendant verbatim reapplication for summary provisions of section were jurisdictional and controlling.id.at,d.the defendant actions,the court held,were difficult to distinguish from the kind of brazen forum shopping section is specifically intended to bar.citation.ibid.in addition,the court found that the tri
