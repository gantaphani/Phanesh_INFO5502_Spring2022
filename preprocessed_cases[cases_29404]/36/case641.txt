mother challenges the juvenile court jurisdictional and dispositional order regarding her two children,born in and lamar,born in.although mother concedes jurisdiction was proper due to her substance abuse,she contends that findings made in connection with a subsequent petition were insufficient to establish jurisdiction and should be reversed.specifically,she argues her failure to obtain a protective order following a domestic violence incident with father did not expose the children to a current risk of harm and the evidence was insufficient to establish that she knew or should have known of lamar father criminal history and sex offender status and placed the children at risk of harm by allowing him access to them.we agree with both contentions and modify the order to strike the allegations based on mother failure to protect the children from father counts b,b,and d.the order is affirmed in all other respects.
factual and procedural summary 
on december,mother consumed either a pack of wine or six medium bottles of brandy and ingested a lot of pain pills and psychotropic medication before getting into her car with and mother pulled the car over and called when she became dizzy and began vomiting.an ambulance took mother and the children to a hospital,where a relative picked up the children and mother was treated for depression and acute alcohol intoxication.a mandated reporter contacted the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs.
dcfs filed a petition pursuant to welfare institutions code section,subdivision b.dcfs alleged mother history of substance and alcohol abuse and emotional problems rendered her incapable of providing regular care and supervision of the children and placed them at risk of physical and emotional harm and damage.
mother was cooperative with dcfs.she acknowledged her history of mental health and substance abuse issues and expressed a willingness to address those issues.mother also informed dcfs that she broke up with father in due to spousal abuse and had not known his whereabouts since then.according to mother initial statement,father had not had contact or visits with the children.however,she later stated on a parentage questionnaire that father had received the child in home.and both stated that they have not heard or seen their father for a long time,and stated she had never seen anyone hit mother.dcfs ran a parent locator search for father on december,and found only an unverified address.
the juvenile court heard the petition on december.the court found that dcfs made a prima facie showing of jurisdiction and ordered the children detained with their maternal grandfather.the court granted mother a minimum of six hours of monitored visitation per week and gave dcfs discretion to place the children with mother at her inpatient treatment program.the court ordered dcfs to present evidence of due diligence in attempting to locate father before the next hearing,which was set for april.
dcfs filed a report on march.the report noted mother was eager to comply with dcfs case plan and court orders to get her children back into her care and was progressing well in her inpatient treatment program.the report also indicated mother had spoken to dcfs about father.according to the report,mother informed dcfs that she had been in an emotionally abusive nonmarital relationship with father from.t he last time that she and the children saw him was in july mother did not know his current whereabouts or have any contact with him.the report noted that father has not provided regular care to the children and his whereabouts remain unknown at this time.
sometime prior to the april,hearing,dcfs determined that father was housed in the men central jail in los angeles.father appeared at the hearing and completed a statement regarding parentage in which he stated that the children lived with him from birth to and that he provided support for them.the court found him to be the presumed father.
mother appeared at the hearing and pleaded no contest to the allegations contained in the petition as amended by interlineation.the court found the amended allegations true and determined that the children were persons described by section,subdivision b.the court put over the disposition hearing to june,to enable dcfs to interview and assess father and monitor mother progress in her treatment program.the children remained in the care of their maternal grandfather.
dcfs interviewed father on may.according to a last minute information filed with the court,father told dcfs that he had been with mother for about years and was still in a relationship with her.father stated that he has always been an active participant in his children lives.father also stated,however,that the children have not had contact with him during his incarceration and he did not want them to.father told dcfs that he was arrested for assault on august,and remained in jail awaiting trial on that charge.he further informed dcfs that he was arrested for attempted murder and rape when he was a juvenile,took a plea deal,and served years for the resulting conviction.
on june,dcfs filed a subsequent petition pursuant to section.in count b,dcfs alleged that father has a criminal history of convictions of.concert,oral copulation concert,kidnapping,false imprisonment,not firearm gbi likely and was a registered sex offender.dcfs alleged that this criminal conduct on the part of the father endangers the children physical health and safety and places the children at risk of physical harm,damage,danger,and sexual abuse within the meaning of section,subdivision b.in count d,dcfs further alleged that the same conduct placed the children at substantial risk of sexual abuse pursuant to section,subdivision d.dcfs included a copy of father criminal history report,which it obtained from clets the criminal history report reflected father convictions for forcible rape,oral copulation,false imprisonment,and assault with a deadly weapon and his and convictions for failure to register as a sex offender.it also documented father juvenile detention for robbery and his juvenile detention for forcible rape,kidnapping,lewd acts with a child under,and murder.it further reflected some of the current charges father faced,which were not crimes of assault as father said,but oral copulation by use of force and failure to register as a sex offender.
dcfs did not interview or in connection with its new allegations mother told dcfs she was unaware that father was a registered sex offender.
father filed a demurrer to the subsequent petition.he contended dcfs failed to state a cause of action for the children dependency under section,subdivisions b and d,because it failed to state specific facts connecting his criminal history to a substantial risk of serious physical harm or sexual abuse.dcfs opposed the demurrer.dcfs included in its opposition a more thorough description of the alleged conduct for which father was awaiting trial according to the victim,father accosted her on april,dragged her into an alley,stole her possessions,and forced her to engage in reciprocal oral copulation with him.father was not arrested in connection with these allegations until august.
dcfs further noted that it had uncovered father arrests for domestic violence against the mother in this case.dcfs provided an incident report documenting a single arrest,which occurred in,in a subsequently filed last minute information.according to that report,mother told police officers who responded to her call that she and father had argued over who was going to feed,who was then an infant.father became increasingly angry,told mother she needs to know her place,and slapped her once on the side of her face.the police officers arrested father for spousal assault,subd.e.mother declined their offer of an emergency protective order.father ultimately was not charged in connection with the incident.the record contains no further evidence of domestic violence.
the court denied father demurrer on july.the court also dismissed the subsequent petition without prejudice and permitted dcfs to file a first amended subsequent petition amended petition.
the amended petition retained counts b and d.it also added two additional counts under section,subdivision b and one count under section,subdivision d.in amended count b,dcfs alleged that father sexually assaulted a minor child in the incident for which he was awaiting trial.the count further alleged that mother knew or should have known about the father criminal conduct and yet allowed the father access to the children.such criminal conduct on the part of the father endangers the children physical health and safety and places the children at risk of physical harm,damage,danger,and sexual abuse.amended count d contained identical allegations and charged mother with failure to protect the children from sexual abuse.in amended count b,dcfs alleged that mother and father engaged in domestic violence on or about.the mother failed to press charges,she declined a restraining order,and she allowed the father continued access to the children.such domestic violence between the mother and father and the mother failure to protect the children endangers the children physical health and safety and places the children at risk of physical harm,damage,and danger.
dcfs interviewed father and mother but not the children about the amended petition.father denied domestic violence and disputed the accuracy of counts b and d he claimed the victim of the incident was not a minor.father also expressed confidence that he would be vindicated on the charges stemming from the incident.mother told dcfs that father never hurt and would not hurt and.when informed of the allegations in counts b and d,mother said,is that true i just do see him doing that i known him for three years.i met him in and had my children with him in and i guess i have two children with him,so that sounds freaky.mother further stated that she had raised the children for seven years and did not want father to have custody because she did not think he has the stability,like a house or an apartment or a job.
mother own stability had improved by that point.she successfully completed her inpatient substance abuse treatment program and moved to a sober living facility,where she stayed for almost two months before abrupt ly leaving for a different facility around july.although dcfs was unable to reach mother for approximately one week,all three of her recent drug tests were negative.the discharge summary from mother inpatient program noted that she was very active in recovery and gave her a good prognosis.
the court held a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on the amended petition on july.father asserted his fifth amendment rights and the matter was submitted without live testimony from any witness.
father counsel argued that all of the counts should be dismissed because they lacked a nexus to the children.mother counsel contended that mother had no ongoing contact with father and took appropriate measures to protect the children from him.she also asked the court to strike mother from count b because mother was not aware of father criminal history or status as a registered sex offender.the court responded,if in the count b the mother had gone to get a restraining order in,that would have then required a clets to be run,and she would have become aware of his registered sex offender status.so in some ways,it might not be that she knew,but definitely she should have known because,if she had taken appropriate action during the domestic violence incident,it would have generated the criminal history that she would have become aware of.
counsel for the children asked the court to sustain the amended petition.she contended that the current criminal charges against father show that there is a risk to the children and that the father behaviors are not they dangerous,and they are not being resolved.she further argued that mother failed to acknowledge father criminal behavior,and that any separation of father from the children was due to father incarceration rather than any efforts by mother.she also informed the court that according to the grandfather and the children,father contact with the children had been very minimal.counsel for dcfs also requested that the amended petition be sustained.although there had not been any documented incidents of domestic violence since,she argued that dcfs remained concerned about future incidents because father indicated he and mother were still in a relationship and mother refuse d to pursue a restraining order.counsel for dcfs also asserted that mother should have known of father sex abuse crime and failure to register as a sex offender.she conceded,however,that nothing in the record showed that father assaulted a minor in and asked that the allegations be conformed to that proof.
the court conformed the allegations in counts b and d as dcfs requested and also struck sentences pertaining to father recent arrest and bail.the court found the allegations true as amended,and also sustained counts b,b,and d.the court ordered the children placed in a suitable home with their maternal grandfather,pending a waiver but granted mother education rights.the court ordered dcfs to provide mother with reunification services and monitored visits twice weekly,with discretion to liberalize.it ordered mother to participate in an substance abuse program with random drug testing,attend parenting classes,obtain individual counseling to address the case issues including domestic violence,and comply with all recommendations of her psychiatrist.the court denied father reunification services but granted weekly monitored visits upon his release from custody.
mother timely appealed.
discussion 
justiciability 
mother acknowledges that because she does not contest all jurisdictional findings against her or those against father,the jurisdictional orders will not be reversed regardless of the outcome of this appeal.as a general rule,a single jurisdictional finding supported by substantial evidence is sufficient to support jurisdiction and render moot a challenge to the other findings.in re alexis th,d.we nonetheless retain discretion to consider the merits of a parent appeal in re th,d,and often do so when the finding serves as the basis for dispositional orders that are also challenged on appeal citation could be prejudicial to the appellant or could potentially impact the current or future dependency proceedings citations or could have other consequences for the appellant,beyond jurisdiction citation.in re drake th,d see also in re th,d in re anthony th,d.
we agree with mother that merits review is warranted here.the findings that mother knowingly or negligently exposed her children to a substantial risk of physical and sexual abuse are pernicious.the finding in count d that mother failed to protect the children from a substantial risk of sexual abuse carries a particular stigma.the findings associated with count b that she failed to protect the children by declining to get a restraining order in,thereby exposing them to a current risk of physical harm appear to have motivated the court order that mother address domestic violence in her individual counseling sessions and could potentially impact the current or future dependency proceedings.further,refusal to address jurisdictional errors on appeal has the undesirable result of insulating erroneous or arbitrary rulings from review.in re joshua th,d.for these important reasons,we review mother appeal on the merits.
ii.standard of review 
dcfs has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the children are dependents of the court under section.in re cal th,d,subd.a.mother argues dcfs failed to carry this burden on counts b,b,and d of the amended petition.
in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jurisdictional findings and disposition,we determine if substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supports them.in making this determination,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the dependency court we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the provin
