the sole issue in this case is whether the absolute immunity provided by section or of the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act ilcs,west or the limited immunity provided by section of the illinois domestic violence act of ilcs west applies to claims that a municipality and two of its police officers were willful and wanton in failing to assist a victim of domestic violence.like the appellate court d,we conclude that the general assembly intended section to govern such claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
on april,ronyale white obtained an emergency order of protection against her husband,louis drexel.on may,white telephoned at to request police assistance because drexel had entered her home.white told the operator that drexel was violating the order of protection and that he owned a gun.the operator told white to watch for the police.an emergency dispatcher then contacted chicago police officers christopher green and donald cornelius in their beat car.after the dispatcher advised the officers of white situation and gave them her address and drexel description,one of the officers responded.that call concluded at witnesses saw the officers arrive and wait briefly in their car at white home,then depart without assisting her.five minutes later,drexel shot and killed white.
melissa moore,independent executor of white estate,filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county against officer green,officer cornelius,and the city of chicago under the wrongful death act ilcs west and the survival act ilcs west moore alleged that white was a protected person under the domestic violence act,and that the officers had a duty under the statute to use all reasonable means to prevent further abuse or harassment by transporting white away from drexel or arresting him.moore charged that the officers willful and wanton conduct in failing to investigate and assist white breached this duty and proximately caused her death.
the city filed a motion to dismiss moore complaint see ilcs a west,arguing that section of the tort immunity act,which provides absolute immunity for failing to provide police protection,to prevent or solve crimes,or to identify and apprehend criminals,and section of that act,which provides absolute immunity for failing to make an arrest,barred moore claims.green and cornelius joined this motion.moore responded that section of the domestic violence act,which provides limited immunity for failing to render emergency assistance or enforce the statute and contains an exception for willful and wanton conduct,trumped sections and.the trial court denied the defendants motion to dismiss.the city filed a motion to reconsider and alternatively to allow an interlocutory appeal of a certified question under supreme court rule a a.green and cornelius again joined this motion.the trial court denied the motion to reconsider,but concluded that there was substantial ground for disagreement on the immunity question raised by the defendants and that an immediate appeal could terminate the case.the trial court submitted this issue to the appellate court 
does section or of the local government and governmental employees tort immunity act provide absolute immunity to a municipality and its police officers who are alleged to have willfully and wantonly failed to prevent a crime against a protected person by their actions or inactions as specified in moore amended complaint under section s and of the illinois domestic violence act of 
the appellate court granted leave to appeal and answered the certified question in the negative.d.the appellate court reviewed the parties arguments,then reviewed this court opinion in calloway kinkelaar.d at.in enacting the domestic violence act,the general assembly sought to encourage active intervention on the part of law enforcement officials in cases of intrafamily abuse.d at.the appellate court continued based on the strongly worded purposes of the act,coupled with the supreme court construction of section in calloway,we believe that,in enacting the domestic violence act,the legislature carved out a separate sphere of duties and liabilities for law enforcement officials.d at.the appellate court rejected the defendants argument that the legislature did not intend the domestic violence act to override the tort immunity act because section of the tort immunity act exempts claims under certain enumerated statutes,and the domestic violence act is not one of those statutes.d at,citing ilcs west.according to the appellate court,section of the tort immunity act does not provide an exhaustive list of exemptions,and the the strongly worded language of the legislature in enacting the domestic violence act can not be ignored.d at.
we allowed the defendants petition for leave to appeal.a.we allowed the illinois municipal league to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the defendants and the illinois coalition against domestic violence,the chicago metropolitan women network,and various other domestic violence service organizations to file an amicus brief in support of moore.on the legal issue presented in this appeal,our review is de novo.see feltmeier feltmeier.
the illinois constitution of abolished sovereign immunity,except as the general assembly may provide see.const,art.xiii,and the legislature exercised this prerogative by retaining the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act.van meter darien park district.the tort immunity act protects local public entities and public employees from liability arising from the operation of government.ilcs a west bubb springfield school district.the act grants only immunities and defenses.ilcs a west.that is,it does not create duties,but merely enumerates immunities which apply to certain government operations.epstein chicago board of education.whether a municipality and its employees owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and whether they enjoyed immunity from the plaintiff subsequent tort claims are separate inquiries.barnett zion park district.
here,the parties agree that there was a duty to protect white,stemming from the domestic violence act.see ilcs west see also calloway,at.in fact,by filing a motion to dismiss under section of the code of civil procedure,the defendants admitted the legal sufficiency of moore tort claims.see ilcs a west involuntary dismissal is proper where the claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim see also van meter,at,citing kedzie currency exchange,hodge.once we have determined that a duty exists,we must then determine whether an immunity applies.village of bloomingdale cdg enterprises.
section of the tort immunity act provides 
neither a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for failure to establish a police department or otherwise provide police protection service or,if police protection service is provided,for failure to provide adequate police protection or service,failure to prevent the commission of crimes,failure to detect or solve crimes,and failure to identify or apprehend criminals.ilcs west.
section provides that n either a local public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by the failure to make an arrest.ilcs west.both sections offer absolute immunity barnes chicago housing authority,d,hernandez kirksey,d,and both sections apparently apply to moore claims.in a typical case,when the applicable provisions of the tort immunity act provide absolute immunity,the plaintiff claim is barred.
this is not a typical case,however,because the domestic violence act also contains its own immunity provision.section of that act provides,any act of omission or commission by any law enforcement officer acting in good faith in rendering emergency assistance or otherwise enforcing this act shall not impose civil liability upon the law enforcement officer or his or her supervisor or employer,unless the act is a result of willful or wanton misconduct.ilcs west.this section,too,apparently applies to moore claims.we therefore must determine which immunity provision governs.
the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.paszkowski metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago.our analysis begins with the statutory language,which remains the best indication of that intent.metzger darosa.the language must be afforded its plain,ordinary,popularly understood meaning.people ex rel.sherman cryns.when the language is unambiguous,the statute must be applied as written without resorting to other aids of construction.lawrence regent realty group.
however,when the plain language of one statute apparently conflicts with the plain language of another statute,we must resort to other means in determining the legislature intent.where two statutes conflict,we will attempt to construe them together,in pari materia,where such an interpretation is reasonable.see ferguson mckenzie,mcnamee federated equipment supply.we presume the legislature would not enact a law that completely contradicts an existing law without expressly repealing it.see in re marriage of lasky.for a later enactment to operate as a repeal by implication of an existing statute,there must be such a manifest and total repugnance that the two can not stand together.jahn troy fire protection district.legislative intent remains the paramount consideration traditional rules of statutory construction are merely aids in determining legislative intent,and these rules must yield to such intent.paszkowski,at.in this regard,we may properly consider the purpose of the statutes,the problems that they target,and the goals that they seek to achieve.in re detention of lieberman,see fumarolo chicago board of education,legislative intent can be ascertained from a consideration of the entire act,its nature,its object and the consequences that would result from construing it one way or the other.where a general statutory provision and a more specific statutory provision relate to the same subject,we will presume that the legislature intended the more specific provision to govern.knolls condominium ass harms.similarly,we will presume that the legislature intended the more recent statutory provision to control.state mikusch.
the general assembly adopted the tort immunity act in after this court abolished the sovereign immunity of municipalities from tort claims in molitor kaneland community unit district.harinek north clark street.partnership.that act included sections and.more than years later,the general assembly passed the domestic violence act,which states that it should be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes.ilcs west.these purposes are,in part,to 
recognize domestic violence as a serious crime against the individual and society which produces family disharmony in thousands of illinois families,promotes a pattern of escalating violence which frequently culminates in homicide,and creates an emotional atmosphere that is not conducive to healthy childhood development 
recognize that the legal system has ineffectively dealt with family violence in the past,allowing abusers to escape effective prosecution or financial liability,and has not adequately acknowledged the criminal nature of domestic violence that,although many laws have changed,in practice there is still widespread failure to appropriately protect and assist victims 
support the efforts of victims of domestic violence to avoid further abuse by promptly entering and diligently enforcing court orders which prohibit abuse and,when necessary,reduce the abuser access to the victim and address any related issues of child custody and economic support,so that victims are not trapped in abusive situations by fear of retaliation,loss of a child,financial dependence,or loss of accessible housing or services 
clarify the responsibilities and support the efforts of law enforcement officers to provide immediate,effective assistance and protection of victims of domestic violence,recognizing that law enforcement officers often become the secondary victims of domestic violence,as evidenced by the high rates of police injuries and deaths that occur in response to domestic violence calls and 
expand the civil and criminal remedies for victims of domestic violence including,when necessary,the remedies which effect the physical separation of the parties to prevent further abuse.ilcs west.
the act protects any person abused by a family or household member,as well as children in the care of an abuse victim and persons who house an abuse victim.ilcs a west.it then streamlines the procedures that victims of domestic violence must use to obtain orders of protection see ilcs west,and pushes petitions for orders of protection to the top of trial court dockets see ilcs west a petition for an order of protection shall be treated as an expedited proceeding accord ilcs b west.the act then details a broad panoply of remedies that orders of protection may contain,in addition to other civil or criminal remedies available to the victim.ilcs,west.
article iii of the domestic violence act law enforcement responsibilities shifts focus from helping victims to obtain orders of protection to instructing law enforcement agencies and officers to enforce them.the act provides that law enforcement officers may arrest,without warrants,persons who violate orders of protection.ilcs west.the act further provides that law enforcement officers shall immediately use all reasonable means to prevent further abuse when they believe a person is a victim of domestic abuse,including,inter alia,arresting the party committing the abuse seizing any weapons used by the party committing the abuse accompanying the victim to his or her residence to remove personal effects offering the victim information summarizing the relief available under the statute providing the victim with a referral to a social service agency advising the victim about seeking medical attention and preserving evidence against the person committing the abuse and transporting the victim to a medical facility or shelter,or to the trial court to obtain an emergency order of protection.ilcs a west.the act even lists duties for officers who investigate domestic violence calls,but do not initiate criminal proceedings against the party committing the abuse.ilcs b west.
this court interpreted this statute in calloway.there,a wife obtained a plenary order of protection against her husband after he physically and mentally abused her during their marriage.several weeks later,the husband violated the order of protection by making threatening telephone calls to the wife at the restaurant where she worked.the husband threatened to kill himself and her father in front of the wife and their daughter.the wife then notified the sheriff department the sheriff drove to the husband residence,briefly observed it,and drove away without further investigation.shortly thereafter,the husband again violated the order of protection by making more threatening telephone calls to the wife at work.the wife again notified the sheriff department,and a dispatcher acknowledged that the department was aware of the order of protection.within an hour,the husband entered the restaurant,abducted the wife at gunpoint,and forced her into his pickup truck.nearly an hour later,state police officers stopped the truck.the wife jumped out of the truck,and when the police approached it,they found the husband had shot and killed himself.
the wife filed a complaint against the county and the county sheriff,alleging that their willful and wanton or negligent conduct breached their duties to her under the domestic violence act,proximately causing her extreme emotional distress and trauma.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,contending that they were insulated from liability under the public duty doctrine,a common law immunity grounded in public policy under which a municipality and its law enforcement officers may be shielded from liability for failing to supply police protection.the trial court dismissed the complaint,and the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the negligence claims,but reversed the dismissal of the willful and wanton conduct claims.the defendants appealed.
this court affirmed.calloway.initially,we examined in detail the domestic violence act,whose purposes include recognizing that domestic violence is a serious crime and recognizing that the legal system has failed to protect and assist domestic violence victims.calloway,at,citing ilcs,west.we emphasized two additional purposes of particular significance namely,helping victims of domestic violence to avoid further abuse by promptly entering and diligently enforcing orders of protection,and expanding the civil and criminal remedies for victims.calloway,at,citing ilcs,west.
we noted that to further these purposes section of the domestic violence act enumerates the responsibilities of law enforcement officers.calloway,at,citing ilcs a west.section of the act limits law enforcement liability to willful and wanton conduct.calloway,at,citing ilcs west.we explained that this partial immunity is a direct expression of legislative intent to reconcile the strongly worded purposes of the act with the recognition that officers performing their legal duties should not be held civilly liable when their efforts to enforce the act fall short,unless the conduct in question can be viewed as willful and wanton.emphasis in original.calloway,at.to give effect to the legislature purposes and intent in enacting the statute,we recognized a right of action for civil damages,provided that the injured party can establish that he or she is a person in need of protection under the act,the statutory law enforcement duties owed to him or her were breached by the willful and wanton acts or omissions of law enforcement officers,and such conduct proximately caused plaintiff injuries.calloway,at.
we then addressed the defendants public duty doctrine argument 
we do not reach the defendants arguments concerning general principles of governmental tort immunity because the domestic violence act itself provides an express limitation of liability on the part of law enforcement officers and municipalities.accordingly,we need look no further than the language and intent of the act to ascertain whether and to what extent law enforcement officers in the performance of their statutory duties under the act are immune from liability to plaintiffs injured by acts or omissions of such officers.emphasis added.calloway,at.
notably,we mentioned general principles of tort immunity,not statutory provisions.but see calloway,at,freeman,specially concurring the affirmative matter asserted to avoid or defeat calloway claims citation were principles of common law and statutory governmental immunity see also sneed howell,d,the tort immunity act and the common law doctrine are not applicable in this case because the general assembly enacted the illinois domestic violence act to deal with these issues.
the defendants sidestep calloway.calloway squarely held that the domestic violence act implies a private right of action to enforce its provisions and therefore overcomes the common law immunity.but,maintain the defendants,calloway did not address the issue here whether sections and of the tort immunity act insulate them from such liability.according to the defendants,there is no language in the tort immunity act that exempts claims under the domestic violence act.see ilcs west.in asserting that the tort immunity act controls over conflicting statutes,the defendants rely upon our opinions in henrich libertyville high school,tosado miller,ferguson,and paszkowski.
in tosado,ferguson,and paszkowski,we decided the tort immunity act limitations provision trumped code of civil procedure limitations periods.those cases involve dueling limitations provisions,not dueling immunity provisions.henrich is more relevant.
in henrich,a high school student had spine fusion surgery.the student physician advised that he was permanently restricted from any contact sports in physical education class.the high school knew of this restriction,but less than a year after the surgery,a substitute instructor required the student to participate in a water basketball game during physical education class.the student was severely and permanently injured.he later filed a complaint alleging,inter alia,that the school district was willful and wanton.the district filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that it enjoyed absolute immunity under sections a and of the tort immunity act ilcs a,west.the student responded that the school district had only limited immunity under sections and of the school code ilcs,west.the school code grants educators the same immunity enjoyed by parents school districts vicariously share this immunity,which covers negligence claims,but not willful and wanton conduct claims.henrich,at.the trial court agreed with the school district and dismissed the student claims.the appellate court affirmed.
this court,in turn,affirmed,concluding that the tort immunity act shielded the school district from liability.henrich,at.though the student argued that the specific provisions of the school code prevailed over the general provisions of the tort immunity act,that distinction was not dispositive t he plain language of section a of the tort immunity act immunizes a local public entity failure to supervise an activity on or the use of public property.the legislature could not have made its intent any plainer.henrich,at.further,construing the statutes together,we stated that each stood in its own sphere.henrich,at.the school code immunity provision applies to both private and public schools the tort immunity act immunity provision applies only to public schools.henrich,at.we reasoned that the legislature,therefore,intended to grant public schools and their employees greater protection than private schools and their employees.henrich,at.see arteman clinton community unit school district,holding that sections and of the school code provided no immunity from the plaintiff allegations that the school district failed to provide a student with safety equipment during physical education class,but that section of the tort immunity act did see also albers breen,d,holding that the exception in the mental health and developmental disabilities confidentiality act did not override the immunity provided by section.
according to the defendants,the immunity provisions here,like the immunity provisions in henrich,can be harmonized because the domestic violence act and the tort immunity act are available to different entities.the tort immunity act applies to only local public entities and public employees ilcs west and not the state or any office,officer,department,division,bureau,board,commission,university or similar agency of the state ilcs west.the domestic violence act confers immunity on any law enforcement officer ilcs west.the defendants assert that section or extinguishes tort claims against municipalities and their law enforcement officers pursuant to the domestic violence act,and that the immunity provided in section remains available to law enforcement officers who are outside the scope of the tort immunity act,such as the illinois state police and police at various state universities.we disagree.
section and sections and can not be harmonized because clearly the immunity provided by both statutes applies to moore allegations.unlike the statutes in henrich,the statutes here do not stand in their own spheres,but rather vie for the same sphere.in henrich,we limited the immunity provided by the school code to private schools and their employees,while we applied the immunity provided by the tort immunity act to public schools and their employees.such a dichotomy between municipal and nonmunicipal defendants is not reasonable in this case.it would pervert the broad purposes of the domestic violence act to conclude that the immunity created by section was intended to apply only to law enforcement agencies and agents beyond the tort immunity act shield,who are less likely to investigate domestic violence calls or to enforce the act.the reading advanced by the defendants threatens to reduce the duties in the domestic violence act to precatory admonitions.if the defendants are correct,the general assembly in passing the domestic
