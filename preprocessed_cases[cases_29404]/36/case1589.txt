marci,a married woman,engaged in a brief sexual relationship with mark in late december,during which they conceived a child.a petition to dissolve marci marriage had been filed in january,but she had not obtained a final judgment of dissolution.the child,named alexander,was born in september,and marci immediately relinquished him for adoption to john and michelle m.a few days later,mark visited marci,and she told him about the impending adoption.
the served mark with a notice of alleged paternity and adoption and filed a petition for adoption.two weeks later,they filed a petition to terminate mark parental rights and to determine the necessity of his consent to the adoption the consent petition.mark filed a petition to establish a parental relationship,seeking a blood test to determine whether alexander was his child and,if so,to obtain custody or visitation the paternity petition.he declared he had agreed to pay for marci to have an abortion if she confirmed the child was his,but four months into her pregnancy,marci had changed her mind and asked him if he would agree to adoption.mark said he would not agree to anything unless and until i had some medical confirmation that i was the father.mark did not see marci again until after the baby was born.
genetic testing established that mark was alexander biological father.the parties stipulated to consolidate the consent petition and the paternity petition for hearing,which was held on december before commissioner julian cimbaluk in the probate department.mark request for visitation was denied,counsel was appointed to represent alexander,and the matter was set for trial on march.shortly after leaving the courtroom,however,counsel were called back by the clerk because commissioner cimbaluk had noticed,apparently for the first time,that marci was married,meaning that her husband was alexander presumed father.this turn of events caused commissioner cimbaluk to realize that the case was governed by family code section,which allows an alleged biological father of a child who also has a presumed father to establish paternity and suspend adoption proceedings.after briefing and argument on the effect of family code section,commissioner cimbaluk vacated the previous consolidation order,suspended the consent petition and related adoption proceedings,and transferred the paternity petition to the family law court 
in family law court,mark filed an order to show cause for custody,visitation,and paternity the were permitted to join,and the matter was heard in march before commissioner david weinberg.the court entered a judgment of paternity but denied mark request for visitation,without prejudice to mark making said request in the adoption matter,currently pending but temporarily suspended.the court finds the adoption matter was suspended and sent to family law court for the purpose of establishing paternity.having done so,the court finds it is appropriate to return the matter,for a determination of all other issues,to the pending adoption proceeding.
back in the probate department,the moved to set a trial date on the consent petition.mark argued family code section prohibits the action until the paternity petition is final and claimed it can not be final until custody and visitation are adjudicated.after reviewing the legislative history,commissioner cimbaluk agreed and denied the motion,retaining jurisdiction over the family law issues of custody and visitation and assigning them to himself for hearing and determination.
mark appeals from the portion of commissioner weinberg order that failed to adjudicate custody and visitation,claiming it violates family code section requirement that the paternity action be final before adoption proceedings can continue the seek mandamus relief from commissioner cimbaluk order that custody and visitation must be adjudicated before their consent petition,claiming commissioner cimbaluk misinterpreted family code section and,in light of adoption of kelsey cal th,d,must hear their consent petition first.we issued a stay of all proceedings,issued an order to show cause,and consolidated the appeal and the writ petition.
discussion 
family code section provides except as to cases where paternity is conclusively presumed,where a child is born to a woman cohabiting with her husband,a man not a presumed father may bring an action for the purpose of declaring that he is the natural father of a child having a presumed father under section,if the mother relinquishes for,consents to,or proposes to relinquish for or consent to,the adoption of the child.an action under this section shall be brought within days after the man is served as prescribed in section with a notice that he is or could be the father of the child or the birth of the child,whichever is later.the commencement of the action suspends a pending proceeding in connection with the adoption of the child until a judgment in the action is final.
mark claims family code section gives him the right to adjudicate the issues of custody and visitation in family court under the detriment standard and burden of proof of family code section former.he asserts that the family court can not deny him the right to assert the full panoply of rights open to in a paternity adjudication.he also asserts that the denial of his right to proceed in family court denies him the constitutional right to establish and enjoy the relationship.the,for their part,argue family code section simply grants an unwed natural father the same standing to challenge a proposed adoption where the child has a presumed father as where the child does not.
family code section is best understood in the context of its statutory framework.in,the legislature enacted the uniform parentage act upa as former civil code sections now,although the upa was intended to provide a comprehensive scheme for judicial determination of paternity michael giovanna th,d,the legislature perceived a loophole in the law,which it remedied in by enacting senate bill.this bill added subdivision d of former civil code section now,and amended former civil code section now.stats,ch.
the upa creates three classes of parents mothers,fathers who are presumed fathers,and fathers who are not presumed fathers.adoption of michael,supra,cal th at,d.a man is rebuttably presumed to be the natural father of a child if the child is born during his actual or attempted marriage to the mother or within days after its termination he marries the mother after the child birth and is either named on the birth certificate or agrees to support the child or h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,subd.d former,subd.a.a biological father may or may not qualify as a presumed father.t o become a presumed father,a man who has neither married nor attempted to marry his child biological mother must not only openly and publicly admit paternity,but must also physically bring the child into his home.adoption of michael,supra,cal th at,d.
in,before senate bill was enacted,only presumed fathers could block an adoption.if a child had a presumed father,his consent was required.former,subd.a.if a child did not have a presumed father,all possible fathers were entitled to notice of pending adoption proceedings,but only those who could qualify as presumed fathers after a court hearing were entitled to block the adoption.former,subdivision d.although the statute provided that an alleged natural father of a child without a presumed father could bring an action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship former,subd.c this had no effect on a pending adoption unless he could also qualify as a presumed father.
the case of adoption of marie d.provided the impetus for senate bill.there,the baby was conceived while the mother was engaged to be married to charles k.the mother broke off the engagement,and although charles wanted to keep the baby,she decided to place the child for adoption.charles offered to pay for the mother prenatal support and expenses of birth,but she refused.she also refused to allow him to receive the baby into his home.three days before the baby birth,th
