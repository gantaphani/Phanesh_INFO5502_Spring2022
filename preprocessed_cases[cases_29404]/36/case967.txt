we are called on in this case to decide an issue of first impression in this state namely,when must a party falsely accused of child abuse or neglect allegations in a child custody proceeding move for sanctions under family code section against the person or persons who made such allegations.because section is silent on the issue,absent further direction from the legislature we conclude equitable principles apply to determine the timing of a section sanctions motion.based on such principles and the public policy of ensuring the best interest of children prevails in child custody cases,we further conclude a party moving for section sanctions must file his or her motion on or before the earliest of days after the judgment or order exonerating him or her from such allegations is served,or days from the entry of such judgment or order.
plaintiff and appellant robert dated catherine briefly and they had one child together,a daughter during the course of child custody proceedings involving their daughter,robert contends catherine falsely accused him of child abuse or neglect.almost two years after catherine initially made such allegations against robert,the court entered judgment granting robert full legal custody of their daughter,and exonerating him of such allegations.
one day less than a year after the final order,robert moved for sanctions against catherine and one of her former attorneys,objector and respondent jeffrey fritz,on various grounds,including those noted under section for the false child abuse or neglect accusations catherine made against robert,which fritz,as her attorney of record,repeated during the course of representing catherine in the custody proceedings.section gives a court discretion to impose monetary sanctions against a party,the party attorney or a witness if the moving party establishes that the accusation of child abuse or neglect was made in a child custody proceeding,the accusation was false and the person or persons making it knew it was false when the accusation was made.robert sought in excess of in sanctions against catherine and fritz for the attorney fees and costs he incurred in the child custody proceedings,of which he claims at least was to defend himself from the child abuse or neglect accusations.
fritz alone moved to quash robert section motion,arguing it was untimely and deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction.the court disagreed,but on its own treated the motion to quash as a motion to strike.the court applied the limitations period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,applicable to defamation,analogizing a claim for damages for false accusations under section to slander,and struck any allegations of child abuse or neglect not made within a year of the filing of robert motion.the court dismissed the motion against fritz,but not catherine,after robert acknowledged the motion could not succeed in light of the court ruling.
on appeal,robert argues the court erred when it borrowed and applied to section the limitations period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.robert instead claims the court should have applied a presumptive deadline under the equitable doctrine of laches based on the tort of malicious prosecution,which he claims is the most analogous tort to a section sanctions motion.robert thus argues the deadline to file his motion was two years from the date of the judgment exonerating him.
as we explain,we conclude that neither a limitations period based on malicious prosecution nor a period based on defamation govern the timing of a motion for sanctions under section.there being no statute and no rule setting a deadline to move for section sanctions,absent further direction from the legislature we agree with robert that equitable principles apply to determine the timing of a section sanctions motion.
as we further explain,in light of the legislature findings and declaration that the public policy of ensuring the health,safety and welfare of children shall be the primary concern of courts in determining the best interest of children in child custody proceedings,and to ensure consistency among related statutes in the family code,we conclude a party moving for section sanctions should file his or her motion on or before the earliest of days after the judgment or order exonerating him or her from child abuse or neglect allegations is served,or days from the entry of such judgment or order.these deadlines are drawn from california rules of court rules,and,if appropriate,rule,applicable to motions for recovery of attorney fees in civil proceedings,which rules also apply in family law proceedings.see rule.we further conclude that if a party files his or her section motion after the presumptive deadlines set forth in these rules,the burden shifts to the movant to show that his or her delay was excusable and that such delay did not result in undue prejudice to the opposing party or person who is the subject of the motion.
here,robert did not file his section sanctions motion until one day less than a year after the judgment exonerating him from catherine allegations of child abuse or neglect.however,because this is an issue of first impression in our state,we conclude it would be unfair to robert to apply this procedural rule retroactively.we therefore reverse the order of the trial court dismissing robert section sanctions motion against fritz and remand for the trial court to consider that motion,on its merits.
factual and procedural background 
robert and catherine dated a few months in,but never married.they had one child together,a daughter born in april.by stipulation and order,the court awarded robert sole physical custody,and catherine and robert joint legal custody,of their daughter.
accusations of child abuse or neglect by catherine 
in early september,catherine filed an order to show cause seeking modification of child custody,child visitation and child support,an order for psychological evaluation and attorney fees and costs custody osc.in support of her custody osc,catherine filed a declaration robert contends falsely accused him of child abuse or neglect hereinafter,the child abuse or neglect allegations 
in her declaration,catherine described robert parenting and their daughter living conditions as follows 
s ince the birth of our daughter,robert has demonstrated that his parenting of our daughter is neglectful,and dangerous to our daughter well being.robert parenting of our daughter has proven to be wholly adverse to the best interest of our daughter.
since our daughter birth,she has been raised in robert residence by a series of nannies too numerous to count.our daughter has been neglected emotionally and deprived of the opportunity to be nurtured and raised by a parent or individual with whom she has a relationship and is bonded to.our t hree year old daughter has virtually been raised by strangers.
additionally,our daughter living conditions in robert home are filthy and hazardous.robert has numerous cats,dogs and birds totaling more than ten animals that live inside his residence and are permitted to urinate and defecate freely throughout the house.the smell of the inside of robert home is unbearable and the animal feces and waste is repulsive.our daughter has been bitten by robert dog and scratched by his cats.these living conditions coupled with robert psychosis is the reason why there have been numerous nannies and housekeepers,too multiple to count,who have worked for robert.
catherine attorney of record when she filed her custody osc was fritz late law partner,robert basie.when basie passed away,fritz substituted in as catherine attorney of record and represented her from september,after she filed her declaration in support of the custody osc to august.
robert is awarded sole legal custody of their daughter 
although not clear from the record,at some point after august,catherine hired new counsel,william blatchley,to represent her in the custody dispute and at trial,which ended in early may.judgment was entered on july,and robert was awarded sole legal custody and primary physical custody of their daughter.the court found the evidence strongly supports a finding that robert is an effective,loving,and appropriate parent and caregiver for their daughter,and did not support the imposition of any restriction on robert care or custody of their daughter.the parties agree it was this finding that exonerated robert from the child abuse or neglect allegations.
catherine subsequently opposed robert motion to move away set for hearing in may.in connection with her opposition,catherine resubmitted her custody osc declaration containing the child abuse or neglect allegations,made new accusations of sexual abuse against robert that he contends were unfounded,and asserted robert psychologist failed to report such abuse after she brought it to the psychologist attention.she also sought an award of attorney fees from robert to enable her to hire legal counsel to represent her in the may hearing.
fritz did not represent catherine at the may,hearing on robert motion.however,fritz was present for that hearing,after appearing on an unrelated matter in the same courtroom on june,fritz briefly substituted back into the case as counsel of record for catherine.robert,who at the time was representing himself,personally served fritz with a copy of the judgment entered on july,to ensure that fritz was made aware of the matters that remained pending,and that the trial court had found robert to be an excellent caregiver of their daughter.the matters pending included,among other things,the finalization of the move away order and other financial issues the court had bifurcated from the custody proceeding.
robert attempts to settle with catherine before filing his sanctions motion 
in,robert contacted fritz and catherine in writing,stating he intended to file a motion for sanctions under sections and,as well as under code of civil procedure section,if remaining matters were not settled.robert wanted to reach a global settlement for peace of mind and for their daughter sake.shortly thereafter,robert hired legal counsel who contacted fritz in late june requesting he stipulate to bifurcate the issues of liability and a monetary award in the instant sanctions motion robert intended to file.
robert contends fritz told robert legal counsel on july,that catherine was coming to fritz office to sign the settlement agreement.based on this representation,robert waited to file his sanctions motion.however,when neither robert nor his counsel heard from fritz regarding settlement,robert went forward and filed his motion on july.after doing so,robert discovered fritz had withdrawn as catherine attorney of record a day earlier,which robert claims was done so fritz could claim he was not catherine attorney of record for purposes of the section motion.
although robert had already filed his sanctions motion,he wrote catherine on july and again on july,seeking a global settlement with her.robert represented to catherine that if she were willing to enter into a global settlement with him,he would take his sanctions motion against her and fritz off calendar.according to robert,catherine did not respond to his offer.
robert motion for sanctions 
grounds for sanctions under section 
robert,in propria persona,filed his motion for sanctions against catherine and fritz.specifically against fritz,robert alleged 
fritz knew from early on that these child accusations by catherine were false,but nevertheless continued to assert them as a basis for his client meritless and unsuccessful attempts to obtain sole custody of our daughter,child support and his excessive and unnecessary attorney fees.for example,i believe that fritz knew the allegations of his client were false because 
a fritz was present at catherine october,deposition when catherine admitted i was a good parent and either recanted or discounted her accusations that i was an parent 
b fritz was served on october,with declarations,including from our daughter school master and pediatrician,which refuted catherine accusations 
c fritz took my deposition on october,and reviewed the third party declarations and the notes and cards written by catherine,as well as photos,which refuted the accusations.
d fritz received the october,family court services report in which the senior mediator found no evidence or reason to change my custody of our daughter 
e fritz had my october,opposition declaration and my october,reply declaration,which further refuted catherine child abuse and neglect accusations 
f fritz subpoenaed,without my objection,and received our daughter school and medical records,which showed no evidence of abuse or neglect 
g fritz received psychological testing results in from two agencies for our daughter,which showed no evidence of abuse or neglect 
moreover,robert sanctions motion noted fritz was present in the courtroom during robert may move away motion,although,as previously noted,fritz was not then catherine attorney of record.nonetheless,robert argued fritz substituted in and once again became catherine attorney of record shortly after that hearing,and while her counsel fritz took no steps to disavow or withdraw the filings for the move away proceeding of which he became counsel of record for all purposes of child abuse and neglect against me which were previously refuted in the court statement of decision,attached and incorporated into the july,judgment.
robert sought sanctions against catherine and fritz well in excess of,which included costs for attorneys,psychological testing,court transcripts,process servers and depositions,among other items,robert incurred to defend himself against the child abuse or neglect accusations made by catherine and asserted by fritz in the custody dispute involving their daughter.robert request for sanctions under section was exclusive and independent of his request for sanctions under section.
sanctions under section 
robert also sought sanctions against catherine and fritz under section because at every turn of this custody proceeding catherine and fritz refused to pursue settlement,refused to cooperate to keep litigation fees and costs down,obstructed relevant discovery,and served irrelevant discovery and baseless motions to compel,thus frustrating the policy to promote settlement or reasonably cooperate as required under section.robert claimed the wrongful actions of catherine and fritz caused his legal fees and costs to skyrocket.
in particular,robert in his motion alleged that catherine and fritz failed to promote settlement by refusing robert offers to mediate in,just two weeks after catherine filed the custody osc,and again in march.robert also alleged catherine and fritz refused to discuss settlement and resolve discovery issues in august.
moreover,after fritz substituted out of the case,robert alleged catherine and her attorney blatchley in february refused to stipulate to recommendations made by a psychologist,thus forcing robert to prepare for and try the custody dispute at tremendous expense in october robert counsel contacted catherine,who was then representing herself,to inquire about resolving the remaining issues.according to robert,catherine did not respond to this request.
in addition to these allegations,robert motion also included several pages of discussion regarding the repeated refusal of catherine and fritz to comply with lawful discovery,court orders regarding such discovery,and their own irrelevant,false and unlawful discovery they served on him.
robert requested sanctions against catherine and fritz under section of not less than based on the substantial legal fees and costs he incurred to promote settlement and reduce costs,as well as to compel relevant discovery.robert thus sought a combined minimum sanction against catherine and fritz of.
fritz motion to quash 
fritz alone moved to quash robert sanctions motion.he argued the court lacked jurisdiction over him because he was not catherine attorney of record when robert filed his motion and was not a party to the action.he also argued robert motion was untimely under former rule current rule,and section applied only to a party and not a party attorney.
robert subsequently withdrew his request for section sanctions against fritz,but maintained fritz was still liable for sanctions under section.robert argued an action under section was akin to a malicious prosecution claim in a civil matter,and thus contended a statute of limitations applied.he further argued that even if the court applied a limitations period based on an action for defamation,his claim against fritz was timely.
as to fritz claim the action was untimely under former rule,robert argued that a section sanctions action was much more than an action to tally up the attorneys fees incurred in the antecedent proceeding that if the court was inclined to apply former rule,the court should extend the time for filing such a motion as provided in part d of that rule and that because the only case on point on this issue was unpublished,in re marriage of burch june,wl and held that the statute of limitations for defamation should apply to a section sanctions motion,it would be unjust to conclude robert motion was untimely under former rule.
in his reply to robert opposition to his motion to quash,fritz argued catherine september declaration did not accuse robert of child abuse or neglect,but rather merely articulated her concerns about robert parenting of their daughter.fritz also disputed that robert had attempted to settle the custody dispute or streamline discovery,and argued robert instead had opposed catherine own legitimate discovery requests and was generally uncooperative in resolving the parties multiple disputes in the custody proceeding.
f.the trial court applies a statute of limitations to robert section sanctions motion 
the trial court issued an order on december,concluding it had subject matter jurisdiction over fritz,based on the plain language of section,which as discussed below expressly applies to a witness,a party,or a party attorney,subd.a,italics added.the court rejected fritz argument that robert motion was under former rule,which provides that a notice of motion to claim statutory attorney fees must be filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under former rules and ordinarily,within days after the court clerk mails the party filing the notice of appeal notice of entry of judgment or after a party service of notice of entry of judgment 
the court instead concluded that rule was inapplicable to robert motion for sanctions under section because the primary purpose of section is to award sanctions,not attorney fees a finding of falsity and an award under section need not occur during the pendency of a child custody proceeding,which,in any event,may already have been concluded by the time a party files his or her motion and section contains an implicit limitation of actions period independent of rule.
the court reasoned the limitations period applicable to defamation implicitly governed a section motion because section permits a party to bring a claim for damages for false accusations and to do so within the context of a proceeding under the family code.because a false accusation of child abuse is a form of slander,the court reasoned robert claim for damages under section and for attorney fees incurred in recovering those damages was subject to the limitations period set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.
the court on its own treated fritz motion to quash as a motion to strike and struck any allegations of false accusations of child abuse or neglect not made within a year of the filing of robert july,order to show cause.the court also ruled that to the extent robert sanctions motion was premised on catherine september declaration in the custody osc,it was,even if the allegations in that declaration were referred to in later hearings.the court set an evidentiary hearing for to determine whether there is a factual basis for robert claim to money sanctions under section.if robert abandons the claim in light of the above ruling,he shall promptly notify the court.
robert seeks reconsideration and clarification of the court december,order 
robert filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification on december,raising the tolling of the statute of limitations and arguing it was inequitable of the court to apply the limitations period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,in light of the lack of legal authority on this issue.
the court on june,denied robert reconsideration motion,ruling the tolling issue did not constitute new facts,new circumstances or new law for purposes of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.the court also concluded robert request to clarify its december,order was untimely.
in early july,robert filed a motion asking the court to issue a final order denying his section sanctions motion only as to fritz.robert brought this motion because it was impossible to proceed with the motion for sanctions in light of the court ruling that family code section has an absolute statute of limitations of one year from when the offending accusations are made and the refiling or reassertion of such accusations is not actionable.robert noted he had insufficient evidence to maintain an action that fritz participated in making any false accusations that could be the subject of sanctions under family code section in the one year before the date on which he filed the order to show cause for sanctions.
on august,the court accepted a stipulation by robert and fritz dismissing robert section sanctions motion against fritz only.robert argued the dismissal was necessary for him to seek review of the court december,order

standard of review 
we review the trial court interpretation and application of section under a de novo standard of review.see people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,in re marriage of dupre th,d dupre.determining the timing of a section motion is also subject to our independent review.see murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.
governing law 
section is within part of division of the family code,which governs custody of a minor.section,subdivision a,sets forth the legislature findings and declarations in connection with part,and provides in part 
the legislature finds and declares that it is the public policy of this state to assure that the health,safety,and welfare of children shall be the court primary concern in determining the best interest of children when making any orders regarding the physical or legal custody or visitation of children.the legislature further finds and declares that the perpetration of child abuse or domestic violence in a household where a child resides is detrimental to the child.
in making a determination of the best interest of the child,a court must consider,among other factors,the health,safety,and welfare of the child,subd.a,and a ny history of abuse by one parent or any other person seeking custody against a ny child t he other parent,subd.b.as a prerequisite to the consideration of allegations of abuse,the court may require substantial independent corroboration,including,but not limited to,written reports by law enforcement agencies,child protective services or other social welfare agencies,courts,medical facilities,or other public agencies or private nonprofit organizations providing services to victims of sexual assault or domestic violence,subd.b.
thus,in the context of a child custody proceeding when allegations of child abuse or neglect arise,before making a custody determination the court necessarily must determine the veracity of such allegations to ensure the court is acting in the best interest of the child,subd.b.
section,subdivision a,allows a court to impose reasonable money sanctions,and any attorney fees incurred in recovering the sanctions,against a person who knowingly makes a false accusation of child abuse or neglect in a child custody proceeding.it provides 
if a court determines,based on the investigation described in section or other evidence presented to it,that an accusation of child abuse or neglect made during a child custody proceeding is false and the person making the accusation knew it to be false at the time the accusation was made,the court may impose reasonable money sanctions,not to exceed all costs incurred by the party accused as a direct result of defending the accusation,and reasonable attorney fees incurred in recovering the sanctions,against the person making the accusation.for the purposes of this section,person includes a witness,a party,or a party attorney.italics added.
subdivision b of section sets forth the notice required for a hearing on a section sanctions motion 
on motion by any person requesting sanctions under this section,the court shall issue its order to show cause why the requested sanctions should not be imposed.the order to show cause shall be served on the person against whom the sanctions are sought and a hearing thereon shall be scheduled by the court to be conducted at least days after the order is served.
finally,subdivision c of section states the remedy provided by this section is in addition to any other remedy provided by law.
rules of construction 
in construing section,our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d,gooch hendrix cal th,d.
however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,see also harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.
here,section is silent on the timing of a motion for sanctions.subdivision a of section provides the accusation of child abuse or neglect,to be actionable,must be made during a child custody proceeding,subd.a.although the accusation of child abuse or neglect must be made during a child custody proceeding,there is no requirement in section that a motion for sanctions must be filed during that proceeding.see dupre,supra,th at,d.
subdivision b of section also does not resolve our issue,inasmuch as it requires that a person subject to a sanctions motion be given at least days notice before the hearing.subdivision b of section does not,however,address when the sanctions motion must be filed,subd.b.
robert argues the trial court erred when it applied the limitations period for defamation under section,subdivision c,and instead claims the court should have applied a presumptive deadline under equitable principles drawn from the tort of malicious prosecution,which he claims is the most analogous tort to a section motion.robert thus argues the deadline to file his sanctions motion should have been two years from the judgment exonerating him of the child abuse or neglect allegations.
robert also argues the trial court properly rejected fritz contention that former rule applied to a section sanctions motion because former rule was limited to claims for attorney fees.according to robert,section is not so limited,inasmuch as it expressly allows recovery of all expenses and not just attorney fees.he further argues that borrowing the time limitations set forth in former rule and applying them to section creates a trap for the unwary,inasmuch as many litigants in family court appear in propria persona and have expenses recoverable under section other than attorney fees.
because the words of section do not resolve the issue of the timing of a motion for sanctions under the statute,we look to extrinsic aids,including legislative history,for guidance.flannery prentice cal th,d,fair employment housing com.cal d.
legislative history of section 
the legislative history shows section was originally enacted in as civil code section in response to the increasing number of child custody cases where an accusation of child abuse and neglect was made in an effort by one party to gain custody of the children.office of criminal justice planning on assem.bill as amended may,reg.sess.former civil code section gave a court the discretion to impose a sanction of no more than,plus reasonable attorney fees to recover that sanction,against any person who made an accusation of child abuse or neglect in a child custody proceeding if the person knew it to be false at the time it was made.
this legislative history also shows the legislature looked to several other statutes that allowed a court to award sanctions for procedural misconduct in family law proceedings for guidance in enacting former civil code section.see senate rules com.on assem.bill as amended may,reg.sess.see also assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill as amended may,reg.sess.in addition to sanctions for failure to comply with the civil discovery act code civ,et,formerly code civ,and for the filing of bad faith actions or pursuing frivolous or delaying tactics code civ,it shows sanctions were authorized in family law proceedings based on the extent to which the conduct of each party and the attorney frustrates the policy of law to promote settlement of litigation,as provided in section assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill as amended may,reg.sess.
following its enactment,former civil code section became part of the family code and was renumbered to former section without substantive change.family code,cal.revision comm reports,fn.in the legislature amended former section to delete the cap on sanctions and substituted it with a new one not to exceed all costs incurred by the party accused as a direct result of defending the accusation.see assem.bill reg.sess.
the legislative history of the amendment demonstrates the legislature considered the cap in former section unreasonable given the enormous cost of defending false charges of abuse or neglect.instead of capping such sanctions at a specified amount as the current law does,this bill would authorize the award of all costs incurred to defend false accusations,together with reasonable attorney fees for recovering those sanctions.rule,office of floor analysis of senate bill reg.sess.august,
by removing the cap,the legislature also sought to discourage further the practice of falsely accusing another of sexual or physical abuse in custody deliberations.rules,office of floor analysis of senate bill reg.sess.may,see also rules,office of floor analysis of senate bill reg.sess.august,i t is becoming common in child custody and divorce proceedings for one party to falsely accuse the other of child abuse the author of assembly bill hopes to curtail such allegations by providing for recovery of costs and increasing the applicable sanction.
in the legislature amended section and renumbered it as current section.stats,ch.it also added a new family code section,section,which,as already noted,applies to accusations of child sexual abuse.stats,ch.
the legislative history does not answer the question of the timing of a motion for monetary sanctions under section.it does highlight,however,the public policy underlying the enactment of this statute of discouraging a person from deliberately making false accusations of child abuse or neglect during a child custody proceeding in order to gain custody of a minor child,and of compensating a party wrongly accused of abuse or neglect up to the statutory maximum.
the legislative history also shows the legislature looked to other sanctions statutes applicable in family law proceedings,including what is now section,for guidance during its enactment of former civil code section,the predecessor of section.in construing a statute,we also examine the context in which the statute appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.pacific sunwear of california,olaes enterprises,th,d.we next turn to an analysis of section,and the timing in which to seek sanctions under that statute.
sanctions under family code section 
as noted,robert also moved under section for monetary sanctions in excess of against catherine and fritz for the substantial legal fees and costs he incurred,which request was separate and independent of his sanctions request under section.robert subsequently dismissed fritz only from his request for sanctions under section 
section provides 
a notwithstanding any other provision of this code,the court may base an award of attorney fees and costs on the extent to which the conduct of each party or attorney furthers or frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation and,where possible,to reduce the cost of litigation by encouraging cooperation between the parties and attorneys.an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to this section is in the nature of a sanction.in making an award pursuant to this section,the court shall take into consideration all evidence concerning the parties incomes,assets,and liabilities.the court shall not impose a sanction pursuant to this section that imposes an unreasonable financial burden on the party against whom the sanction is imposed.in order to obtain an award under this section,the party requesting an award of attorney fees and costs is not required to demonstrate any financial need for the award.
b an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to this section shall be imposed only after notice to the party against whom the sanction is proposed to be imposed and opportunity for that party to be heard.
c an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to this section is payable only from the property or income of the party against whom the sanction is imposed,except that the award may be against the sanctioned party share of the community property,italics added.
section authorizes a fees and costs award as a penalty for obstreperous conduct.in re marriage of norton d.however,w hile fees and costs imposed under section are in the nature of a sanction,the requisite delicts are limited.the statute is aimed at conduct that further or frustrates settlement of family law litigation and at reduction of litigation cost.in re marriage of freeman th,d freeman.a trial court has broad discretion to award sanctions under section,subject to the unreasonable financial burden cap in subdivision a of that statute,subd.a in re marriage of feldman th,d feldman the imposition of sanctions under section will be reversed for abuse of discretion only if,considering all of the evidence viewed most favorably in support of its order,no judge could reasonably make the order.
section contemplates that sanctions be assessed at the end of the lawsuit,when the extent and severity of the party bad conduct can be judged.freeman,supra,th at,d,quoting in re marriage of quay th,d.in freeman,the court concluded a party,seeking sanctions in the form of attorney fees and costs under section against another for the latter frivolous appeal,was required to file an application within the time limitation set forth in former rule,subdivision c,or within days after the clerk sent notice of issuance of the remittitur.freeman,supra,th at,d.
subsequently,this court concluded in feldman,supra,th at pages,d,that a court may award sanctions under section before the end of a lawsuit,observing the text of section contains no requirement that the trial court impose the sanction at the end of the lawsuit.indeed,the only procedural requirement in the statute is that an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction may be imposed only after notice to the party and an opportunity for that party to be heard.id.at,d.we further concluded,a s a matter of logic,to promote cooperation a trial court must be able to apply sanctions during the course of the litigation when the uncooperative conduct arises in order to encourage better behavior as the litigation progresses.ibid.
robert argues that because there is no statute or rule setting a deadline when a party must file a section motion for monetary sanctions,the deadline is prescribed by equitable principles based on laches.we agree.see fountain valley regional hospital medical center bonta th,d.
laches is designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared.the theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.wood elling cal d,see also magic kitchen llc good things,th,d laches is an equitable time limitation on a party right to bring suit,resting on the maxim that equity aids the vigilant,not those who sleep on their rights.citations.
these policies also guard against other injuries caused by a change of position during a delay.while a statute of limitations bars proceedings without proof of prejudice,laches requires proof of delay which results in prejudice or change of position.lam bureau of security investigative services th,d lam,quoting brown state personnel bd.d.brown.delay alone ordinarily does not constitute laches,as lapse of time is separately embodied in statutes of limitation.ibid.what makes the delay unreasonable in the case of laches is that it results in prejudice.ibid.
there is one circumstance in which unreasonable delay may be found as a matter of law.in cases in which no statute of limitations directly applies but there is a statute of limitations governing an analogous action at law,the period may be borrowed as a measure of the outer limit or reasonable delay in determining laches.citations.whether or not such a borrowing should occur depends upon the strength of the analogy.lam,supra,th at,d,quoting brown,supra,d at.the effect of the violation of the analogous statute of limitations is to shift the burden of proof to the plaintiff to establish that the delay was excusable and the defendant was not prejudiced thereby.ibid.if,however,the two actions are not analogous,the burden does not shift and it remains the responsibility of the party asserting laches to show that the delay was unreasonable and caused the party prejudice.id.at.
in brown the plaintiff argued his dismissal in based on incidents of sexual harassment in was barred by laches,analogizing to a provision in the government code that mandated disciplinary action be brought against a civil service employee within three years after the reason for the discipline arose.brown,supra,d at.the court agreed,observing that while the government code provision did not govern that case as a statute of limitations,it did reflect a legislative policy judgment that a delay of three years is inherently unreasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against a broad range of public employees,including employees whose positions mirror those of the plaintiff.id.at.the brown court thus borrowed the government code provision and concluded it provided an outer limit of delay which is reasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against an employee of the state university system.ibid.
we conclude a party seeking sanctions under section should file his or her motion within the time provided in rule under that rule,the motion for sanctions should be filed within the time provided in rule or,if applicable,rule,or the earliest of days after the superior court clerk mails,or a party serves,notice of judgment or a copy of the judgment or an order exonerating the party of child abuse or neglect allegations,or days after entry of judgment or the issuance of an order where the party is exonerated from such allegations.
we further conclude that if a party files his or her request for section sanctions after the presumptive deadlines set forth in rules,and,if applicable,rule,the burden shifts to the movant to show that his or delay was excused and that such delay did not result in undue prejudice to the opposing party or person who is the subject of the sanctions motion.
our conclusion is based in part on the legislature findings and declaration that the public policy of ensuring the health,safety and welfare of children shall be the primary concern of courts in determining the best interest of children in child custody proceedings,and that an allegation of child abuse asserted by one parent against another has a significant impact on the court determination of custody.see.
in addition,our conclusion promotes consistency within the family code,inasmuch as the court in freeman held a party seeking sanctions under section against another for the latter frivolous appeal was required to file an application within the time limitation set forth in former rule,subdivision c,or within days after the clerk sent notice of issuance of the remittitur.freeman,supra,th at,d.
a section sanctions motion filed within the time period prescribed by rules and is also more likely to be heard by the same judge who presided over the child custody proceeding.as such,this also will promote consistency and fairness in the courts treatment of sanctions awards under section.
robert argues former rule is inapplicable because section expressly provides for recovery of all expenses,not just attorney fees.because former rule current rule governs the timing of a claim for attorney fees only,robert argues these rules do not apply to a statute that provides for recovery of attorney fees and additional expenses.robert also distinguishes section from section on this basis,arguing section provides for an award of attorney fees and costs,whereas section provides for sanctions capped by all costs incurred by the party accused as a direct result of defending the accusation.
robert argument ignores the plain language in section,subdivision a,that a n award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to this section is in the nature of a sanction.italics added see also,subd.b an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to this section shall be imposed only after notice to the party against whom the sanction is proposed and subd.c an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to this section is payable only from the property or the income of the party against whom the sanction is imposed italics added.
in addition,the legislative history of section shows the legislature looked to section code section when authorizing a court to award sanctions based on procedural misconduct.assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill as amended may,reg.sess.
we thus reject robert contention that section is sufficiently distinguishable from section such that the former statute is governed by the time limitation in rule or former rule freeman,supra,th at,d,whereas the latter statute should be governed by a different rule,which according to robert is a limitations period based on equitable principles derived from the tort of malicious prosecution.in fact,sections and have more in common than differences,as both statutes provide for an award of sanctions both give a court broad discretion to make such an award both address procedural misconduct in family law proceedings and both allow a party to recover attorney fees and costs as sanctions.
robert own sanctions motion supports this analysis.it would make little sense to require a party to file a motion for sanctions under section within the time limitation prescribed by rule,for example,while at the same time giving that party two years from the date the party is exonerated from child abuse or neglect allegations to seek sanctions under section.this is particularly true when both statutes allow for the recovery of attorney fees and costs in family law proceedings,which robert sought in his motion 
we also reject robert argument that a limitations period should apply based on the tort of malicious prosecution.allowing a party in a child custody dispute to wait two years to seek sanctions against a person under section is decidedly not in the best interest of a child,as it discourages,as opposed to encourages,finality in child custody litigation,in contravention of public policy.see,lehman lycoming county children services,d t he state interest in finality is unusually strong in child custody disputes adoption of alexander cal d,state interest in finality in disputes is unusually strong in view of the importance of a stable relationship in re clarissa th,d the public policy of expediency and finality is unusually strong in custody matters,as uncertainty is detrimental to a child development and.
in addition,we disagree with robert that section redresses the same injury that is at the core of a civil action for malicious prosecution.section does not create a right to damages,as robert argues.instead,this statute provides a limited exception to the absolute litigation privilege in civil code section,subdivision b,which is further limited by the family law court discretion to sanction a person for making knowingly false accusations of child abuse or neglect in a child custody proceeding.
by analogizing the discretionary authority of a court to award sanctions under section to the right to recover damages in the tort of malicious prosecution,robert opens the door to the potential abuse of this statute by parties in child custody and other family law proceedings that courts closed when they barred malicious prosecution in such proceedings.see begier strom th,d can not maintain malicious prosecution against based on her filing of false police report accusing of molesting their daughter bidna rosen th,d bidna husband may not maintain action for malicious prosecution against wife for her filing of multiple child custody proceedings,inasmuch as the remedy for egregious conduct in family law court is for the family law bench to nip it in the bud with appropriate sanctions,not to expand tort liability for malicious prosecution to the family law bar.courts adopted a bright line rule barring malicious prosecution claims in family law cases because such cases have a unique propensity for bitterness bidna,supra,th at,d and because family law courts have the ability to swiftly discourage litigious nonsense at its source by imposing sanctions within the family law proceeding,citing among other statutes.
we thus reject robert argument the legislature intended to leave litigants,witnesses and attorneys exposed to potential sanctions under section for two full years after a party has been exonerated from child abuse or neglect allegations.
we also reject applying the limitations period in code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,to a request for sanctions under section.the trial court here reasoned the statute of limitations for defamation implicitly governs a section motion because section permits a party to bring a claim for damages for false accusations and to do so within the context of a proceeding under the family code.because a false accusation of child abuse is a form of slander,the trial court reasoned robert claim for damages under section and for attorney fees incurred in recovering those damages was subject to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.
a cause of action for defamation accrues at the time the defamatory statement is published using term published in its technical sense.shively bozanich cal th,d.i n defamation actions the general rule is that publication occurs when the defendant communicates the defamatory statement to a person other than the person being defamed.ibid.
in the case before us,robert claim he was wrongly accused of child abuse or neglect of his daughter dates back to catherine september,declaration in support of her custody osc.if we applied defamation principles to section as did the trial court,robert would have been required to file his request for sanctions under within one year,or by september,at the latest.
the record shows,however,that the psychological evaluation of the parties was not completed until january.the record further shows the trial court extensively relied on the findings in this report and the testimony of the doctor who prepared it in determining the best interest of the parties daughter,and in granting robert sole legal custody of her at the conclusion of the child custody trial held in may.
we decline to adopt a rule that would have required robert to seek sanctions under section before the trial court determination of custody and visitation based on the best interest of their daughter,wh
