a guardian ad litem and conservator of an incompetent injured worker seeks to compel the workers compensation appeals board wcab or board to vacate its opinion determining the guardian was entitled to be compensated by the worker employer for the care she gave the worker pursuant to labor code section only if she were not compensated for such care out of the conservatorship estate and the care were not duplicative or capable of being duplicated by a professional such as a licensed vocational nurse.
we conclude the board has no basis for restricting compensation to nonduplicative care because the parties agreed in a compromise and release agreement c r that the guardian was entitled to compensation for duplicative care and the employer,not the estate of the injured worker,should bear the expense.
background 
on october,john perry hodgman john sustained a catastrophic industrial injury in a collision while employed by community care center hospitalized and in a coma for an extended period,he underwent multiple surgeries,including implantation of permanent ventricular peritoneal shunts within the brain in order to reduce pressure from an intracranial bleed which was blocking the flow of cerebral spinal fluid.the injuries left john with severe cognitive and physical deficits,and he now resides in an assisted living facility.
on november,john mother,ruth ann prokosch prokosch,was appointed john guardian ad litem and trustee by the workers compensation judge wcj.prokosch and her husband,merlin,were later appointed conservators of john person and estate by the superior court.conservatorship of hodgman super.county,no.nep.
in early,withers at arcadia methodist hospital advised prokosch that she needed to become aware of the nature of john injury in that she would be the primary person involved in making decisions concerning his medical care.prokosch,who had no prior medical knowledge or training,undertook extensive,which included reading a book on closed brain injuries written by a renowned physician in the field,whom she contacted.the book dealt with stages of development.she also participated in family support groups.she continued to do research as issues arose and acquired and conducted an study of all of john medical reports.
rosen at northridge hospital advised prokosch that an individual whose family members are actively involved in patient care improves far more rapidly than those who are left alone.in a march,report,jeffrey schaeffer,opined john family and in particular his mother ruth prokosch have been a major source of strength and advocacy for john,the results of which appear to have been the procurement of a vast number and depth of services during the past ten years or so.a bsent this exceedingly high level of commitment and advocacy it would be unlikely that he would have accessed as many services that he received to date,nor would he have progressed as far as he has,given the severity and complexity of his initial brain injury and subsequent developments.
prokosch services included attending all medical appointments and medical team conferences,informing and interacting with all medical providers regarding medical and behavioral issues as they arose,evaluating and checking on the level of attendant care and medications,inspecting equipment and arranging for necessary repairs,maintaining and delivering supplies,and,because her son risks aspiration of food,reviewing and adjusting his menus.rosen and two other physicians,dumas and hedge,all recommended that she engage in these activities.
oonagh sankar,a registered nurse who has acted as the nurse case manager for john since about or,testified she handles approximately catastrophic cases at any one time and attends only a small percentage of the medical appointments.as a case manager for years,sankar is of the opinion that prokosch direct involvement is essential intervention by a guardian,parent,or other family member to secure quality care is necessary for the survival of someone in john condition during medical evaluations issues arise suddenly,which physicians specifically directed prokosch to watch for and address and because a individual is incapable of communicating such things as the need for repair of medical equipment,a guardian is needed so that such information is communicated to the medical team.she also testified that only prokosch has the authority to make john decisions.sankar stated that john sometimes aspirates his food and that significant medical issues like pneumonia could arise unless caught right up front,which is what prokosch is so good at,but someone who was so diligent could easily miss 
nurse sankar sees prokosch monitoring of attendant care as vital.there are attendants in and out of that room,on and off john case all the time t here is no one else to take responsibility to make sure the operations are running well and what going on with the equipment.people want to come in,do their shift,do their hours and leave,they do care that the wheelchair is wobbly.
dumas,john primary treating physician,testified that john caregivers are his custodians or guardians and he has a nurse case manager dumas defers immediate care decisions that are urgent or emergent to them dumas noted that john is not capable of making his own decisions or of deciding what care he needs.all of these decisions can impact john medical status and must be made for him by his guardian,who has the power to make decisions.
prokosch has taken care to log separately the time she spends on medically related activities for which she has sought compensation from community care center in the workers compensation proceedings and nonmedically related activities for which she has obtained compensation from the conservatorship in superior court.
a dispute arose in regarding the question of whether prokosch,in her capacity as guardian,was entitled to be compensated for medical treatment,such as nursing or housekeeping services and for the extraordinary amount of time she devotes to ensuring that her son receives appropriate medical care 
after a long delay unexplained by the parties,on february,prokosch and community care center executed a c r regarding prokosch claimed expenses through december.the c r covered six months after december,or through july,and stated for the next six months,it is agreed that the guardian ad litem prokosch will be entitled to per hour for reasonable and necessary services,which shall not be duplicative to other services.at the termination of the six month period,the parties will the hourly amount.six month period beginning upon submission of this document to wcab duplicate services shall not be interpreted as any two parties such as the legal guardians and the case manager attending to the same issue,as it is often necessary for both parties to attend appointments jointly to discuss medical equipment issues,italics added.
pursuant to the order approving the c r,prokosch submitted monthly statements to community care center,which compensated her without objection for five years,from to.in,community care center abruptly quit paying.
on november,prokosch filed a petition to enforce the c r,for a penalty,and for reasonable attorney fees.prokosch contended that the c r established that she is entitled to be compensated by community care center for her services where necessary to secure appropriate medical care and equipment for john and community care center should pay a penalty for unreasonably refusing to do so.as all such activity requires necessary time expenditures on the part of the guardian ad litem prokosch in order to procure treatment that is necessary to cure or relieve the injury,under the c r the defendant community care center is obligated to reimburse such services.
community care center responded that the c r was limited to six months,with the hourly amount to be renegotiated,but there was no agreement that community care center was required to pay for any guardian ad litem time or expense it further contended there was no case law or statutory law requiring such payments.
at trial,prokosch argued the c r was res judicata.the wcj ruled that the c r was res judic
