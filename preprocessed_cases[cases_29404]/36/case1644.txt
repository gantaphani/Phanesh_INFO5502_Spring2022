the remarkable thing about this juvenile dependency case is the diametrically opposite positions taken by the two attorneys who,respectively,have been minor counsel at trial and on appeal.at the welfare and institutions code section hearing hearing held in may,involving zeth,minor trial counsel was adamantly in favor of the termination of parental rights.the minor trial counsel,in fact,led the charge against mother stacy,usually being the first to object to questions from stacy counsel that would have shown that zeth had a strong relationship with his mother zeth trial counsel was the most aggressive lawyer in the of his mother,relentlessly emphasizing that stacy had had a relapse into taking illegal drugs in march and in oral argument at the hearing,zeth trial counsel confidently assured the court that zeth then current caretaker,his maternal grandfather,was ready,willing and able to adopt.
it is a different story on appeal,where zeth independent appellate counsel now supports the mother.in her letter brief,the minor appellate counsel has informed the court that the grandfather felt pressure to adopt zeth and would rather be his legal guardian.minor appellate counsel letter brief emphasizes the strong bond between mother stacy and her child,reminds the court that stacy continues to assume primary parental responsibilities of taking care of zeth in the home of the maternal grandfather,and urges reversal of the order terminating parental rights.the letter brief also states that minor appellate counsel conferred with both the case social worker and minor trial counsel as part of her investigation.
california rules of court rule a f provides that minor counsel appellate briefs are due days after the respondent brief is filed unless minor counsel is granted leave to file the minor brief at a different time,so county counsel did not have an opportunity to respond to minor appellate counsel revelation.we requested further briefing to provide that opportunity.
before we address county counsel position,it must be noted that,even without the allegation that the caretaker had been pressured into agreeing to adopt zeth stacy presented strong evidence at the hearing that she fit within the and usually unsuccessful c a benefit exception,at least insofar as the requirement of fulfilling a parental role is concerned.see in re beatrice th,d.zeth had been placed with stacy own father,so the usual logistical problems of visitation did not prevent her from being her child primary caregiver.there was uncontroverted evidence at the hearing that she fed him,cooked meals for him,bathed him,dressed him,read a bedtime story and put him to bed,and taught him the alphabet,colors,shapes,and numbers.that was in addition to the fun things that she did with her child go the pool or the park,play with the child toys,play catch,go to the pet shop,toy store and mall.there was evidence that the child preferred to be bathed by his mother rather than one of the grandparents.likewise he wanted his mother whenever he was hurt or sick,and when she was home zeth would ask for his mother.
we must now reverse and send the case back for an updated review hearing.see in re eileen,supra,th at,d analogous procedure in cases of ineffective assistance of counsel in re arturo th,d same.the new information brought to the attention of this court by the minor appellate counsel calls into question the position taken by minor counsel at the trial level,and raises the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.had minor trial counsel sided with the parent in this case based on the new information,in all likelihood there would have been a dramatically different result in the hearing more probable than not,in the language usually used to describe ineffective assistance of counsel.see in re kristin th,d,quoting people watson cal d.
in its supplemental brief,arguing against any remand,county counsel stresses one point because the law is that an identified adoptive family need not be waiting in the wings in re jennilee th,fn,d first use of phrase in context of hearing see also in re lukas th,d in re sarah th,d,the fact that the grandfather might have been pressured into stating he wanted to adopt zeth rather than be his guardian is irrelevant to the issue of whether zeth was adoptable within the meaning of section,subdivision c zeth is still quite adoptable ergo the fact that his caretaker did not really want to adopt him makes no difference to the termination of stacy rights.
county counsel argument fails because it does not take into account the fact,as we show in detail in part iii of this opinion,that the legislature has conferred a special role on minor counsel.that role is only part advocate.it is also part watchdog,and part referee.let us be plain minor counsel serves a special and unique role in dependency jurisprudence,and a judge or hearing officer,acting as trier of fact,is likely to be influenced by the position taken by minor counsel.the new evidence that the grandfather was pressured into stating a preference for adoption could very well have prompted minor trial counsel to change their position,and that in turn would have changed the whole focus of the proceeding,and certainly might have led to a different result.
the duties of minors counsel are set by section of the welfare code,subdivisions c initial appointment of minor counsel,requirement that counsel shall advocate for the protection,safety,and physical and emotional of the minor and e detailing specific duties,including interviewing and other investigation.
the statute is remarkable in that it requires minor counsel to be proactive in investigating the minor best interest.the statute specifically requires minor counsel to conduct an independent factual investigation into what position accords best with the minor welfare and then report the results of that factual investigation to the court counsel shall make further investigations necessary to ascertain the facts,including the interviewing of witnesses,subd.e,emphasis added.if the child is four years old or older,counsel must interview the child to determine the child wishes and to assess the minor,and shall advise the court of the minor wishes.ibid.counsel also shall investigate the interests of the minor beyond the scope of the juvenile proceeding and report to the court other interests of the minor that may need to be protected by the institution of other administrative or judicial proceedings,emphasis added.
these statutory duties to conduct a factual investigation and report to the court necessarily confer on minor counsel in dependency cases a special role in american jurisprudence.the situation where a lawyer is required by statute to investigate and report to the court on behalf of his or her client so that the court can take action to protect the interests of that client is unusual,to say the least.even more unusual is a statutory prohibition against a lawyer arguing a certain position.under section,the lawyer is forbidden to argue for the return of a child to his or her parent under certain circumstances,subd.e.and on top of those anomalies,there is the further requirement,well established in the common law,that minor counsel must use his or her independent judgment in arriving at the position to advocate,despite the stated preferences of the client.see in re eileen,supra,th at,d emphasizing need for minor counsel to exercise independent judgment in re candida th,d the obligation of counsel for a dependent minor is to pursue whatever is in the minor best interest.this may or may not be what the minor wishes.in re richard d.the preference of the minor is not determinative of his or her best interests.
minor counsel is special also because the minor counsel necessarily acts a neutral litigant in the sense of being only concerned about the child.triers of fact must necessarily be skeptical about the other parties and the positions advocated by their lawyers.parents have reasons for seeking return of their children that are always pure guilt,pride,or simple possessiveness too often motivates parents in dependency cases,as well as a natural desire to be with their offspring.on the other hand,social service agencies are subject to their own sets of bureaucratic rules and dynamics which,on occasion,also conflict with a child best interests.see generally los angeles county of children.services superior court th,d chastizing children services agency and its counsel for opposing plan by foster parent to send child for an vacation.
it should thus be fairly obvious that of all the parties who appear in a juvenile dependency proceeding,it is the minor counsel who functions closest to a capacity the minor counsel role is reminiscent of the court own role in a inquisitorial justice system,where judges rely on experts and investigators who are not chosen by the parties indeed,judging simply by the plain text of section,subdivision e,the most important function of minor counsel is to determine the particular position that best accords with the child interests.
moreover,given human nature,the minor counsel special role tends to confer on minor counsel a special credibility with the court qua trier of fact.a juvenile court judge could reasonably assume that the minor counsel had performed his statutory duty to investigate,general presumption that the law has been obeyed and would therefore enjoy a certain confidence that any ruling consistent with the position of the minor counsel would be one which,at least in minor counsel opinion,would not result in physical harm to the minor needless to say,it is the worst nightmare of every judge who works on a dependency case including,we dare say,appellate judges that a return of a child to a parent will result in harm to the child 
finally,the statute makes no differentiation between minor trial counsel and minor appellate counsel.if anything,the statutory duty to investigate the interests of the child beyond the scope of the juvenile proceeding and report to the court other interests of the child that may need to be protected by the institution of other administrative or judicial proceedings is a clear indication that minor counsel investigative role extends to appellate counsel.the legislature must have intended that minor counsel act as a final check on any placement made by the social service agency.
given the special role of minor counsel,both trial level and appellate,the very position taken by the minor attorney is going to carry de facto some independent weight with the trier of fact.and we dare say that,in a case,the position taken by minor appellate counsel will also carry at least some weight with the court of appeal.
of course,the mere fact that an appointed appellate counsel changes position from that of the minor counsel by itself comes nowhere close to establishing grounds for reversal.trial and appellate counsel may simply have an honest disagreement about the best interests of the child,and given that equilibrium,the usual appellate presumptions in favor of the trial court judgment would certainly be dispositive.
in this case,however,there is evidence of a nature that furnishes a concrete reason for the change of position.that evidence is clearly relevant to a change of circumstances warranting a change in a prior order because the best interests of the child demand it.in re eileen,supra,th at,d.the evidence also casts doubt on the actual resolution of the conflicting evidence at the hearing regarding the applicability of the benefit.had minor trial counsel apprised the trial court of the pressure put on the grandfather to adopt,and of the grandfather stated preference to be a guardian so that his daughter could continue to have the legal status as zeth mother,we can not say that the judgment before us would be the same.
thus far we have proceeded on the assumption that minor appellate counsel statement in her letter brief concerning the caretaker real preference is accurate,even though it has not been made in a declaration under oath.the obvious issue that arises is how appellate courts should treat such information,which is not going to be in the appellate record,given that it arrives without the usual safeguards of the law of evidence.
manifestly,it is not the proper province of appellate courts to determine facts.the instances when appellate courts actually take evidence code civ,cal.rules of court,rule are extremely rare,and it would be safe to say that appellate courts are loath to use the power they have.see generally eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group to,to.but,as the eisenberg rutter group practice guide notes,there is an exception in the area of juvenile dependency appeals,where at least some courts will routinely accept additional evidence.id.at,citing in re jonathan th,d.
but there can be no doubt about the need to take into account developments in juvenile dependency cases,where the subject matter of the litigation is,after all,a child life.the static model of appellate evaluation of a judgment based on settled and discrete facts that works well in almost all other areas of law does not always work well when the object of the litigation is the ongoing of a child.see in re arturo,supra,th at,d no static conditions in juvenile dependency law.the consequences to the child are too grave if an adoptive placement is not working out,yet a judgment affirming the termination of the relationship between the child and his or her natural parents is routinely affirmed.if an adoptive placement does work out,the result can be catastrophic to the child.legal orphanage is the worst of all possible outcomes no parents and no adoptive home.
the problem is how to evaluate the evidence of such developments,without undoing the basic structure of appellate procedure.is it enough,for example,that appellate counsel put the information in a letter brief 
there are grave consequences on the opposite side as well.as this court pointed out in in re cristella th,d,there are cases where the erroneous non termination of parental rights is worse than the erroneous termination.cristella involved far different facts than the case here the child was born addicted to drugs,and no parental relationship ever developed reversal of the judgment would in all likelihood have led to the loss of a stable and permanent home.
in light of the dangers of erroneous termination or erroneous nontermination,something more than just a statement in a brief the functional equivalent of an offer of proof would appear to be necessary before an appellate court should reverse the termination of parental rights in the wake of a change of position by the minor counsel which casts doubt on the result of the hearing.see smith,smith kring superior court th,d matters in points and authorities are not evidence.accordingly,we conclude that information concerning new developments submitted by appellate counsel on appeal in juvenile dependency cases should be made pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,which,by a to rule,requires affidavits or other evidence in its support.if the appellate court concludes that the new developments which will usually concern some aspect of the minor placement in a prospective adoptive home,if found true on remand by a trial court,would otherwise warrant a reversal of the order terminating parental rights,the case should be remanded to the trial court for an updated review hearing in order to assess the child current status.
the updated review would,in effect,be a retrial of the hearing,this time with presumably better information on both adoptability and the possible application of the benefit exception.see in re eileen,supra,th at,d analogous procedure in cases of ineffective assistance of counsel in re arturo,supra,th at,d same.if the matter turns out to be a false alarm another order terminating parental rights is the logical outcome of the retrial of the hearing.if not,the court can make the appropriate order under section.additionally,the pendency of the appeal would allow the parent to bring a section motion if appropriate.
there is civil precedent for this procedure,as it parallels the procedure of an application for a writ of error coram vobis,where a party asks for a writ from the appellate court directing the trial court to r
