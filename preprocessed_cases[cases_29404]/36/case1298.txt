marianne and robert appeal the judgments terminating their parental rights to their children,joshua and jacob,under welfare and institutions code section marianne asserts the court erred in denying her motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a to vacate the referral orders erred by not advising her of the possible consequences of waiving her right to a trial and abused its discretion when it denied her request to continue the section hearing.she also asserts insufficient evidence supported the finding of adoptability and the finding that the section,subdivision c a beneficial relationship exception does not apply.
robert asserts the judgments should be reversed because the imperial county department of social services the department reneged on its agreement to recommend guardianship and was estopped from asserting the parents did not meet their burden to show an exception to adoption applied extrinsic fraud or mistake denied the parents a fair adversary proceeding and the court erred in terminating parental rights because he had a beneficial relationship with the children within the meaning of the section,subdivision c a exception.each parent has joined the appeal of the other.we affirm the judgments.
factual and procedural background 
in january,the department removed jacob and joseph from marianne custody and filed a section petition on the children behalf.the petition alleged the children were at risk because marianne left the children with her mother and had not returned,marianne might be using drugs,and the children had been left without provision for their care by both parents.the petition was subsequently amended to allege a long history of domestic violence between the parents.in march,the court made true findings on the allegations in the petitions relating to marianne,dismissed the petition as to robert,declared the children to be dependents,removed the children from marianne custody,and ordered reunification services for her.the children were placed with their maternal grandparents.
later in march,the department filed another section petition alleging the children were at risk because the social worker had learned robert had been convicted of violating a restraining order preventing him from contacting marianne and he had left the children without provision for care and support.in april,the court made true findings on the petition.in june,the court again declared the children to be dependents,removed them from parental custody,and ordered reunification services.
in february,the court found marianne had been making substantial progress and continued her services for six more months.in april,the court terminated robert reunification services because his progress with his case plan had been minimal.he appealed from this order.in re joshua,wl,nonpub.opn.hereafter appeal.in august,the court returned the children to marianne custody and continued the matter for six months.robert appealed this order as well.in re joshua,wl,nonpub.opn.hereafter appeal.
in our january decision in appeal,we reversed the order terminating robert reunification services and remanded the matter for the court to his progress on the reunification plan and determine whether he was provided with reasonable visitation.the next month,the court told counsel it had received an opinion from the court of appeals with a tentative ruling,but had not yet received the remittitur.simultaneously,the court terminated marianne family maintenance services and dismissed the matter as to her.
in march,this court reversed the orders from the review hearing in appeal.we remanded the matter for the court to reconsider the issue of returning the children to marianne custody in light of the outcome of the remand on the proceedings we had directed in appeal.the court scheduled a new review hearing for july.
in july,apparently before the court had held the new review hearing we directed in appeal,the department filed a section modification petition on behalf of the children.the petition alleged the children were at risk because marianne had been arrested for possession of a controlled substance,had not made proper arrangements for the care and support of the children,and had not complied with her case plan,and her whereabouts were unknown.the petitions were amended in august to add a count that marianne had a methamphetamine pipe in her possession and had admitted using methamphetamine.in september,the court made true findings on the section modification petition.
in october,the department filed a status review report recommending the court terminate reunification services and schedule a section hearing with the proposed permanent plan of adoption.at the november review hearing,it changed its recommendation to guardianship.the children counsel,however,asked the court to prepare an adoption assessment.the court explained to the parents that although the department was recommending guardianship,it would consider terminating parental rights at the section hearing.the court scheduled the section hearing.
in its initial assessment report,the department recommended a permanent plan of guardianship.two months later,however,it filed an assessment report recommending a permanent plan of adoption.in may,the court agreed to continue the section hearing in light of the changed recommendation so the parents could file section modification petitions.both parents filed section petitions.marianne sought to vacate the section hearing,place the children with the parents,and transfer the case to the parents county of residence.robert sought reinstatement of reunification services for both parents.each parent subsequently filed a motion under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a seeking to vacate the referral hearing and hold a new hearing as we directed in appeal and appeal under the court general power to amend and control its processes and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.subsequently,the department filed an addendum report indicating it was recommending a permanent plan of guardianship based on its agreement with the parents.
at the august section hearing,the court denied the code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motions on the ground that the department was again recommending guardianship and denied robert section modification petition the court then terminated parental rights after finding the children were adoptable and none of the section,subdivision c exceptions applied.
discussion 
the parents argue the department should be equitably estopped from asserting they did not meet their burden to show the section,subdivision c a exception applied 
in order to find equitable estoppel,four elements must be present the department must be apprised of the facts the department must intend that its conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the parents had a right to believe it was so intended the parents must be ignorant of the true state of the facts and the parents must rely upon the conduct to their injury.guardianship of ethan d.further,for the doctrine to apply,the parents reliance must be reasonable.phillippe shapell industries cal d,morrison california horse racing bd.d.
here,the parents could not reasonably rely on the court following the department recommendation for guardianship.they have been aware since the jurisdictional hearing that the court could terminate parental rights if they failed to reunify.at the hearing in which the department first indicated it would limit its recommendations to guardianship,the children counsel said he wanted the children adoptability to be assessed,making clear the children would press for termination of parental rights.at that same hearing,the court told the parents it would consider terminating parental rights at the section hearing moreover,they have always known the grandparents wanted to adopt the children.because the parents knew the children wanted a permanent plan of adoption and the court was considering terminating parental rights,any reliance by the parents on their belief that the court would follow the department recommendation of guardianship was not reasonable.
moreover,a lthough equitable estoppel may apply to government actions where justice and right so require,estoppel will not be applied against the government if the result would be to nullify a strong rule of policy adopted for the benefit of the public citations or to contravene directly any statutory or constitutional limitations.citation.citations.emma inglewood unified school dist.th,d.the public policy here is the protection of abused and neglected children and the children need for stability and permanence in re marilyn cal th,d.
the department is an arm of the government and its duty is to protect the best interests of dependent children.in re danielle d.it also has a duty to apprise the court of all relevant facts and circumstances when issuing reports.in re john th,d.thus,regardless of its agreement with the parents,the department had a duty to provide a report to the court assessing the children adoptability if,in performing that analysis,the department concluded its earlier assessment that guardianship was the most appropriate permanent plan was no longer valid,it had a duty to so inform the court.adhering to a recommendation of guardianship based on the department agreement with the parents would subordinate the children best interests to that agreement and thereby nullify a strong rule of public policy.the equitable estoppel doctrine is inapplicable.
the parents assert the judgment should be reversed because the department engaged in extrinsic fraud however,the parents did not raise the issue of fraud in either their section modification petitions or their code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motions.we see no reason to deviate from the usual rule that when a parent does not raise an issue in the trial court,he or she is precluded from raising the issue on appeal.in re cal th,d.that is particularly true when,as here,the issue requires a finding of fact.see guido koopman th,d the existence of actual fraud is always a question of fact.to resolve the issue of whether the department acted fraudulently,we would have to engage in factfinding,which is not the function of this court.tupman haberkern cal,findings of fact are the sole province of the trial court.the parents have waived their right to argue the department committed fraud when it initially recommended guardianship.
the parents assert the court erred in denying marianne code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion.
preliminarily,we address the children contention that code of civil procedure section does not apply to juvenile dependency proceedings.dependency proceedings are special proceedings governed by their own rules and statutes.et cal.rules of court,rule et statutes applicable to civil cases are not applicable to dependency actions unless expressly made so.in re daniel th,d.because there is no provision in the welfare and institutions code adopting code of civil procedure section,subdivision a for juvenile dependency court proceedings,the section is inapplicable here however,because the children did not argue below that a code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion was not allowed in dependency proceedings,they are estopped from claiming the issue was not in controversy.see george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.d.thus,we will examine whether the court correctly denied the motion.
under the first sentence of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.we review the denial of a code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion for an abuse of discretion.see chambers superior court d,fn.
the department and the children assert there is no abuse of discretion because the department stood by its recommendation for guardianship.the department took no position at the section hearing and has not asserted on appeal that the court correctly found the section,subdivision c a exception did not apply however,before the hearing,the department filed an assessment recommending adoption.that action did not require the court to grant the code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion because the department had been ordered to file an assessment of the children adoptability.further,as discussed in part,infra,the department was statutorily obligated to give the court all the information about the children,regardless of any agreement made with the parents.
the department also filed a trial brief that was clearly a request for the court to terminate parental rights there was no statutory duty compelling the department to file this brief and it certainly violated the spirit of the department agreement to recommend guardianship.however,this fact did not compel the court to grant the code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion.notwithstanding the department agreement to recommend guardianship,when the department first told the court in november it would recommend guardianship,the parents were told the court was considering terminating parental rights and the children intended to request termination of parental rights.knowing this,the parents could not assume the court would follow the department recommendation.their decision not to litigate the issues as specified in our remand in appeal was apparently a calculated risk that failed.this did not mean the referral order was not just or that the court had to give them another opportunity to litigate those issues.the court did not abuse its discretion in denying marianne code of civil procedure section,subdivision a motion.
the parents assert the judgments should be reversed because the court did not advise them of the possible consequences of waiving their rights to a hearing on the merits when they submitted at the referral hearing.although they have provided us with several cases that discuss knowing and voluntary waiver of constitutional rights in criminal proceedings,none of those cases addressed the issue in the context of dependency matters.the parents have cited no authority requiring the court to determine whether a parent choice to submit at a referral hearing is knowing and voluntary to the contrary,the court has a duty to explain the parents rights to a hearing only at the jurisdictional hearing.cal.rules of court,rules j,b.
even if we assume the court had an obligation to tell the parents of the consequences of submitting at the referral hearing,the court effectively did so by stating it would consider terminating parental rights at the section hearing.this statement was a clear warning that waiving the right to a hearing on possibly meritorious issues could have significant consequences in the future.the court did not err by not explicitly informing marianne of the consequences of not having a hearing.
the parents contend the court erred in terminating parental rights because the department provided the court with no information about the children feelings regarding termination of the parents rights 
section,subdivision h requires the court at the selection and implementation hearing to consider the wishes of the child.this evidence may be presented by direct formal testimony in court,informal direct communication with the court in chambers,reports prepared for the hearing,letters,telephone calls to the court,or electronic recordings.in re diana th,d.however,the court must only consider the child wishes to the extent those wishes are ascertainable.in re amanda th,d.a child may not be able to understand the concept of adoption.in re juan th,d.here,at the time of the hearing,jacob was seven and joshua was five.we infer the social worker attempted to discuss the concept of adoption with the children because she said neither understood the concept.she also asked them with whom they wanted to live and they said they wanted to live with marianne.thus,the social worker provided the information she had about the children wishes to the court.
moreover,although the court is obligated to consider a child best interests at the section hearing,the court need not follow the child wishes unless he or she is over the age of,subds.c b,h.thus,even though young children such as jacob and joshua may wa
