on appeal,foster parents argue that we should reverse the granting of the section petition because the juvenile court never specified either in open court or in its written findings the standard of proof it applied.foster parents contend the court should have used the clear and convincing evidence standard,while agency maintains the proper standard of proof was preponderance of the evidence.further,foster parents argue,under any standard of proof,the juvenile court abused its discretion in granting the motion for modification.we conclude that reversal is required because the lower court findings are inadequate and it is unclear whether the court considered the best interests of the child.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to the juvenile court to make findings and to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
was born in february.on july,a petition pursuant to section,subdivisions a and e was filed and,subsequently,was made a dependent of the court was placed with foster parents,and tina was declared a de facto parent on july.
on october,agency filed a petition pursuant to section to modify the placement of with tina to another licensed foster home.the petition alleged that on october,received multiple facial injuries from the foster family dog.the petition specified that t here were multiple puncture wounds on the child jawline and lower right lip,there were five linear scratch marks across the child right cheek and there were scratch marks behind his right ear and on the edge of the right ear.also contained in the petition was the social worker assertion that she had previously observed scratch marks on face and arms and that she had told tina to separate the child from the foster family dog and cats.the petition further alleged that the dog,a rottweiler,was alleged to have bitten tina biological son on his hand earlier that year.the petition stated that,who was months old at the time,was not developmentally capable of interacting appropriately with the animals and would be vulnerable to future injury.
with regard to the reasons why the requested modification was in the child best interests,the petition alleged the foster family has not taken the previous injuries seriously to their child nor to the foster child and the child suffered multiple facial injuries.the foster family dog is a rottweiler and weighs about fifty to sixty pounds and is a danger to the child in addition to the numerous cats.because of the child young age and small size he is vulnerable to further injury.four pictures of the child injuries are attached hereto and made a part of this motion.
the petition indicated that the attorney for,as well as the foster parents attorney,opposed agency section petition.
on october,the juvenile court found that the petition stated a prima facie case for modification and set the matter for hearing on october.
agency filed an interim review report dated october.the report indicated that tina called and left a voice mail message for the social worker on october,about,advising her that had been bitten by the family dog and that she had taken him to the hospital emergency room for treatment.the following morning,about,tina called and spoke with the social worker supervisor.that same day,the social worker called tina.tina reported that had been bitten by their dog and she had taken him to the hospital.tina maintained that the hospital staff could not determine whether the marks on face were bites or scratches.she also stated that the hospital asked her to decide whether should get stitches or liquid stitches she chose the latter.tina also told the social worker that the hospital staff did not believe the injuries met the criteria for a vicious dog attack and the staff did not file a vicious dog report.the social worker wrote that tina tried to minimize injuries by asserting that the nurse at the emergency room had joked about the injuries.
the social worker wrote in the report that tina told her that the incident with the dog occurred when she was in another room doing laundry and,the dog,and tina stepdaughter were in the kitchen.the stepdaughter heard the dog growl and then tina heard scream.as soon as she saw that was injured,tina took him to the hospital.the social worker wrote the foster mother stated that she knew something was going to happen to the child and then she stated that she had allowed the dog to lick the child face the morning after the injury.the foster mother went on to explain that she wanted the dog and the child to have a friendly relationship and that she did not want the child to be scared further,when the emergency worker spoke with tina on october,tina stated several times that children must learn there are limits and boundaries to things they can do with animals,and the emergency worker asked tina three separate times if she were blaming the child.tina stated that she was going to take the dog food bowl and toys out of the house,but she did not mention or discuss separating from the dog.
the court held the hearing on the section petition on october.the parties stipulated that was injured by the family dog and that the wound appeared to be a bite.additionally,counsel stipulated to the authenticity of the four photographs of injuries taken by the court appointed special advocate casa on october.
the social worker who prepared the interim report testified.she testified as to what tina had told her,and her testimony was essentially the same as what she had written in her report.when asked about a prior incident involving the dog and the foster parents biological child,she stated that there had been a referral to children protective services cps in april.the report was principally concerned with the child hand being caught in the door,but it also mentioned that the child had been injured by the dog.
also testified.he stated that their family dog is a mutt.he received the dog from his sister,and her dog is a hound.the dog father was unknown,but he presumed the father was a rottweiler because their dog has many of the markings of a rottweiler.
stated that he was familiar with the cps referral in april and the incident between their son and their dog.he stated the incident involving the dog and their son occurred in january.at that time,their oldest daughter,their son,and he were in the same room their son was playing with the dog.their son picked up the dog rawhide bone and was getting the dog to chase it.his son then took the bone away from the dog and placed the bone behind his own head.the dog jumped at the bone and came down and struck his son on his cheek.the wound bled for a couple of minutes,and he was taken to the family doctor the next day.the wound was not deep enough for stitches.
said that cps considered this incident an accident.testified that tina and he were already taking the dog,who was about months old,to obedience training.the evening following the incident with their biological son,they went to a dog training session and talked to the trainer about the incident.the trainer recommended removing all rawhide bones from the home,which he asserted they did.she also recommended that all roughhouse play with their son and the dog be eliminated,which asserted they also implemented.he stated that they also removed all the dog toys from the house and placed them outside.the dog completed a or obedience training class and claimed that he was the star of his class.
when asked whether it was safe for the dog to be around,responded it unacceptable for a family pet to respond in that way no matter what might precipitate that event.and he ca be in the house,and he ca be at our house he needs to find a new home.when asked whether the solution was to get rid of the dog,he responded,yeah.
was also asked about scratches that the social worker had previously observed on indicated that they were from the cats and that they have carefully watched while he was around the pets.asserted we worked really hard with him,teaching him how to pet the cats from head to tail so it does rough their fur,how to be appropriate around pets.
the court also asked a few questions.the court stated that said the dog struck his son,and it wanted to know what part of the dog struck his son.responded that it was one of his teeth.the court asked,so it was a bite responded,yes,definitely.
tina also testified.she stated that she took complete responsibility for the fact that the family dog hurt.when asked what she did wrong,she stated i left a little boy in a room while i decided to go out and tend to our dog.my daughter was in the other room.i assumed she was paying attention.i am the adult,and i should have made that assumption.i made a bad judgment.she stated that she did not tell the social worker that she knew something was going to happen to.she noted that she had a conversation with the social worker at another time and she stated that was a very active child and that she was concerned that there would be some point in time where he would have an injury.she also denied letting the dog lick face the day following the injury.she stated that it would not have been appropriate to let the dog lick his face because the instructions were that the liquid bandages were not to get wet and the licking could cause an infection.she stated that she did not allow any contact between the dog and on the day following the incident.
when asked why the court should entrust to her care despite her bad judgment on october,tina responded because he been with us for months.i made a really bad mistake,and i will always have to live with that.and i sorry.i take full responsibility.but we love that little boy.and he has become a part of our family.he bonded with our son.we thought that we could try and teach children to get along with family animals,but i think what i learned is you ca do that.and the animals are gone.we made that choice.will not be harmed anymore.
during argument by counsel for the foster parents,the court interrupted counsel when he said that was straightforward the court interjected except it bothered me that he insisted on saying the dog struck his son,and i had to pursue whether it was a bite.the reluctance in the courtroom to acknowledge it was an injury caused by the dog teeth is of grave concern to me.his pride of the dog being the star of the obedience sorry.the dog is not even close to being at the same level as a human being it reading between the lines that causes me more concern than i had prior.
the court continued it not a matter of being pleased.it a matter of somebody on the witness stand saying,the dog bit my kid.it his child,not my dependent child,that was bit.and he ca even bring himself to acknowledge that his son was bitten.his explanation was,and i quote from the record,that,the dog struck his son.not only is he personifying the dog it not being open,and there still that element of denial.now,maybe i am putting too much on the importance of symbolism of language,but that what we do here.
the attorney for argued that the foster parents deserve and should get a severe knuckle rapping or severe statements to them for them to understand what they did was wrong.it not excusable at all.but i also weigh that against how has lived in their home for of the months that he been alive.i saw yesterday in the home he is at now.he looks uncomfortable.we would like to think that future will be good,but i feel like this is the first point where in everyday life,the mean,the decisions since the initial incident that brought about the dependency action,that right now psyche is being affected and he does understand what going on.it difficult,but i think,after hearing the assurances that the foster parents have given and how the dog will not be in the house,and with severe statements given to them by your honor,that should be returned.
the two attorneys for the biological parents told the court that they agreed with agency section motion.
finally,the court heard from the casa.the casa for stated that the foster parents made a serious mistake in allowing to be with the dog unattended.the casa for stated in the times i have been in the house observing,which is approximately between five and ten times,i time i have returned with,they either put the dog outside or he has been inside in the first place.so i have seen him engaging with the dog directly.i feel,just as the casa for and not everybody else involved,that from his little perspective,the place that he wants to be most if he could verbalize that,would be at the foster parents home.he very bonded,and i have seen the great relationship he has with the foster parents other children.not that he has necessarily experienced some degree of trauma from the dog bite.but i am sure if he was older and he could express his wishes,that is what he would most likely say.and i feel that even though this does reflect a lack of judgment around the issue of pets,i am not sure whether that can be extended,from what i have seen of them,to imply that we have a lack of judgment about other areas of his safety.as i have directly seen them be very careful in other areas,like safety gates or making he always being watched.so i feel if the pets are there,and that was the area in which the lack of judgment occurred,then their place would be safe for him to be returned.but from perspective,he going to be best served in their house with the pets gone.
when asked by the court whether she had seen since he had been placed in another foster home,the casa for responded yes,i have.i saw him nights ago.he was not as gregarious as i have observed him at tina house he was a little more withdrawn 
at the end of the hearing,the court stated the following when i look at these photographs and know that there was a prior injury to a child by this same animal,i can do nothing but grant the motion.the court also terminated the de facto parent status of tina.the court did not specify the standard of proof used in evaluating the merits of the motion.the form for the findings contains a box next to each of the following statements after hearing evidence,the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence,that the allegations of the petition are true.after hearing evidence,the court determines by clear and convincing evidence,that the allegations of the petition are true.no check mark was entered in either of the boxes adjacent to the foregoing statements.
on december,the foster parents filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
foster parents argue that reversal is required because the juvenile court did not set forth the standard of proof it used when making its decision.they maintain that the court should have required agency to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence.agency concedes that the court never specified the standard of proof it used when assessing the evidence,but it insists the proper standard is preponderance of the evidence,not clear and convincing evidence.additionally,foster parents contend that,even if reversal is not automatic because of the lower court failure to specify the standard of proof it used,the court abused its discretion in granting the modification petition.we first determine the proper standard of proof the lower court should have used and then we consider whether it abused its discretion when it granted agency section motion.
standard of proof 
under section,various parties,including the agency,may petition the court to change,modify or set aside a previous court order on the grounds of changed circumstances or new evidence,subd.a.the petition shall set forth why the requested modification is in the best interests of the dependent child,subd.b.
foster parents acknowledge that ordinarily the moving party for a section motion has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a change of circumstances exists and that
