the rogers family brought this action under,alleging that the conduct of social worker charlotta royal in removing the rogers children from their home without a warrant violated their fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,although the rogerses was as to liability only.the district court granted royal motion on the basis of qualified immunity.because we hold that it was clearly established that warrantless removal of children is permissible only in cases of exigency,and that it would have been apparent to a reasonable social worker that no exigency existed in this case,we reverse both the grant of summary judgment to royal and the denial of partial summary judgment to the rogerses.
factual and procedural background 
on august,san joaquin county child protective services received a report of child neglect in the rogers home.the caller stated that shelby rogers shelby and thomas rogers,tommy were not,were locked in their rooms at night and in a room at their parents business during the day,were not receiving medical or dental care,that tommy had lost his teeth due to bottle rot,that shelby was still being fed with a bottle,that their home was dirty and,and that there were unsecured guns in the home.the intake unit did not view this report as requiring an emergency response,but rather classified it as warranting a response within ten days three days later,before any action had been taken to investigate the report,child protective services received a second,similar report regarding the rogers children and likewise classified it as requiring a response.
on august,royal,a social worker with child protective services,visited the rogers home,but,finding no one there,departed without leaving a message or a note.she returned a week later,on september at observing that the family was home,royal called for the assistance of lodi police and waited for the officers to arrive before making contact with the family.officer dennis lewis and at least one other police officer responded.
the family was just getting up when royal and the officers entered their home royal claimed that following her entry she heard shelby knocking and asking for her mother from inside a bedroom.the mother,nicole rogers nicole,claims,however,that shelby was neither knocking nor calling for her.
officer lewis asked to see the whole family.nicole went to shelby bedroom and unfastened a lock to open the door.shelby emerged from the room dressed in a diaper that,according to royal,appeared to be soiled.nicole then retrieved tommy from his bedroom.tommy emerged wearing pajamas and a diaper.royal saw a thumb lock similar to those used in bathroom doors on the outside of tommy bedroom door.royal believed that both children had been locked in their bedrooms,but nicole testified that tommy bedroom door was not locked.the father,thomas rogers thomas,also got out of bed to talk with royal and officer lewis.
royal asked why the children had locks on their bedroom doors.nicole testified that she told royal that they had never locked tommy door,that his room had a lock on the door when they moved into the house,and that they had simply never removed it.according to her testimony,she also stated that they locked shelby in her room at night because otherwise she would roam the house and get into things while the rest of the family was sleeping.however,royal testified that nicole first stated that she locked the children in their rooms only when she showered,and that only after royal pointed out that nicole had not been showering when they arrived did she say that she locked shelby in at night.royal testified that she believed nicole had tried to lie to her and that this concerned her.she said that she was also concerned about the children being locked in their bedrooms because it could result in injury due to lack of supervision or as a result of a fire,and could restrict their access to the bathroom.royal told the rogerses that they would have to remove the locks.nicole testified that she agreed to do so,but royal contended that the rogerses did not respond to her statement.
royal asked why the children were still in diapers.the rogerses testified that they replied that they were working with tommy,and that while they put a diaper on him at night,he was doing good during the day.they said that shelby was not yet.royal testified,however,that nicole told her that she had had time to the children.
royal and officer lewis inspected tommy mouth.tommy suffered from severe bottle rot.several of his teeth were missing and his remaining teeth were yellow and showed signs of decay.his mother acknowledged during her deposition that tommy mouth had looked horrible.nicole told royal that tommy had never complained of pain.she said that a dentist had told her that tommy needed surgery,and she had scheduled an appointment but cancelled it out of fear that tommy would be harmed,after she and her husband saw a television program about a child dying while under general anesthesia.royal testified that she believed that this meant the rogerses were unwilling to take tommy to the dentist.
royal asked if the family had medical insurance.according to nicole,she answered that they did not have medical insurance at the moment but that she was waiting for an application,at which point royal asked for proof that she had ever had insurance and nicole showed her old membership cards for kaiser.nicole testified that royal then asked her if the cards were active and she replied that they were not.royal,however,stated that nicole first told her that they had medical insurance and then attempted to deceive her by showing her inactive cards when she asked for proof.this,according to royal,caused her further to doubt nicole honesty.
royal observed that the children had multiple circular bruises on their legs.nicole stated that the children were always falling down.royal also observed that shelby had a large scratch on the side of her face.nicole and thomas told royal that shelby sustained the scratch when she fell off a chair at their workplace.they explained that they worked in an auto shop in san leandro and that they took the children with them to work every day.royal testified that she did not think that the children were being physically abused.she was concerned,however,that,because the children were taken to their parents place of business every day,they were isolated and would not be seen by teachers or others who would be required to report suspected abuse.
royal also observed that shelby had unkempt hair that appeared to be thin and missing in some areas and that both children were very pale.she believed that the thinning hair could indicate malnutrition and the pale skin could be due to a vitamin deficiency or lack of sunlight.she observed,however,that the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets were well stocked with food and that the bathroom had the necessary toiletries.she told the rogerses that the children looked very pale and sickly,and that they could be suffering from a vitamin deficiency or from lack of sunlight.nicole responded that their pale complexion and shelby thin hair were due to the fact that their father has pale skin and fine hair.
the parties dispute the condition of the rogers home.royal and officer lewis stated that they observed piles of dirty dishes and an overflowing garbage receptacle in the kitchen,as well as piles of dirty clothing scattered about the kitchen,living room and bedrooms.thomas testified,however,that the garbage receptacles were only partly full.he also testified that the reason for the piles of clothing was that the washer and dryer were broken.
royal stated that she observed that the children had dirty bedding and mattresses without frames.in shelby room,she saw clothing that she believed was dirty scattered on the floor.the rogerses do not dispute that the children did not have bedframes,but testified that the clothing and bedding were clean.thomas also testified that shelby clothes were on the floor because she had a habit of pulling them out of her dresser to play.in tommy room,royal observed a brown substance that she believed to be feces smeared on the wall and a substance that she thought was rat droppings on the floor.officer lewis observed what he thought was vomit in the bottom drawer of a night stand.tommy told royal that the substance on the wall was a smashed graham cracker.the rogerses testified that the alleged rat droppings on the floor actually consisted of small grains of filling that came out of a broken hacky sack ball,and the purported vomit,like the smears on the wall,was the remains of broken graham crackers.
there were five guns in the rogerses bedroom,four of which were unloaded and stored in the closet,and one of which was loaded and kept in the dresser next to the rogerses bed.thomas testified that ammunition for the guns remained in the closet in a childproof container.nicole testified that the gun in the dresser had a trigger lock with a key,and the key was located in a jewelry box mounted on the wall.
royal stated that after her conversation with the rogerses and her observations of the condition of the home,she believed that the rogers children had been neglected for some time and that there was an imminent risk to their physical health and safety.based on this opinion,royal chose to remove them from their home immediately and place them in the custody of child protective services royal did not offer the rogerses alternative accommodations,medical referrals for the children,or services from the agency whereby the children could remain at home.royal also did not obtain a warrant.
royal called for a car seat and,when it arrived,transported the children to lodi memorial hospital.she testified that tommy complained of mouth pain while at the hospital.she also testified that an attending nurse stated that the children appeared to be malnourished and suffering from a vitamin deficiency.the doctor who saw the children stated in his evaluation that both were alert and playful,but had poor hygiene.the doctor wrote that tommy had many teeth missing and that shelby hair was sparse,brittle.the doctor also wrote that the purpose of the visit was medical clearance prior to child protective services placement and classified the visit as routine rather than emergency.
after the medical clearance the children were placed in a shelter.tommy did not receive any dental care that day or at any time while in the county custody.the children were returned to their parents on september,after the rogerses made changes to their home and lifestyle as required by child protective services,obtained medical insurance,and arranged for tommy to have oral surgery.as a result of their time in custody,according to their mother,the children became concerned about being separated from their parents.nicole further testified that tommy,in particular,lost trust in people in general because of the experience.
the rogerses appealed the grant of summary judgment to royal as well as the denial of their own motion for partial summary judgment as to royal.
jurisdiction 
the grant of summary judgment is a final order and thereby gives us jurisdiction over both the grant of summary judgment to royal and the denial of partial summary judgment to the rogerses.see beazer materials,cir.we have declined to exercise our jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment when reviewing orders granting summary judgment where the record has not been fully developed.id.at.such is not the case here.moreover,both sides agree that the denial of the rogerses motion is properly before us on appeal.
qualified immunity 
constitutional violation 
in assessing a claim of qualified immunity,we must first decide whether the official conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.parents and children have a constitutional right to live together without governmental interference.wallis spencer,cir.the fourteenth amendment guarantees that parents will not be separated from their children without due process of law except in emergencies.mabe san bernardino county,dep t of pub.soc,cir.officials violate this right if they remove a child from the home absent information at the time of the seizure that establishes reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury.id.at quoting wallis,at.the fourth amendment also protects children from removal from their homes absent such a showing.doe lebbos,cir.officials,including social workers,who remove a child from its home without a warrant must have reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to experience serious bodily harm in the time that would be required to obtain a warrant.mabe,at.
serious allegations of abuse that have been investigated and corroborated usually give rise to a reasonable inference of imminent danger sufficient to justify taking children into temporary custody if they might again be beaten or molested during the time it would take to get a warrant.ram rubin,cir.however,an official prior willingness to leave the children in their home militates against a finding of exigency,as does information that the abuse occurs only on certain dates or at certain times of day.mabe,at wallis,at.
under this standard,the district court correctly concluded that tommy bottle rot,the children malnourishment,and the disorderly conditions in the home did not present an imminent risk of serious bodily harm.this is so whether the disputed factual questions are resolved in favor of appellants or defendants.
at oral argument,royal conceded that she could have obtained a warrant within hours.there is no indication in the record that so short a delay could have resulted in a significant worsening of the children physical conditions or an increase in the prospects of harm.royal testified that she thought,after seeing tommy mouth,that he could have an abscess and that he almost certainly had an infection.however,she does not assert that she believed that his condition would worsen if she delayed taking him into custody in order to obtain a warrant.tommy teeth may have hurt,but,if so,he had likely been experiencing such pain for a considerable period of time and the pain was not so serious that he ceased to be playful and alert.under such circumstances,any pain tommy may have experienced can not justify a failure to obtain a warrant or the peremptory removal of the children from their parents custody.similarly,royal testimony,even viewed in the light most favorable to her,does not suggest that the malnourishment in this case was sufficiently serious to justify the children immediate removal as both were alert and active,and there was no indication of imminent danger.it is worth noting in this respect that when the children eventually reached the hospital,the doctor did not suggest any immediate treatment for tommy bottle rot or shelby malnutrition 
nor do the other circumstances cited by royal support a finding of exigency,even if her version of all the disputed facts is accepted as true,and even if all of the conditions observed by her are considered collectively.there was no imminent danger of serious bodily harm as a result of shelby being locked in her room,as this occurred only at night.mabe,at concluding that the sexual abuse alleged in that case occurred only at night,so there was time to get a warrant before the child would be in imminent danger.the allegations that the children were also locked up during the day at their parents workplace,even if true,do not support a finding of imminent risk of serious bodily harm.the chances of accidental injury or of a fire breaking out at the rogerses workplace during the few hours that it would take royal to obtain a warrant were very low.so remote a risk does not establish reasonable cause to believe that the children were in immediate danger.
similarly,the conditions of the home,even if as unsanitary as royal asserts,fail to indicate any imminent risk of serious bodily harm.like the bottle rot,the mess in the rogers living quarters,to the extent that it may have existed,was a chronic,ongoing problem.the presence of disorderliness and a small amount of droppings,feces,and other matter may i
