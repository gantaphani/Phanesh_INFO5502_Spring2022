principles of due process require that the juvenile court not terminate a presumed father parental rights without first finding,by clear and convincing evidence,that the father is unfit.because no such finding was made in this case,and based on our conclusion the court improperly terminated parental rights based on a father poverty,we will reverse the order terminating parental rights and remand for reconsideration whether a proper basis for such termination exists,and if not,for renewed efforts aimed at returning the children to their father custody.we also conclude reversal of the order terminating parental rights is required,and remand the matter,so the juvenile court may properly determine whether the indian child welfare act icwa,section et,governs this proceeding.
factual and procedural background 
general background facts 
in may,then appellant,and his brother,appellant michael or,collectively,the boys,were detained by respondent department of children and family services dcfs from their mother custody after she was arrested for having sex with a minor.the boys were placed with their relatives,paternal grandmother marie,and a paternal uncle jesus 
the whereabouts of the boys father,appellant gerardo gerardo,were not known at the time.gerardo first appeared in this action in july.he told the juvenile court he had always been a part of the boys lives,and wanted to be a good father.the court thanked him for his interest,told him to contact mother and dcfs so he could remain in the boys lives,and informed him the children would continue to reside with marie until mother could obtain adequate housing.the first welfare and institutions code section petition was dismissed in july,after the boys mother agreed to informal dcfs supervision under a family reunification plan.all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code.
gerardo appeared at the detention hearing in january,and was appointed counsel.the court was told gerardo was very involved with the boys,and he saw them nearly every day.gerardo wanted the boys to live with him,but he did not yet have suitable housing.he agreed they should remain in his mother home for the time being,and was given unmonitored visitation.in february,gerardo was found to be the boys presumed father.
the hearing was conducted in.dcfs reported gerardo became involved with the boys mother in he was,she was.gerardo admitted a history of alcohol abuse and occasional drug use.but,he said he had not used drugs since,had completed a drug program,and had ceased drinking entirely in.gerardo had committed two acts of domestic violence,for which he completed a domestic violence program.gerardo was unable to assume custody of the boys because he rented a room in a house that could not accommodate children.he wanted to gain custody and planned to continue working toward that goal and to obtain suitable housing.dcfs provided a january letter from an employer stating gerardo was a very reliable employee and a committed father.he had been offered work.however,he was not able to take anything other than a job because of problems with childcare and mother.
a mediated agreement was reached.all but two of the allegations of the petition were dismissed against the mother,to which she pled no contest.no allegations were sustained against gerardo,who was proclaimed to be.both parents were offered reunification services.gerardo was given unmonitored day and overnight visits at marie home and ordered to participate in a sobriety program,such as alcoholics anonymous aa.dcfs was ordered to conduct an evaluation in the event gerardo obtained housing for himself and the boys.
in june,dcfs reported gerardo had a job but was still unable to assume custody due to a lack of housing.gerardo had attended aa meetings,participated in a special education iep meeting for one child,and visited his sons regularly.the court told gerardo to notify dcfs if he found housing,so the boys might have unmonitored overnight visits in his own home and encouraged him to keep up the good work.
in its report for a review hearing in,a dcfs social worker said gerardo had returned her phone calls and left her voicemail messages,but she had not been able to meet with him or confirm his attendance at aa meetings.the report noted gerardo was and eligible to have the children placed in his care.however,based on gerardo lack of,the social worker surmised he might not be interested in caring for the children.about a week after her report was written,the social worker met gerardo at his apartment,which was an inappropriate living space for him and the boys.gerardo was visiting the boys regularly.he had attended aa meetings for weeks but stopped going a few months before.at the hearing,the court found gerardo had partially complied with its orders,but that it would be detrimental to return the boys to their parents care.it continued reunification services another six months.
meanwhile,dcfs reported the boys continued to do well in marie care,and liked living with her.she and jesus were meeting their needs and facilitating visits,and wanted to adopt the boys.dcfs intended to initiate a home study once reunification services terminated.dcfs confirmed that gerardo had attended some aa meetings between may and june,stopped attending in early december and resumed again in january.however,he had also been laid off from work.by february he had another job,but was still unable to afford appropriate housing.in her report for a march review hearing,the social worker reiterated her view that gerardo lack of to dcfs requests and his failure to comply fully with the court orders to secure housing and attend aa meetings,was evidence gerardo was not interested in caring for children.the social worker report failed to mention that gerardo had told her for months that he was determined to find appropriate housing and to complete the plan,and was not giving up this fight.gerardo told the social worker he loved his boys and had resolved to stay strong and persevere because he knew he was able to care for and raise his sons.he also noted that,in early february he had been honored and happy to attend a ceremony at school at which one of his sons received an award for being student of the month.
at the hearing on march,gerardo requested custody,and told the court he planned to move in with marie and care for his children.his attorney told the court the only problem gerardo had was an inability to find suitable housing,so his custody plan was to have the boys returned to his care while he lived with his mother for a time.in the alternative,gerardo requested additional reunification services.the boys attorney objected because of a concern that,if gerardo moved in,it might jeopardize the funding marie had been able to secure for the children and gerardo could not make up for the loss because he was unemployed at the time.in addition,gerardo had not been attending aa meetings.the court denied gerardo request and found that returning the boys to their parents custody would pose a substantial risk of detriment to their.reunification services were terminated for both parents,and the matter was set for a permanency planning hearing.
the permanency planning hearing was scheduled for late june.at that time,dcfs reported on the boys progress in school,and noted that both were participating in individual counseling.marie and jesus were assessed to be proper adoptive parents,and participating in therapy and parenting classes to address some issues surrounding discipline.both boys wanted to stay with marie michael wanted to live with his mother or father if he could not stay with his grandmother.dcfs said the boys were likely to be adopted,and should remain in marie care.but dcfs recommended delaying termination of parental rights,because marie home study was incomplete.gerardo opposed adoption.he informed the court he had lived with the children and seen them daily until april,when friction developed with jesus and interfered with gerardo visitation.gerardo was worried about the children because jesus purportedly got drunk every weekend,and drove the boys in the car while intoxicated.since april,gerardo had spent each saturday with his sons.dcfs was ordered to investigate gerardo allegations and to include information from the boys and their therapists regarding the children relationship with gerardo.the hearing was continued to early august.
marie and jesus homestudy was complete by august,but dcfs had deferred a final decision while the family addressed concerns regarding jesus unrealistic expectations for and inappropriate discipline of the children,and dcfs desire to improve the relationship between gerardo and his brother.gerardo had been visiting the boys regularly but dcfs was unable to contact him because he was homeless.the report for the hearing was accompanied by a letter from michael therapist.the therapist said michael continued to defy marie and had nightmares once or twice weekly.his behavior hinged on his ability to see his parents every week.he was trying to adjust to life with marie,but had trouble accepting the notion his parents would never have custody of him again the idea made him feel abandoned and sad.the section hearing was continued again.
by early december,marie homestudy had been approved she and jesus remained committed to adopting the boys.gerardo objected to termination of parental rights and adoption,and argued his due process rights had been violated based on our decision in in re gladys th,d gladys.he noted he was a nonoffending father who had never been found unfit.he was involved in his boys lives and had recently secured a new job,so the only obstacle to obtaining custody of his children was a lack of housing.the court requested briefs on issues raised by gladys,and continued the hearing.
in its brief on the gladys issues,dcfs argued gerardo had problems finding housing and had failed to attend aa meetings on a regular basis.in addition,he had been present at each hearing at which the court found it would be detrimental to return the children to his care but had not appealed any of those orders,created a stable lifestyle or obtained appropriate housing for his sons.dcfs argued the court periodic findings of detriment were sufficient to satisfy the due process prerequisite recognized in gladys,that a parent rights may not be terminated without a prior finding of unfitness.attorneys for gerardo and the boys disagreed,arguing dcfs had to file a supplemental petition alleging gerardo unfitness to parent and to afford him a hearing on the issue.they also argued that a lack of affordable family housing presented the only impediment to gerardo ability to obtain custody of his sons,and dcfs had never made any effort to assist him on that front.accordingly,due process required the juvenile court conduct a hearing to explore the possibility of having dcfs assist gerardo to resolve this barrier to reunification,or to make a finding by clear and convincing evidence he was unfit to parent.
the juvenile court found it was not necessary that a section petition be filed and that its prior findings of detriment were equivalent to a finding gerardo was not fit to assume custody of his children.it noted gerardo had agreed but failed to fully comply with the case plan that required him to attend aa meetings and locate appropriate housing.the court found the boys were likely to be adopted,and terminated parental rights.
facts related to the icwa 
while the first petition was pending in,the boys mother told the court that,although she was not registered,she had indian heritage from several tribes,including the apache,navaho,cherokee and,possibly,chumash or some other tribe beginning with ch.dcfs sent identical icwa notices to tribes,the bureau of indian affairs bia and the secretary of the interior secretary.the notices sent to the bia and secretary mentioned only the apache,navaho and cherokee tribes,and failed to list the mother birth name.the notices also provided contradictory information they said the boys had possible tribal affiliations but that their mother,through whom that affiliation was asserted,had none they also said that although the maternal grandparents lacked any tribal affiliation,it was not known whether maternal great grandparents had such an affiliation.dcfs never provided the juvenile court with signed certified return receipts.nevertheless,on june,the juvenile court mistakenly stated it had received all of the certified return receipts.the juvenile court made no icwa determinations before the first petition was dismissed in july.after the operative petition was filed in january,the juvenile court indicated its belief that it had already found proper notice had been given,and there was no reason to believe the icwa applied.accordingly,no more attempts were made to notify any tribe,the bia or the secretary.
discussion 
due process requires a finding of unfitness before parental rights may be severed.
gerardo and the children contend the juvenile court erred in terminating gerardo parental rights as a presumed father without an allegation or a finding,made by clear and convincing evidence,that he was an unfit parent.we agree.
parents have a fundamental interest in the care,companionship and custody of their children.for this reason,they have certain due process protections in juvenile dependency proceedings.santosky kramer,d santosky.before the state may sever a parent rights in his natural child,due process mandates the state allegations be supported by evidence that is,at a minimum,clear and convincing.id.at.once the state has shown a parent unfit,the juvenile court may then assume the child interests have diverged from those of his or her natural parent.id.at.however,until the state proves parental unfitness,the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship.ibid.
california dependency system comports with santosky requirements because,by the time parental rights are terminated at a section hearing,the juvenile court must have made prior findings that the parent was unfit.gladys,supra,th at,d,citing in re cynthia superior court cal th,d,cynthia.except for a temporary period,the grounds for initial removal of the child from parental custody have been established under a clear and convincing standard see,subd.b in addition,there have been a series of hearings involving ongoing reunification efforts and,at each hearing,there was a statutory presumption that the child should be returned to the custody of the parent,subds.e,f,subd.a.only if,over this entire period of time,the state continually has established that a return of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child is the section stage even reached.cynthia,supra,cal th at,d.the number and quality of the judicial findings that are necessary preconditions to termination convey very powerfully to the fact finder the subjective certainty about parental unfitness and detriment required before the court may even consider ending the relationship between natural parent and child.citation.the linchpin to the constitutionality of the section hearing is that prior determinations ensure the evidence of detriment is already so clear and convincing that more can not be required without prejudice to the interests of the adoptable child,with which the state must align itself.citation.gladys,supra,th at,d.
here,no judicial finding of a lack of parental fitness was made as to gerardo.gerardo was a nonoffending,noncustodial father,as was the presumed father in gladys l,supra,th at page,d.the boys were removed from their mother care after her conduct alone was found to place them at risk of harm.although gerardo admitted a history of domestic violence and substance abuse,those issues were addressed and resolved before the first petition was filed in.the record contains no evidence and dcfs never alleged gerardo had a problem with domestic violence or substance abuse during these proceedings,and gerardo was never told to test for drugs or alcohol.nevertheless,the juvenile court ordered gerardo to attend aa meetings,which he did for some time,all the while maintaining unmonitored visitation with his sons,without concerns on the part of dcfs
