jack harris appeals from an order in a probate proceeding denying his spousal property petition.harris and the decedent,derrel depasse,had lived together.depasse became terminally ill and was hospitalized.the day before she died,the hospital chaplain performed a marriage ceremony for harris and depasse.although aware that a marriage license was required,the parties did not obtain a license because of depasse illness and imminent death.
two days before the marriage ceremony,depasse had executed a will naming her brother executor of her estate.harris filed a spousal property petition in the probate action claiming a interest in depasse estate as her surviving spouse.the executor challenged harris petition on the ground that the marriage was not valid because the parties had not obtained a marriage license.the trial court found that a license was a prerequisite for a valid marriage in california and that harris was not entitled to inherit as a putative spouse and denied his spousal property petition.
on appeal,harris asserts that the failure to obtain a marriage license before the ceremony is a curable defect that does not invalidate the marriage.based upon the statutes governing marriage,we conclude that the issuance of a license is a mandatory requirement for a valid marriage in california.we also hold that harris petition to establish the fact of marriage pursuant to health and safety code section did not cure his failure to obtain a license.finally,we conclude that the trial court was correct in finding that harris was not a putative spouse because he did not have an objectively reasonable,good faith belief that he was lawfully married.we will therefore affirm the trial court order denying harris spousal property petition.
factual background 
derrel depasse was hospitalized at stanford university medical center with a terminal illness.the date she was hospitalized and the nature of her illness are not disclosed in the record.prior to her hospitalization,depasse had resided with jack harris in his home in saratoga,california.the record does not indicate how long the couple lived together.
at the time she was hospitalized,depasse owned a sizable estate consisting of over million dollars in liquid assets,pieces of artwork worth to,plus furniture,books,jewelry,household goods and other items of personal property.except for some of the artwork,which was on loan for public display in the community,depasse artwork,books,furnishings,jewelry,and other items of personal property were located in harris home.
on july,while in the hospital,depasse executed a holographic will appointing her brother,john depasse,executor of her estate and instructing him to donate all of her artwork to one of three museums,either the american museum of folk art in new york city,the national museum of american art in washington,or the philadelphia art institute.depasse also instructed her brother to s et up endowment funds for two museums for twentieth century american folk art.the amounts of money to be contributed to the endowment funds were not specified in the will.the will also provided that the donations be completed within days of depasse death and that none of her artwork be removed from her collection.the will did not mention harris.
on july,two days after depasse executed the holographic will,she and harris asked the hospital chaplain to perform a marriage ceremony for them.according to the chaplain,both depasse and harris told her that they wanted to be married before depasse died and that there was no time for them to obtain a marriage license.the chaplain performed the marriage ceremony at stanford university medical center.according to harris,the couple had planned to be married in a large ceremony in late or in.
depasse died the day after the marriage ceremony.she was years old.she is survived by her brother,john depasse her mother,josephine depasse and jack harris.
ii.procedural history 
on july,john depasse filed a petition for probate and letters testamentary.the petition asserted that derrel depasse had no spouse or children.
on january,almost six months after the marriage ceremony,harris filed an ex parte petition for an order establishing the fact,time and place of marriage pursuant to health and safety code section hereafter section.the petition was filed as a separate action,in another department of the court.copies of the petition were not served on any of the parties to the probate action.in his petition,harris asserted that d ue to derrel death shortly thereafter,the parties did not obtain a license or otherwise record the marriage.the chaplin sic neglected to provide a certificate of marriage under.harris also advised the court that t here is no prejudice to anyone because this ex parte procedure has no evidentiary effect.schmidt retirement board th at d no evidentiary weight whatsoever.on january,the court signed a form order that had been prepared by harris establishing the fact of the marriage.
that same day,the executor filed a petition in the probate action to establish the estate claim of ownership to depasse property and for an order directing transfer of the property to the estate.on january,harris filed a petition to determine ownership of the estate property and his spousal intestate rights and for an order directing the transfer of the property to harris.in that petition,he asserted that depasse had given him several items of personal property as gifts prior to their marriage,including four paintings,sketches,a piece of china,some jewelry and one half of her books.harris also filed a spousal property petition in which he claimed one half of all of the assets of the probate estate as depasse surviving spouse.
on march,harris filed an amended petition to determine ownership of the estate property and his spousal intestate rights and for an order directing transfer of the property hereafter the amended petition.in the amended petition,harris claimed that,in addition to the items listed in his first petition,depasse had given him all of the furniture and furnishings located at his residence as gifts prior to their marriage.the amended petition contained a detailed,listing of the furniture and personal property harris claimed as gifts.harris also continued to claim a interest in all of the other assets of the probate estate as depasse surviving spouse.
on march,the executor objected to harris spousal property petition and harris amended petition on the grounds that harris was not legally married to depasse because the parties had never obtained a marriage license.the executor also asserted that the chaplain had committed a misdemeanor by solemnizing the marriage without a license in violation of penal code section and that depasse did not have the capacity to marry under probate code section 
a hearing was held on harris spousal property petition on march.the issue of the legality of the marriage was argued and submitted.both sides were also allowed to submit supplemental briefs on the issue.harris supplemental brief argued that the court order establishing the fact of marriage cured the parties failure to obtain a license.he also asserted that the marriage statutes permit a marriage to be registered after the fact.in addition,he contended that he could inherit as a putative spouse.the executor supplemental brief reviewed the statutory scheme governing marriage and argued that the issuance of a license was essential to a valid marriage.the executor also argued that creating a statistical record of an invalid marriage pursuant to section does not validate the marriage.finally,the executor asserted that the putative spouse claim was not properly alleged and was not before the court.
on april,the trial court issued an order denying harris spousal property petition.the court found that california requires a marriage license as a prerequisite to marriage.the court also found that nothing in the statutory scheme permits the use of the procedure in section to validate a marriage if the parties never obtained a marriage license.the court also reached the merits of harris putative spouse claim and found that harris assertion of putative spouse status did not rest on facts that would cause a reasonable person to harbor a good faith belief that the marriage was lawful because he lacked a marriage license.the court found that harris subjective belief,even if honestly held,did not constitute good faith.the court concluded that the estate had overcome the rebuttable presumption in favor of finding a valid marriage.harris claim that certain items of property belonged to him as gifts was reserved for hearing at a later date.harris appeals from the order denying his spousal property petition.
iii.standard of review 
harris admits that he and depasse did not have a marriage license when the chaplain conducted the marriage ceremony.in addition,neither the parties nor the chaplain made any effort to obtain a license after the ceremony.harris does not claim that a license was not required.he asserts instead that his failure to obtain a license was a curable defect that did not invalidate the marriage.harris only attempt to cure the lack of a license was the filing of the ex parte petition to establish the fact of marriage pursuant to section.
harris arguments require us to determine,as a matter of law,whether a marriage license is required for a valid marriage and whether harris section petition cured the parties failure to obtain a license in this case.matters presenting pure questions of law,not involving the resolution of disputed facts,are subject to the appellate court independent review.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.our analysis requires us to review and interpret the statutes governing marriage.appellate courts independently determine the proper interpretation of a statute.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
iv.discussion 
the state has a vital interest in the institution of marriage and plenary power to fix the conditions under which the marital status may be created or terminated.in re marriage of walton d.the regulation of marriage is solely within the province of the legislature.beeler beeler d.in view of the legislature role in regulating marriage,we begin by reviewing the statutes governing marriage in california.
review of statutes governing marriage in california 
family code section provides marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman,to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary.consent alone does not constitute marriage.consent must be followed by the issuance of a license and solemnization as authorized by this division except as provided by section and part commencing with section.italics added.
section provides except as provided in section,a marriage shall be licensed,solemnized,and authenticated,and the certificate of registry of marriage shall be returned as provided in this part noncompliance with this part by a nonparty to the marriage does not invalidate the marriage.italics added.
section provides before entering a marriage,or declaring a marriage pursuant to section,the parties shall first obtain a marriage license from a county clerk.italics added.the marriage license shall show the parties identities,real and full names,places of residence,and ages.the applicants may be required to present identification and the clerk may examine them under oath or request additional documentary proof as to the facts stated.a marriage license shall not be granted if either of the applicants lacks the capacity to enter into a valid marriage or is under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time he or she applies for the license.a marriage license expires days after it is issued.
section provides before solemnizing a marriage,the person solemnizing the marriage shall require the presentation of the marriage license.if the person solemnizing the marriage has reason to doubt the correctness of the statement of facts in the marriage license,the person must be satisfied as to the correctness of the statement of facts before solemnizing the marriage.for this purpose,the person may administer oaths and examine the parties and witnesses in the same manner as the county clerk does before issuing the license.italics added.penal code section provides that every person who solemnizes a marriage without first being presented with the marriage license,as required by section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
section contains the procedures for completion of the certificate of registry of marriage.at the time of the marriage ceremony here,section provided in relevant part a applicants for a marriage license shall obtain from the county clerk issuing the license,a certificate of registry of marriage c the certificate of registry shall be filled out by the applicants,in the presence of the county clerk issuing the marriage license,and shall be presented to the person solemnizing the marriage.d the person solemnizing the marriage shall complete the certificate of registry and shall cause to be entered on the certificate of registry the signature and address of one witness to the marriage ceremony.e the certificate of registry shall be returned by the person solemnizing the marriage to the county recorder of the county in which the license was issued within days after the ceremony.f as used in this division,returned means presented to the appropriate person in person,or postmarked,before the expiration of the specified time period.section lists the information that is to be added to the certificate of registry by the person solemnizing the marriage.section reiterates the requirement that the person solemnizing the marriage return the marriage license,along with the certificate of registry,to the county recorder.
the information to be contained on the certificate of registry of marriage is prescribed by section and by section of the health and safety code,subd.b.the forms for the application for license to marry,certificate of registry of marriage including the license to marry,and the marriage certificate shall be prescribed by the state registrar.health.currently and at the time of marriage ceremony in this case,a single form entitled license and certificate of marriage,state of california,department of health services,office of state registrar form number,serves as the combined application for the marriage license,the license to marry and certificate of registry of marriage.kirkland,et,cal.family law practice and procedure ed.validity of marriage,to,kirkland.on form,the county clerk authorizes the person conducting the marriage ceremony to solemnize the marriage.
according to the statutory scheme,there are five steps in the marriage process.first,the parties must consent.second,the parties must obtain a license from the county clerk.since the license and certificate of registry are combined into one form,the parties also obtain the certificate of registry at that time.third,the marriage must be solemnized.before solemnizing the marriage,the person conducting the ceremony must ensure that the parties have obtained a marriage license.fourth,the person solemnizing the marriage must authenticate the marriage by signing the certificate of registry and arranging for at least one witness to sign the certificate.finally,the person solemnizing the marriage must return the certificate of registry to the county clerk for filing.
in this case,although the executor raised the issue of depasse capacity to consent in his objections to harris spousal property petition,that issue was not adjudicated in the hearing on the petition and is not before us on this appeal.as to the other four requirements for a valid marriage,harris admits that he never obtained a marriage license.the chaplain performed a marriage ceremony knowing the parties did not have a license in violation of section,subjecting herself to prosecution for a misdemeanor pursuant to penal code section.since the parties did not obtain a license,they also failed to obtain the certificate of registry of marriage required by section.the chaplain did not fill out or sign a certificate of registry and there is no evidence that anyone other than the chaplain and the parties witnessed the ceremony.finally,the chaplain failed to return a certificate of registry to the county clerk.
mandatory nature of licensing requirement in california 
in some jurisdictions,a marriage will be deemed valid even though no license was obtained where the statutes providing for the procurement of a license are viewed as directory rather than mandatory.d marriage,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.husband wife.other jurisdictions view the licensing requirement as mandatory and hold that the absence of a license is a fatal flaw to the validity of a marriage.d,supra,citing among others nelson marshall nelson.the california courts have never authoritatively determined whether a license is an absolute requirement for a valid marriage.witkin,supra,citing in re estate of shipp cal,and norman norman cal.however,the legislature addressed the issue in by amending former civil code section now,to provide that the parties consent to marriage must be followed by the issuance of a license.compare stats,ch,and stats,ch,see historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll.other statutory provisions governing marriage reinforce the mandatory nature of the licensing requirement in california.section provides that a marriage shall be licensed.section provides that b efore entering a marriage,the parties shall first obtain a marriage license and section provides that the person solemnizing the marriage shall require the presentation of the marriage license.
we are cognizant of the fact that our courts have held that the use of the word must in a statute does not necessarily and ipso facto make statutory provisions mandatory.argonaut ins.industrial acc.com.d.argonaut.likewise the word shall has been held in some cases to be merely directory.estate of mitchell cal d.whether the words must or shall should be construed as mandatory or directory depends on the intention of the legislature in enacting the particular code section.argonaut,supra,d at.in the legislature reorganized the major family law statutes into a new code,entitled the family code.stats,ch.the new code specifically addressed the question of whether the term shall is directory or mandatory.section provides that the use of the term shall in the family code indicates that the required action is mandatory.sections,and all employ the word shall.thus according to the plain language of the statutes,a license is a mandatory requirement for a valid marriage in california.
in finding that a license is required for a valid marriage,the trial court relied on nelson,supra,a case which is factually very similar to this case.the man and woman in nelson had lived together for years.the man took ill and was hospitalized.the woman asked the hospital chaplain to determine how they could marry.the chaplain called the county recorder and was told that a judge would have to waive the usual waiting period after issuance of a marriage license.the chaplain concluded that the waiver would be difficult to obtain,because it was a holiday.the chaplain performed the marriage ceremony in the hospital and told the couple they would have to sign the application forms for a marriage license.the parties did not sign the forms.the man died the day after the ceremony.a marriage license was never obtained.the missouri statute contained a mandatory licensing provision.the court concluded that the statute was unambiguous and that the plain language of the statute required a license for a valid marriage contract.the court observed that one of the purposes of the licensing requirement in missouri was to eliminate common law marriages.the california statutes,like those in missouri,contain mandatory language requiring the issuance of a license for a valid marriage.in addition,california,like missouri,has abolished common law marriages.norman norman,supra,cal.at,prior to section of the civil code provided for marriages by declaration without the solemnization required by section,but the act of march,swept away that easy process of marriage.we conclude,as the court did in nelson,that a license is a mandatory requirement for a valid marriage in california.
harris reliance on maxwell maxwell misc d,maxwell is misplaced.the court in maxwell was interpreting former civil code section,a predecessor to section.stats,ch,repealing,stats,ch,enacting,stats,ch,repealing,stats,ch,enacting.former civil code section provided that the parties must obtain a license before marrying.the maxwell court construed the language of former section as directory,citing argonaut,supra,d.maxwell,supra,misc d at,at.the legislature amended renumbered former civil code section several times after maxwell was decided.historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll.section,the current successor to former civil code section,provides that the parties to a marriage shall first obtain a marriage license and section provides that the word shall is mandatory.maxwell did not discuss any other california statutes and applied new york law in the balance of its analysis.thus maxwell has no application here.
harris petition to establish the fact of marriage pursuant to section 
in support of his argument that the parties failure to obtain a license is a curable defect,harris relies on the procedures set forth in sections,and.
harris argues that the procedure set forth in section expressly allows for the purchase of a marriage license after a marriage ceremony has taken place.section provides if no record of the solemnization of a marriage previously contracted is known to exist,the parties may purchase a license and certificate of declaration of marriage from the county clerk in the parties county of residence.the license and certificate shall be returned to the county recorder of the county in which the license was issued.section provides that b efore declaring a marriage pursuant to section,the parties shall first obtain a marriage license from a county clerk.sections and provide a mechanism whereby both parties to a solemnized marriage of which there is no known record,may declare the facts necessary to create a record of the marriage.section requires that both parties join in the declaration and section provides that a license shall be obtained before the parties resort to the declaration procedure.
the parties debate whether the marriage that is declared pursuant to section had to have been licensed before it was solemnized.the purpose of the procedure is to create a record of an otherwise unrecorded marriage,thus focusing on the registration requirement,as opposed to the licensing requirement.we need not decide whether section may also be used to cure a defect in the licensing of the marriage,since that issue is not before us.harris and depasse made no attempt to declare their marriage pursuant to section before depasse died.it is undisputed that they never obtained a license,either prior to their marriage ceremony or as part of an attempt to declare their marriage pursuant to section.after depasse died,the section procedure was unavailable to harris,since both parties must participate in a declaration of marriage.
harris also relies on section in support of the proposition that the failure to obtain a license is a curable defect.section provides if either party to a marriage denies the marriage,or refuses to join in a declaration of the marriage,the other party may proceed,by action,to have the validity of the marriage determined and declared.section does not address the licensing issue at all.it simply provides that when there is a dispute regarding the existence of a marriage one of the parties may file suit to determine the validity of the marriage.
harris also argues that section provides a mechanism for curing the parties failure to obtain a license and record their marriage.section is found in division,chapter of the health and safety code,which is entitled,court proceedings to establish record of birth,death or marriage.chapter provides for an ex parte court proceeding to judicially establish the fact of,and the time and place of a birth,death or marriage that is not registered or for which a certified copy is not obtainable.the proceeding is commenced upon the filing of a verified petition which shall contain all the facts necessary to enable the court to deter
