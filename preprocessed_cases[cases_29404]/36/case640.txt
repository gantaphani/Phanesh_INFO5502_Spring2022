appellant joseph sweeney downloaded the contents of respondent keri evilsizor cell phones around the time evilsizor gave birth to the couple daughter.after these dissolution proceedings were initiated a few months later,sweeney filed with the court copies of some downloaded text messages.evilsizor sought a restraining order under the domestic violence prevention act dvpa to stop sweeney from further disseminating the downloaded information after taking testimony and finding that sweeney actions amounted to abuse under the dvpa,the trial court prohibited sweeney from distributing the information without first receiving the court permission.we conclude that the order did not violate sweeney constitutional rights to free speech,and we therefore affirm.
factual and proceduralbackground 
evilsizor and sweeney were married in november.evilsizor used two phones during her marriage to sweeney one for the legal side of her business and another for the management side of her business that she also allowed her young son from a previous relationship to use for playing games.sweeney claimed that he had regular access to both phones for the purpose of taking pictures,sending,text messages,browsing the internet,or using applications,and that the phones were not password protected.he also claimed that evilsizor gave him the password to her account so that he could send for her and have full access to her.evilsizor disputed these claims.
evilsizor gave birth to the couple daughter in november.around this time,sweeney became concerned that he might not be the child biological father after he read a text message on his stepson phone leading him to believe that evilsizor had received fertility treatments without his knowledge.he then downloaded the contents of evilsizor phones using software that made it easier to read the information sweeney obtained tens of thousands of text messages from the phones as well as information from the notes section of evilsizor iphone,which evilsizor used as a diary.he testified he thought it was unnecessary to get evilsizor permission before downloading the data or to tell her he had done it after the fact because he had regular access to the phones and had previously backed up the phone to the computer at her request.evilsizor denied ever asking sweeney to back up data on her phones and denied knowing he had done so.
sweeney ultimately spent about to hours reviewing the text messages he downloaded.in january or february,he confronted evilsizor with information he had learned from her text messages.in march,he went uninvited to the home of evilsizor parents and disclosed private and sensitive information about evilsizor to her father evilsizor was very upset and shocked when she learned of the disclosure.
that month,the parties separated,and dissolution proceedings were soon initiated.disputes arose over various issues,and the trial court has characterized this as a highly contentious case.one such dispute was over child and spousal support,as well as the sharing of costs for a custody evaluation.on august,evilsizor filed a request to increase sweeney support payments on the ground that her income had decreased because her father had fired her from her job with his the father company.in opposing this request,sweeney alleged that evilsizor had colluded with her parents to falsely make it appear she had been fired.
sweeney attached text messages to his declaration supporting his opposition.one was from october before these proceedings began meant to demonstrate that evilsizor was misstating the assets at her disposal.the text message that appears in the record is illegible,but it apparently refers to three cases of diamond rings evilsizor owned.another text message was dated january,when evilsizor was in litigation with her son father over the custody of her son sweeney stepson.part of the printout of the message that appears in the record is also illegible,and the text that is legible appears benign,at least when read out of context,keri,i on the train.text works.whassup gir sic.but according to sweeney,the message apparently,the portion that is illegible in the record demonstrated that evilsizor could manipulate her property interests and finances 
in response to her text messages being used as exhibits,evilsizor filed a request for a restraining order under the dvpa.she alleged that sweeney had downloaded her private text communications to third parties,including her attorney,without her consent,and had hacked into her facebook account,changed her password,and rerouted the associated with her facebook account to his own account.evilsizor claimed that as a result she suffered extreme embarrassment,fear,and intimidation.she also alleged that sweeney threatened to reveal publicly more text messages and for leverage in the dissolution proceedings.she sought an order prohibiting sweeney from further disseminating her text messages and,requiring sweeney to return all electronically downloaded information he had accessed along with hard copies of the messages,and barring sweeney from accessing or interfering with her provider or accounts.
at some point during discovery,sweeney provided to evilsizor a usb drive containing about to gigabytes of data he had retrieved from her phones.he objected to providing the data in a different format,claiming it would constitute about printed pages.
the trial court initially declined to issue a temporary restraining order but indicated it would address the matter at a hearing on november,later continued to november.at the november hearing,the court set a trial date on the dvpa petition for the following summer,on july.during a discussion of possible interim orders,sweeney counsel stated he objected to any order that would sound like it a dv order.so if there a stipulation outside of a dv order,that fine.counsel contended that sweeney should be allowed to share whatever he wishes with the custody evaluator but that he would agree there was no need nor purpose in distributing any of those messages to anyone else.after further discussion,the trial court issued an interim order prohibiting sweeney from disseminating information protected by the privilege.regarding the rest of the information,the court noted it was optimistic that the parties are truly going to be able to work out whether or not they want to truly have a hearing on a restraining order request of this nature.i hoping that the hearing will not be necessary.
the trial court optimism was misplaced.the day after the november hearing,sweeney attorney wrote to evilsizor attorney stating he was looking forward to a draft of a non dv stipulation order regarding the orders that keri sought since that hearing was continued to july.although the letter suggested that evilsizor attorney had offered to draft such a stipulation,apparently no one ever drafted one.
in december,sweeney provided the custody evaluator with text messages regarding fertility treatments evilsizor underwent during their marriage and messages about previous boyfriends.sweeney provided the messages in order,in his words,to counter the false version of our marriage presented by evilsizor to the evaluator.evilsizor and others then wrote to the evaluator asking her not to consider the messages.although the custody evaluator written response is not in the appellate record,it is clear the evaluator wrote to the trial court requesting guidance on how to proceed.
the case was ultimately assigned to a new trial judge after evilsizor parents,who had been joined as parties to the proceedings,filed a peremptory challenge to the original judge code civ.the new judge issued a minute order rescheduling various matters,but initially kept the july date for the contested hearing on the dvpa petition.then,at a hearing on march,the parties discussed the rescheduled dates,as well as how the court should respond to the custody evaluator about the text messages that sweeney had submitted.the court said the evaluator should not look at any information retrieved from cell phones until the dvpa petition was resolved,and it expressed interest in holding a hearing on the petition before july so the parties would know sooner what material could be used.the court stated it had availability on march,but sweeney,who at this point was representing himself,stated,i would prefer to have counsel,and loewenstein sweeney previous attorney is out of country march to april.the trial court confirmed that loewenstein was no longer representing sweeney on the dvpa petition and stated it preferred a march date instead of waiting until july.sweeney again objected he would need more time because he was representing himself,and he asked whether it would be possible to move it back to april some time.after further discussion,the trial court agreed that march was short notice for sweeney and offered the afternoon of april instead.sweeney responded,okay.
sweeney,evilsizor,and evilsizor father testified at the april hearing.evilsizor testified that it had been incredibly incredibly difficult to deal with the dissemination of her personal information,stating,i have sleepless nights.i sick to my stomach.my friends are mad at me,embarrassed as if i let him.i did know he was even doing any of this.my parents are upset,you know.why did i marry him i did know that things were going i did know.yeah.it been incredibly challenging to live with.she further testified that she had suffered shock and embarrassment and feared for her safety because of the disclosure.evilsizor also was concerned about sweeney threats to reveal information to the internal revenue service about things she did do.
after the close of evidence,the trial court remarked that the narrow issue to decide was whether there was a need to prevent dissemination of the information from evilsizor phones.it stressed,i not making any conclusive decision about whether they the text messages were properly acquired.i not deciding what e ffect it has on privilege or on the presence of sweeney former attorney in the case.the court concluded that even if sweeney legally obtained evilsizor information,an issue left unresolved,it was authorized under the dvpa to enjoin the disclosure or threats of disclosure of the information to protect evilsizor peace of mind.the court ordered sweeney be prohibited from using,delivering,copying,printing or disclosing the messages or content of evilsizor text messages or messages or notes,or anything else downloaded from her phone or from what has been called the family computer except as otherwise authorized by the court.sweeney also was prohibited from trying to access or otherwise interfere with evilsizor provider accounts or accounts.the trial court order expires on april.sweeney timely appealed.
discussiona.the applicable law and the standard of review.
at the time evilsizor sought and obtained the restraining order,the dvpa authorized a trial court to restrain any person for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of domestic violence and ensuring a period of separation of the persons involved if evidence showed reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.former.a court may issue an order enjoining specific acts of abuse,subd.a,which are defined as,among other things,behavior that could be enjoined under section,subd.d.section,in turn,permits a court to enjoin a party from engaging in various types of behavior,including disturbing the peace of the other party,subd.a.t he plain meaning of the phrase disturbing the peace of the other party in section may be properly understood as conduct that destroys the mental or emotional calm of the other party.in re marriage of nadkarni th,nadkarni.the phrase includes destroying the mental or emotional calm of a former spouse by accessing,reading and publicly disclosing her confidential.id.at.
we review an order granting a protective order under the dvpa for abuse of discretion.nadkarni,supra,th at.in considering the evidence supporting such an order,the reviewing court must apply the substantial evidence standard of review,meaning whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supporting the trial court finding.citation.we must accept as true all evidence tending to establish the correctness of the trial court findings,resolving every conflict in favor of the judgment.citation.burquet brumbaugh th.
sweeney actions constituted abuse under the dvpa.
we first reject sweeney argument that the trial court misapplied nadkarni,supra,th in determining that sweeney actions constituted abuse under the dvpa.in nadkarni,a former wife alleged that her had accessed her private account while she was away on a business trip,then attached copies of the to documents filed in proceedings regarding custody of their teenaged children.id.at.she sought a permanent restraining order,but the trial court denied it without a hearing after finding that the dvpa did not cover situations in which there was no physical harm alleged.the appellate court reversed and remanded the matter to the trial court for a hearing.it held that the definition of abuse under the dvpa is not limited to the infliction of physical injury or assault.id.at.
both parties cited nadkarni,supra,th below,and the trial court relied on it in ruling that it was not necessary for evilsizor to prove physical abuse to obtain a restraining order and that the disclosure of various communications can constitute disturbing the peace of the other party within the meaning of the domestic violence statute.the court ultimately concluded that sweeney had disturbed evilsizor peace under nadkarni,because you going around either disclosing or threatening to disclose to third parties for no particular reason intimate details of your lives,and that what i think is happening here.
sweeney attempts to distinguish this case from nadkarni are unpersuasive.we disagree with him that there is a meaningful distinction between nadkarni assumption that the were confidential and the trial court finding here that sweeney had disclosed intimate details of the parties lives.we also are not persuaded by sweeney point that,unlike here,there were allegations of past physical abuse in nadkarni.th at.although a lack of past physical abuse may be considered by a trial court in considering a protective order,the dvpa definition of abuse is not confined to physical abuse but specifies a multitude of behaviors which does not involve any physical injury or assaultive acts.eneaji ubboe th,see also burquet brumbaugh,supra,th at,substantial evidence supporting dvpa restraining order where there was no evidence of physical abuse,but restrained party disturbed peace of by her,sending her text messages,and showing up unannounced at her home conness satram th,no evidence of physical injury needed under dvpa.
sweeney reliance on th is also misplaced.in that case,the appellate court concluded,without analyzing the disturbing the peace definition of abuse,subd.a,that the trial court description of the restrained party behavior did not support a finding of abuse,at.in fact,the trial court statement that it would wait to see if there were more incidents before it relied on the presumption under section,subdivision a that child custody would not be in the best interests of the restrained person child suggested the trial court believed the restrained person would have to engage in some additional behavior before the court would find that he engaged in domestic violence,at,original italics.here,by contrast,the trial court specifically found that sweeney behavior fell within the dvpa.
at oral argument before this court,sweeney suggested that his conduct was not sufficiently egregious to warrant the entry of the dvpa order,especially since the order will have the particularly serious consequence of creating a rebuttable presumption in the ongoing dispute that his child best interest would not be furthered by him being awarded custody.but the presumption is rebuttable by a preponderance of the evidence,and we believe that the trial court can and will properly consider and weigh the evidence in the proceedings to determine whether it should be overcome,taking into account factors that may be favorable to sweeney,subds.a b,understanding that there was no finding sweeney was physically violent,and focusing on the best interest of the child.the trial court previously has acknowledged the applicable rebuttable presumption at a hearing on april,when it stated that section says what it says.there is an automatic presumption.it not a separate finding that i make.that presumption can be rebutted.and we will go through all of that at the appropriate time.italics added see also keith superior court th,orders often must issue quickly and in highly charged situations but should not be misuse d for tactical reasons.
we also reject sweeney argument that insufficient evidence supports the trial court order.to be sure,the parties disputed certain aspects of the events that led to the issuance of the restraining order,and sweeney highlights on appeal his version of events.but the trial court was in the best position to evaluate credibility and to resolve factual disputes,and our review of the record reveals sufficient evidence to conclude that the court order was not an abuse of discretion burquet brumbaugh,supra,th at.
c.the trial court order is not an improper prior restraint of sweeney constitutional rights to free speech.
sweeney next argues that the restraining order is an improper prior restraint of his rights to free speech under the federal and california constitutions.we reject this argument because sweeney ability to continue to engage in activity that has been determined after a hearing to constitute abuse is not the type of speech afforded constitutional protection.
the first amendment to the united states constitution provides congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech this fundamental right to free speech applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment due process clause.aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,plur.opn.of george,aguilar.p rior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights.citation.the term prior restraint is used to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.citation.p ermanent injunctions,court orders that actually forbid speech activities are classic examples of prior restraints.dvd copy control,bunner cal th,original italics.the special vice of a prior restraint is that communication will be suppressed,either directly or by inducing excessive caution in the speaker,before an adequate determination that it is unprotected by the first amendment,quoting pittsburgh press pittsburgh comm on human relations.
although stated in broad terms,the right to free speech is not absolute.aguilar,supra,cal th at.t here are categories of communication and certain special utterances to which the majestic protection of the first amendment does not extend because they are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.balboa island village inn,lemen cal th,lemen,quoting bose consumers union of.such categories include libelous speech lemen,at and words amounting to employment discrimination aguilar,at.
similarly,prohibiting sweeney from disseminating the contents of evilsizor phones does not amount to a prohibited restraint of protected speech because sweeny conduct constituted abuse under the dvpa,subd.d,subd.a,subd.a.sweeney places far too much emphasis on the fact that the trial court specifically declined to address whether sweeney illegally obtained information from evilsizor phones.regardless whether the data was acquired legally,the trial court was authorized to conclude that its dissemination as we have described was abusive under the dvpa and not the type of speech afforded protection under the first amendment.lemen,supra,cal th at.
bartnicki vopper,upon which sweeney relies,does not compel a contrary conclusion.there,an unidentified person unlawfully intercepted and recorded a telephone call between the president of a local teachers union and a union negotiator involved in contract negotiations with the school board,and several media outlets published the contents of the recording even though they knew or had reason to know the conversation had been illegally obtained.id.at.the supreme court held that under the circumstances the valid privacy interests in a private conversation gave way to the first amendment protection of truthful speech about a matter of public concern.id.at.the court specifically declined to address whether the first amendment would protect unlawfully intercepted messages concerning domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern.id.at,italics added.in doing so,the court recognized that the first amendment interests served by the disclosure of purely private information are not as significant as the interests served by the disclosure of information concerning a matter of public importance.dvd copy control,bunner,supra,cal th at affirming preliminary injunction enjoining party from posting on the internet trade secrets regarding licensed dvd encryption technology.here,sweeney has not identified any public concern in evilsizor text messages and other information that he surreptitiously took from her phones.
sweeney comparison of this case to situations where parties obtain information from independent sources also misses the mark.he relies on in re marriage of candiotti th,where the trial court entered an order barring an in a proceeding from disseminating information obtained about her new wife that was acquired both during discovery and also from independent sources.id.at.division three of this court affirmed the portion of the order protecting disclosure of material obtained through discovery.id.at.as for the portion of the order banning dissemination of material acquired through independent sources,however,the court reversed,holding that the order infringed on the freedom to speak freely about another adult.id.at.although it is not entirely clear how the obtained the objectionable information,there was no suggestion that it was obtained improperly.id.at investigated allegations learned through anonymous telephone call and obtained information about new wife driving and personal history.here,by sharp contrast,the trial court determined that sweeney committed acts that are restrainable under the dvpa.whether this was a reference to the way in which the data was gathered or the manner in which sweeney disseminated or threatened to disseminate it,we do not believe this abusive conduct is the sort of independently secured information to which the candiotti court afforded constitutional protection.id.at.
furthermore,the trial court determined that sweeney actions amounted to abuse under the dvpa after a contested hearing.this distinguishes the present case from those in which trial courts enjoined speech before a determination was made that the speech was unprotected.for example,in evans evans th the appellate court reversed the issuance of a preliminary injunction that prohibited a party from publishing certain statements about her former husband,because the injunction was overbroad and amounted to an invalid prior restraint before trial.id.at see also gilbert national enquirer,th,preliminary injunction entered before trial that prohibited from discussing allegedly defamatory comments about his former spouse,a famous actress,amounted to invalid prior restraint.the evans court emphasized,however,that a court may prohibit a party from repeating statements determined at trial to be defamatory,because defamatory statements are not subject to protection under the first amendment.evans,at.here,the trial court entered an order after a contested hearing where it determined sweeney committed abuse under the dvpa.
this approach is consistent with first amendment jurisprudence.a n injunctive order prohibiting the repetition of expression that ha s been judicially determined to be unlawful d oes not constitute a prohibited prior restraint of speech.lemen,supra,cal th at.for example,following a court trial in lemen,the trial court determined that th
