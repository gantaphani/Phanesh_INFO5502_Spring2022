menachem binyamin zivotofsky,by his parents and guardians,ari and naomi siegman zivotofsky,petitioner hillary rodham clinton,secretary of state 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
congress enacted a statute providing that americans born in jerusalem may elect to have israel listed as the place of birth on their passports.the state department declined to follow that law,citing its longstanding policy of not taking a position on the political status of jerusalem.when sued by an american who invoked the statute,the secretary of state argued that the courts lacked authority to decide the case because it presented a political question.the court of appeals so held.
we disagree.the courts are fully capable of determining whether this statute may be given effect,or instead must be struck down in light of authority conferred on the executive by the constitution.
in,congress enacted the foreign relations authorization act,fiscal year,stat.section of the act is entitled united states policy with respect to jerusalem as the capital of israel.at.the first two subsections express congress commitment to relocating the united states embassy in israel to jerusalem,at.the third bars funding for the publication of official government documents that do not list jerusalem as the capital of israel,at.the fourth and final provision,d,is the only one at stake in this case.entitled record of place of birth as israel for passport purposes,it provides that f or purposes of the registration of birth,certification of nationality,or issuance of a passport of a united states citizen born in the city of jerusalem,the secretary shall,upon the request of the citizen or the citizen legal guardian,record the place of birth as israel.ibid.
the state department foreign affairs manual states that w here the birthplace of the applicant is located in territory disputed by another country,the city or area of birth may be written in the passport.foreign affairs manual,app.the manual specifically directs that passport officials should enter jerusalem and should not write israel or jordan when recording the birthplace of a person born in jerusalem on a passport,exh,app.see also,app.
section d sought to override this instruction by allowing citizens born in jerusalem to have israel recorded on their passports if they wish.in signing the foreign relations authorization act into law,president george bush stated his belief that impermissibly interferes with the president constitutional authority to conduct the nation foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch.statement on signing the foreign relations authorization act,fiscal year,public papers of the presidents,george bush,vol.he added that if the section is construed as mandatory,then it would interfere with the president constitutional authority to formulate the position of the united states,speak for the nation in international affairs,and determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states.ibid.he concluded by emphasizing that policy regarding jerusalem has not changed.ibid.the president made no specific reference to the passport mandate in d.
petitioner menachem binyamin zivotofsky was born in jerusalem on october,shortly after d was enacted.zivotofsky parents were american citizens and he accordingly was as well,by virtue of congressional enactment.c see rogers bellei,children of american citizens acquire citizenship at birth through congressional generosity zivotofsky mother filed an application for a consular report of birth abroad and a united states passport.she requested that his place of birth be listed as jerusalem,israel on both documents.officials informed zivotofsky mother that state department policy prohibits recording israel as zivotofsky place of birth.pursuant to that policy,zivotofsky was issued a passport and consular report of birth abroad listing only jerusalem.app.
zivotofsky parents filed a complaint on his behalf against the secretary of state.zivotofsky sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering the secretary to identify his place of birth as jerusalem,israel in the official documents,at.the district court granted the secretary motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that zivotofsky lacked standing and that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political question.
the court of appeals for the circuit reversed,concluding that zivotofsky did have standing.it then observed that while zivotofsky had originally asked that jerusalem,israel be recorded on his passport,b oth sides agree that the question now is whether d entitles him to have just israel listed as his place of birth.the circuit determined that additional factual development might be helpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable,as the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implications of listing israel alone as a birthplace on the passport,at.it therefore remanded the case to the district court.
the district court again found that the case was not justiciable.it explained that r esolving zivotofsky claim on the merits would necessarily require the court to decide the political status of jerusalem.supp.concluding that the claim therefore presented a political question,the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the circuit affirmed.it reasoned that the constitution gives the executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns,and that the exercise of this power can not be reviewed by the courts.therefore,deciding whether the secretary of state must mark a passport as zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw the court into an area of decisionmaking the constitution leaves to the executive alone.the circuit held that the political question doctrine prohibits such an intrusion by the courts,and rejected any suggestion that congress decision to take a position on the status of jerusalem could change the analysis,at.
judge edwards concurred in the judgment,but wrote separately to express his view that the political question doctrine has no application to this case.he explained that the issue before the court was whether d impermissibly intrude s on the president exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns.at.that question,he observed,involves commonplace issues of statutory and constitutional interpretation plainly within the constitutional authority of the judiciary to decide,at.reaching the merits,judge edwards determined that designating israel as a place of birth on a passport is a policy in furtherance of the recognition power.at.because in his view the constitution gives that power exclusively to the president,judge edwards found d unconstitutional.for this reason,he concluded that zivotofsky had no viable cause of action,and concurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.
zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari,and we granted review.
the lower courts concluded that zivotofsky claim presents a political question and therefore can not be adjudicated.we disagree.
in general,the judiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it,even those it would gladly avoid.cohens virginia,wheat.our precedents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,known as the political question doctrine.see,japan whaling american cetacean.we have explained that a controversy involves a political question where there is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.nixon united states,quoting baker carr.in such a case,we have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the dispute before it.
the lower courts ruled that this case involves a political question because deciding zivotofsky claim would force the judicial branch to interfere with the president exercise of constitutional power committed to him alone.the district court understood zivotofsky to ask the courts to decide the political status of jerusalem.supp,at.this misunderstands the issue presented.zivotofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether jerusalem is the capital of israel.he instead seeks to determine whether he may vindicate his statutory right,under d,to choose to have israel recorded on his passport as his place of birth.
for its part,the circuit treated the two questions as one and the same.that court concluded that o nly the executive not congress and not the courts has the power to define policy regarding israel sovereignty over jerusalem,and also to decide how best to implement that policy.at.because the department passport rule was adopted to implement the president exclusive and unreviewable constitutional power to keep the united states out of the debate over the status of jerusalem,the validity of that rule was itself a nonjusticiable political question that the constitution leaves to the executive alone.at.indeed,the circuit opinion does not even mention d until the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis,and then only to dismiss it as irrelevant that congress took a position on the status of jerusalem and gave zivotofsky a statutory cause of action is of no moment to whether the judiciary has the authority to resolve this dispute at.
the existence of a statutory right,however,is certainly relevant to the judiciary power to decide zivotofsky claim.the federal courts are not being asked to supplant a foreign policy decision of the political branches with the courts own unmoored determination of what united states policy toward jerusalem should be.instead,zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory right.to resolve his claim,the judiciary must decide if zivotofsky interpretation of the statute is correct,and whether the statute is constitutional.this is a familiar judicial exercise.
moreover,because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of d,the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional.at least since marbury madison,cranch,we have recognized that when an act of congress is alleged to conflict with the constitution,i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.at.that duty will sometimes involve the r esolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches,but courts can not avoid their responsibility merely because the issues have political implications.ins chadha.
in this case,determining the constitutionality of d involves deciding whether the statute impermissibly intrudes upon presidential powers under the constitution.if so,the law must be invalidated and zivotofsky case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.if,on the other hand,the statute does not trench on the president powers,then the secretary must be ordered to issue zivotofsky a passport that complies with d.either way,the political question doctrine is not implicated.no policy underlying the political question doctrine suggests that congress or the executive can decide the constitutionality of a statute that is a decision for the courts.at.
the secretary contends that there is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment to the president of the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and,as a corollary,to determine whether an american born in jerusalem may choose to have israel listed as his place of birth on his passport.nixon,at quoting baker,at see brief for respondent.perhaps.but there is,of course,no exclusive commitment to the executive of the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute.the judicial branch appropriately exercises that authority,including in a case such as this,where the question is whether congress or the executive is aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.freytag commissioner,see,myers united states,finding a statute unconstitutional because it encroached upon the president removal power bowsher synar,finding a statute unconstitutional because it intruded into the executive function morrison olson,upholding a statute constitutionality against a charge that it impermissibly interfere d with the president exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions 
our precedents have also found the political question doctrine implicated when there is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question before the court.nixon,supra,at quoting baker,supra,at.framing the issue as the lower courts did,in terms of whether the judiciary may decide the political status of jerusalem,certainly raises those concerns.they dissipate,however,when the issue is recognized to be the more focused one of the constitutionality of d.indeed,both sides offer detailed legal arguments regarding whether d is constitutional in light of powers committed to the executive,and whether congress own powers with respect to passports must be weighed in analyzing this question.
for example,the secretary reprises on the merits her argument on the political question issue,claiming that the constitution gives the executive the exclusive power to formulate recognition policy.she roots her claim in the constitution declaration that the president shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers.art.ii.according to the secretary,c executive branch practice,congressional acquiescence,and decisions by this court confirm that the receive ambassadors clause confers upon the executive the exclusive power of recognition.brief for respondent.
the secretary observes that president washington and his cabinet unanimously decided that the president could receive the ambassador from the new government of france without first consulting congress.at citing letter from george washington to the cabinet,reprinted in papers of thomas jefferson catanzariti ed.thomas jefferson,notes on washington questions on neutrality and the alliance with france may,reprinted in,at.she notes,too,that early attempts by the legislature to affect recognition policy were regularly rejected in congress as inappropriate incursions into the executive branch constitutional authority.brief for respondent.and she cites precedents from this court stating that p olitical recognition is exclusively a function of the executive.banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,see brief for respondent citing,united states pink.
the secretary further contends that d constitutes an impermissible exercise of the recognition power because the decision as to how to describe the place of birth operates as an official statement of whether the united states recognizes a state sovereignty over a territorial area.brief for respondent.the secretary will not list as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over the relevant territory the united states does not recognize.at.therefore,she claims,listing israel as the place of birth would constitute an official decision by the united states to begin to treat jerusalem as a city located within israel.at some internal quotation marks omitted.
for his part,zivotofsky argues that,far from being an exercise of the recognition power,d is instead a legitimate and permissible exercise of congress authority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.brief for petitioner.he points the court to professor louis henkin observation that in the competition for power in foreign relations,congress has an impressive array of powers expressly enumerated in the constitution.at quoting henkin,foreign affairs and the united states constitution ed.zivotofsky suggests that congress authority to enact d derives specifically from its powers over naturalization,art.i,cl,and foreign commerce,cl.according to zivotofsky,congress has used these powers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of passports since.see brief for petitioner citing act of,stat.
zivotofsky contends that d fits squarely within this tradition.he notes that the state department designated representative stated in her deposition for this litigation that the place of birth entry is included only as an element of identification.app.deposition of catherine barry,deputy assistant secretary of state for overseas citizens services see brief for petitioner.moreover,zivotofsky argues,the place of birth entry can not be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sovereigns,because the state department authorizes recording unrecognized territories such as the gaza strip and the west bank as places of birth.brief for petitioner citing foreign affairs manual,app.
further,zivotofsky claims that even if d does implicate the recognition power,that is not a power the constitution commits exclusively to the executive.zivotofsky argues that the secretary is overreading the authority granted to the president in the receive ambassadors clause.he observes that in the federalist papers,alexander hamilton described the power conferred by this clause as more a matter of dignity than of authority,and called it a circumstance,which will be without consequence in the administration of the government.the federalist,cooke ed.see brief for petitioner.zivotofsky also points to other clauses in the constitution,such as congress power to declare war,that suggest some congressional role in recognition.reply brief for petitioner citing,art.i,cl.he cites,for example,an message from president jackson to congress,acknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to recognize because it is a power no where expressly delegated in the constitution,and one that is necessarily involved in some of the great powers given to congress.message from the president of the united states upon the subject of the political,military,and civil condition of texas,doc,see reply brief for petitioner.
zivotofsky argues that language from this court precedents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively to the president is inapplicable to his claim,because that language appeared in cases where the court was asked to alter recognition policy developed by the executive in the absence of congressional opposition.see brief for petitioner reply brief for petitioner.finally,zivotofsky contends that even if the receive ambassadors clause confers some exclusive recognition power on the president,simply allowing a choice as to the place of birth entry on a passport does not significantly intrude on that power.
recitation of these arguments which sound in familiar principles of constitutional interpretation is enough to establish that this case does not turn on standards that defy judicial application.baker,at.resolution of zivotofksy claim demands careful examination of the textual,structural,and historical evidence put forward by the parties regarding the nature of the statute and of the passport and recognition powers.this is what courts do.the political question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of this case.
to say that zivotofsky claim presents issues the judiciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a decision in this case is simple.because the district court and the circuit believed that review was barred by the political question doctrine,we are without the benefit of thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of the merits.ours is a court of final review and not first view.adarand constructors,mineta,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.ordinarily,we do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.national collegiate athletic smith.in particular,when we reverse on a threshold question,we typically remand for resolution of any claims the lower courts error prevented them from addressing.see,bond united states,slip,at reversing the court of appeals determination on standing and remanding because the merits of petitioner challenge to the statute validity are to be considered,in the first instance,by the court of appeals we see no reason to depart from this approach in this case.having determined that this case is justiciable,we leave it to the lower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.
the judgment of the court of appeals for the circuit is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
opinion of sotomayor,
menachem binyamin zivotofsky,by his parents and guardians,ari and naomi siegman zivotofsky,petitioner hillary rodham clinton,secretary of state 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice breyer joins as to part i,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
as this case illustrates,the proper application of baker six factors has generated substantial confusion in the lower courts.i concur in the court conclusion that this case does not present a political question.i write separately,however,because i understand the inquiry required by the political question doctrine to be more demanding than that suggested by the court.
the political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of circumstances in which courts properly examine whether a particular suit is justiciable that is,whether the dispute is appropriate for resolution by courts.the doctrine is essentially a function of the separation of powers,baker carr,which recognizes the limits that article iii imposes upon courts and accords appropriate respect to the other branches exercise of their own constitutional powers.
in baker,this court identified six circumstances in which an issue might present a political question a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.at.baker established that u nless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar,there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability.ibid.but baker left unanswered when the presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal,as well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the relative importance of each in determining whether a case is suitable for adjudication.
in my view,the baker factors reflect three distinct justifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a dispute.when a case would require a court to decide an issue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordinate political department,as envisioned by baker first factor,abstention is warranted because the court lacks authority to resolve that issue.see,nixon united states,holding nonjusticiable the senate impeachment procedures in light of article i commitment to the senate of the sole power to try all impeachments see also marbury madison,cranch,by the constitution of the united states,the president is invested with certain important political powers,in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion,and is accountable only to his country in his political character,and to his own conscience in such cases,the constitution itself requires that another branch resolve the question presented.
the second and third baker factors reflect circumstances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond courts competence.the judicial power created by article iii,of the constitution is not whatever judges choose to do,but rather the power to act in the manner traditional for english and american courts.vieth jubelirer,plurality opinion.that traditional role involves the application of some manageable and cognizable standard within the competence of the judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts of a concrete case.when a court is given no standard by which to adjudicate a dispute,or can not resolve a dispute in the absence of a policy determination charged to a political branch,resolution of the suit is beyond the judicial role envisioned by article iii.see,gilligan morgan,i t is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence than t he complex,subtle,and professional decisions as to the composition,training,equipping,and control of a military force vieth,at one of the most obvious limitations imposed by article iii is that judicial action must be governed by standard this is not to say,of course,that courts are incapable of interpreting or applying somewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of statutory or constitutional interpretation.but where an issue leaves courts truly rudderless,there can be no doubt of the validity of a court decision to abstain from judgment.ibid.
the final three baker factors address circumstances in which prudence may counsel against a court resolution of an issue presented.courts should be particularly cautious before forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that judicial intervention risks embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question,would express a lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,or because there exists an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.at.we have repeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met whenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitutionality or propriety of the act of another branch of government.see,united states,powell mccormack.a court may not refuse to adjudicate a dispute merely because a decision may have significant political overtones or affect the conduct of this nation foreign relations,japan whaling american cetacean.nor may courts decline to resolve a controversy within their traditional competence and proper jurisdiction simply because the question is difficult,the consequences weighty,or the potential real for conflict with the policy preferences of the political branches.the exercise of such authority is among the gravest and most delicate dut ies that this court is called on to perform,blodgett holden,holmes,concurring,but it is the role assigned to courts by the constitution.questions may occur which we would gladly avoid but we can not avoid them.all we can do is,to exercise our best judgment,and conscientiously to perform our duty.cohens virginia,wheat.
rare occasions implicating baker final factors,however,may present an unusual case unfit for judicial disposition,at quoting the argument of daniel webster in luther borden,how.because of the respect due to a coequal and independent department,for instance,courts properly resist calls to question the good faith with which another branch attests to the authenticity of its internal acts.see,field clark,deeming forbidden by the respect due to a coordinate branch of the government j udicial action requiring a belief in a deliberate conspiracy by the senate and house of representatives to defeat an expression of the popular will see also,at scalia,concurring in judgment mutual regard between the coordinate branches,and the interest of certainty,both demand that official representations regarding matters of internal process be accepted at face value likewise,we have long acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited to intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual need for attributing finality to the action of the political departments,coleman miller,or creating acute risk of embarrassment of our government abroad,or grave disturbance at home,baker,at.see,luther,at after the president has acted and called out the militia,is a circuit court of the united states authorized to inquire whether his decision was right if the judicial power extends so far,the guarantee contained in the constitution of the united states is a guarantee of anarchy,and not of order finally,it may be appropriate for courts to stay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions concerning the distribution of political authority between coordinate branches until a dispute is ripe,intractable,and incapable of resolution by the political process.see goldwater carter,powell,concurring in judgment.abstention merely reflects that judicial intervention in such cases is legitimate only in the last resort,chicago grand trunk wellman,and is disfavored relative to the prospect of accommodation between the political branches.
when such unusual cases arise,abstention accommodates considerations inherent in the separation of powers and the limitations envisioned by article iii,which conferred authority to federal courts against a backdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in exceptional cases.new orleans public service,council of city of new orleans,see generally shapiro,jurisdiction and discretion,hereinafter shapiro.the political questions envisioned by baker final categories find common ground,therefore,with many longstanding doctrines under which considerations of justiciability or comity lead courts to abstain from deciding questions whose initial resolution is better suited to another time,see,national park hospitality department of interior,ripeness united states parole comm geraghty,mootness or another forum,see,gulf oil gilbert,forum non conveniens railroad comm of pullman,louisiana power light city of thibodaux,burford sun oil,abstention in favor of a state forum united states western pa cific,primary jurisdiction doctrine.see also daimlerchrysler cuno,the doctrines of mootness,ripeness,and political question all originate in article iii case or controversy language shapiro,describing practices of judicial abstention sounding in justiciability,comity,forum non conveniens,and separation of powers.
to be sure,it will be the rare case in which baker final factors alone render a case nonjusticiable but our long historical tradition recognizes that such exceptional cases arise,and due regard for the separation of powers and the judicial role envisioned by article iii confirms that abstention may be an appropriate response.
the court below held that this case presented a political question because it thought petitioner suit asked the court to decide an issue textually committed to a coordinate branch namely,to review a policy of the state department implementing the president decision to keep the united states out of the debate over the status of jersualem,cadc.largely for the reasons set out by the court,i agree that the court of appeals misapprehended the nature of its task.in two respects,however,my understanding of the political question doctrine might require a court to engage in further analysis beyond that relied upon by the court.
first,the court appropriately recognizes that petitioner claim to a statutory right is relevant to the justiciability inquiry required in this case.ante,at.in order to evaluate whether a case presents a political question,a court must first identify with precision the issue it is being asked to decide.here,petitioner suit claims that a federal statute provides him with a right to have israel listed as his place of birth on his passport and other related documents.app.to decide that question,a court must determine whether the statute is constitutional,and therefore mandates the secretary of state to issue petitioner desired passport,or unconstitutional,in which case his suit is at an end.resolution of that issue is not one textually committed to another branch to the contrary,it is committed to this one.in no fashion does the question require a court to review the wisdom of the president policy toward jerusalem or any other decision committed to the discretion of a coordinate department.for that reason,i agree that the decision below should be reversed.
that is not to say,however,that no statute could give rise to a political question.it is not impossible to imagine a case involving the application or even the constitutionality of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable issue.indeed,this court refused to determine whether an ohio state constitutional provision offended the republican guarantee clause,art.iv,holding that the question of whether that guarantee of the constitution has been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.ohio ex rel.davis hildebrant.a similar result would follow if congress passed a statute,for instance,purporting to award financial relief to those improperly tried of impeachment offenses.to adjudicate claims under such a statute would require a court to resolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in nixon.such examples are atypical,but they suffice to show that the foreclosure altogether of political question analysis in statutory cases is unwarranted.
second,the court suggests that this case does not implicate the political question doctrine concern with issues exhibiting a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards,ante,at,because the parties arguments rely on textual,structural,and historical evidence of the kind that courts routinely consider.but that was equally true in nixon,a case in which we found that the use of the word try in the first sentence of the impeachment trial clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judicially manageable standard of review of the senate actions.at.we reached that conclusion even though the parties briefs focused upon the text of the impeachment trial clause,the constitution drafting history,contemporaneous commentary,the unbroken practice of the senate for years,contemporary dictionary meanings,hamilton federalist essays,and the practice in the house of lords prior to ratification.such evidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than that on which the parties rely here.
in my view,it is not whether the evidence upon which litigants rely is common to judicial consideration that determines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable and manageable standards.rather,it is whether that evidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate meaningfully the issue with which it is presented.the answer will almost always be yes,but if the parties textual,structural,and historical evidence is inapposite or wholly unilluminating,rendering judicial decision no more than guesswork,a case relying on the ordinary kinds of arguments offered to courts might well still present justiciability concerns.
in this case,however,the court of appeals majority found a political question solely on the basis that this case required resolution of an issue textually committed to the executive branch.because there was no such textual commitment,i respectfully concur in the court decision to reverse the court of appeals.
alito,concurring in judgment 
menachem binyamin zivotofsky,by his parents and guardians,ari and naomi siegman zivotofsky,petitioner hillary rodham clinton,secretary of state 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
justice alito,concurring in the judgment.
this case presents a narrow question,namely,whether the statutory provision at issue infringes the power of the president to regulate the contents of a passport.this case does not require the judiciary to decide whether the power to recognize foreign governments and the extent of their territory is conferred exclusively on the president or is shared with congress.petitioner does not claim that the statutory provision in question represents an attempt by congress to dictate united states policy regarding the status of jerusalem.instead,petitioner contends in effect that congress has the power to mandate that an american citizen born abroad be given the option of including in his passport and consular report of birth abroad crba what amounts to a statement of personal belief on the status of jerusalem.
powers conferred on congress by the constitution certainly give congress a measure of authority to prescribe the contents of passports and crbas.the constitution gives congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,art.i,cl,and this power includes the power to regulate the entry of persons into this country,see henderson mayor of new york.the constitution also gives congress the power to make a uniform rule of naturalization,art.i,cl,and pursuant to this power,congress has enacted laws concerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents who are citizens of this country,see united states wong kim ark.these powers allow congress to mandate that identifying information be included in passports and crbas.
the president also has a measure of authority concerning the contents of passports and crbas.the president has broad authority in the field of foreign affairs,see,american ins.garamendi,and,historically,that authority has included the power to issue passports,even in the absence of any formal congressional conferral of authority to do so.see haig agee,explaining that p rior to,when there was no statute on the subject,the common perception was that the issuance of a passport was committed to the sole discretion of the executive and that the executive would exercise this power in the interests of the national security and foreign policy of the united states we have described a passport as a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.at.this is apparent from the first page of petitioner passport,which reads as follows 
the secretary of state of the united states of america hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit the citizen national of the united states named herein to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful aid and protection.app.
similarly,a crba is a certification made by a consular official that the bearer acquired united states citizenship at birth.see,at.
under our case law,determining the constitutionality of an act of congress may present a political question,but i do not think that the narrow question presented here falls within that category.delineating the precise dividing line between the powers of congress and the president with respect to the contents of a passport is not an easy matter,but i agree with the court that it does not constitute a political question that the judiciary is unable to decide.

justice breyer,dissenting.
i join part i of justice sotomayor opinion.as she points out,baker carr,set forth several categories of legal questions that the court had previously held to be political questions inappropriate for judicial determination.those categories include instances in which the constitution clearly commits decisionmaking power to another branch of government,and issues lacking judicially manageable standards for resolution,at.they also include issues that courts can not decide without making an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,issues that a court can not independently decide without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,cases in which there is an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made,and cases in which there is a potential for embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.ibid.
as justice sotomayor also points out,these categories and in my view particularly the last four embody circumstances in which prudence may counsel against a court resolution of an issue presented.ante,at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment see nixon united states,souter,concurring in judgment the doctrine deriv es in large part from prudential concerns about the respect we owe the political departments goldwater carter,powell,concurring in judgment t he doctrine rests in part on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect among the three branches of government see also jaffe,standing to secure judicial review public actions,harv,prudence counsels hesitation where a legal issue is felt to be so closely related to a complex of decisions not within the court jurisdiction that its resolution by the court would either be poor in itself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger complex 
justice sotomayor adds that the circumstances in which these prudential considerations lead the court not to decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.ante,at.i agree.but in my view we nonetheless have before us such a case.four sets of prudential considerations,taken together,lead me to that conclusion.
first,the issue before us arises in the field of foreign affairs.indeed,the statutory provision before us is a subsection of a section that concerns the relation between jerusalem and the state of israel.see of the foreign relations authorization act,fiscal year,stat.united states policy with respect to jerusalem as the capital of israel the constitution primarily delegates the foreign affairs powers to the political departments of the government,executive and legislative,not to the judiciary.chicago southern air lines,waterman,see also marbury madison,cranch,noting discretionary foreign affairs functions of secretary of state as beyond the power of the judiciary to review.and that fact is not surprising.decisionmaking in this area typically is highly political.it is delicate and complex.chicago southern air lines,at.it often rests upon information readily available to the executive branch and to the intelligence committees of congress,but not readily available to the courts.ibid.it frequently is highly dependent upon what justice jackson called prophecy.ibid.and the creation of wise foreign policy typically lies well beyond the experience or professional capacity of a judge.ibid.at the same time,where foreign affairs is at issue,the practical need for the united states to speak with one voice and ac t as one,is particularly important.see united states pink,frankfurter,concurring see also fallon,manning,meltzer,shapiro,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed.
the result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that have significant foreign policy implications,as reflected in the fact that many of the cases in which the court has invoked the doctrine have arisen in this area,cases in which the validity of a treaty depended upon the partner state constitutional authority,doe braden,how,or upon its continuing existence,terlinden ames,cases concerning the existence of foreign states,governments,belligerents,and insurgents,oetjen central leather,united states klintock,wheat,united states pal mer,wheat,and cases concerning the territorial boundaries of foreign states,williams suffolk ins,pet,foster neilson,pet.see baker,supra,at,citing these cases as the court principal cases see also fallon,supra,at.
second,if the courts must answer the constitutional question before us,they may well have to evaluate the foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions.the constitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,d,that says the secretary of state,upon the request of a citizen born in jerusalem or upon the request of the citizen legal guardian,shall record in the citizen passport or consular birth report the place of birth as israel.stat.and the question is whether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the president inherent constitutional authority to make certain kinds of foreign policy decisions.see american ins.garamendi,citing cases clinton city of new york,t his court has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena,the president has a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved quoting united states export,youngstown sheet tube sawyer,jackson,concurring.
the secretary of state argues that the president constitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes the power to recognize foreign governments,that this court has long recognized that the latter power belongs to the president exclusively,that the power includes the power to determine claims over disputed territory as well as the policy governing recognition decisions,and that the statute unconstitutionally limits the president exclusive authority to exercise these powers.see,art.ii,cl.art.ii,kennett chambers,how,recognition williams,supra,at disputed territory pink,supra,at recognition policy see also haig agee,executive passport authority.
zivotofsky,supported by several members of congress,points out that the constitution also grants congress powers related to foreign affairs,such as the powers to declare war,to regulate foreign commerce,and to regulate naturalization.see art.i,cls,see also american ins,supra,at.they add that congress may share some of the recognition power and its attendant power of determining claims over disputed territory,palmer,supra,at recognition jones united states,disputed territory.and they add that congress may enact laws concerni
