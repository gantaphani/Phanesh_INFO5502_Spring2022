family code section,subdivision d defines a presumed father as a man who receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.the question in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding that appellant lacked standing to prosecute an action under the uniform parentage act upa et as a presumed father.we hold that the trial court erred and,accordingly,reverse the judgment of dismissal and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.
factual and procedural 
certain facts are undisputed.the child,was born in march,to maria.joseph and maria lived together for a year before birth.at the time of birth,joseph signed a voluntary declaration of paternity to qualify for health insurance and other benefits.shares joseph surname.at all times lived in joseph household for the months of her life,until joseph and maria separated in january.
joseph was employed until october,when was six months old,at which time joseph became disabled by cystic fibrosis and could no longer work.after that,he was at home full time.when was born,maria had no means to support herself and n.her last day of employment was in may of.prior to that,she had been employed for approximately two years.both parties acknowledge that at some point shortly before they stopped living together,joseph,who had been drinking,dismantled a locked door to gain entry to a room in which and maria were situated.after leaving joseph house with,maria once again found herself without the means of supporting herself and,except for family support she received from her father in florida.
joseph is not biological father,and both joseph and maria had strong reason to suspect that he was not her biological father during maria pregnancy joseph and maria were never married and,in fact,at the time of the breakup,she was still married to david although,according to maria,true biological father is robert neither david nor robert has come forward to claim paternity of 
at this point,the narratives begin to diverge.according to joseph,from the day n.was born,he has been an active,participating parent and despite his illness,he has been able to manage any and all of n.requirements.he regularly cooked,fed,bought clothing and cared for n.as any parent would do.according to maria,d uring the period joseph and she lived together with n,she was solely responsible for daily care and needs including but not limited to feeding,bathing,sleep routine and medical care and supervision.the child was never left in joseph care except for a few occasions for very short periods when maria would go to the store for food or household supplies or run a short errand.
maria claims that joseph told her to vacate the residence on january,and that she did so,with,on january.joseph claims that he was briefly hospitalized after an automobile accident,and when he returned he found that maria had apparently been served with his petition to establish paternity and left his house,taking with her,and refusing to allow him any contact with except under supervised conditions.
on january,joseph filed petitions under the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act et and the upa et for establishment of a parental relationship and for joint legal and physical custody and reasonable visitation.he also requested mediation to work out a parenting plan.maria was served on january.
on january,maria applied to the court ex parte for orders for custody,genetic testing pursuant to section to determine parentage and permission to relocate with to florida.joseph stipulated to genetic testing but otherwise opposed maria requests for permission to relocate,alleging under penalty of perjury that i am clearly the presumed father at present because i have both signed a parternity sic declaration and held n.out as my child for the past two years.i have actively parented n.and she is very attached to me and i to her.there is no basis for an early order permitting n.to relocate to florida and no reason why we should not participate in the normal process.joseph also filed his own request for an emergency screening due to maria refusal to let him have contact with,except under supervised conditions.
in response to joseph petition to establish parentage,maria specifically disputed that joseph was biological father.
on january,the court granted maria request for genetic testing,ordered the parties to mediation and calendared a hearing for february.following his review of the genetic testing which excluded him as biological father,joseph renewed his request for emergency screening,averring that n.has lived in my house for her entire life and i signed a declaration of paternity at the hospital n o other person has stepped forward to assume responsibilities for n.parenting and it is my understanding that under recent case law this should be considered the critical factor by the court rather than biological test results.
on february,the court held a hearing at which joseph,maria,and eric towle,the court investigator,were sworn.the court wanted to hear from towle about how the court should proceed at this time given that joseph was going to be excluded at least by test to be the biological father and that there may be some psychological attachment that the court needed to be concerned about with regard to visitation and move away towle testified as to his preliminary assessment.he had separately interviewed joseph,joseph parents,maria,and maria mother and had observed joseph with in the playroom for some undisclosed period of time.towle explained it difficult from the information that i have so far to really make any kind of absolute assertion as to the quality of the bond between the child and the father.the child did not respond to the father in the playroom and did not show that there was a very strong bond.but that can also be explained by the fact that the child has been separated from the father for a month.and so that disruption could cause something of a change in the display of affection for the father.if there was a very strong bond between the child and the father,if the father was a regular caretaker that disruption probably would not have been as absolute.so i can say that the bond between the father and the child is not probably on the very strong end of the spectrum but from that evidence i ca conclude that there is a bond at all.in fact,when asked to rate the bond from one to,towle responded that it could be a three or it could be a seven he did know.he opined that had not suffered in an extreme way from being away from joseph but there might be some more subtle process going on.
although towle noted disagreements between joseph and maria about the extent of their relative participation in childcare tasks,both sides agreed that joseph was in the residence for two years and did take part in the child life to some degree that maria provided the majority of the physical care for the child that joseph did change some diapers,but not often and that they had different perspectives on his involvement.joseph felt that the mother wanted to provide that care and he perhaps did have as much opportunity to do it because the mother insisted on doing it herself,where as the mother perspective is that he was more interested in other things,was not interested in taking care of the child.
asked for his recommendation to the court,towle ventured if we going to establish if there is a bond between the father and the child,absolutely,and what that would mean in terms of separating the child from the father,then i would say that we would need more information to be able to establish that if we want to know for sure what the possible repercussions are from allowing the move we would have to have more information than i have now.
the court also elicited testimony from maria that the child called joseph da da,and that she let call him da da,even though both maria and joseph knew from the beginning that he was the father.
at the end of the hearing the court requested letter briefs from the attorneys on the threshold issue of whether or not joseph has standing in this case as a presumptive father.letter briefs were submitted.joseph brief included a father day card signed n.in a childish scrawl and stating in part from your daughter i admire you,dad happy father day 
on march,the court issued a decision and orders re petitioner ability to asert sic standing in this matter in which the court found.t his case can be distinguished from nicholas cal th,d,based on the fact that the minor in this case has a loving mother who has been her primary care provider for her entire life.maria is a fit parent.nicholas had no fit biological parent that wanted to provide a loving home for this child.a paternity test has determined that joseph is not the biological father.the couple never believed that he was the biological father.the couple lived together and joseph assisted maria in raising the minor much like a friend or relative might in a shared housing situation.to extend the nicholas case to this setting would be to invite boyfriends,uncles,or housemates to begin to petition the court for standing in matters where they may have assisted the mother for a period of time with a child,however have no biological or primary attachment for and to the child.in this case granting such standing would have the effect of not allowing a mother to move to a community where she has extended family and the promise of a job in order to analyze the exact depth of bond between joseph and the child.that is probably not what the court in nicholas contemplated when they gave the six year old the permanency of a loving home with the only adult that was fit and stepping forward to continue to love him and care for him.eric towle with family court services determined that this child was not so deeply attached to the petitioner that he could see a bond in the short time that he observed them together.he indicated had there been a strong bond that it would have withstood the period of time that the child had not seen joseph.he would have been able to see a strong bond if it had ever been there.no such bond existed.towle said that further assessment could determine the level of the bond because some bond should exist if they lived together for two years,but he did not know what level that would be.this child does not appear to have been psychologically devastated by the separation of joseph and herself thus far according to the evidence before the court.hence,because we have a loving mother who is the primary caretaker and has and will continue to provide a loving home to her child the court denies joseph motion for standing in this matter.
contentions 
joseph contends,based on our supreme court decisions in in re nicholas,supra,cal th,d,nicholas and in re jesusa cal th,d,jesusa,that the presumption of paternity established by section,subdivision d is not rebutted by evidence of biological nonpaternity,that nicholas and jesusa are not limited to dependency actions,and that the trial court erred in finding that he did not have standing to pursue his claim of paternity as a presumed father under section,subdivision d.he also claims that maria should be estopped from challenging the voluntary paternity declaration they both signed,and that the trial court should not have decided disputed factual issues in a summary adjudication without a full hearing.
maria responds that joseph not only lacked standing to claim paternity under section,subdivision d because at best he held the child out as his own,the court in fact determined on the merits that the presumption of paternity arising under section,subdivision d was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that joseph was not biological father and by towle testimony that was not strongly bonded to joseph.she also argues that she is not estopped from challenging joseph voluntary acknowledgment of paternity,in which she joined,because she moved to rescind the voluntary declaration of paternity before turned two years old,she never led joseph to believe he was biological father,and she never sought judicial or as child the basis of the voluntary declaration.because we find that the trial court did not make a ruling on the merits of joseph paternity claim and erred in finding that he lacked standing under nicholas,jesusa,and the relevant statutes,we do not reach joseph remaining claims.
discussion 
applicability of nicholas and jesusa 
in nicholas,our supreme court interpreted section,subdivision a provision that a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by convincing evidence.italics added.the court held when it used the limiting phrase an appropriate action,the legislature was unlikely to have had in mind an action like action in which no other man claims parental rights to the child,an action in which rebuttal of the section d presumption will render the child fatherless.rather,we believe the legislature had in mind an action in which another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section d presumption in order to perfect his claim,or in which a court decides that the legal rights and obligations of parenthood should devolve upon an unwilling candidate.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court findings and orders id.at,d,the supreme court upheld the trial court exercise of discretion in concluding that this case,in which no one else was a candidate for the privilege and responsibility of fathering this little boy,was not an appropriate action in which to find that the section d presumption of fatherhood had been rebutted by evidence that the presumed father was not also the boy biological father.id.at,d,italics omitted.
in jesusa,the court reaffirmed its holding in nicholas,finding that as between two presumed fathers,it was the nonbiological presumed father whose paternity claim was founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic within the meaning of section,subdivision b.jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.after jesusa it is absolutely clear that biology is not the determinative factor in resolving paternity disputes under our statutory scheme.
here,the trial court found that nicholas was not controlling because,unlike nicholas,already had one fit parent,her mother.in other words,the trial court sought to limit nicholas to the dependency context.in our view,nicholas can not be fairly limited in that way.nothing in nicholas or jesusa suggests that sections and should be construed as making biology determinative of paternity in adoptions,family law matters and upa petitions,but not in dependency cases.the clear import of nicholas and jesusa is that whenever possible,a child should have the benefit of two parents to support and nurture him or her.the court concern,stated repeatedly,was that biology should not be used to render children fatherless.the fitness or unfitness of the mother did not figure in the equation.
nor do we agree with the trial court finding that applying nicholas case to this setting would be to invite boyfriends,uncles,or housemates to begin to petition the court for standing in matters where they may have assisted the mother for a period of time with a child,however have no biological or primary attachment for and to the child.as we see it,the import of nicholas is that a boyfriend,uncle or housemate who receives a child into his home and holds the child out as his own is not disqualified from asserting parental rights and responsibilities to the child by virtue of his lack of a biological attachment.
we find that insofar as the trial court refused to apply nicholas to the paternity action before it because was not a dependent child,and gave considerable weight to joseph biological of,the trial court erred.
accordingly,we now turn to the question whether joseph had standing to bring a upa petition to establish his paternity to 
standard of review 
the question before joseph meets the relevant statutory criteria for standing to sue for establishment of paternity to for statutory interpretation of sections,subdivision b and,subdivision d.statutory interpretation is a question of law,which appellate courts revie
