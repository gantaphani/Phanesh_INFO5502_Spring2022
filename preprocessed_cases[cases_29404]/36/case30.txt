savvas charalambous filed a petition for the return of his two children,and,to cyprus pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,which was implemented by the international child abduction remedies act icara,et.the children were removed in june from cyprus,their country of habitual residence,to the united states by their mother,elizabeth charalambous.she did not return the children to cyprus before september as she had represented she would.she defended against the petition primarily on the ground that returning the children would expose them to a grave risk of harm,an exception to return under article b of the convention.
following a evidentiary hearing,the district court held that there was not clear and convincing evidence of a grave risk of harm to the children,and that the convention required their return.the court ordered the children placed in their father custody no later than october,date later postponed to november,ordered certain interim conditions.in an october,order,this court stayed the removal of the children pending the outcome of respondent appeal,but expedited the appeal.the court heard oral argument on december.
we now lift the stay,and affirm,finding no error of law by the district court and holding that its findings and conclusions are well supported.we order that the children be placed in the custody of the father no later than december,at for their return to cyprus,and we return jurisdiction to the district court should any further orders be necessary to secure enforcement.
we briefly summarize the facts that led to the present appeal,taking them from the record of proceedings before the district court.we refer to the parents by their first names and to the children by their initials.
savvas,a citizen of cyprus,married elizabeth,a citizen of the united states,in a civil ceremony in virginia in,and again in a religious ceremony in cyprus in.the couple has resided in limassol,cyprus since december,save for a few months in during which elizabeth and savvas briefly separated and elizabeth returned on her own to her parents home in maine.they have two children,born in,and,born in.
on june,elizabeth,and departed cyprus for a summer visit to elizabeth family in maine.elizabeth had purchased return tickets to cyprus,and savvas expected elizabeth and the children to return in august.
by july,savvas came to believe elizabeth would not return to cyprus with the children as planned,based on her failure to provide the children opportunities to speak to their father,the infrequent nature of her communications with him,and what she said when she did communicate.these beliefs were confirmed when elizabeth informed savvas on july,that she and the children would not be returning as planned.consequently,on july,savvas filed an application for return of his children under the hague convention with the central authority in cyprus.savvas then filed a petition in the district of maine on september,alleging that elizabeth had wrongfully retained and in the united states,and seeking the return of the children to cyprus pursuant to the hague convention and icara.
the district court promptly held an evidentiary hearing on october and.both savvas and elizabeth testified in person the court heard evidence by video from other witnesses in cyprus.on october,in a careful and sensitive opinion,the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law,granting savvas petition,and ordering the children returned to the custody of their father by october.see charalambous charalambous,wl,at.the court concluded that elizabeth had wrongfully retained the children in maine and that elizabeth had failed to prove either that savvas had consented or acquiesced to the retention or that the children faced a grave risk of physical or psychological harm if they were returned to cyprus id.at.we discuss the relevant findings in more detail in the next section.
the court also ordered that,until the return,elizabeth not remove the children from the district of maine without approval of the court,and that the parties shall seek a determination as soon as possible from a court of competent jurisdiction in cyprus regarding the custody,support,and visitation with respect to the children.id.at.the court ordered the return of and passports upon receipt of an affidavit from either savvas or elizabeth that they would be used solely for the purpose of travel to cyprus.id.the court clarified that its order in no way precluded an independent custodial determination by an appropriate authority in cyprus.id.
on october,elizabeth filed both a motion to stay the judgment and a motion to extend time within which to turn over children so that she might pursue an appeal.on october,the district court denied elizabeth motion to stay,and granted the motion to extend time.the court reset the deadline for elizabeth to return and to savvas to november.
this appeal followed,accompanied by an emergency motion to stay judgment of the district court.we granted the motion to stay on october.that stay was modified and other conditions were imposed on the mother as a result of actions she unilaterally took during the pendency of the appeal 
we review the district court interpretation of the hague convention de novo.danaipour mclarey,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,and its application of the convention to the facts de novo.id.
the hague convention was enacted to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.hague convention,see also abbott abbott,d.the convention establishes a strong presumption favoring return of a wrongfully removed child,danaipour,at,and is based on the principle that the best interests of the child are well served when decisions regarding custody rights are made in the country of habitual residence,abbott.at.the hague convention is generally intended to restore the status quo before the removal and to prevent a parent from engaging in international forum shopping.kufner kufner,cir.we interpret the convention text mindful of these purposes.abbott.at.
children who have been wrongfully retained outside of their country of habitual residence must be expeditiously returned,unless the respondent can prove one of the defenses provided for by the convention.hague convention.in the district court,elizabeth invoked the article b defense that returning and to cyprus would create a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child ren in an intolerable situation.id.at.specifically,she alleged a grave risk of such harm existed based on the children having been physically,sexually or psychologically abused by savvas and his mother.she also argued that returning to cyprus would place her own safety at risk,thus causing her children psychological harm see walsh walsh,cir.the district court rejected elizabeth argument based on its findings of fact.
on appeal,elizabeth waives most of her claims and only pursues discrete portions of her grave risk defense.specifically,elizabeth has abandoned a primary claim she made to the district court that or would be subject to physical harm in the form of sexual or other abuse upon their return to cyprus.on appeal,elizabeth has not contested the district court findings on this point 
the only questions on appeal are whether the district court erred in its interpretation of the hague convention concerning any psychological harm to the children that returning them to cyprus could cause,and whether it was clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that elizabeth had not demonstrated that any spousal abuse would create a grave risk to the children.
under article b,grave means a more than serious risk,but it need not be an immediate risk.see danaipour,at citing hague international child abduction convention text and legal analysis,walsh,at.elizabeth bears the burden of establishing the existence of such a grave risk by clear and convincing evidence.e a.t
