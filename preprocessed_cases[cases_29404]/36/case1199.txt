in a proceeding following a contested trial,the trial court divided community property,confirmed separate property,and ordered charles nelson to pay arista nelson spousal support of per month.arista appeals from the judgment.she contends that the trial court erred by valuing her sole proprietorship business as of the date of separation rather than trial,determining that the marital residence was entirely charles separate property,and failing to consider the parties standard of living during marriage in arriving at the spousal support amount.we agree in part with arista marital residence issue.we therefore modify and affirm the judgment.
background 
charles then years old and arista then years old married in.charles had purchased the marital home in for,using a mortgage loan of for which the monthly payment was.at the time of the marriage,the mortgage balance was.the parties paid off the balance in,the year in which arista began a retail business known as arista flowers and dolls.the business was never profitable.the parties separated in.after separation,arista moved the retail business to another location and incurred for moving costs and expenses.she closed the business in,shortly before trial.
date of business valuation 
pursuant to family code section,subdivision a the general rule is that community assets must be valued as near as practicable to the time of trial.the trial court may value a community asset at an alternate valuation date on a showing of good cause,subd.b.in this regard,the trial court has considerable discretion to divide community property in order to assure that an equitable settlement is reached.in re marriage of duncan th,d.as long as the court exercised its discretion along legal lines,its decision will be affirmed on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support it.ibid.
charles experts could not adequately value arista business because of arista poor recordkeeping.for example,there was an unexplained loss of between and,gross profit percentage for and was inexplicably inconsistent,inventory for december and january was inexplicably identical,income statements for and were inconsistent with income tax returns for those years,and there existed two disparate income statements.one expert opined that it was impossible to value a retail business without reliable income statements and balance sheets for the previous three to five years.charles therefore asked the trial court to value the business as of the separation date and offered his expert opinion of book value as of that date,which the expert extrapolated from arista tax return,august income statement,and june statement.
relying on in re marriage of stallcup d,in re marriage of kilbourne d,and in re marriage of stevenson th,d,the trial court determined that the date of separation was the appropriate valuation date for arista business because the state of arista record keeping and subsequent disclosures were such that it was difficult if not impossible to calculate the value of this business since the date of separation,and the business was a sole proprietorship operated by arista alone from the date of separation.
placed in context within the scope of our review,arista contends that the trial court abused its discretion by finding good cause to value the business as of the date of separation.she argues that there was no evidence that she ever tried to hide anything or that her allegedly bad bookkeeping was intentional,and the value of the business as of trial devolved largely from her personal skill,industry and guidance as opposed to a mere change in value of the capital assets.we disagree with arista first point.
there is no requirement in a bad bookkeeping case that the proprietor must have intentionally created the uncertainty.this subject was discussed in the case of in re marriage of stallcup,supra,d at page,where the court affirmed a trial court decision to value community property as of a date near separation.there,the husband had answered the wife interrogatories regarding business transactions only after the wife motion to compel answers was granted.he had frustrated efforts by a cpa to obtain tax returns and other papers and documents,and the trial court found that he had willfully refused discovery and disobeyed court orders.the trial court noted inconsistencies in the husband testimony and in his bank loan applications and deposition statements regarding current assets and liabilities.it concluded that the husband was not a credible witness.it valued the property at the earlier date to simplify the accounting and to eliminate the inference that the husband failure to provide discovery was calculated to conceal unfavorable evidence.on appeal,the court found both good cause and equitable division under those circumstances,remarking that having failed to provide timely evidence of his claimed business reverses,husband may not now benefit from the confusion thus created.ibid.
though the trial court in stallcup inferred that the husband was intentionally concealing information,the appellate holding does not rest upon intentional concealment.the pivotal point of the case is simply that a party may not benefit from confusion for which he or she is responsible,no one can take advantage of his own wrong.stated another way,when a party precludes an expert valuation because he or she does not provide needed information,a valuation as of another time is appropriate because it is made as near as practicable to the time of trial,subd.a.
here,the trial court accepted that arista recordkeeping precluded a postseparation valuation of her business.it was therefore rational to conclude that good cause existed to value the business as of the separation date.
given that the trial court good cause finding is justified on this basis,it is unnecessary to examine arista second point challenging the trial court finding 
character of marital residence 
generally,w hen community property is used to reduce the principal balance of a mortgage on one spouse separate property,the community acquires a pro tanto interest in the property.citations.this principle is known as the rule.citations.bono clark th,d.
in moore,an unmarried woman bought a house in by making a down payment and securing a loan for the balance of the purchase price.for a brief period,she also reduced the loan balance through payments from her earnings.she then married,and the loan payments were made with community funds until she separated from her husband in.thereafter,she made mortgage payments from her own funds until the time of trial.at issue in moore was the determination of the community percentage interest in the the trial court had found to be the woman separate virtue of the use of community funds to reduce the loan balance.moore,supra,cal d at.the court held that the loan was a separate property contribution,and that the woman was entitled to credit for the down payment.id.at.it calculated the woman separate property percentage interest by adding the amounts of the down payment and the loan,subtracting the amount to which the community payments had reduced the loan balance,and dividing the result by the purchase price.it further calculated the community property percentage interest by dividing the amount that the community payments had reduced the loan balance by the purchase price.
in marsden,the court confronted an issue not addressed in moore,namely,the allocation of prenuptial appreciation on separate property.there,a man bought property and constructed a house in.in so doing,he expended personal funds and obtained a loan,towards which he made payment prior to the marriage.thereafter,community funds were used to reduce the outstanding loan balance until the parties separated,when the man used his earnings to further reduce this balance.the court concluded that the man was entitled to the full benefit of the prenuptial appreciation on the house.marsden,supra,d at.accordingly,in calculating his cash share in the house,the court accorded him all of the prenuptial appreciation,together with a portion of the postnuptial appreciation based on the moore formula.
charles introduced testimony to the effect that the fair market value of the marital residence was on the date of the marriage and on the date of separation.his expert calculated from the formula that the community interest in the residence was.charles also introduced testimony that the fair rental value of the residence exceeded per month during the and per month during the early.
on,charles acknowledged that in he secured a debt owed to his first wife by means of a deed of trust on the residence and that in he obtained a home equity loan to pay the balance due on that and other debts.
arista offered no evidence on the marital residence issue.
the trial court accepted as the community interest per moore marsden but denied the community any interest for purposes of dividing the community property.it explained in its amended statement of decision the residence is the separate property of charles.at the time of the marriage,the mortgage balance on the property was only about.the mortgage was paid off within a few years after their marriage.as a result the parties have lived in charles home virtually rent free and certainly for far less than they would have had to pay had they been renting a home.the evidence was that the calculation was.however,charles also presented evidence that the mortgage payments from through were about per month.from until the date of separation in there was no mortgage owed on the property and the parties lived rent free.charles expert testified that the fair rental value during the period of time that the mortgage was paid far exceeded.as a result the court concludes that the fair rental value use of the property to the to the sic community far exceeded the amount,and therefore the community is entitled to zero.
arista contends that the trial court erred by factoring rental value into the calculation,failing to factor the home equity loan into the calculation,and using the separation date rather than the trial date in the calculation.we agree that rental value is not a factor in the calculation.
rental value 
california practice guides note that the question of offset from the community reimbursement has never been addressed in a california published opinion.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,adams sevitch,cal.family law practice ed.offset for rental value,see generally reppy,acquisitions with a mix of gift by recognizing shared ownership or displacing california presumption of gift by recognizing shared ownership or reimbursement idaho,bartke,yours,mine and title and community funds.
the case of in re marriage of camire d.camire,mentions the issue without addressing it.camire rested on an earlier precedent establishing that,where the husband expends community funds on improvements to the wife separate property,the separate character of the property is not altered,and courts presume that the husband has made a gift of community funds.it held that the community was not entitled to any interest in the wife separate property although community funds were used to reduce the encumbrance on the property.id.at.it then concluded,since reimbursement is precluded by the applicable rule of law discussed herein,we need not determine the propriety of the trial court determination with respect to the fair rental value of the property,as a source of to the claim of entitlement to reimbursement to the community.id.at.
we conclude that the supreme court has implicitly addressed the issue in moore by declining to offset from the community reimbursement those expenditures which do not increase the equity value of the property.
in moore,the supreme court rejected the husband argument that interest,taxes and insurance should be included with the mortgage payment in the computation of the community interest in the wife separate property.it explained since such expenditures do not increase the equity value of the property,they should not be considered in its division upon dissolution of marriage.the value of real property is generally represented by the owners equity in it,and the equity value does not include finance charges or other expenses incurred to maintain the investment.amounts paid for interest,taxes and insurance do not contribute to the capital investment and are not considered part of it.a variety of expenses may be incurred in the maintenance of investment property,but such expenses are not considered in the valuation of the property except to the extent they may be relevant in determining its market value from which in turn the owners equity is derived by subtracting the outstanding obligation.moore,supra,cal d at,italics added.
more important for our purposes,the moore court went on to declare,without mentioning camire upon dissolution,it is the court duty to account for and divide the assets and the debts of the community.payments previously made for interest,taxes and insurance are neither.moreover,if these items were considered to be part of the community interest,fairness would also require that the community be charged for its use of the property.moore,supra,cal d at,italics added.
we view this latter quote from moore as a rejection of the suggestion that rental value should be an item of credit to the owning spouse when calculating the reimbursement to the community for its contribution to the residence equity value.hence,in determining the community interest in the marital residence,owned as separate property of one spouse,only those community funds which increase that property equity should be considered in property division upon dissolution of marriage.by implication,the supreme court held,just as the real property equity is not influenced by finance charges,it is not influenced by the property use or occupancy.
the trial court judgment concludes that arista owes charles an equalization payment of.given that the trial court made this calculation without taking into account the community interest in the marital residence,it follows that the judgment should be modified to credit arista equalization payment with of the community interest in the marital residence,which amounts to a modified equalization payment of.
home equity loan 
arista claim that the calculation should have accounted for the home equity loan is manifestly without merit.
first,it fails because of insufficient evidence.no evidence shows what amount charles owed to his first wife on the date of marriage,what amount charles borrowed on the home equity loan,what amount charles paid for separate debts,and what amount the community paid on the home equity loan.no calculation can be done knowing only that charles owed his first wife in and satisfied the obligation balance in via a home equity loan.
second,arista point fails because the home equity loan is unrelated to the acquisition of the marital residence.the case arista relies on,in re marriage of branco th,d branco,makes this clear.
branco addressed the application of the rule when community funds from a mortgage secured by separate property are used to pay off a prenuptial loan by which the owner of the separate property bought it.in branco,a woman owned a house that was subject to a mortgage when she married in.in,she and her husband refinanced the mortgage on the house,and used a portion of the loan proceeds to pay off the original mortgage.the court concluded that there was no meaningful difference,for purposes of determining whether the community acquires an interest in real property,between the use of community funds to make payments on one spouse preexisting loan and the use of proceeds from a community property loan to pay off the preexisting separate loan.branco,supra,th at,d.it thus stated applied to the present case,the community property interest in the home would be computed by dividing the community contribution to the purchase price of the home payments reducing principal made with community funds on the original loan,if any,plus the principal balance of the loan paid off with proceeds from the postnuptial mortgage by the purchase price.this percentage would then be multiplied by the appreciation of the home during the years of the marriage.id.at,d.it added that the separate property share inc
