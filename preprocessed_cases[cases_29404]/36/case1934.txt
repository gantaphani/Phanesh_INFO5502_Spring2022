we have for review macar macar,so d dca,based on certified conflict with goodstein goodstein,so d dca,addressing the issue of whether final judgments which incorporate marital settlement agreements achieved after commencement of litigation in marriage dissolution actions should be subject to challenges based on casto casto,so d,or whether such challenges should be solely predicated on florida rule of civil procedure.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons detailed below,we conclude that challenges to these types of agreements,made after extensive litigation and discovery,should be controlled by rule.thus,we approve the second district decision in macar and disapprove the third district decision in goodstein,to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.
alex and vivian macar were married in.on november,macar filed a petition for dissolution from november until october,the parties engaged in discovery,filed financial affidavits,and made mandatory disclosures.at all times,both parties were represented by counsel.macar also hired george snyder,an accountant,to inventory the parties assets based on the discovery documents and disclosures.snyder prepared a schedule of the parties assets,which he gave to macar for use at trial.
four days prior to trial,the wife requested a continuance and filed no fewer than five other motions.when the court convened for trial on the morning of october,the wife filed two more motions and renewed her request for a continuance.the trial court addressed and denied all of the wife motions.when the court reconvened for the trial to commence that afternoon,counsel for both parties announced that they had reached an agreement on all issues after all terms of the agreement were fully articulated,the trial court and both counsel asked each party whether they had agreed to the terms voluntarily.both parties responded affirmatively on november,the trial court entered a final judgment which incorporated the october settlement agreement as part of the judgment.
on may,the wife filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to florida rule of civil procedure and florida family law rule of procedure in her motion,the wife alleged that the settlement agreement as incorporated into the final judgment was unfair that it was a result of the husband fraud,overreaching,coercion or duress and that she had entered into the agreement without full knowledge of the parties assets.the wife also alleged that she had uncovered new evidence indicating that the husband had misrepresented the amount in three brokerage funds,and that the husband had misclassified those funds as nonmarital assets.
at the hearing on the wife motion,the wife asserted that during discovery the husband had not disclosed a tax refund of in stock certificates an investment account in the children names for which the husband was a custodian answers to two interrogatory questions and documents that the wife had requested supporting any claim the husband presented that any asset was nonmarital.the wife further contended that the husband had misclassified three brokerage accounts as nonmarital and erroneously listed the value of the three accounts at each,when in fact the values ranged from to.
after the evidentiary hearing,the trial court found that although there was no coercion,the terms of the agreement were unfair to the wife.the trial court relied upon and applied casto elements for analysis,discussed infra,and ultimately set aside the property settlement agreement that had been incorporated into the initial final judgment.the trial court reasoned that the wife had not been involved in,or familiar with,the family finances,and the husband had not made a full and complete disclosure,given the errors in his financial affidavit.the husband sought review of that determination.
the second district court of appeal reversed the trial court decision and remanded the case for reinstatement of the initial final judgment.specifically,the district court determined that the trial court should not have applied the casto analysis because casto applies only to marital agreements entered into prior to litigation and entry of final judgment.the second district also noted that the only avenues available for the wife to seek relief from the final judgment were through direct appeal or by motion pursuant to florida rule of civil procedure the district court applied the only possible rule elements available to the wife for relief,fraud and newly discovered evidence,and held that the wife challenge to the final judgment failed.the second district then certified conflict with goodstein goodstein,so d dca,which set aside a final judgment incorporating a marital property agreement reached after litigation based on casto provisions for overreaching and duress.
in casto,we considered the elements upon which a trial court could rely to set aside a postnuptial agreement.in doing so,we delineated the following parameters 
first,a spouse may set aside or modify an agreement by establishing that it was reached under fraud,deceit,duress,coercion,misrepresentation,or overreaching.
the second ground to vacate a settlement agreement contains multiple elements.initially,the challenging spouse must establish that the agreement makes an unfair or unreasonable provision for that spouse,given the circumstances of the parties 
once the claiming spouse establishes that the agreement is unreasonable,a presumption arises that there was either concealment by the defending spouse or a presumed lack of knowledge by the challenging spouse of the defending spouse finances at the time the agreement was reached.the burden then shifts to the defending spouse,who may rebut these presumptions by showing that there was either a a full,frank disclosure to the challenging spouse by the defending spouse before the signing of the agreement relative to the value of all the marital property and the income of the parties,or b a general and approximate knowledge by the challenging spouse of the character and extent of the marital property sufficient to obtain a value by reasonable means,as well as a general knowledge of the income of the parties.the test in this regard is the adequacy of the challenging spouse knowledge at the time of the agreement and whether the challenging spouse is prejudiced by the lack of information.
casto,so d at citations omitted.
thus,casto dictates that a postnuptial agreement may be set aside where there is a direct showing of fraud or overreaching by one party or,assuming the agreement was unreasonable or unfair,where the challenging party shows by unrebutted presumption that he or she did not have adequate knowledge of the marital property at the time the agreement was entered into,or that the other party concealed assets.the casto court qualified its reasoning by noting 
as reflected by the above principles,the fact that one party to the agreement apparently made a bad bargain is not a sufficient ground,by itself,to vacate or modify a settlement agreement a bad fiscal bargain that appears unreasonable can be knowledgeably entered into for reasons other than insufficient knowledge of assets and income.there may be a desire to leave the marriage for reasons unrelated to the parties fiscal position.if an agreement that is unreasonable is freely entered into,it is enforceable.
critical to our analysis is the fact that the parties in casto reached their postnuptial agreement one year before the husband had even filed the petition for dissolution of marriage.in goodstein and macar,however,the parties did not conclude their settlement agreements until after the marriage dissolution action was filed.the macars had not only commenced litigation,but they had engaged in extensive discovery for an extended period before reaching their agreement.as a result,the macar court disapproved the trial court extension of casto,distinguishing casto on the basis that casto involved a simple postnuptial agreement concluded before the commencement of litigation,whereas macar addressed a settlement agreement reached after the initiation of litigation and the completion of extensive discovery.see
