i.the conviction for threatening a public official 
defendant conviction arises from his threatening his own defense attorney during his first trial on the domestic violence charge.
attorney marc tirrell represented appellant in his first trial for inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant.tirrell worked for the solano county conflict defender office.he had years experience as a criminal defense attorney.he had dealt with thousands of clients who had not always been pleasant to him.as he put it,y ou must develop a thick skin to work in the public defender conflict defender office.because for whatever reason,you are often not liked by almost anyone.the clients,the clients families,the public,sometimes the judges.on one prior occasion,a defendant had threatened him to the extent that he feared for his safety,and he withdrew from the case.
on the morning of june,before the start of the second day of trial,tirrell met with defendant in a holding cell in the courthouse.the room was only four feet by six or eight feet,and contained a table and two chairs that were not bolted down.defendant was wearing belly chains attached to handcuffs,which limited the range of motion of his he had room to move his hands within the restraints.his legs were not restrained.
as tirrell and defendant talked about how the trial was progressing,defendant became very upset with tirrell.defendant facial expression changed,as did the volume and tone of his voice,and his body language.he became a little bit flushed.defendant was upset about the questions tirrell had asked his former girlfriend,the victim,who testified the day before.
defendant told tirrell that when he got out of custody,he was going to kick my ass.at that point,tirrell was a little concerned,but defendant had made similar comments to tirrell before.tirrell described these comments as general physical threats,but the pattern in the past was that defendant would become angry,make a threat,and then calm down when he and tirrell continued to talk about the case.thus,tirrell was not concerned for his safety.
this time defendant did not follow the prior pattern.as tirrell continued to talk to him,he stood up,his face became extremely red sort of contorted,his body was very tensed,and he looked at me and said that he was going to shoot me in the head with a bullet.
tirrell felt very threatened.i did feel that this was real,and i felt that it was serious.tirrell reached that conclusion because the threat was very specific.the way he said it how he looked at me his body language his tone of voice the color of his face the fact that he stood up at that point.tirrell felt in fear for my safety.tirrell felt that defendant would carry out the threat when he was released from custody.
tirrell told defendant that their conversation was over,and got up and left the holding cell.he went up to deputy chase,a custodial officer who was outside,and told him he wanted to make a police report.immediately after he left the room,tirrell was a little upset.even being,i felt that the threat was real.and i felt that my safety might be in jeopardy.
on by defense counsel,tirrell admitted that he knew that defendant had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd,that adhd causes people to be easily distracted and suffer from poor impulse control,and that he had observed defendant having poor impulse control.on redirect,tirrell testified he did not feel safer because he knew defendant had adhd.on the contrary,knowing defendant had poor impulse control caused me to have more concern when he made that specific threat to kill me.
officer chase testified that when tirrell came out of the holding cell,he looked scared.his eyes were kind of wide open i would describe it as a deer in the headlights he was extremely nervous.chase went into the holding cell,and noticed that defendant was aggravated and angry,and was mumbling things like,dumptruck,piece of shit.stuff like that.
as a result of the threat,the domestic violence trial ended in a mistrial.
discussion 
penal code section criminalizes certain threats against various elected and appointed public officials and their staffs and immediate families.subdivision a of section sets forth the elements of the offense.as here pertinent,subdivision a provides as follows 
every person who knowingly and willingly threatens the life of,or threatens serious bodily harm to,any county public defender with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat,and the apparent ability to carry out that threat by any means,is guilty of a public offense 
subdivision c of section defines various terms.it defines apparent ability to carry out that threat as including the ability to fulfill the threat at some future date when the person making the threat is an incarcerated prisoner with a stated release date,subd.c.
of more significance to the present case is the statute definition of threat.a threat means a verbal or written threat or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal or written statements and conduct made with the intent and the apparent ability to carry out the threat so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety,subd.c,italics added.
the trial court instructed the jury with calcrim,which tracks the language of section.as here pertinent,the court instructed the jury as follows 
the defendant is charged with threatening a public official.to prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime,the people must prove that one,the defendant willingly threatened to kill or threatened to cause serious bodily harm to a conflict defender two,when the defendant acted,he intended that his statement be taken as a threat three,when the defendant acted,he knew that the person he threatened was a conflict defender four,when the defendant acted,he had the apparent ability to carry out the threat and five,the person threatened reasonably feared for his safety.someone who intends that the statement be understood as a threat does not have to actually intend to carry out the threat 
defendant contends that calcrim is incorrect because it tells the jury that the defendant need not have the intent to carry out the threat,only the intent that the statement be taken as a threat.he argues that the language of section,subdivision c section c,which we italicized above,requires an intent to carry out the threat in order to convict under the statute.according to defendant,the language made with the intent to carry out the threat requires the people to prove not only that he intended his comments and conduct in the holding cell to be taken as a threat,but also that he intended to carry out the threat.
the people respond by relying primarily on two cases which state that section does not require an intent to carry out the threat people gudger th,d gudger and people craig th,d craig.these cases are not helpful as authority on the precise question before us.
gudger observed that there is no requirement in section of specific intent to execute the threat gudger,supra,th at,d.gudger went on to hold that the intent that a statement be taken as a threat,coupled with the apparent ability to carry it out,satisfied first amendment concerns of criminalizing speech.gudger,supra,at,d see discussion at,d.but gudger was decided on october,before the effective date of the amendment to section that a
