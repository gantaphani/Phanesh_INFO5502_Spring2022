is laches available as a defense to the payment of child support arrearages we join the second and fourth district appellate courts recently facing this issue in holding that it is.we also conclude the trial court finding of laches was supported by the evidence.
background 
harold and lesley copeman divorced in.the parties agreed that lesley would have custody of their two sons,michael and steven,and harold would pay child support of per month until the children reached age.harold also agreed to provide medical and dental insurance for the children and pay of all uninsured medical expenses.finally,harold promised to pay spousal support of per month for two years.
on june,the parties modified the support agreement.this stipulation and order provided that,effective january,harold would pay per month in child support.on january,this amount would increase by percent to on january,the payment would increase by another percent to and on january,the payment would increase again by percent to the order did not provide for any further increases in child support.both parties agreed to the scheduled increases subject to their right to prove to the satisfaction of the court that such increase is not justified by the economic or other circumstances of the parties.subject to one final payment,the order terminated harold obligation to pay spousal support.
from january until december,harold continued to pay child support of every month.after his older child emancipated in december,harold reduced the support payments to per month.lesley never asked harold for the scheduled support increases,nor did they ever discuss the matter.then,on october,the alameda county district attorney filed a declaration on lesley behalf,seeking accumulated child support arrearages and interest totaling.harold filed a notice of motion to expunge all arrears,and the court held a contested hearing on the motion.on the date of the hearing,the children were and years old.
lesley testified she did not ask for the increases before october because she did not want to involve her sons in a conflict.she also described herself as a very passive personality and thought she did not have the financial means to pursue the additional support.she did not know until recently that the district attorney could assist her.lesley never told harold he did not have to pay the additional support,however.
harold admitted he did not pay the scheduled increases.however,harold regularly paid many of the children expenses even though he was not obligated to by the support order.he paid for half,or more,of their extracurricular expenses,including many expenses related to their participation in sports.he paid for the older son driver education,auto insurance and car maintenance.lesley often presented him with written statements outlining expenses she wanted reimbursed.harold also paid a portion of the children day care expenses for one year,during which time lesley agreed to reduce his support obligation by per month.harold also funded several shopping sprees for the boys.harold believed he and lesley had agreed to share these extra expenses in lieu of the percent child support increases.he did not keep all his bank statements or receipts for credit card or cash purchases nevertheless,he produced some receipts and cancelled checks reflecting in expenditures.harold testified that he could not have afforded to pay the child support increases in addition to the extracurricular activities he funded,and he would not have contributed to expenses beyond the order had he known lesley would pursue the additional support.he also would have sought a modification of the support order.
the court found that the doctrine of laches applied and,on that basis,expunged all child support arrears through november.the court reserved jurisdiction on arrears that accrued after november,and harold later agreed to pay child support of per month for the younger son.the attorney general appealed the arrearage issue on lesley behalf.
discussion 
laches is available as a defense to child support arrearages 
lesley contends the trial court order runs afoul of several sections of the family code she notes that a judgment for child support is enforceable until paid in full,and may not be set aside simply because the court finds that it was inequitable when made,nor simply because subsequent circumstances caused the support ordered to become excessive or inadequate.
prior to,judgments for child and spousal support expired within a stated period of years.accordingly,such judgments had to be periodically renewed,similar to any other civil judgment.in re marriage of fogarty rasbeary th,d fogarty.beyond the statutory time frames,the trial court had discretion to determine whether to allow enforcement of the judgment.in making this determination,the trial court was required to consider the lack of diligence in pursuing enforcement for more than these specified periods.citation.in re marriage of garcia th,d.
in,when family law proceedings were still within the civil code,the legislature amended former civil code section to provide that judgments for child support and spousal support were exempt from renewal,and that those judgments were enforceable until fully paid.in,the family code supplanted the civil code as to family law matters.family code section took the place of former civil code section.the new section reads as follows notwithstanding any other provision of law,a judgment for child,family,or spousal support,including a judgment for reimbursement or other arrearages is exempt from any requirement that judgments be renewed.a judgment for child,family,or spousal support,including all lawful interest and penalties computed thereon,is enforceable until paid in full.fogarty,supra,th at,d.the legislature also amended civil code section in to exempt judgments for spousal or child support from the renewal requirements that must be met for enforcement of other civil judgments.id.at,d.
with these legislative changes,spousal and family support orders are enforceable in perpetuity until paid.the lack of diligence defense is gone,as is the trial court discretion in deciding whether to enforce a judgment beyond the presumptively timely period for enforcement.in re marriage of garcia,supra,th at,d.
we are not the first court to address whether these amendments rendered the defense of laches unavailable to the enforcement of support judgments.in in re marriage of plescia th,d plescia,the appellant argued that amendments to the family code rendering support judgments enforceable until paid in full eliminated the statute of limitations for enforcement of her spousal support judgment and,by implication,eliminated the laches defense too.plescia,supra,at,d.division two of the fourth district court of appeal discussed the scope of the superior court equity jurisdiction and determined,unless the legislature specifically excluded laches from the jurisdiction of the superior court,the court not only had the power to bring this controversy to an equitable conclusion,it had the duty.therefore,respondent equitable defense of laches,raised during the equitable disposition of appellant spousal support order,should be affirmed absent any explicit statutory language to the contrary.id.at,d.the plescia court found no such exclusion of the laches defense.statutory abolition of the limitations period did not impliedly destroy the traditional defense of laches,since the two doctrines are fundamentally different.id.at,d.nor could amendments removing lack of diligence as a consideration in enforcement proceedings be construed as an implied elimination of laches,which requires both delay and undue prejudice.id.at,d.considering the long history of the laches defense,its prevalent use in other states,and the legislature failure to mention laches in the applicable statutes,plescia concluded that laches remains an available defense to collection of spousal support arrears.id.at,d.
last year,division two of the second district court of appeal extended plescia holding to apply to past due child support as well.fogarty,supra,th at,d.fogarty observed that,although authorities across
