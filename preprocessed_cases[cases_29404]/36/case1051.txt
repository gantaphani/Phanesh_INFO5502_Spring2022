introduction 
christine appeals from the judgment entered on james petition for dissolution of marriage.christine suffers from bipolar disorder and breast cancer.she was representing herself in propria persona and was hospitalized when the trial court denied her request under the americans with disabilities act of,united states code section et.ada and california rules of court,rule to continue the trial.the trial was concluded in her absence.christine contends the trial court erred by denying her ada request.
although we sympathize with the trial court frustration over the many continuances granted in this case,including a prior unopposed ada request from christine,we conclude her request for ada accommodation under california rules of court,rule should have been granted.it is undisputed christine suffers from bipolar disorder,a potentially incapacitating mental illness,and,on her psychiatrist recommendation,checked herself into a hospital,the day before trial was set to resume.rule f permits a trial court to deny a request for accommodation under the ada only if the court makes a determination of at least one of three specifically identified grounds none of those grounds existed when christine request was denied.we therefore reverse and remand without addressing christine challenge to the judgment on its merits.

on march,the court scheduled the trial for august,and.on june,the court appointed counsel to represent james and christine child.
christine first ada request 
on july,christine applied ex parte for an order continuing the trial due to her psychiatric condition.christine treating psychiatrist,kathleen farinacci,submitted a declaration confirming that christine had suffered from bipolar disorder for a number of years.farinacci further declared the divorce proceedings and upcoming trial have been a source of serious anxiety and emotional turmoil for christine c.and i am afraid that she may suffer a mental and emotional breakdown as a result of the pressures of trial.as a result,i do not believe that she is capable to prepare for trial at this time.i believe that if the trial were delayed for days that christine c.would be in better psychological and emotional shape to deal with the trial and would be less at risk of a breakdown.
the court denied christine ex parte application but stated,i f you advise the court in the middle of the trial there is an emergency,i certainly respond to it.the court then commented,i do think i have any evidence to indicate that she would be institutionalized for years if we started trial.the court decided to try valuation and property issues before custody and support issues.
on july,christine filed an exhibit list and a witness list,which included a business appraiser and a forensic accountant.on the same date,the parties filed their respective trial briefs.in her trial brief,christine again explained she suffered from bipolar disorder and two forms of cancer.
trial started on august.christine was present in a wheelchair,and her attorney stated she was ill.on the first day of trial,james testified and presented expert testimony and evidence concerning the valuation of his business.on the second day of trial august,james presented expert testimony and evidence on the value of the family residence.christine was not present on august.
at on august,the court recessed and conducted an conference with counsel.in the meantime,christine filed a request for accommodations by persons with disabilities the ada request.she filed the request with assistant presiding judge wieben stock,the ada coordinator,who notified judge silbar of the request.judge silbar conducted a telephonic examination of farinacci,asking her if christine would be fine for trial in days.farinacci was placed under oath and testified f ine would be an exaggeration,but right now she has been a wreck.i mean very depressed and crying all the time and really overwhelmed by everything that is happening to the point that we were discussing hospitalization for her.and following my last visit with her i called the hospital where she been before to see if that could be arranged.farinacci testified christine mental disorders were lifelong conditions but a little bit of time passing where she comes to grips with the various things that she has found out will allow her to be able to deal with the whole situation and go to trial.farinacci confirmed that christine suffered from bipolar disorder,and what that means is her mood is unstable and sometimes she is much more manic and sometimes she depressed.
after a brief recess,the court announced that after a thorough discussion,the court and counsel agreed it would not be in either party best interest to proceed with trial while the ada request was pending.in light of farinacci testimony,the court continued the trial to november,and set a settlement conference for september.the court minutes for august included this statement for the record,the court feels this matter should have proceeded to trial.historically,the court was not made aware of christine mental illness.this court had not seen christine in a wheelchair until yesterday.the trial continuance is to benefit both sides.
after being informed by judge silbar of the trial continuance,assistant presiding judge wieben stock granted the ada request,stating given the nature of this accommodation,that it is a temporary accommodation relating to the timing and pace of the trial as it was set to occur this week,christine is advised that,consistent with her rights to confidentiality in this matter,she should be prepared to make available to the trial c ourt,any updated medical or psychiatric status information,including,if appropriate,the ability to consult with any treating professionals,so that the court can monitor and make appropriate adjustments,if necessary,relative to future settings.
further trial continuance and motion to appoint guardian ad litem 
in early september,christine underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from her left armpit.her surgeon described the tumor as a serious malignancy and showed that her lymphoma had spread to parts of her body beyond that at the time of her original diagnosis.
later in september,christine filed an order to show cause asking the court to order james to pay her he owed on a promissory note and to liquidate some community property securities so she could receive an advance of community funds.in support of the order to show cause,christine declared she was badly in need of additional funds because my financial condition has seriously deteriorated.the trial court denied the order to show cause.
on november,christine requested a continuance of the trial,scheduled for november.christine oncologist submitted a declaration concluding christine was not fit for trial on that date.the oncologist explained christine has a very complicated medical history of breast cancer and lymphoma.she has recently been diagnosed with recurrent lymphoma.she has been quite stressed with those recent findings.she is also quite fatigued which is part of the disease state.at this point a great deal of work needs to be done to determine the extent of the recurrent lymphoma.imaging studies and a bone marrow exam have been done.i have been contacting other experts in the field of bone marrow transplantation to determine the extent of aggressive therapy needed.farinacci submitted a declaration concluding christine was not fit for trial on november because t he stress of this recurring cancer has worsened her psychological condition.
james did not object to the request,and the trial court continued the trial to march and.
in december,james moved for an order appointing a guardian ad litem for christine.his attorney declaration asserted a guardian ad litem was necessary because it has become apparent this dissolution action is unlikely to be completed in a timely manner as a result of christine ongoing disability.christine was unable to pay her attorney,the attorney withdrew,and christine opposed the motion in propria persona.farinacci submitted a declaration reaffirming christine suffered from bipolar disorder,but was currently on a pharmaceutical regimen under my medical supervision that has controlled the mood swings and compulsivity that are characteristic of this genetic disorder.according to farinacci,christine was well stabilized emotionally,fully competent mentally,capable of providing for her personal needs,and able to manage her financial resources.farinacci suggested christine undergo an evidence code section evaluation to answer any issues of mental capacity or stability.
on january,the trial court denied james motion to appoint a guardian ad litem,stating,i do not think that i can make the findings by clear and convincing evidence that i am required to make in order to appoint a guardian ad litem or a conservator.the court mentioned christine prior requests for a continuance,noted the trial had been set for march for many months,and then told christine,so i expect you are not going to come in march,asking for a continuance is that correct christine who did not have counsel replied,n o,i wo go ask you for a continuance.
christine second ada request 
on february,christine filed an ex parte request for an ada accommodation to continue the trial the second ada request.the second ada request was personally served on presiding judge wieben stock,the court ada coordinator,and on judge silbar.accompanying the second ada request was a declaration from farinacci stating christine is currently in a totally depleted state emotionally and i am strongly recommending that she be hospitalized early the week of february,at a local psychiatric facility and hospital.while she is hospitalized,my professional medical opinion is that she be granted absolute rest from any further legal stress.the duration of her hospitalization will be determined by staff psychiatrists and physicians.i estimate that with proper care,she will be able to resume normal activities within three months.
christine was not present when trial resumed on march.on february,she had checked herself into a hospital on farinacci recommendation.christine was admitted by eric speare and was under his care through march,speare checked herself out of the hospital.she did so because the behavioral health unit mixed alcohol and drug patients with psychiatric patients,making the atmosphere seem turbulent and oppressive.
christine friend,daniel remy who is not a lawyer,was in judge silbar courtroom on march.he told judge silbar that christine had been hospitalized and that an ada request was pending before presiding judge wieben stock.judge silbar said she would contact presiding judge wieben stock to learn if a request was pending.judge silbar returned after a recess and announced,t he court does not have any paperwork from any other court,whether it be the court of appeal,whether it be the presiding judge,that would indicate the court should proceed on this trial date,which appears to be our third or fourth trial date.
remy then went to see presiding judge wieben stock and met with her for an hour.in a declaration submitted with christine motion for a new trial,remy stated that presiding judge wieben stock told him she needed written proof that christine had been hospitalized and would stop the trial if he could present anything to show christine was in the hospital.presiding judge wieben stock gave remy her personal fax number so he could directly send her evidence of christine hospitalization.remy contacted speare,who stated he would send a note on his prescription pad to presiding judge wieben stock.later that day,speare told remy that by he had faxed a note to presiding judge wieben stock confirming christine had been hospitalized.remy,believing the trial would be continued,went home.
presiding judge wieben stock denied the request to continue the trial,stating on march,this court met with daniel remy,personal representative for moving party christine c.this court instructed remy to provide any available evidence of c.current status to the trial judge in this matter as soon as possible.a determination whether to grant a continuance in the middle of an ongoing and complex trial involves the necessary weighing and balancing of a variety of factors,not otherwise known to this court.for example,a review of the court record in this case,reveals that the declarant on the current ada request,kathleen farinacci,submitted a prior declaration on or about january,declaring that c.is now well stabilized emotionally.farinacci further declared that c.is not severely physically incapacitated by any illness at this time.as of the day of the scheduled trial resumption,c.had not provided the trial judge with any evidence of her condition.it is this court understanding that c.has been hospitalized and at this court request,a note from eric speare,states only that c.has been hospitalized and was admitted the night before march.under the unique circumstances of this case,the court finds that to grant c.a second continuance,ex parte and without sufficient medical evidence,would fundamentally alter the nature of the service program or activity,within the meaning of the ada,insofar as it would inappropriately countermand the discretion and duties of the trial judge in the matter,who is otherwise fully qualified to consider c.reasonable requests,in an appropriate manner.
judge silbar learned christine had made the second ada request to presiding judge wieben stock,but proceeded with trial before a ruling was made on that request.judge silbar stated christine has failed to do anything that would mandate or even require this court to consider another continuance and added the court had shown patience by entertaining the c.matter times.although presiding judge wieben stock and judge silbar conversed about the second ada request,it appears judge silbar was never informed of speare note confirming christine had been hospitalized.judge silbar stated e ven though c.is not present,the court intends to be as fair as possible to her in all of these issues.we are not here to railroad her because she is not here.
judge silbar approved with a few additions the stipulation regarding temporary child custody and visitation as the permanent custody and visitation order,ordered james to pay monthly spousal support of based on his offer to pay that amount,and ordered christine to pay james in attorney fees,to be deducted from her share of a brokerage account.judge silbar assigned a community property value of to james business.in contrast,christine business valuator would have testified the business was worth million.james was awarded an equity interest credit of in the family residence,which christine contended was overvalued by.
christine motion for a new trial 
the judgment of dissolution with an addendum on reserved issues was entered on march.christine obtained counsel,and they brought a motion to vacate the judgment and for a new trial.the motion included declarations from christine,remy,farinacci,and speare confirming christine was hospitalized on march.speare declared,among other things,he believed christine would not have been able to participate in trial given her medical condition on march,and described her as physically incapacitated and unable to function,as she was rambling,distressed and hyperverbal.
in ruling on christine motion for a new trial,judge silbar nine pages of the reporter procedural history of the case,emphasizing the many continuances.the parties had stipulated to some of the continuances,and the origin of one was unknown.although recognizing that most ada accommodation requests are confidential,judge silbar found that christine waived that confidentiality by bringing the issue up on numerous occasions.indeed,judge silbar criticized christine for going to presiding judge wieben stock with a request for an ada accommodation without the court knowledge,even though presiding judge wieben stock was the ada coordinator.judge silbar referred to remy as a man whose name has been thrown around in this matter numerous times,and commented that he had spoken up on numerous occasions and had sought another accommodation from presiding judge wieben stock.judge silbar accused farinacci t he psychologist or psychiatrist or whatever her title is of submitting under oath competing statements to two different courts regarding the mental state of christine and found her testimony to completely lack credibility.completely.
judge silbar denied the motion with these strong words this is absurd,absolutely absurd.years,to appearances on a very simple dissolution is unacceptable,costly,and inexcusable.the court finds that the tactics by c.were manipulations to obtain continuances.the court made that finding when i proceeded on march.after numerous attempts for continuances that were denied,after numerous requests for continuances that were granted,i get an informal statement that she checked herself into a hospital the night before trial resumes.unacceptable.there is no surprise to c.the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence there is no irregularity in the proceedings resulting in an unjust,unfair result to c.c.has attempted to,by using two courtrooms,to manipulate the system.judge silbar also stated let the court of appeal look at the record and let the court of appeal understand that we we allowed every case to continue for years,we would get anything done.
the trial court erred by denying the second ada request under california rules of court,rule for a trial continuance 
did the trial court err by denying the second ada request for accommodation in her reply brief,christine argues california rules of court,rule virtually compelled presiding judge wieben stock to grant a trial continuance as an ada accommodation.in response to our invitation,james submitted a supplemental brief in response to issues raised for the first time in the reply brief arguing,among other things,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the second ada request 
california rules of court,rule 
california rules of court,rule governs requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities.rule a defines persons with disabilities to mean persons covered by civil code section et the unruh civil rights act,the ada,or other applicable state or federal law.
california rules of court,rule advances the court policy to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system.cal.rules of court,rule b.to fulfill that purpose,rule b requires each superior court and appellate court to designate at least one person to be the ada coordinator to address requests for accommodations.rule c permits requests for accommodations to be made ex parte to the ada coordinator,but requires they be made as far in advance as possible,and in any event must be made no fewer than court days before the requested implementation date.the court has discretion to waive this deadline,rule c.the court must keep confidential all of the applicant information concerning the request unless the applicant waives confidentiality in writing or disclosure is required by law,rule c.
california rules of court,rule a defines accommodations to mean actions that result in court services,programs,or activities being readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities and may include making reasonable modifications in policies,practices,and procedures furnishing,at no charge,to persons with disabilities,auxiliary aids and services,equipment,devices,materials in alternative formats,readers,or certified interpreters for persons with hearing impairments relocating services or programs to accessible facilities or providing services at alternative sites.in responding to a request for accommodation under rule,the court must consider,but is not limited by,california civil code section et,the provisions of the americans with disabilities act of,and other applicable state and federal laws in determining whether to provide an accommodation or an appropriate alternative accommodation.cal.rules of court,rule e.
the grounds for denying a request for accommodation are limited a request for accommodation may be denied only when the court determines that the applicant has failed to satisfy the requirements of this rule the requested accommodation would create an undue financial or administrative burden on the court or the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.cal.rules of court,rule f.
christine came within the ada and followed the procedures under california rules of court,rule for requesting an accommodation 
it was undisputed christine suffered from bipolar disorder,a potentially incapacitating mental illness which may result in disability under the ada den hartog wasatch academy cir,bipolar disorder of sufficient severity is a disability under the ada.in his supplemental brief,james assumes christine qualifies as having a mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities and is,therefore,disabled under the ada.see a.in addition,christine suffered from breast cancer and a lymphoma.
christine followed the procedures for seeking an ada accommodation.on february,christine had the second ada request personally served on presiding judge wieben stock and on judge silbar.christine was hospitalized on february,and the next day her friend,remy,made another request for an ada accommodation in the form of a trial continuance.the second ada request was filed fewer than five court days before the date set for trial to resume,but the trial court apparently waived the deadline under california rules of court,rule c,and james does not argue the second ada request was untimely.
in considering the second ada request,presiding judge wieben stock was required to consider the provisions of the ada.relevant here is title ii of the ada concerning provision of public services.title united states code section states,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.under section,a state and its departments and agencies are defined as public entities.christine,acting on her psychiatrist recommendation,checked herself into a hospital on february,as a result of her mental illness.in the order denying the second ada request,presiding judge wieben stock acknowledged receiving a faxed note from speare stating christine had been hospitalized.
as christine was representing herself in propria persona,she was unrepresented at trial on march.thus,by reason of her disability,christine would be denied the benefit of court services unless the trial court granted the second ada request.
none of the three grounds listed in california rules of court,rule f required to deny an ada request was present 
the trial court could deny the second ada request only by making a determination of one of the three grounds listed in california rules of court,rule f.if the court did not,or could not,make any such determination,the
