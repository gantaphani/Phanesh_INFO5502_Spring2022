willard mccloy,the debtor mccloy,and his wife,beatrice mccloy collectively,the mccloys,challenge the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over mccloy estate and over beatrice mccloy asserted property rights as a spouse.the mccloys state that they are farmers.willard mccloy was placed into involuntary bankruptcy by one of his creditors.the bankruptcy court approved a settlement negotiated by the bankruptcy trustee involving a parcel of community property owned by the mccloys,known as section.the mccloys objected to the settlement.they argue that section is not an asset of the bankruptcy estate.further,willard mccloy asserts that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction over him because an involuntary bankruptcy petition can not be brought against a farmer.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the holdings of the bankruptcy court.
mccloy purchased a parcel of land known as section,block,rr survey,hansford county,texas section in.the mccloys were married at the time.although the mccloys both testified that willard mccloy purchased the property with joint funds,only willard mccloy name appears on the deed.in july,mccloy signed a promissory note and deed of trust on section to citizens security savings loan association.beatrice mccloy did not sign these documents.in may,mccloy borrowed from appellee craig silverthorne silverthorne to pay off debts and judgment liens on his separate properties.mccloy executed a promissory note for to silverthorne and a deed of trust against acres out of section to secure the note.beatrice mccloy name does not appear on any of these documents.mccloy made no payments on this note.
beatrice mccloy filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy on june.she listed section on her schedule a list of assets as community property and there listed silverthorne as a creditor.however,she did not list silverthorne on her schedule d list of secured creditors.she testified that she did not consider herself indebted to silverthorne on the promissory note.silverthorne consequently did not receive formal notice of beatrice mccloy bankruptcy or her claim to section.silverthorne testified that he learned of beatrice mccloy bankruptcy four or five years after she had filed her petition for chapter bankruptcy,but that he did not know that she asserted a claim to section.beatrice mccloy testified that she believed that silverthorne was aware of her bankruptcy earlier on,but admitted that she never specifically notified silverthorne of the bankruptcy or that she claimed a community property interest in section.
mccloy executed a new note to silverthorne on june,for.this note was to cover the original note,accrued interest,and expenses advanced to mccloy by silverthorne.mccloy again gave silverthorne a deed of trust against acres out of section.beatrice mccloy name does not appear on these documents either.
mccloy also executed two leases to his son,delbert mccloy,on section.again,beatrice mccloy name does not appear on these documents.delbert mccloy wrote checks in payment on the leases to mccloy,and these checks were deposited in the mccloys joint bank account.beatrice mccloy name did not appear on a lease to delbert mccloy of section until august,and the lease was predated to january.both dates occurred after the bankruptcy proceedings against mccloy had begun.the bankruptcy court characterized this lease as peculiar.
willard mccloy made no payments to silverthorne on the note either,and in october silverthorne foreclosed on section.mccloy then sued silverthorne to set aside the foreclosure sale for lack of notice.beatrice and delbert mccloy remained in possession of section.on december,mccloy was placed into involuntary bankruptcy under chapter by one of his creditors,national loan investors,lp nli.the proceedings were converted to chapter,but then were converted back to chapter.beatrice mccloy moved to intervene in the state court proceedings,claiming that she had a interest in section that had survived silverthorne foreclosure and seeking to quiet title to her interest.silverthorne evicted delbert mccloy from section on august,and filed a forcible detainer action against beatrice mccloy after she claimed a right to possession the chapter bankruptcy trustee,kent ries,removed all pending actions to the bankruptcy court.
ries mediated a settlement with silverthorne,in which silverthorne agreed to pay to the bankruptcy estate in exchange for the release of the estate claims to section.the bankruptcy court approved the settlement,although the mccloys objected to it.the bankruptcy court also found that section was the community property of willard mccloy and that the trustee kent ries had the authority to release and settle pending suits regarding section.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court rulings.the mccloys then appealed to this court.
we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.in the matter of henderson,cir.we first address the mccloys claims that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to determine beatrice mccloy rights as a spouse.the mccloys argue that section is not an asset of mccloy bankruptcy estate,because silverthorne foreclosed on mccloy interest in section prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings,and that beatrice mccloy retains her interest in section.they contend on appeal that the state court suit between silverthorne and beatrice mccloy over section,which was removed to the bankruptcy court,therefore is not related to the bankruptcy proceedings.they argue that mccloy no longer had any interest in the property,and the bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction to consider the lawsuit.the mccloys did not challenge the relatedness of the suit in the courts below mccloy consented to the entry of an order for relief in the bankruptcy proceedings.the appellees argue that mccloy therefore has waived any objections that he has to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.
however,a lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,and we can examine the lack of subject matter jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.see giles nylcare health plans,cir citations omitted.therefore,we must determine if the state court suit is in fact related to the bankruptcy proceeding in order to assess whether the bankruptcy court properly exercised jurisdiction over the case and whether we have jurisdiction.under c,a bankruptcy court may hear proceedings that are related to the bankruptcy proceeding.we have held that a proceeding is related to a bankruptcy proceeding if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.in the matter of wood,cir quoting pacor,higgins,cir emphasis added.
in this respect,the key issue here is whether section was willard mccloy sole or joint management community property or not.under the bankruptcy code,community property that is under the sole,equal,or joint management and control of the debtor is property of the bankruptcy estate.a a.if section was under his control,mccloy had the authority to encumber and dispose of the property,and third parties such as silverthorne could rely on this authority to do so.beatrice mccloy therefore would have no claim to the property.state law determines whether property is classified as separate or community.see in re bishop college.under texas law,p roperty possessed by either spouse during or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property.ann.a vernon.clear and convincing evidence is required to prove that property is separate.id.b.however,property is presumed to be subject to the sole management,control,and disposition of a spouse if it is held in that spouse name id.a.further,
a third person dealing with a spouse is entitled to rely,as against the other spouse or anyone claiming from that spouse,on that spouse authority to deal with the property if the property is presumed to be subject to the sole management,control,and disposition of the spouse and the person dealing with the spouse a is not a party to a fraud on the other spouse or another person and b does not have actual or constructive notice of the spouse lack of a
