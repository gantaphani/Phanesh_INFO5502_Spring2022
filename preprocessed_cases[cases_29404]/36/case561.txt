this case calls upon us to construe welfare and institutions code section which governs orders for reunification services in child dependency proceedings.pursuant to subdivision a of that statute,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,with certain exceptions not applicable here,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide services to the child and the child parent or guardian.subdivision b of the statute,however,provides that reunification services need not be offered when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that any of a number of conditions exists.subdivision b of section provides that services may be denied on a finding t hat a the court ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings or of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or after the sibling or had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to section and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision a,or b the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or of the child had been permanently severed,and that,according to the findings of the court,this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or of that child from that parent or guardian.italics added.
mother renee was denied reunification services under subdivision b of section.on the facts of this case,the correctness of that ruling hinges on whether the italicized language in the immediately preceding paragraph applies to both subparts a and b,or only the latter.the courts of appeal are divided on the question,and the present court of appeal joined the court in shawn superior court th,d,holding that the language applies to both subparts.accord,in re diamond th,d but see marshall superior court th,d marshall holding reasonable effort language applies only to subpart b in re jasmine th,d same in re baby boy th,d same see also marlene superior court th,d implicitly concluding same.thus,in the absence of the requisite finding,the court granted renee petition for extraordinary relief,ordering the juvenile court to vacate its order denying services and directing a new dispositional hearing be held at which services would be offered.
we find the statute ambiguous in the relevant respect and the canons of construction of little assistance in resolving the question before us.from recent legislative trends toward restricting the circumstances in which reunification services must be provided,however,we discern a legislative intent to deny reunification services to a parent who previously has failed at reunification.we conclude the court of appeal erred in its reading of the statute and therefore reverse.
facts and procedure 
sayrah was born to renee in october.several of renee older children previously had been the subject of dependency proceedings anthony,born in september,christopher,born in september,and dylan,born in december,had been declared dependents of the orange county juvenile court under section,subdivisions b and j in november,after anthony was born with a positive toxicology screen for methamphetamine.
both renee and robert,the father of anthony,christopher and sayrah,had substance abuse problems and an extensive history of domestic violence.in january,after renee and robert had received reunification services in the earlier dependency proceeding for months without completing successfully any of the drug programs,testing regimens,parenting classes,housing procurements,domestic violence programs,or visitation schedules that had been prescribed for them by the trial court,the orange county juvenile court terminated reunification services.later,the court terminated renee and robert parental rights to anthony and christopher,who were in the process of being adopted.renee parental rights to dylan were also terminated,and dylan was in the process of being adopted by renee father and stepmother 
according to renee,when she learned she was pregnant with sayrah,she began to abstain from drugs and thereafter remained abstinent,although she completed no treatment programs.she acknowledged needing help,such as counseling or a program,in the area of substance abuse.renee obtained prenatal care throughout the pregnancy,and sayrah was healthy at birth.
from the time sayrah was two months to four months old,renee lived with robert r.at that point,however,she stopped living with robert and ended the relationship because he became emotionally abusive toward her and she feared he would physically abuse her again,as he had in the past.thereafter,renee lived with a friend for a short while and then began living with her friend leticia velez,a former schoolteacher.in lieu of rent,renee provided child care services for velez children.velez told the social worker she had not been very trusting of renee at first because she had heard renee had lost custody of her other children,but velez began to trust her completely after seeing her consistency in disciplining the children.velez also said she saw no sign of drug use in renee during the time she lived with her.
in april,renee was arrested for burglary and forgery.she was convicted of possessing deceptive government identification,possessing a driver license to commit forgery,receiving stolen property,second degree burglary and two counts of felony possession of bad checks or money orders.renee was sentenced to days in jail and months probation.she did not,however,turn herself in to serve her sentence 
on january,police officers on patrol recognized renee as a person with outstanding warrants and arrested her.the officers found sayrah in an improperly secured car seat.in a diaper bag in the car,police found a wallet,personal checks and credit cards that had previously been reported stolen.renee picture with an unknown male subject was found inside the wallet,along with the owner identification.renee asserted she had found the wallet and notified the owner,but had not had time to return it to her.police confirmed that the owner of the wallet had received a call from a renee,who said she would bring the wallet to the owner workplace but had never showed up.renee was eventually sentenced to days in jail on old warrants and probation violations.no new charges were filed in connection with renee possession of the reportedly stolen wallet.no drugs or paraphernalia were found in renee car.
when sayrah was taken into protective custody,she was dirty and her diaper had not been changed for several hours,but she appeared healthy and developmentally normal.because renee could not provide the name of a relative to take custody of sayrah,sayrah was initially placed in a series of temporary homes.later,sayrah was moved to the home of her maternal grandfather and stepgrandmother,who,as noted,were in the process of adopting sayrah half brother,dylan.the juvenile court established jurisdiction over the case on february,after finding sayrah was a person described in section,subdivisions b failure to protect due to substance abuse,g no provision for support,and j sibling abuse.
at the dispositional hearing on march,the juvenile court found,by clear and convincing evidence,that the reunification services offered to renee in the cases of sayrah two siblings,anthony and christopher,and half sibling dylan had been terminated because both renee and robert had failed to reunify.the juvenile court further found that renee parental rights to those children had been terminated and that neither renee nor robert had made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that had led to the removal of renee three other children.the court found that,under both subparts a and b of section,subdivision b,reunification services were not appropriate in this case.although the orange county social services agency ssa specifically eschewed reliance on subdivision b of section,the court nevertheless concluded that subdivision applied,in that renee had a history of substance abuse.the court further found,by clear and convincing evidence,that the provisions of subdivision c and of section applied and that to vest custody of sayrah with her parents would be detrimental to her.the court then set the matter for a permanency planning hearing pursuant to section.
renee petitioned for extraordinary relief pursuant to california rules of court,rule b.the court of appeal agreed with her that the juvenile court had erred in resting its decision on subdivision b of section because ssa had waived reliance on that provision and renee had relied on the waiver.with respect to section,subdivision b,the court of appeal likewise found merit in renee arguments and,following shawn superior court,supra,th,d,read the reasonable efforts clause as applicable to both subparts a and b.the court of appeal reasoned that abstinence from drugs,regardless of actual completion of a rehabilitation program,would constitute the most important evidence that a drug problem is being addressed and concluded that,in the absence of any evidence renee was still using drugs or had exposed sayrah to domestic violence,the juvenile court could not simply assume those conditions continued to exist.having thus rejected both of the juvenile court stated bases for denying reunification services to renee,the court of appeal granted relief,ordering the juvenile court to vacate its order denying reunification services and setting the matter for a permanency planning hearing,and directing that court instead to hold a new dispositional hearing at which reunification services would be offered.
we granted ssa petition for review in order to construe section,subdivision b.renee answer to the petition for review raised,as an additional issue for our review,the question whether interpreting section,subdivision b to deny her reunification services would deprive her of due process.
a fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in construing a statute,our first task is to look to the language of the statute itself.citation.when the language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent,we look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms.citations.additionally,however,we must consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute citation and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.we are required to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citations.citations.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.phelps stostad cal th,d.
we are directed to no legislative history expressly answering the question before us and,as a matter of english usage,nothing in section,subdivision b clearly compels one reading over the other.to resolve the ambiguity,the parties cite various principles of statutory interpretation.a longstanding rule of statutory construction the last antecedent rule provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.white county of sacramento cal d.exceptions to the rule,however,have been identified.one provides that when several words are followed by a clause that applies as much to the first and other words as to the last,the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.wholesale dealers national.cal d.another provides that when the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding words,its application will not be restricted to the last.white county of sacramento,supra,at.this is,of course,but another way of stating the fundamental rule that a court is to construe a statute so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.where a statute is theoretically capable of more than one construction a court must choose that which most comports with the intent of the legislature.citation,second bracketed insertion in original.principles of statutory construction are not rules of independent force,but merely tools to assist courts in discerning legislative intent.
as the court in marshall,supra,th at pages,d,observed we must give the provision a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers,practical rather than technical in nature,which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citation.significance,if possible,should be attributed to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose,as the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citation.the court should take into account matters such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy,and contemporaneous construction.citation.
the purpose of section was explained in in re baby boy,supra,th at page,d.as a general rule,reunification services are offered to parents whose children are removed from their custody in an effort to eliminate the conditions leading to loss of custody and facilitate reunification of parent and child.this furthers the goal of preservation of family,whenever possible.citation.nevertheless,as evidenced by section,subdivision b,the legislature recognizes that it may be fruitless to provide reunification services under certain circumstances.citation.once it is determined one of the situations outlined in subdivision b applies,the general rule favoring reunification is replaced by a legislative assumption that offering services would be an unwise use of governmental resources.citation.
as pertinent,the in re baby boy court went on to infer that the legislature intended to restrict provision of reunification services in the case of a parent who previously had failed to reunify.the exception at issue here,section,subdivision b,recognizes the problem of recidivism by the parent despite reunification efforts.before this subdivision applies,the parent must have had at least one chance to reunify with a different child through the aid of governmental resources and fail to do so.experience has shown that with certain parents,as is the case here,the risk of recidivism is a very real concern.therefore,when another child of that same parent is adjudged a dependent child,it is not unreasonable to assume reunification efforts will be unsuccessful.further,the court may still order reunification services be provided if the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interests of the child,subd.c.in re baby boy,supra,th at,d.
we agree with in re baby boy understanding of the legislative purpose in enacting section,subdivision b and with its interpretation of the statute.renee cites factual differences between that case and this one,but any such differences are irrelevant to the pure question of statutory interpretation confronting us here.at the same time that it enacted subdivision b,moreover,the legislature shortened from months to six the period for provision of reunification services in the case of a child who was under age three at the time of removal from the physical custody of the parent,subd.a,added by stats,ch.one might thus characterize both of these amendments as aimed at expediting the dependency process in order to facilitate the placement of minors in stable,permanent homes,particularly in the cases of the youngest children and those least likely to benefit from reunification services.consistent with this aim,we find it probable that the legislature did not intend,in the case of a minor whose parent in connection with a prior dependency proceeding has already demonstrated an inability to benefit from services,to impose for denial of services an additional and arguably redundant requirement that the parent has made no reasonable effort to treat the underlying problem.
as the marshall court of appeal reasoned supra,th at,d,our reading of the statute accords significance to all its parts.had the legislature intended to require the finding of no reasonable effort in the case both of the parent whose service plan had been ordered terminated and of the parent whose rights over the child had been severed,there would have been no need to affix separate a and b labels to the two clauses.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,separately numbered paragraphing as emphasizing grammatical and analytical independence of clauses within code civ,subd.e.likewise,had the legislature meant to require the finding in both cases,it might have set forth that requirement as a preface to the two different scenarios.the legislature,however,did neither.
moreover,when viewed in the context of the different ways in which a child is removed from his or her parents,the distinction between subparts a and b of section,subdivision b is a reasonable one.as the court in marshall,supra,th at page,d,observed,subparts a and b are similar in that each involve s a court prior removal of another child of the parent but,as the court explained,there is also a key distinction between the two subparts.this distinction relates to whether the parent has previously failed when given a chance at reunification services.ibid.thus,under subpart a,the parent had an opportunity to reunify and failed.therefore,the court selected a permanent plan for the sibling.in other words,in the case of subdivision b a,the parent did not make a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the sibling removal because that parent necessarily failed to reunify.section,subdivision b b anticipates a discrete scenario.subpart b requires a termination of rights but does not condition the termination upon a parent failure to reunify.indeed,the fact that the parent rights over any sibling have been permanently severed does not inescapably establish that the parent failed to make a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the sibling removal i n a case described by subpart a,the court knows as a matter of law that the parent did not make reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to the sibling removal.the same can not be said solely because a parent rights over another child have been permanently severed.marshall,supra,at,d.
as ssa observes,the legislative history of section,subdivision b reveals that subparts a and b were originally drafted as separately numbered paragraphs and were only combined in the shaping of the final form of the amendment to section.see legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,rules,office of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.of the two,only the provision that is now subpart b ever included the requirement of the finding.although the significance of this sequence of events is not free from doubt,we find it reasonable to infer that,in combining into one subdivision the two provisions that are now subparts a and b,respectively,the legislature meant to group together two thematically related scenarios,two distinct kinds of removal of a child from a parent,while still applying different requirements to each.
the parties devote much of their remaining argument to an examination of technical aspects of the wording and punctuation of the statute,matters that we find less significant than its legislative history and evident purpose,as discussed above.
first,renee argues that because both subpart a and subpart b of section,subdivision b refer to a sibling or,and the reasonable effort clause also refers to a sibling or,the principle in wholesale dealers national,supra,cal d at page,dictates that the latter clause refers to both subparts.undercutting this argument,however,is the fact that as renee acknowledges both subpart a and the reasonable effort clause,but not subpart b,refer to a removed sibling.obviously,the reasonable effort clause must apply,at a minimum,to subpart b.the repetition or absence of certain words or phrases within the various parts of section,subdivision b,therefore,does not dictate the interpretation renee urges.
citing board of trustees judge d,footnote,renee further argues that the legislature use of a comma to separate the reasonable effort phrase from the antecedent phrases signifies it intended the phrase to apply to all antecedents rather than only the last.she also observes that the legislature,after the enactment of section,subdivision b but before its effective date,amended the statute to add that comma stats,ch,the initial version of the statute not having included it stats,ch.we agree generally that the presence or absence of commas is a factor to be considered in interpreting a statute see board of trustees judge,supra,at,fn,but find this principle not to be dispositive in the present case.inasmuch as a comma properly joins the independent clauses of subpart b regardless of the existence of subpart a,the inference that,by so amending the statute,the legislature meant the reasonable effort clause to apply to both subparts arises only weakly,if at all,and the history of the provision,as discussed above,tends to refute it 
pointing out that courts are to avoid interpretations that render some words surplusage moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,renee contends ssa interpretation of section,subdivision b runs afoul of this principle.she reasons that ssa justifies its discrepant treatment of the parent who previously has failed at reunification with other siblings,facts triggering the application of subpart a,the parent whose rights over another sibling had been permanently severed,facts triggering the application of subpart b,by equating the parental failure to complete a prior service plan,leading to a termination of services subpart a,with the failure to make a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of the sibling.but the statute,according to renee,contemplates that such effort be made subsequently to the court order,an impossibility under ssa reading,inasmuch as the failure to complete the reunification plan necessarily precedes the court order terminating services.renee argument,however,commits the fallacy of assuming its conclusion,only if one accepts the premise that the reasonable effort clause applies to subpart a does the referent for subsequently become an issue.but even were we to accept that premise,we disagree that the efforts must be made subsequent to the termination order.rather,the statute by its terms refers to efforts subsequently made to treat the problem that led to removal of the child from the parents,which removal,in the case of subpart a cases,occurs before services are provided or terminated.see marshall,supra,th at,d.
in sum,we interpret the clause as applicable only to subpart b of section,subdivision b if we have failed to discern correctly the legislature intent in enacting the statute,that body may clarify the statute accordingly 
renee contends the interpretation of section,subdivision b that we embrace in this case violates due process.her argument is twofold procedural due process is denied by the statute failure to place the burden on ssa to demonstrate the parent unworthiness to receive reunification services,and substantive due process is violated by its exclusive reliance on the parent problematic history and corresponding failure to require proof of the parent current unfitness.we address each contention in turn.
for her procedural due process claim,renee relies on santosky kramer,d santosky,in which the united states supreme court held unconstitutional a new york statute permitting termination of parental rights based on a finding of permanent neglect made by a mere preponderance of the evidence.because of the fundamental nature of the rights at stake and the irreparable harm an erroneous decision to terminate them would cause,as compared with the lesser societal costs of an erroneous decision to postpone their termination,the high court determined that the federal constitution imposes a heightened standard,that of clear and convincing evidence.santosky,supra,at.
renee also distinguishes cynthia superior court cal th,d,cynthia,in which this court rejected a parent argument that california child dependency scheme violates due process by allowing termination of parental rights based on a finding by a mere preponderance of the evidence that return of the child to parental custody would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child.in cynthia,we held that,in the context of the entire process for terminating parental rights under the dependency statutes,the proof requirements at the selection and implementation hearing held pursuant to section comport with due process because the precise and demanding substantive and procedural requirements the petitioning agency must have satisfied before it can propose termination are carefully calculated to constrain judicial discretion,diminish the risk of erroneous findings of parental inadequacy and detriment to the child,and otherwise protect the legitimate interests of the parents.at this late stage in the process the evidence of detriment is already so clear and convincing that more can not be required without prejudice to the interests of the adoptable child,with which the state must now align itself.cynthia,supra,at,d.
at issue in both santosky and cynthia was the quantum of proof required for termination of parental rights,which indisputably are fundamental in nature.santosky,supra,at.here,in contrast,renee parental rights have not been terminated.renee assumes,but fails to establish,the foundational premise that she possesses a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the state providing her with reunification services.the courts of appeal that have addressed this question have held to the contrary.in re baby boy,supra,th at,d in re christina d.although renee may be understood to argue that reunification services constitute her only opportunity to reunify with sayrah,and thus that a denial of services is tantamount to a slow termination of her rights,in our view the present state of the record does not enable this court to draw such a conclusion.for example,a petition pursuant to section remains an available mechanism by which to modify the juvenile court previous orders,given some sufficiently compelling new evidence or change of circumstances.
in any event,as ssa points out,even in the face of a finding under section,subdivision b,the juvenile court may still order reunification services if it finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interest of the child,subd.c.thus,contrary to renee and amicus curiae california public defenders association substantive due process argument,evidence of a parent current fitness may,in appropriate circumstances,persuade the juvenile court to order reunification services despite his or her problematic history 
we are satisfied that,given the weighty interests of the state in assuring the proper care and safety of children in the dependency system,and those of the children themselves,this provision sufficiently diminishes the risk of erroneous deprivations of services as to satisfy the requirements of due process.see cynthia,supra,cal th at,d.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.
when a child is removed from a parent custody as part of a dependency proceeding welf,the juvenile court must normally order the social services agency to provide reunification services to the child and the parent.without such services,a parent whose child has been removed has little hope of ever regaining custody of the child.
but reunification services need not be provided in certain instances specified by statute.subdivision b of section section b describes two such instances when past efforts at reunification proved unsuccessful after removal of another child,and when parental rights to another child have been severed.a clause at the end of section b states that reunification services must nonetheless be afforded if the parent has made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the other child removal.at issue here is whether this clause the reasonable effort clause applies only when parental rights to the other child were severed,or whether it also applies when reunification services were unsuccessfully provided after removal of the other child.
the majority concludes that the reasonable effort clause applies only when parental rights were severed.i disagree.
petitioner renee and her boyfriend robert had a long history of drug use and domestic violence.as a result,the orange county social services agency ssa removed their children,anthony and christopher,and renee daughter dylan.after reunification services proved unsuccessful,the superior court terminated the parental rights of renee and robert as to those three children.
thereafter renee and robert had sayrah,the subject of this proceeding,who was born in october.according to renee,she stopped using drugs when she was pregnant with sayrah when sayrah was four months old,renee broke up with robert,taking sayrah with her.two months later she was charged and convicted of burglary and forgery.sentenced to days in jail,she failed to turn herself in to serve her sentence,and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest.when arrested on that warrant in january,she was driving a car.sayrah was in a child safety seat that lacked the required base and was not properly attached.renee told police she was a transient,and she could not name a responsible adult who would care for sayrah during incarceration.
ssa filed a petition asking the superior court to declare sayrah a dependent child.the petition alleged that renee negligence in the matter of the safety seat showed a lack of concern for sayrah safety that renee was unable to care for sayrah because of her history of drug abuse,her criminal history,her incarceration on the bench warrant,and her lack of a permanent residence and that renee had abused or neglected sayrah siblings and there was a substantial risk she would abuse or neglect sayrah.the superior court found the allegations of the petition true.
at the time of the dispositional hearing,renee was separated from robert who had apparently left the state,and there was no evidence that she had resumed using drugs.ssa argued that under section b,it need not provide reunification services to renee because it had afforded them without success after removal of renee other children.the superior court construed section b as entitling renee to reunification services if she had made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of her other children,but it ruled that she had not made such an effort.it therefore refused to order reunification services.
renee filed a petition for writ of mandate in the court of appeal to challenge the superior court ruling.the court of appeal agreed with the superior court that renee was entitled to reunification services if she had made a reasonable effort to treat her problems,but it held that the superior court had abused its discretion when it ruled that renee had not made such an effort.we granted review,limited to the question of whether a parent who made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the previous removal of a child or children may obtain reunification services when another child is later removed in a dependency proceeding.
ii.the statutory scheme 
subdivision a of section sets forth the general rule that a parent whose child has been removed in a dependency proceeding must be afforded reunification services.subdivision b of that section lists the relatively extreme or unusual circumstances in which reunification services are not required.these circumstances include death of a sibling from abuse or neglect,severe sexual abuse or physical harm,repeated physical or sexual abuse,parental conviction of a violent felony,and willful abduction of the
