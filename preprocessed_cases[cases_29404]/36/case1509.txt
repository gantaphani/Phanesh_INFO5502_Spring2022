under california rules of professional conduct,rule rule an attorney may not accept a new representation of multiple clients when there exists a potential conflict of interest between those prospective clients,and must withdraw from an existing representation of multiple clients when an actual conflict of interest arises among those existing clients.rule,subds.c.with these fundamental precepts as guideposts,we examine whether and to what extent the legislature addition of new subdivision c e to welfare and institutions code section requires the trial court to grant the motion by multiple minors current attorney to be relieved as their counsel and to appoint new separate counsel for each minor.
backgrounda.the clients 
in section petitions were filed by the san diego county health and human services agency agency,alleging the seven minor children of norma were within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.the public defender was appointed as counsel for all of the minors.deputy public defender henkels appeared on behalf of all the minors the court sustained the petitions and entered dispositional orders removing custody of the minors from norma and placing them in licensed foster care.henkels continued to appear on behalf of and represent all of the minors throughout the following dependency proceedings.the agency assessments for janet,vanessa and reyna then six,five and three years of age,respectively,who were in the same placement concluded these minors were adoptable.the minor caregiver was not interested in adopting the three girls but would consider legal guardianship.the assessments stated these three girls had lived with their other siblings while in norma custody but had not visited with their other siblings after they had been placed in their current foster home.the assessments concluded the minors would gain more from the stability of adoption than from ongoing contact with their siblings or parents,and recommended termination of parental rights and pursuing adoption as the permanent plan for each.
the agency assessments for francisco,cynthia and adriana then,and years of age,respectively,who were placed together in the same foster home,concluded they were not adoptable because of their ages and the belief it would be detrimental to their if they were separated from each other.they were doing well in their placement,and their current caregiver was willing to accept legal guardianship for each.these three minors were strongly bonded to norma and preferred reunification to either adoption or guardianship.
the agency assessment for jazmin then three,who was placed in the same home as francisco,cynthia,and adriana,concluded jazmin was very closely bonded to cynthia and adriana.however,jazmin was significantly developmentally delayed and her caregiver,although willing to undertake guardianship for francisco,cynthia,and adriana,asked that jazmin be placed in a setting that could better respond to jazmin need for constant supervision and attention.the social worker believed jazmin might be adoptable and recommended that her case be continued for days to complete a further adoptability assessment.
b.the conflict of interest 
at a february pretrial status conference,henkels raised the issue of a conflict of interest regarding continued representation of the minors.on february,henkels filed a written motion and declaration of conflict of interest,seeking to be relieved as counsel for all minors because of the conflict of interest.she averred that because the newly enacted sibling relationship provisions of section,subdivision c e require counsel to consider and advocate on behalf of some of the minors against adoption as a permanent plan while simultaneously considering and advocating on behalf of other of the minors for adoption as a permanent plan,there was an actual,disabling conflict of interest that requires the public defender to discontinue representation of each of the children.at oral argument,henkels elaborated on the conflict.in francisco case,a permanent plan of guardianship was proposed,and he had expressed a wish to maintain a sibling relationship with janet,vanessa and reyna,which is a factor under section,subdivision c e permitting a court to refuse to terminate parental rights to those siblings.however,the permanent plans of adoption recommended for janet,vanessa and reyna would sever that sibling relationship,and therefore francisco should be represented by an attorney untainted by any confidential communication henkels may have obtained from janet,vanessa and reyna,or by any duty henkels owed to janet,vanessa and reyna to consider and advocate that their best interests were served by the stability provided by adoption.
henkels applied the same analysis to the conflict of an attorney representing cynthia or adriana.henkels also noted a distinct,but equally intractable,actual conflict existed with regard to the minors for whom adoption as a permanent plan was recommended.two of those children janet and vanessa had expressed an interest in preserving their sibling relationship,and an attorney for them could therefore consider and counsel them on whether to invoke the sibling relationship exception to advocate against the recommended permanent plans of adoption.however,that attorney should analyze the relative benefits to them independently from confidences he or she may have received from or any duty owed to francisco,cynthia or adriana.henkels noted the issue was even more complicated for the attorney representing reyna,for whom adoption was the recommended plan.reyna tender age prevented her from expressing an informed preference on whether her best interests were served by adoption or by maintaining sibling relationships,and her attorney should evaluate her best interests untainted by any duty to or confidences received from those minors who might wish to maintain their sibling relationship with reyna.
the court denied the public defender motion to be relieved as minors attorney.this petition for writ of mandate followed.
the public defender petition for writ of mandate requests an order directing the trial court to relieve it as counsel for the minors and to appoint separate counsel for each minor.the response filed by the agency agrees the public defender had actual conflicts of interest that required the court to relieve it as minors attorney,but questions whether different counsel is required for each minor.we address the issues serially because we conclude the public defender actual conflicts of interest required the court to relieve it as minors attorney and to evaluate the potential conflicts of interest for purposes of appropriate appointment of new counsel for the minors.
a.an attorney must withdraw from an existing representation of multiple clients when an actual conflict of interest arises among those existing clients 
unless the court finds a minor would not benefit from representation by counsel,a minor is statutorily entitled to appointed counsel in re candida th,d,who may not represent another party whose interests conflict with the child,subd.c.if an appointed attorney is representing multiple minors in a dependency proceeding,and an actual conflict of interest between the minors arises,the attorney is obliged to withdraw from representing the clients rule,subd.c and the court is required to relieve the attorney and appoint new counsel.in re candida,supra in re richard d.
the public defender here represented all seven sibling minors.after the court terminated reunification services and scheduled the section hearing and the assessments recommended adoption as the permanent plan for one or more of the minors,an actual conflict of interest arose among at least some members of the client group.by way of example only,francisco expressed wish to maintain a sibling relationship with reyna requires his attorney to counsel him on whether to invoke section,subsection c e and pursue any rights conferred on him by that section however,the same attorney could not pursue francisco interests by opposing a permanent plan of adoption for reyna on the ground it would sever their sibling relationship,and simultaneously i
