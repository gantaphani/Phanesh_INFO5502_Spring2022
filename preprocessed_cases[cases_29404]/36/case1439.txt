factual and procedural background

after commencing this action on september,plaintiffs filed the operative second amended complaint on april,naming numerous defendants including rodriguez and the county of los angeles the county.as against rodriguez,the complaint pled four causes of action negligence,assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
plaintiffs alleged they suffered unconscionable abuse in rodriguez foster home.they pled rodriguez subjected them to constant beatings,denied them adequate nutrition,which led at least one of the plaintiffs to forage for food in trash cans,tied them to a tree,exploited them and forced them to serve as domestic help in rodriguez household,made them live in a house infested with cockroaches,and left them infested with lice for years.one of the children,at age three,had her leg broken by rodriguez husband and was hospitalized in a body cast.another attempted suicide.
with respect to the issue of their compliance with the claims presentation requirements of health and safety code section,plaintiffs alleged in the complaint they submitted timely claims to the fund on march,and that the claims were rejected on the merits on or about august,
rodriguez demurred.she contended that as to three of the plaintiffs,their status as dependent minors ended on january,so that they were required to file claims with the fund within one year thereof,by january.however,the complaint alleged the plaintiffs filed claims with the fund on march.further,as to the three other plaintiffs,the complaint was silent as to the date their dependent status ended.therefore,the complaint on its face established that plaintiffs failed to file timely claims with the fund,so as to preclude them from maintaining a civil action against rodriguez.
the trial court overruled rodriguez demurrer.the trial court relied,inter alia,on the tolling statute,which provides that if a person entitled to bring an action is under the age of majority,the time of the disability is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action,subd.a.the trial court noted that section,subdivision b of the tolling statute provides the tolling benefit does not apply to an action where there is a requirement that a tort claim under the government code be presented,but there was no such exception in the tolling statute for an action involving a claim against the fund pursuant to the health and safety code 
rodriguez filed the instant petition for writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause why the relief should or should not be granted.
contentions 
rodriguez contends her demurrer should have been sustained without leave to amend because a claim must be submitted to the fund within the applicable period of limitations for the civil action underlying the claim health,subd.b,plaintiffs therefore were required to file their claims against the fund within one year of the injury former,subd,no tolling provision exists in the fund claim filing requirements,and absent a tolling provision the plaintiffs claims were untimely.
