this case presents two issues of first impression.first,we consider whether a peace officer payroll records are personnel records as defined in penal code section,and are therefore subject to the discovery requirements of evidence code sections and,commonly called a motion.second,if payroll records are personnel records,we examine whether there should be an exception to the statutory discovery requirements for marital dissolution proceedings involving the peace officer and his or her spouse.
we answer both questions in the affirmative.the legitimate expectation of privacy recognized and protected by statute includes peace officers payroll records.however,there is nothing legitimate about forcing the spouse of a peace officer to expend unwarranted time,energy and money to obtain those records during a dissolution proceeding.when it comes to domestic relationships,peace officers owe their spouses the same fiduciary duty to reveal financial information as any other citizen of this state.therefore,we deny the petition for writ of mandate.
facts and procedural history 
robert williamson williamson and valerie williamson real party were married on june.they have no minor children.williamson is a peace officer employed by the los angeles police department lapd.
real party filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on august.at that time,she alleged,t he full nature and extent of the parties separate property assets and debts were unknown.she also filed an order to show cause for spousal support,an injunctive order,and a request for attorney fees and costs.on august,real party served a subpoena duces tecum on the discovery section of the lapd risk management division demanding production of williamson payroll records from july,to the current date.the affidavit attached to the subpoena requested the production of eight types of records,including r ecords of all bonuses commissions,records of all payments made to williamson for reimbursement of expenses,records of all monies paid to williamson for any reason whatsoever,records of williamson interest in any retirement plan profit sharing plan,saving plan,stock option purchase plan,records of williamson interest in any insurance plan or program,and records of any monies held in any savings plan,credit union,deferred compensation plan,bonus plan,stock purchase plan,or for any other reason whatsoever.these records were declared to be unavailable to real party through any other source,and relevant to the issues of spousal support and attorney fees 
the subpoena was directed to the city of los angeles controller or its custodian of records,and it required the appropriate person to produce the requested documents or appear in the orange county superior court on september.mable ling,a clerk typist for the lapd,accepted the subpoena duces tecum and forwarded it to analyst eugene mori.
analyst mori,acting pursuant to department policy,sent a waiver of confidentiality form to williamson and a letter,drafted and signed by captain richard bonneau and chief of police martin pomeroy,to real party attorney,joseph shuff iii.the letter explained that the lapd considered payroll records to be personnel records within the meaning of penal code sections and,and pursuant to evidence code section,the requested records were confidential and should not be disclosed except by discovery.the letter also noted stated,if the concerned peace officer is willing to waive right to confidentiality of the records,the department will comply with your subpoena within days of actual receipt of a waiver.the officer has been notified.in addition,the lapd provided an information sheet listing the custodian of records for tax records,and for retirement,deferred compensation,medical insurance,dental insurance,and life insurance benefits.
shuff telephoned mori and left a message stating his opinion that payroll records are not personnel records and therefore should be released.mori conferred with los angeles deputy city attorney alan blackman,who reaffirmed lapd policy.mori returned shuff telephone call,but shuff could not be persuaded.shuff also sent a letter to the lapd legal department,stating the proper response to the subpoena would be a motion to quash and not a letter,payroll records are not personnel records within the meaning of penal code section,and real party would obtain a bench warrant for the arrest of mable ling if the lapd failed to comply with the subpoena.
on september,the lapd failed to produce the documents or appear in court.the court issued a bench warrant for the arrest of mable ling.the city of los angeles petitioner responded to the bench warrant by filing an ex parte motion to recall and quash the warrant and for an order to quash real party subpoena duces tecum.the trial court rejected petitioner argument that the pitchess procedure applied to peace officer payroll records i do think the payroll records need to be the subject of a pitchess motion considering the security terms that the court provides so that the identity,social security numbers,et cetera is not made public.italics added.the court also relied on the fiduciary duty owed divorcing spouses i saying that the personnel records are personnel records and payroll records are payroll records,has nothing to do with williamson except how much money he earns.and in a fiduciary relationship williamson is entitled to it and why should a police officer be anywhere above the law in as we do it in other family law cases.accordingly,the court denied the ex parte motion and signed the bench warrant for mable ling arrest.it held the warrant to allow petitioner time to file a petition for writ of mandate with this court.
on october,petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate requesting an immediate stay of the bench warrant,an order vacating the trial court denial of the ex parte motion,and an order quashing real party subpoena.this court issued a stay prohibiting the trial court from compelling the disclosure of williamson personnel files and the execution of the bench warrant for the arrest of mable ling.we invited real party to file an informal response and address why the filing of a pitchess motion would not provide an adequate remedy at law.we subsequently issued an order to show cause and invited real party to file a formal response and petitioner to reply.following oral argument,we ordered supplemental briefing on two issues the application of certain principles announced in schnabel superior court cal th,d,and whether the case should be remanded to the trial court for the assessment of attorney fees and costs,notwithstanding both parties failure to request them at the time of the hearing on the ex parte motion.
for reasons discussed below,the petition is denied.this court stay as to the bench warrant is to remain in full force and effect until issuance of the remittitur,at which time it is dissolved.the stay prohibiting disclosure of williamson personnel files is dissolved upon the filing of this opinion.we leave the assessment of attorney fees and costs to the sound discretion of the trial court.
procedural objections 
real party first claims petitioner pursued an improper procedural remedy in filing an ex parte motion in response to the court issuance of a bench warrant.we agree.in general,the procedural remedy against a defective subpoena duces tecum that calls for privileged matter is a motion to quash,vacate,recall,or modify the subpoena.code civ,see also witkin,cal.evidence ed.discovery.petitioner failed to appear as directed and,after the issuance of a bench warrant for mable ling,filed an ex parte motion to quash.a properly noticed motion to quash heard on or before the date and time specified would have been the appropriate vehicle for challenging real party subpoena.
but real party is no gleaming example of how to follow proper civil procedure.real party directed her subpoena to the city of los angeles controller or the custodian of records.mable ling received the subpoena,but she is a clerk typist for the lapd.code of civil procedure section requires service be made on the custodian of records or other qualified witness.see also,subd.b.ling capacity to accept the subpoena is unclear from this record.if she received it in her individual capacity,the court bench warrant is void.see chapman superior court d.in addition,it is not clear the city of los angeles controller is the custodian of records for every document requested by real party.nevertheless,these are not jurisdictional issues.therefore,we consider the merits of the petition.
background 
as to the merits of the petition,it is important to briefly discuss the history of the pitchess procedure and the interplay between several statutes to understand the nature of the parties respective positions.
in pitchess,supra,cal d at,a criminal defendant was one of a group of people charged with battery against four deputy sheriffs.the sheriff of los angeles county sought a writ of mandate to prevent a criminal defendant from discovering evidence of the complaining witnesses propensity for violence.ibid.the supreme court discussed the fundamental right of a criminal defendant to a fair trial,which included the right to access information that might be relevant to a potential defense,and the absence of statutory guidelines for discovery in criminal cases.id.at.the high court concluded that trial courts have wide discretion in allowing peace officer personnel files to be discovered after a defendant demonstrate s sufficient good cause under the appropriate standards of criminal procedure,as developed in case authority,to warrant the trial court in compelling discovery.id.at.
in response to pitchess,allegations surfaced that police departments across the state were disposing of potentially damaging records to protect the officers privacy.in,the legislature codified the privilege and developed procedures to protect the privacy interest of peace officers in their personnel records the report by the senate committee on the judiciary indicates that the main purpose of the legislation bill was to curtail the practice of record shredding and discovery abuses which allegedly occurred in the wake of the california supreme court decision in pitchess citation.san francisco police officers superior court d.the legislative purpose behind the enactment of evidence code sections and and penal code sections and was the protection of peace officer personnel records from random discovery by defendants asserting to charges of criminal assault upon a police officer.san francisco police officers superior court d at.
pursuant to evidence code sections and,a party seeking personnel records,or information contained in those records,must follow a specific discovery procedure.the party requesting discovery must file and serve the motion days before the hearing code civ,and give written notice to the governmental agency housing the records,subd.a.the governmental agency must notify the individual whose records are sought.ibid.the motion must include a description of the type of proceeding in which the discovery is sought,the identification of the person seeking the records,the name of the peace officer whose records are being sought,the identity of the governmental agency that houses the records,and the time and place the motion shall be heard,subd.b.it must also include a description of the type of records or information sought and include a ffidavits showing good cause for discovery or disclosure sought,setting forth the materiality thereof to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation and stating upon reasonable belief that the governmental agency identified has the records or information from the records,subd.b.
at the hearing on the motion,the trial court conducts an in camera review of the personnel files,pursuant to evidence code section,subd.b.evidence code section,subdivision b directs the court to exclude from discovery certain specific categories of information,citizen complaints over five years old,and if sought in conjunction with a criminal trial,conclusions of any officer investigating a complaint filed pursuant to section of the penal code,and facts sought to be disclosed which are so remote as to make disclosure of little or no practical benefit,subd.b.in cases where personnel information is disclosed,the court may make any order which justice requires to protect the officer or agency from unnecessary annoyance,embarrassment or oppression,subd.d,and must order that the records disclosed or discovered may not be used for any purpose other than a court proceeding pursuant to applicable law,subd.e.
payroll records are personnel records 
the procedure described applies to peace officer personnel records or information contained in those records.specifically,penal code section,subdivision a,provides peace officer personnel records and records maintained by any state or local agency pursuant to section,or information obtained from these records,are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to sections and of the evidence code.
penal code section defines personnel records as any file maintained under that individual name by his or her employing agency and containing records relating to any of the following a personal data,including marital status,family members,educational and employment history,home addresses,or similar information.b medical history.c election of employee benefits.d employee advancement,appraisal,or discipline.e complaints,or investigations of complaints,concerning an event or transaction in which he or she participated,or which he or she perceived,and pertaining to the manner in which he or she performed his or her duties.f any other information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
petitioner contends payroll information qualifies as personal data or employment history under subdivision a,or,in the alternative,under subdivision f catchall language.real party argues that since the term payroll records does not appear in penal code section,such records are not covered by any provision of the statute.while we disagree with petitioner assertion that payroll records are subsumed within the definition provided in subdivision a,we find merit in petitioner alternative argument.
true,the term payroll records does not appear in the statute.however,o ur role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation,but rather examine the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision,construing its words in context and harmonizing its various parts.citation.alford superior court cal th,d,see also estate of griswold cal th,d.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.people tabb d.
in garden grove police department superior court th,d garden grove,we held a peace officer birth date,although not specifically enumerated in this section,would be personal data within the meaning of penal code section,subd.a.we explained the legislature inclusion of the term similar information signifies its intent to include other things related to the listed items,such as birth dates and social security numbers,which are not expressly listed.garden grove,supra,th at,d.however,payroll records,unlike birth dates,do not constitute similar information to the other data listed in penal code section,subdivision a.
penal code section,subdivision a includes,marital status,family members,educational and employment history,and home address.however,this presents a list of general pieces of information that might be found on any resume or job application,the subdivision a list would include basic status or identifying information about the employee as he or she came to the job.it does not include any information that would be specific to the current job,such as would be found in payroll information.information that is specific to the employee current status as a peace officer would not be similar information to the other information covered by the statute.
however,we are persuaded the garden grove analysis applies with respect to penal code section,subdivision f.in garden grove,we concluded that a birth date would also qualify as personnel records under subdivision f because the disclosure of it or social security numbers could lead to other sensitive information.garden grove,supra,th at,d.a person payroll information itself is sensitive information and would be the type of information to fall within the plain language of the inclusive phrase,information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,subd.f.
payroll information is personal.ask any ordinary reasonable person if he or she would want their payroll information routinely disclosed to parties involved in litigation and one would hear a resounding,no.see braun city of taft d.job classification and salary are deemed personal and capable of causing embarrassment.even though the pay scale of public employees is generally a matter of public record,it is quite a different thing to know with precision another person salary,selection of benefits,and potential retirement income.few records are deemed more personal.of all records kept by employers,it is the disclosure of payroll records that would constitute one of the greatest unwarranted invasions of personal privacy.we conclude payroll records are subsumed within penal code section,subdivision f catchall provision 
evidence code sections and do not apply 
petitioner further claims evidence code sections and are applicable in family law proceedings just as in criminal or civil cases involving peace officer personnel records.real party argues the fiduciary duty spouses owe to one another to disclose financial information in a marital dissolution proceeding creates an exception in this case to the special discovery requirements.additionally,real party contends enforcement of the pitchess procedure would result in a waste of judicial and private resources since the peace officer spouse would be entitled to obtain payroll records.we find real party arguments persuasive.
evidence code sections and,which have been discussed at length,are generally applicable statutes requiring all persons seeking peace officer personnel records to comply with the described procedure.the pitchess procedure is applicable in civil cases.city of hemet superior court th,d county of los angeles superior court d.however,the family code clearly expresses the legislature intent to require financial disclosure as part of the fiduciary duty owed spouses obtaining dissolution of their marriage.
the legislature finds and declares the following a it is the policy of the state of california to marshal,preserve,and protect community and assets and liabilities that exist at the date of separation so as to avoid dissipation of the community estate before distribution,to ensure fair and sufficient child and spousal support awards,and to achieve a division of community and assets and liabilities on the dissolution or nullity of marriage or legal separation of the parties as provided under california law.b sound public policy further favors the reduction of the adversarial nature of marital dissolution and the attendant costs by fostering full disclosure and cooperative discovery.c in order to promote this public policy,a full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which one or both parties have or may have an interest must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties,regardless of the characterization.further codifying the duty to disclose is family code section which states from the date of separation to the date of the distribution of the community asset or liability in question,each party is subject to the standards provided in section,as to all activities that affect the property and support rights of the other party,including,but not limited to,the following activities the accurate and complete disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which the party has or may have an interest or obligation and all current earnings,accumulations,and expenses.the accurate and complete disclosure of all assets and liabilities,fn.added.
the relevant sections in the evidence,penal,and family codes are part of the same system of laws governing the issue in this case.in construing a statute it is necessary to harmonize its provisions with preexisting and companion provisions of the system of laws of which it is a part citation.county of tulare campbell th,d.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.people tabb,supra,d at,quoting,fair employment housing com.cal d.
the parties disagree about how we should harmonize the statutes in this particular discovery matter.essentially the disagreement boils down to whether there should be a judicially created exception to the pitchess procedure for the spouse of a peace officer in the midst of a marital dissolution.if we hold that there is an exception to the evidence code requirements in this case,as real party suggests,then the requirements of the family code are satisfied.the evidence code procedure will not literally be complied with however,the intent of the law will be fulfilled.
the purposes of evidence code sections and are,to make sure that the discovering party has good cause to compel disclosure of the peace officer personnel file,and to filter out irrelevant or extraneous information in order to preserve the peace officer privacy.as originally contemplated and most frequently used,these procedures protect a peace officer privacy interest in his or her personnel records in the context of a criminal case.in the specific case of discovery in a marital dissolution,the spouse of a peace officer would be able to demonstrate good cause to seek the peace officer payroll records.full disclosure of all financial information is essential in determining the equitable division of assets and calculating spousal and child support.furthermore,there will be little need to filter out any irrelevant,extraneous,or unfairly prejudicially information.a peace officer spouse is probably already aware of any matter that would be deemed confidential in other settings.
in contrast to real party position,which accomplishes the letter of one code and the spirit of the other,petitioner argues that there should be no exception to the pitchess procedure in family law cases.petitioner would require strict adherence to the evidence code requirements,even though this adherence would violate the legislative mandate of the family code and the public policy concerns advanced by it.further,strict compliance with the pitchess procedure in marital dissolution cases would not serve any useful purpose.
a divorcing spouse will invariably demonstrate good cause for disclosure of payroll information.we are to avoid an interpretation of statutes which leads to absurd consequences county of tulare campbell,supra,th at,d.and,the consequences of forcing the spouse of a peace officer to comply with the pitchess procedure would be absurd.it appears petitioner failed to count the cost in terms of public and private resources in litigating a pitchess motion every time a spouse seeks a peace officer payroll records in family court.in an era of fiscal conservatism,it is a waste of these resources to force both parties to go through a complex motion procedure to disclose relevant information when the outcome is generally assure
