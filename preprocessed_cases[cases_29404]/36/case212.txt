vicki marie egleston appeals the summary judgment in her adversary proceeding to except from discharge various pennsylvania state court judgments rendered against her,a chapter debtor,leon alan egleston.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
facts and proceedings below 
the ceaseless litigation following the divorce of vicki marie egleston vicki and leon alan egleston alan has once again reached this court.on september,the court of common pleas of westmoreland county,pennsylvania state court entered a consent order to enforce a marital settlement agreement settlement order between the eglestons.the settlement order provided,inter alia,for the payment of alimony and the distribution of property 
six months after the settlement order,on march,alan filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the western district of louisiana.in response,vicki moved to lift the automatic stay as to her claims for alimony and she filed an adversary proceeding under a to contest the discharge of certain obligations under the settlement order.on july,the automatic stay was lifted only for vicki claims for the alimony payments described in paragraph nine of the settlement order.on september,vicki obtained a state court order that adjudged alan in contempt for failure to comply with the settlement order and directed him to pay in alimony arrearages and in attorneys fees.
meanwhile,in her adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,vicki argued that the payments provided for in paragraph eight of the settlement order should also be excepted from alan discharge.the eventual result of that an appeal that provided the first opportunity for this court to address the egleston dispute,see egleston egleston,cir,unpublished was the bankruptcy court judgment on april,that monthly payments of were excepted from alan discharge as alimony under section a.these payments included all of the payments provided for in paragraph nine of the settlement order,see supra note,and an additional five payments considered to be alimony under the provisions of paragraph eight the balance of payments under paragraph eight did not constitute alimony,and therefore vicki claim to that amount was discharged.
alan did not always timely pay his monthly alimony obligations of,and vicki subsequently relied on pennsylvania state court contempt proceedings to force payment a review of the docket entries for the egleston divorce case reveals various state court efforts to ensure that alan met his alimony obligations,including orders,wage attachments,and even imprisonment for contempt.alan generally found himself on the losing side of the state court judgments.specifically,on january,the state court again adjudged alan in contempt of court and noted that vicki lost the marital home through mortgage foreclosure due to alan failure to pay alimony for a considerable period of time.the court was unable to determine vicki damages at that time and so it granted leave for the parties to present additional testimony of losses or credits.the court also noted that alan had failed to pay to vicki the sum of for the sale of his medical practice pursuant to paragraph eight of the settlement order the state court was apparently not informed that the only obligation under paragraph eight that was not discharged by alan bankruptcy was the sum of in the form of five additional monthly alimony payments of.as a result,the state court ordered alan to pay with interest from january.then on june,following a hearing that alan did not attend and at which he presented no evidence the state court again adjudged alan in contempt of court and ordered alan,inter alia,to pay to vicki the following sums a in attorneys fees that vicki incurred in attempts to enforce the settlement order,b for vicki lost equity in real property,c for vicki lost equity in her automobile that was repossessed,d for the value of vicki lost personal property some apparently taken by alan and some sold by vicki when alan alimony payments were not made,and e for vicki costs associated with traveling to louisiana to defend the property settlement agreement in alan bankruptcy.although the litigation has continued to the present day,resulting in many additional orders from the state court the current dispute primarily involves the bankruptcy court treatment of the amounts first awarded by the state court in january and june of.
on october,at alan request,the bankruptcy court reopened alan bankruptcy,and,on november,alan filed an adversary proceeding alleging that vicki violated the injunction of a by bringing state court proceedings to collect alan discharged debts.alan asked the bankruptcy court to void portions of the state court judgments,enjoin vicki from future attempts to collect the obligations of the settlement agreement,find vicki in contempt of court,and award damages and attorneys fees.on june,alan and his current wife,sharon,filed a new bankruptcy petition,which was consolidated with alan bankruptcy.on september,vicki filed an adversary proceeding in the new case,claiming that the state court judgments against alan are not dischargeable.alan adversary proceeding of november,and vicki adversary proceeding of september,were consolidated and alan moved for summary judgment on december.
meanwhile,on september,the state court issued an order that finally acknowledged the bankruptcy and its effect on the earlier state court judgments this order set alan alimony arrearage at concluded that the january,state court order to alan to pay vicki the sum of was related to the settlement agreement equitable distribution provisions that had been discharged in bankruptcy recognized that the judgment for interest accrued on the discharged equitable distribution obligation was similarly defective and noted that the bankruptcy court would have to determine the validity of the other components of the state court judgment of june.
on may,the bankruptcy court granted alan motion and ruled that alan prior bankruptcy discharge caused all of vicki claims,except for the claim for alimony,to be barred by res judicata.the bankruptcy court set as the balance remaining on alan alimony,enjoined the parties from taking actions contrary to its ruling,annulled the state court orders to the extent they are contrary to the bankruptcy court reasons for decision,and dismissed with prejudice all of the parties remaining claims,including alan claim for the damages caused by vicki contempt of court.
vicki appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment.specifically,the district court concluded that alan obligation to pay any of the proceeds from the sale of the medical practice was discharged in the bankruptcy and vicki can not revive her claim to these proceeds.this conclusion dispensed with the amounts awarded in the state court january,order.in its analysis of the amounts awarded by the state court on june,the district court considered the award for compensatory damages separately from the award for attorneys fees.for the compensatory damages,the district court held that the bankruptcy court conclusion that this portion of the award was barred by res judicata was a conclusion of fact that was not clearly erroneous.for the attorneys fees,however,the district court explicitly declined to adopt the bankruptcy court reasoning and instead affirmed the decision to annul the attorneys fees by applying the equitable doctrine of unclean hands.in discussing vicki unclean hands,the district court noted that vicki actions in state court went far beyond an attempt to recover alimony and constituted an attempt to issues that were finalized in the bankruptcy.
alan also appealed to the district court,attempting to revive his claim for damages caused by vicki violation of the permanent injunction of section a.the district court affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of this claim,noting that alan provided no support for his claim for damages and also noting that,because vicki awards were annulled,alan only remedy is the injunctive relief provided by the bankruptcy court.
vicki appeals from the judgment of the district court 
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court is provided under d.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.summary judgment is proper only where,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the court determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact and judgment is proper as a matter of law.in re intelogic trace,cir citation omitted.c.
if we disagree with the lower courts reasons for granting summary judgment,we can nonetheless affirm if other appropriate grounds appear in the record.thompson georgia pacific,cir.
ii.the bankruptcy court judgment and section a 
the bankruptcy court judgment purports to annul any and all orders of the state court that are contrary to the bankruptcy court reasons for decision.we note that congress has not provided bankruptcy courts with the general authority to annul state court orders.instead,section a of the bankruptcy code provides 
a discharge in a case under this title 
voids any judgment at any time obtained,to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under section and 
operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action,the employment of process,or an act,to collect,recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor 
the bankruptcy court granted alan motion for summary judgment after concluding that all of vicki claims,except for her claim to unpaid alimony,were barred by res judicata under the howe tests.our opinion in matter of howe,cir,described the four elements of res judicata.id.at.the principles of res judicata,however,are not directly applicable to the question in this case to what extent are the state court judgments void under section a to answer this question,we focus instead on whether the amounts awarded by the state court represent a determination of the personal liability of the debtor with respect to any debt discharged under section.a.if so,then the judgment is void to that extent.but if not,a federal court can not turn to the principles of res judicata to find void or annul a state court judgment in these circumstances.although we reject the bankruptcy court reasoning in this case,we nonetheless review the record to determine if there are other appropriate grounds for affirming the summary judgment.
iii.the january,award for plus interest 
the january,state court order contains an award that is a perfect example of a judgment that is void under section a.the order directed alan to pay vicki plus annual interest from january.this amount represents the sale of alan medical practice that is described in paragraph eight of the settlement order.all but of alan obligations under paragraph eight were discharged in alan original bankruptcy,and that was explicitly converted by this court into five monthly alimony payments of each.we hold that the january,state court award of plus interest is void under section a as a determination of alan personal liability for a debt discharged under section,and we affirm the summary judgment to the extent it rejects this state court award.
iv.the june,award for 
on june,the state court determined vicki losses associated with alan earlier failure to pay alimony.the state court directed alan to pay vicki,an amount determined from the following sums a for her expenses traveling to louisiana to defend the settlement order in alan bankruptcy,b for her lost equity in foreclosed real property,c for the value of her lost personal property,d for her lost equity in a repossessed automobile,and e in attorneys fees that she incurred enforcing the settlement order.
a.the state court award for attorneys fees is void in part 
the state court in its june,order awarded vicki for attorneys fees incurred in attempts to enforce the marital settlement order.vicki argues that our decision in swate hartwell,cir,stands for the proposition that any state court award for damages based on a debtor failure to pay alimony is also.we disagree with her broad interpretation of swate.in swate,after the first bankruptcy court determined that certain obligations incorporated in swate divorce decree were in the nature of alimony and therefore,swate hartwell won a state court judgment against swate that included damages for child support,alimony,anticipatory breach of the alimony provisions of the divorce decree,and attorneys fees.id.at.swate then filed a second bankruptcy petition and argued that the state court judgment against him was dischargeable.id.the second bankruptcy court disagreed,holding that swate was barred by res judicata from challenging the of this debt because past,present,and future alimony and the attorneys fees and costs related to the prosecution and collection of the same had been explicitly excepted from the prior discharge.id.we affirmed that judgment,noting that r educing alimony obligations to a judgment does not change the substance of the liability for purposes of a even if the form has changed.id.at.
in this case,the bankruptcy court found swate inapplicable because,unlike the judgment in swate first bankruptcy,the judgment in vicki adversary proceeding in alan original bankruptcy did not explicitly except from discharge attorneys fees for collection of alimony.the bankruptcy court noted that the state court award for attorneys fees for collection and enforcement are clearly not within the scope of the final determinations between the eglestons.while this may be accurate,it is not sufficient justification to find void the state court judgment for attorneys fees.we agree with vicki that a bankruptcy court judgment that excepts from discharge a stream of future support payments does not have to explicitly state that attorneys fees related to the collection of those support payments are also excepted from discharge.for the same reason that we treat the reasonable attorneys fees associated with establishing support obligations as an integral part of the support obligations,see matter of hudson,cir matter of dvorak,cir,the reasonable attorneys fees associated with collecting support obligations should also be treated as support obligations.conversely,those attorneys fees associated with collecting discharged debt should be treated as discharged debt.see matter of gober,cir the status of ancillary obligations such as attorney fees and interest depends on that of the primary debt.
the problem with vicki attorneys fees in this case is that some of vicki legal proceedings were legitimate attempts to collect alimony obligations,while some were illegitimate efforts to collect discharged debt.these illegitimate efforts led the district court to conclude that vicki entire award of attorneys fees should be rejected under the equitable doctrine of unclean hands.while the district court explicitly declined to adopt the bankruptcy court analysis regarding attorneys fees,it determined,based on vicki unclean hands,that the bankruptcy court decision to annul the state court award of attorneys fees was the most just and equitable solution to this litigation.while we agree in principle that the judgments below are just and equitable,the role of the federal courts in this case is not to entertain collateral equitable attacks on the state court judgments we must give such judgments full faith and credit with only such exceptions as congress has provided.specifically,under section a,the state court judgment awarding attorneys fees to vicki is void to the extent that those attorneys fees were incurred in the determination of alan liability with respect to discharged debt.because the record is insufficient to allow a determination on this issue,we remand this case to the district court with directions to remand the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings regarding the classification of the state court award of vicki attorneys fees.
b.the state court awards for damages due to lost equity are void 
the state court in its june,order awarded vicki for the loss of equity in the real property located in seven springs,pennsylvania and for the loss in equity in the automobile repossessed by the bank,caused by alan refusal to pay the required alimony payments.the bankruptcy court annulled these awards after finding them barred by res judicata and noting that,unlike the state court judgment upheld in swate,the state court judgment for vicki was not a mere change in the form of the judgment rendered in alan original bankruptcy.the district court affirmed,holding that the bankruptcy court decision that the damages were barred by res judicata was a finding of fact that was not clearly erroneous.because of our earlier conclusion that the principles of res judicata do not apply in these circumstances,we do not address the issues associated with the district court stated standard of review instead,we again focus on whether the state court judgment is void under section a.for these portions of the state court judgment to be void,they must represent alan liability for discharged debt.in other words,vicki claim to these amounts must have arisen.see matter of southmark,cir the meanings of the terms debt and claim are coextensive.vicki argues that her claims for lost equity arose.we disagree.
the definition of claim in the bankruptcy code is very broad.specifically,the code defines claim as a 
a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured or 
b right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment,whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,secured,or unsecured.
the supreme court has explained that congress intended to adopt the broadest available definition of claim.johnson home state bank,d.in southmark we noted,the house and senate reports state that b y this broadest possible definition of the term claim the bill contemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor,no matter how remote or contingent,will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy case.at quoting,sess.and,sess.emphasis added in southmark see also in re national gypsum,the creditor need not have a cause of action that is ripe for suit outside of bankruptcy in order for it to have a claim for purposes of the code.
in lemelle universal,cir,we considered the question of how broad the term claim is under the code.id.at.the issue presented in lemelle was whether a claim for tort liability arose.we first noted that,while some courts have taken the view that a claim does not arise in bankruptcy until a cause of action has accrued under law,other courts have rejected this accrual theory as interpreting the term claim too narrowly.id.we then noted that some courts have determined when a claim arises based on the debtor conduct,that is if a debtor conduct forming the basis of liability occurred,a claim arises under the code when that conduct occurs,even though the injury resulting from this conduct is not manifest at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.id.we then discussed a third approach,by which courts have determined that a claim arises at the time of the debtor negligent conduct forming the basis for liability only if the claimant had some type of specific relationship with the debtor at that time.id.at.following this third approach,we held that the tort liability claim did not arise when the injury occurred more than three years after the petition and there was no evidence of any contact,privity,or other relationship between the parties.id.at.
in this case,the was awarded to compensate vicki for her lost equity in real property that was foreclosed on after vicki failed to make mortgage payments,which to the state a result of alan breach of his obligation to make alimony payments.the record reflects that the foreclosure on vicki real property had commenced prior to alan bankruptcy petition.similarly,the was awarded to vicki for lost equity in an automobile that was repossessed after she failed to make her car payments.the record is clear that alan breached his obligation to make alimony payments prior to filing his petition and that vicki car was up for repossession.under the bankruptcy code broad definition of claim as described above,vicki therefore had claims for this debt.
these claims represented debt that was discharged in alan bankruptcy unless it is excepted from the discharge under section a vicki argues that these amounts are excepted from discharge under section a,or alternatively,under section a.both arguments fail.vicki cites to no cases,nor have we found any,that treat an award of consequential damages for the failure to pay alimony as being in the nature of alimony.in swate,where we upheld the state court judgment as only a change in the form of the previously alimony obligation,we refused to indulge in swate speculation that the state court judgment included consequential damages.at.in this case,there is no speculation required,as these awards are explicitly consequential damages.while they result from alan breach of his obligation to pay alimony,the awards themselves are not in the nature of alimony,maintenance,or support as required by section a instead,the state court judgment awards may well be the type of debt contemplated by section a.unfortunately for vicki,and as the lower courts correctly held,section a is not available to allow vicki to except from discharge any of alan debts that arose prior to the filing of chapter petition on march,therefore,these debts were not excepted from alan discharge.
because these two debts were discharged,the state court judgment awards for and were a determination of alan personal liability with respect to a discharged debt,and are therefore void under section a.
c.the state court award for lost personal possessions is not wholly void 
the state court in its june,order also awarded vicki for lost personal possessions taken by alan contrary to the provisions of the marital agreement order,and the balance which was sold by vicki to live on when alan refused to provide the required alimony payments.as with the other awards,the bankruptcy court annulled this award based on principles of res judicata.we focus instead on the requirements of section a.
this award is considered in the two parts described by the state court.the first part is the amount related to those possessions that the state court found were improperly taken by alan.if this taking occurred,then vicki had a claim and alan liability for such taking represented a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy.on the other hand,if the taking was,then alan liability for such taking is a debt that does not invoke section a.the second part is the amount associated with the property that the state court decided that vicki was forced to sell due to alan failure to pay alimony.vicki testimony indicates that she sold at least some of this property,but if any of the losses associated with this portion of the award were incurred,then alan liability for such losses was a debt that was discharged in his bankruptcy.to the extent the award represents a determination of alan discharged debt,it is void under section a.we remand this issue for a factual determination of how this award breaks down into and claims.
d.the state court award for travel expenses is not void 
the final portion of the state court judgment at issue in this case is the which the june,order awarded to vicki for expenses incurred by vicki in traveling to louisiana to defend the property settlement agreement when alan attempted to discharge the same in bankruptcy.vicki claim for this sum arose and thus alan liability for this sum was not a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy.therefore the state court judgment award for this amount is not void under section a.
to summarize,we affirm the summary judgment to the extent it the state court award of plus interest.in addition,we affirm the summary judgment to the extent that it rejects the state court awards of for lost equity in real property and for lost equity in an automobile.we reverse the summary judgm
