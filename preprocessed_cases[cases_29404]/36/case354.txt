the defendants,six social workers from the missouri division of family services dfs appeal from the district court denial of their motion to dismiss based upon qualified immunity.the defendants have argued that no clear constitutional right existed at the relevant time to protect the plaintiffs liberty interests.for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.
while they were children,the plaintiffs allege they were improperly removed from their mother care and placed in an abusive foster home.as a result,they brought this suit alleging two causes of action.their first claim is that their substantive due process rights were violated when they were placed into an abusive home without prior investigation of the guardians,no supervision was performed during the placement despite numerous specific complaints,and they were not removed from the placement for months despite knowledge of jim huffman violent criminal history.the second claim is that their procedural due process rights were violated when they were removed from their mother without a hearing,were not allowed free contact with their natural parents,and were not provided a guardian ad litem or appointed counsel to represent their interests.the defendants have argued that qualified immunity bars the entirety of this lawsuit specifically,contending at the time of the placement in,the law was not clearly established that state caseworkers had a duty to protect these children.
we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.patterson von riesen,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d footnote omitted.when analyzing the adequacy of a complaint allegations under federal rule of civil procedure b,we must accept as true all of the complaint factual allegations and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.see patterson,at.in order to fully explain the scope of the history of this action,this court provides the following time line of events as submitted in the complaint.

on january,judge byron kinder signed the proposed order and the children were placed with the huffmans.the order further stated dfs must maintain supervision over the children.apparently,notice was not given to either natural parent of the removal of their custody rights nor were the children represented by independent counsel,if in fact an actual hearing ever took place.
no criminal history check or home study of the huffmans was performed prior to the placement of the plaintiffs.prior to january,jim huffman had been convicted of numerous felonies,including a history of sexual assault,rape,and murder.this history included molestation of other members of jean huffman family.

discussion 
missouri child protection laws are facially discretionary.accepting the facts in the complaint as true,it is clear that the defendants in this action were performing discretionary functions,therefore,these government officials are shielded from liability for civil damages in a action unless their actions violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.in determining whether the legal right at issue is clearly established,this circuit applies a flexible standard,requiring some,but not precise factual correspondence with precedent,and demanding that officials apply general,legal principles,cir,cert.denied,d citation and quotation omitted.bearing this in mind,we must determine the following first,whether the plaintiffs procedural due process rights were violated when they were removed from their mother without notice,a hearing or appointed counsel.second,this court must determine whether,in,the law was clearly established that it was a violation of an individuals liberty interest for the state to remove that person from her natural parents and place her in an abusive situation,or in the alternative,whether there was a duty by the state to discover whether the situation was abusive and to remove the individuals from the placement.
procedural due process 
the plaintiffs complaint alleges they were denied their procedural due process rights when counsel was not appointed to them at any reasonable time before or after their removal from their mother care and custody,and when notice or hearing was not given at any relevant time prior to the placement with the huffmans.the defendants ask this court to reverse the district court denial of qualified immunity and dismiss this action.they center their arguments around the notion that the law was not clearly established in,and that they did not exercise the requisite control over the plaintiffs at the time of the abuse.the trial court did not address the procedural due process issue and the defendants did not present argument,either oral or written,on count of the complaint alleging a procedural due process violation.as a result,this issue is not properly before this court and the district court decision on this issue is affirmed.
substantive due process 
the parties exhaustively argued the issue of whether substantive due process violations have been stated by the plaintiffs complaint.the defendants have asserted three arguments that they claim preclude this action.the primary
