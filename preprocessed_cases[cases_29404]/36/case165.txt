opinion of the court 
claudia librett librett and michael marran marran were involved in a protracted custody dispute over their daughter,rachel.after the state proceedings had ended,librett and rachel brought this action,based on the allegations of child abuse that had been made during the custody proceedings.they appeal the order of the district court dismissing their complaint under,younger abstention,and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we will affirm the dismissal,although on somewhat different grounds than those given by the district court.
librett and marran cohabited for a time in new york,but were never married.on may,while they were still living together,librett gave birth to rachel,the couple only child.shortly after rachel birth,marran and librett were involved in an altercation that became physical.as a result of that altercation,marran pled guilty to a state criminal charge of harassment in the second degree,and the parties separated.by consent as approved by the family court in new york,librett was granted sole physical and legal custody of rachel,and marran was allowed supervised visitation with the child.librett was also granted permission to move with rachel to pennsylvania.
after librett and rachel moved to pennsylvania,marran sought to modify his visitations by filing a motion in the court of common pleas of montgomery county.hearings in the matter began in october and continued through may.during this time,marran was permitted seven unsupervised visits,which culminated in an overnight visit from december to december.sometime after may,librett began to suspect that marran had sexually abused rachel.librett filed several complaints of abuse with the montgomery county office of children and youth ocy.she also filed petitions to modify and suspend marran visitations.in response,the court of common pleas suspended marran visitation rights,and ocy conducted an investigation into the allegations.ocy ultimately determined that the allegations of sexual abuse were unfounded.relying on these findings,the court of common pleas reinstated marran visitation rights.on january,the court of common pleas issued a custody order in which it found that there was nothing to substantiate librett allegations that marran had sexually abused rachel,and found that librett was intent on excluding marran from rachel life.the court then awarded joint legal custody to marran and librett,primary physical custody to librett,and partial physical custody to marran.librett appealed the orders lifting suspension of marran visitation rights,denying a subsequent emergency petition based on the same events,and awarding custody.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the orders,including those dealing with the abuse allegations.an appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court is now pending 
rather than wait for the pennsylvania courts to rule on the appeal,librett filed this action in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.librett sought damages from marran on her own and rachel behalf,as well as an injunction prohibiting marran from abusing rachel.the complaint alleged claims for assault and battery,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of implied contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of earnings during minority.in addition,librett and rachel brought a claim under the civil rights act,alleging that the montgomery county defendants had violated librett and rachel constitutional rights by failing to properly investigate the allegations of abuse.the complaint sought monetary damages and a declaration that ocy findings regarding the abuse allegations were null and void,and could not be relied upon for any purpose.
both marran and the montgomery county defendants filed motions to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claims under the doctrine,that the district court should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction,and that the complaint had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.on june,the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over all of the claims under the doctrine.alternatively,the district court held that younger abstention was proper.finally,the district court held that the complaint had failed to state a claim against the montgomery county defendants.this appeal followed.
as a preliminary matter,the montgomery county defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this appeal.they argue that librett is a fugitive from justice and should not be entitled to use this court resources to promote her own ends,when she is unwilling to follow the pennsylvania court custody orders.although it is troubling that librett would blatantly ignore another court orders while seeking relief before this court,we are not convinced that dismissal is warranted,and will deny the motion.
the supreme court has recognized that courts have the power to dismiss a fugitive criminal appeal.see molinaro new jersey,d a fugitive escape disentitles the defendant to call upon the resources of the court for determination of his claims.the supreme court later held,however,that a claimant failure to appear in a criminal case does not permit a district court to grant summary judgment to the government in a related civil forfeiture case.degen united states,d.in addition,it has held that an appellate court does not have the power to dismiss an appeal when a convicted felon who fled after conviction but before sentencing was recaptured before the appeal.united states,d.the supreme court reasoned that,although the fugitive flight acted as an affront to the district court authority,permitting an appellate court to sanction by dismissal any conduct that exhibited disrespect for any aspect of the judicial system,even where such conduct has no connection to the course of the appellate proceedings,would sweep too broadly.id.the court did,however,recognize that dismissal would be appropriate if the fugitive status in some way prejudiced the government status as a litigant,but found that the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit had not articulated such prejudice in dismissing the case.
in the state court proceedings,librett has failed to produce rachel for the visitations required by the custody order.as a result,librett has been held in contempt by the court of common pleas of montgomery county.criminal charges have also been filed against her in montgomery county for interfering with child custody and concealment of the whereabouts of a child,in connection with her refusal to produce rachel under the custody order.although the finding of contempt and the criminal charges are very troubling and relate in part to the events underlying this case,they have no direct effect on the processing of this appeal.even assuming that librett is a fugitive from justice,the montgomery county defendants have not shown that her status as a fugitive would prejudice them in this appeal.we also observe that the affront was to the dignity of the pennsylvania courts,not to this court.dismissing this appeal under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine would expand that doctrine even beyond the scope rejected by the supreme court in.moreover,the fact that librett is not acting solely in her own capacity,but is also representing rachel interests,complicates the prospect of dismissal on this basis,as it would not be fair to penalize rachel based on her mother fugitive status.we will deny the montgomery county defendants motion to dismiss the appeal.
the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine.we exercise plenary review over the decision to grant the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.focus allegheny county court of common pleas,cir.
the doctrine bars lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over a case that is the functional equivalent of an appeal from a state court judgment.rooker fidelity trust.district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.a case is the functional equivalent of an appeal from a state court judgment in two instances when the claim was actually litigated before the state court or when the claim is inextricably intertwined with the state adjudication.itt corporation intelnet international corporation,cir.as we recently noted,almost any claim that is actually litigated will also meet the inextricably intertwined test.id.unless the federal claims are identical to the state court claims,determining whether the claims have been actually litigated is more difficult than determining whether the claims are inextricably intertwined with the state judgment.id.at.thus,we will begin by determining whether the current claims are inextricably intertwined with the custody determination.
a claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court adjudication when federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong.parkview city of lebanon,cir.applies only when in order to grant the federal plaintiff the relief sought,the federal court must determine that the state court judgment was erroneously entered,or must take action that would render the state judgment ineffectual.focus,at.
to determine whether a particular claim for federal relief is inextricably intertwined with a prior state court decision,this court looks at the questions of state law that the state court was required to reach in order to render its decision.desi pizza city of,cir.pennsylvania law requires that courts consider the preference of the child as well as any other factor which legitimately impacts the child physical,intellectual and emotional in determining custody.a.ongoing sexual abuse,as well as continued association with a past abuser,would unquestionably impact a child.in addition,the state court is required to consider each parent and adult household member present and past violent or abusive conduct in determining custody.id.at c.in other words,the court of common pleas had to consider and adjudicate the allegations of sexual abuse in reaching its determination that marran was entitled to joint legal custody and partial physical custody of rachel.
librett argues that the court of common pleas refused to adjudicate the issue of whether rachel had been sexually abused,because the judge in the custody matter deferred to the findings of the investigation conducted by ocy,rather than conduct a separate hearing on the matter.in the custody order,however,the judge explicitly discounted the opinions of librett experts regarding the alleged abuse,determined that reports of rachel behavioral problems after the overnight visit were a result of librett reaction to the visit rather than to any abuse,and discounted the idea that an incident of abuse took place during supervised visit.in making these determinations,the judge considered the reports of a neutral third party,the therapist chosen by librett to supervise the visits between marran and rachel.in those reports,the therapist noted that rachel responded well to marran and gave no indication that anything was wrong.the judge further found that,although marran may have made mistakes as a new father,the program of supervised visitation and therapy had made him a better father,and a strong bond existed between him and rachel.in addition,the judge referred to the findings of ocy that the allegations of abuse were unfounded,and noted that no new allegations of abuse had been made.the fact that no additional hearings were held does not mean that the issue was not adjudicated.indeed,under pennsylvania law the judge was required to adjudicate the issue of whether the abuse had occurred,because he was required to consider a parent abusive conduct in making the custody determination.see.a.whether the judge erred in not holding a hearing,accepting other evidence,or allowing additional testimony after may is an issue that must be decided by the pennsylvania courts through the appeals process.
the claims in this case fall into three categories librett claims against marran rachel claims against marran and the claims against the montgomery county defendants.librett claims against marran present the most straightforward application of.librett seeks damages for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of implied contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of earnings during minority.all of these claims are based on the alleged abuse of rachel.in order for librett to succeed on these claims,the district court would have to find that the court of common pleas erred in deciding that the allegations of abuse were unfounded.as such,the claims are inextricably intertwined with the state court adjudication and the district court was correct in finding it lacked jurisdiction over these claims.
librett also argues that does not bar the claims against marran,because she and rachel are seeking an injunction against further abuse and damages for past abuse,not modification of the custody order.even assuming that it is true that no modification of the custody order would occur because of an injunction or an award of damages,granting an injunction or award of damages against marran would require this court to find that the court of common pleas erred in finding that the abuse allegations were unfounded.bars all of librett claims against marran.
rachel claims against marran present a slightly more complicated issue.generally,does not bar claims by persons who were not parties to the underlying state action.valenti mitchell,cir.as we have noted,t his limiting principle of the doctrine has a close affinity to the principles embodied in the legal concepts of claim and issue preclusion.exxon mobil saudi basic industries,cir quoting valenti,at.for example,as with claim preclusion and issue preclusion,bars actions brought by parties in privity with the parties in the state action.id.
privity is merely a word used to say that the relationship between one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include that other within the res judicata.eeoc united states steel,cir quoting bruszewski united states,cir.one relationship long held to fall within the concept of privity is that between a nonparty and party who acts as the nonparty representative.id.even if a child is not a party to a custody action her federal claims will be barred if the child is in privity with the named parties her parents.
rachel was not a named party in the underlying custody proceeding.the pennsylvania supreme court has never ruled that a child is a party to her own custody hearing,and it is unclear whether a child who is the subject of a custody hearing is in privity to her parents.a recent superior court decision has held,however,that three boys could not intervene in their own custody action in order to assert their own interests.frank frank.in frank,the superior court reasoned that there is no need for a child to intervene in his or her own custody proceeding because the child interests are the subject of the hearing,and allowing such an intervention would be ineffectual as being redundant.id.it then held that the boys claims were barred by collateral estoppel,as they had already been addressed and decided in the custody hearing.id.
other states have similarly held that there is no need to make children parties to the custody litigation,either through intervention or other means.see,auclair auclair,miller miller,me hartley hartley,leigh aiken,so d.in some of those cases,the court relied on the availability of a guardian ad litem to represent the children interests.see,auclair,at miller,at hartley,at.in other cases,no guardian ad litem was involved,and only the parents were parties to the action.leigh,so d at court did not err in not appointing guardian ad litem,when none was requested and the nature of custody proceedings is already protective of the child interests.
in all of the cases,the courts recognized that the child best interests were the guiding force in the custody determination and reasoned those interests were already adequately represented,whether by an appointed guardian ad litem or by the parents and court.courts have generally recognized that a child interests in a custody dispute are represented by the parents,even when the child makes no motion to intervene.see generally,smith organization of foster families for equalit
