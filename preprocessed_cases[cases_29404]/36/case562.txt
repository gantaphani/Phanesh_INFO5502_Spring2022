terrold bean claims the right to inherit the intestate estate of arthur patrick ford as ford equitably adopted son.the superior court denied the claim,and the court of appeal affirmed the denial,for lack of clear and convincing evidence that ford intended to adopt bean.after reviewing california case law on equitable adoption,we conclude that no equitable adoption is shown unless the parties conduct and statements clearly and convincingly demonstrate an intent to adopt.we will therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
born in,bean was declared a ward of the court and placed in the home of ford and his wife,kathleen ford,as a foster child in.bean never knew his natural father,whose identity is uncertain,and he was declared free of his mother control in,at the age of four.bean lived continuously with and ford and their natural daughter,mary catherine,for about years,until ford death in,then with ford and mary catherine for another two years,until.
during part of the time bean lived with the fords,they cared for other foster children and received a county stipend for doing so.although the fords stopped taking in foster children after ford became ill with cancer,they retained custody of bean.the last two other foster children left the home around the time of ford death,but bean,who at years of age could have left,stayed with ford and mary catherine.
bean knew the fords were not his natural parents,but as a child he called them mommy and daddy,and later mom and dad.joan malpassi,mary catherine friend since childhood and later administrator of ford estate,testified that bean relationship with mary catherine was as two siblings and that the fords treated bean more like mary rather than a foster son,like a real son was my observation.mary catherine later listed bean as her brother on a life insurance application.
bean remained involved with ford and mary catherine even after leaving the ford home and marrying.ford loaned bean money to help furnish his new household and later forgave the unpaid part of the debt when bean marriage was dissolved.bean visited ford and mary catherine several times per year both during his marriage and after his divorce.when ford suffered a disabling stroke in,mary catherine conferred with bean and malpassi over ford care ford was placed in a board and care facility where bean continued to visit him regularly until his death in.
mary catherine died in.bean and malpassi arranged her funeral.bean petitioned for malpassi to be appointed ford conservator,and with malpassi agreement bean obtained a power of attorney to take care of ford affairs pending establishment of the conservatorship.bean also administered mary catherine estate,which was distributed to the ford conservatorship.when a decision was needed as to whether ford should receive medical life support,malpassi consulted with bean in deciding he should.when ford died,bean and malpassi arranged the funeral.
the fords never petitioned to adopt bean.ford told barbara carter,a family friend,that they wanted to adopt terry,but she was under the impression that she could not put in for adoption while he was in the home.she worried that if bean was removed during the adoption process he might be put in a foster home that was safe.
ford nearest relatives at the time of his death were the two children of his predeceased brother,nephew john ford iii and niece veronica newbeck.neither had had any contact with ford for about years before his death,and neither attended his funeral.john ford iii filed a petition to determine entitlement to distribution,listing both himself and newbeck as heirs.bean filed a statement of interest claiming entitlement to ford entire estate under probate code sections foster child heirship and equitable adoption as well as sections,subdivision a and.
after trial,the superior court ruled against bean.probate code section requirement of a legal barrier to adoption was unmet,since the fords could have adopted bean after his mother parental rights were terminated in.the doctrine of equitable adoption,the trial court found,was inapplicable because there is no evidence that ford ever told bean or anyone else that he wanted to adopt him nor publicly told anyone that bean was his adopted son.there was thus no clear and convincing evidence of an intent to adopt.
bean appealed only on the equitable adoption issue.the court of appeal affirmed,agreeing with the trial court that equitable adoption must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.moreover,the reviewing court held,any error by the trial court in this respect would be harmless because the evidence did not support equitable adoption on any standard of proof for the same reasons articulated by the trial court.
we granted bean petition for review.
discussion 
chapter of part of division of the probate code,sections to,defines the relationship for purposes of intestate succession.section,subdivision b provides that such a relationship exists between adopting parents and the adopted child.section,subdivision a provides that the relationship exists between a child and a presumptive parent under the uniform parentage act.section delineates the circumstances in which a foster parent or stepparent is deemed a parent for the purpose of succession,requiring both a personal relationship beginning during the child minority and enduring for the child and parent joint lifetimes,and a legal barrier but for which the foster parent or stepparent would have adopted the child.see generally estate of joseph cal th,d.finally,section provides in full nothing in this chapter affects or limits application of the judicial doctrine of equitable adoption for the benefit of the child or the child issue.we therefore look to decisional law,rather than statute,for guidance on the equitable adoption doctrine proper scope and application.
criteria for equitable adoption 
in its essence,the doctrine of equitable adoption allows a person who was accepted and treated as a natural or adopted child,and as to whom adoption typically was promised or contemplated but never performed,to share in inheritance of the foster parents property.the parents of a child turn him over to foster parents who agree to care for him as if he were their own child.perhaps they also agree to adopt him.they do care for him,support him,educate him,and treat him in all respects as if he were their child,but they never adopt him.upon their death he seeks to inherit their property on the theory that he should be treated as if he had been adopted.many courts would honor his claim,at least under some circumstances,characterizing the case as one of equitable adoption,or adoption by estoppel,or virtual adoption,or specific enforcement of a contract to adopt.clark,the law of domestic relations in the united states ed.the doctrine is widely applied to allow inheritance from the adoptive parent at least jurisdictions have so applied the doctrine,while only have declined to recognize it in that context,modern status of law as to equitable adoption or adoption by estoppel.
a california court first recognized the doctrine,albeit in the atypical context of inheritance through the adoptive parent,in estate of grace d.a california couple had taken custody of and raised a texas girl,edna grace,having recorded in texas a statement that they hereby adopt the child,who was to be their heir and a member of our family,with all the rights and privileges as if born to us.id.at.although texas adoption law at that time did not recognize inheritance from an adoptive grandparent through an adoptive parent id.at,the california court upheld grace daughter entitlement to inherit from her adoptive grandparents as a matter of contract the parents had offered to adopt grace and make her a full member of their family,and t he child,by living with them as a member of the family,accepted the offer,creating a contract concluded and performed in california.estate of grace,supra,at.quoting from a treatise,the appellate court noted that the courts,in their effort to protect and promote the welfare of the child,have given effect to a contract to adopt,where it has been fully performed on the part of the child,although it was invalid under the laws where it was made.id.at.
this court decided its only case relating to equitable adoption nine years later.estate of radovich,supra,cal d.the question before us was not whether the child could inherit as an equitable final superior court decree established that he the child status,for purposes of inheritance taxation,as either the decedent adopted child or a stranger in blood to the decedent.id.at.the majority took the former view,but its opinion rested on the in rem character of the superior court probate decree and did not address the contours of the equitable adoption doctrine.id.at.
justice schauer dissenting opinion,however,addressed the equitable adoption doctrine at some length,concluding the child took solely by virtue of an unperformed contract of adoption and thus as a stranger in blood.estate of radovich,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of schauer.citing authority,justice schauer explained when the child takes property in such a case it is as a purchaser by virtue of the contract citation and by way of damages or specific performance citations the child shares in the estate of the deceased foster parent as though his own child but not as such.in order to do justice and equity,as far as possible,to one who,though having filled the place of a natural born child,through inadvertence or fault has not been legally adopted,the court enforces a contract under which the child is entitled to property,declaring that as a consideration on the part of the foster parents a portion of their property will pass on their death to the child.id.at.
although expressed in a dissenting opinion,justice schauer explanation of the doctrine has been widely cited and relied upon by the courts of appeal.estate of rivolo d.presented the issue in the straightforward context of intestate succession from the adoptive parent.the child was an orphan when the foster parents took her in and told her that she would live with them and be their little girl,an arrangement she said pleased her.id.at.the foster parents took the child to the courthouse,where they took out letters of guardianship but told the child she was being adopted.thereafter they referred to her as their adopted daughter.as a child,the daughter helped them in their business,and even after her marriage they remained exceedingly close.id.at.
citing estate of radovich,supra,cal d,the rivolo court held it well established that equity will specifically enforce an oral contract to adopt and found that the record establishes the existence of a contract of adoption and respondent part performance thereof by clear,convincing and unequivocal evidence.it is uncontroverted that the respondent was at all times regarded and treated as the adopted daughter of the rivolos that they told her and others on numerous occasions that she was legally adopted and would be their sole heir.estate of rivolo,supra,d at.u nder the circumstances,equity demands recognition of her lifelong status as an adopted child of frank rivolo and her inheritance rights citations.id.at.
estate of wilson d.also presented the question of intestate succession from the adoptive parent.the child,born in a home for unwed mothers,was placed with foster parents who petitioned to adopt him.the adoption petition was dismissed,however,because the natural mother consent could not be obtained although the court record refers to an abandonment petition to be filed,the foster parents did not pursue that remedy and apparently made no further efforts to adopt.they nonetheless told the child he was adopted and treated him in all respects as their son their relationship remained warm and familial until the deaths of both parents.id.at.following both estate of rivolo and estate of radovich,the appellate court regarded the issue as one of the right of an equitably adopted child to inherit by virtue of contract estate of wilson,supra,at.and found substantial evidence that,according to the authority,the wilsons and keith had entered into a contract of adoption which was faithfully adhered to by them id.at.
in estate of bauer d,an inheritance tax case,the court found insufficient evidence of equitable child did not live with the asserted parents either as a minor or for any extended time as an adult,and did not assume any duties normally associated with a relationship id.at.but aptly summarized the doctrine as it had developed in california e quitable adoption requires some form of agreement to adopt,coupled with subsequent objective conduct indicating mutual recognition of an adoptive parent and child relationship to such an extent that in equity and good conscience an adoption should be deemed to have taken place.id.at.
in mingo heckler cir,the federal court expanded on bauer analysis,distilling from the california decisions factors tending to show mutual recognition of a parent and child relationship t he adoptee lived with the adoptive parent for a number of years the adoptee assumed the adoptive parent surname the adoptive parent told the adoptee that he or she was adopted the adoptive parent publicly acknowledged the adoptee as his or her child the adoptee considered and conducted himself or herself as a natural child the adoptee worked or performed services for the adoptive parent and the adoptive parent attempted legally to adopt or obtained guardianship papers for the child.because the factors are merely examples of the type of conduct demonstrating an adoptive parent and child relationship,the claimant need not demonstrate that she satisfies every factor.id.at.the court held that the child,who had lived with her grandmother and the grandmother cohabitant from infancy,was entitled to social security benefits as the cohabitant equitably adopted child.id.at.
as reflected in this summary,california decisions have explained equitable adoption as the specific enforcement of a contract to adopt.yet it has long been clear that the doctrine,even in california,rested less on ordinary rules of contract law than on considerations of fairness and intent for,as justice schauer put it,the child should have been adopted and would have been but for the decedent inadvertence or fault.estate of radovich,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of schauer,italics omitted.in the earliest case,estate of grace,the court quoted a new mexico case explaining why specific performance was an unrealistic description of equitable adoption a specific performance of a contract to adopt is impossible after the death of the parties who gave the promise.equity was driven to the fiction that there had been an adoption.that fiction being indulged,the case was not one of specific performance.estate of grace,supra,d at,quoting wooley shell petroleum corporation.in both estate of rivolo,supra,d,and estate of wilson,supra,d,moreover,the contracts purportedly being enforced were made between foster parents and their minor charges,yet neither court addressed the children capacity to contract,suggesting,again,that the contract served mainly as evidence of the parties intent,rather than as an enforceable legal basis for transmission of property 
bean urges that equitable adoption be viewed not as specific enforcement of a contract to adopt,but as application of an equitable,restitutionary remedy he has identified as or,as his counsel emphasized at oral argument,as an application of equitable estoppel principles.while we have found no decisions articulating a theory,courts in several states have,instead of or in addition to the contract rationale,analyzed equitable adoption as arising from a broader and vaguer equitable principle of estoppel.clark,the law of domestic relations in the united states,supra,at.bean argues ford conduct toward him during their long and close relationship estops ford estate or heirs at law from denying his status as an equitably adopted child.
for several reasons,we conclude the california law of equitable adoption,which has rested on contract principles,does not recognize an estoppel arising merely from the existence of a familial relationship between the decedent and the claimant.the law of intestate suc
