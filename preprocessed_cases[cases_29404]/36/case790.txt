discussion 
whether the trial court erred in determining that is a parent of and is governed by the uniform parentage act upa et the upa defines the p arent and child relationship as the legal relationship existing between a child and the child natural or adoptive parents.under the upa,a woman is presumed to be the natural mother of a child if she receives the child into h er home and openly holds out the child as h er natural child.d.a wo man who claims entitlement to presumed mother status has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts supporting h er entitlement.citation.the family code section d presumption,once it arises,may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.in re th,quoting,subd.a.
we review the trial court factual findings,including its findings that received the children into her home and openly held them out as her natural children,under the substantial evidence standard.charisma,th at in re th.under that standard,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment citations.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.charisma,supra,th at.to the extent we are called upon to review the trial court legal interpretation of the receiving and holding out requirements set forth in section d,we shall exercise our independent legal judgment.see ghirardo antonioli cal th.we review the trial court determination that there is no basis to rebut the parentage presumption for abuse of discretion.charisma,supra,th at.
the trial court did not err in finding that received the children into her home 
contends failed to satisfy the receiving requirement because she never brought the children into her own house.argument is premised on the fact that the children did not live with or regularly visit at her separate residence.as we shall explain,there is ample evidence to support the trial court finding that home served as the family home,and that received the children into their joint home.
prior to birth,spent virtually every night at.the parties were together when attempted to conceive through artificial insemination,and was present for the ups and downs of that process.when that process proved unsuccessful,asked to help pay for her to have in vitro fertilization,which initially refused to do.later,agreed to help pay for the procedure,but by then,had decided to adopt a child,with encouragement and support.accompanied to redding for birth,and after they returned to sacramento,she continued to spend three to four nights a week at home,sleeping in bed and helping to care for on the nights she did not sleep there,she stopped by after work to see and assist in his care.since that time,has remained active in life,except for those periods when prohibited her from seeing him.
while and were not together when was born,continued to go to on weeknights and on weekends to spend time with and care for,which inevitably included helping to care for.when the parties reconciled in,resumed sleeping at at least three to four nights a week and was there after work on the nights she did not spend the night,assisting in the children care.since that time,has remained active in life,except for those periods when prevented her from seeing the children.
that also maintained a separate residence does not undermine the court finding that she received the children into her home.in in re,supra,th at page,the court adopted an expansive interpretation of the receives requirement,holding that the trial court erred in refusing to find a man a presumed father under section d even though the child never actually lived with him.the court reasoned that when a mother and father of a child are not inclined to live with each other,their child often lives with only one of the parents and visits the other although the minor was not received into home to live with him on a basis,he was involved with the minor from the very beginning,with mother blessing w hen his own son,came to visit him,so also did the minor child,whom the record shows was bonded with additionally,provided financially for the minor needs,buying her clothes,toys and food,and other essentials.ibid.
the same is true here.while did not live with and the children on a basis,she slept at more than half the time,and was there most other nights and on weekends.she cared for both children from the very beginning,with blessing,and provided for them financially.
argues the trial court erred in relying on the fact that spent most nights at because would have stayed there regardless of her parentage claim.in in re spencer th,the court found substantial evidence supported the trial court rejection of a man claim to presumed father status where t he evidence permitted the conclusion that mother permitted the man to reside in her home,and that the man residence with the child was not demonstrative of the man commitment to the child but reflected that he acted out of personal convenience and.id.at,italics omitted.such evidence included the following mother paid for the apartment and apparently most other expenses she supported the man,who was unemployed and when mother funding ceased the man stopped residing with the child.ibid.
in contrast,here,was not financially dependent upon.she maintained a separate residence but chose to stay at,at least in part,to be with and help care for the children.indeed,after broke up with in,she continued to go to house after work and on weekends to spend time with and help care for.as the trial court found,this is not a case where a person cared for the children of someone she was dating just because she happened to be dating the other.it actually quite the reverse.the relationship between the parties lasted longer than it otherwise would have for the sake of the children and because was devoted to the children.this is not a case where just cared for the kids because it was convenient or because of.made personal,professional and financial sacrifices to care for the children.a person occasionally spending the night on the couch would not do all of the things did would not clean up the children vomit,set up college accounts,pay for their therapy,volunteer at the school,name the children as beneficiaries,and act in the myriad of other ways did,as a parent.
we likewise reject assertion that the trial court finding created an exception to the receiving requirement under what it called a blended home theory pursuant to which regular overnight stays at house sufficed.the trial court found,under the totality of the circumstances,including the fact that spent at least three to four nights a week at,that house served as the parties joint home,and thus,received the children into her home.as previously discussed,the trial court did not err in so finding.
the trial court did not err in finding that openly held and out as her natural children 
contends there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court finding that openly held and out as her natural children as we shall explain,there is ample evidence to support the trial court finding.
the parties were in a committed relationship during the time sought to conceive and then adopt.told that she would support her and a child should be fortunate enough to have one.paid for the updated home study for adoption.she took time off from her job to be present for birth and told her supervisor the reason for her absence.she accompanied to redding for birth and waited at the hospital until he was born.she flew to minnesota following birth to help care for.when returned to sacramento following birth,helped care for both children.she allowed to use her middle name as part of middle name.she displayed pictures of and the children in her cubicle at work for everyone to see.she brought and the children to work related functions typically attended by family.she regularly worked at school,attended back to school nights,and other school events.she attended all of baseball games and most practices.she named the children as beneficiaries on everything she had.she went on numerous family vacations with and the children.she took and the children to visit her family in texas numerous times.parents considered and treated and as their grandchildren.parents took,the children,along with the rest of their family,on a cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary spent christmas holidays with,and the children and contributed to the children education savings accounts as they did for their other grandchildren.had participate in the ceremony recognizing her promotion to the rank of colonel,an honor reserved for family,in front of numerous friends and.and the children gave mother day cards year after year.
while may not have intended for to obtain any legal rights to the children,the record is replete with evidence that she not only allowed,but encouraged,to both children from the beginning.among other things,she did not object when told her she would a child with her should she be fortunate enough to have one she asked to share in the cost of in vitro fertilization,which eventually agreed to do she asked to accompany her to redding for birth she shared her home with she allowed to care for the children since birth she took the children on numerous vacations with she took the children to visit parents in texas she took the children on a cruise with and extended family to celebrate parents anniversary she took the children to various activities organized by work she arranged for to regularly work in classroom she allowed to provide for the children financially and she did not object when set up college savings accounts for the children 
in sum,the trial court did not err in finding that met her burden of establishing she received the children into her home and held them out as her natural children our conclusion is consistent with the purpose behind the presumed parent designation,which is to distinguish between those fathers who have entered into some familial relationship with the mother and child and those who have not.in re sabrina d.t he premise behind the category of presumed father is that an individual who has demonstrated a commitment to the child and the child welfare regardless of whether he is biologically the father is entitled to the elevated status of presumed fatherhood.in re,supra,th at.here,there is no doubt that entered into a familial relationship with and the children and demonstrated a commitment to the children over the course of their lives.thus,recognizing as a parent furthers the purpose of the statute.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining there is no basis to rebut the parentage presumption 
contends t he trial court abused its discretion in finding that she had not rebutted any presumption of parenthood which may have arisen under section d.we disagree.
section,subdivision a provides that a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.thus,bore the burden below of rebutting the presumption that was and parent with clear and convincing evidence.charisma,supra,th at.we review the trial court determination that failed to meet her burden for abuse of discretion.elisa,supra,cal th at.
in elisa,the court held that it would be an abuse of discretion to conclude that the presumption may be rebutted with proof that elisa is not the children biological mother because she actively participated in causing the children to be conceived with the understanding that she would raise the children as her own together with the birth mother,she voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood after the children were born,and there are no competing claims to her being the children second parent.cal th at.the court further concluded that d eclaring that elisa can not be the twins parent and,thus,has no obligation to support them because she is not biologically related to them would produce a result similar to the situation we sought to avoid in in re nicholas cal th of leaving the child fatherless rebutting the presumption that elisa is the twins parent would leave them with only one parent and would deprive them of the support of their second parent.id.at.
similarly,here,encouraged to adopt a child with the understanding she would the child voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood since the children were born there are no competing claims to her being the children second parent and public policy favors children having two parents.see elisa,supra,cal th at.the trial court acted well within its discretion in concluding failed to rebut the parentage presumption.
recognizing.as a parent did not infringe upon fundamental right to rear her children 
citing troxel granville d,claims that the trial court order declaring that is a parent of and violated her right,under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of her children.she is mistaken.
in troxel,the court held that a washington statute that allowed any person to petition the court for visitation rights at any time and authorized the court to grant such visitation rights whenever visitation may serve the best interest of the child,as applied in that case,infringed upon the mother fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of he
