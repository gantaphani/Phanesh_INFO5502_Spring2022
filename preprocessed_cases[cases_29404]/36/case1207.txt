appellant also repeatedly violated the restraining order.she sent written and electronic correspondence to respondent.she made telephone calls,and left messages on his voice mail.appellant threatened respondent,his wife,members of their families,and his employer.between september and march,appellant made more than calls,and left nearly messages,which totaled almost hours of recordings.though respondent changed his home telephone to an unlisted number,appellant was able to obtain his new cell phone number within a few weeks,and the calls continued.in february,appellant threatened the president of the company that employed respondent.on march,appellant left over messages on respondent voice mail.
since appellant had left florida,the prosecutor was seeking her extradition from california for violations of the restraining order.in the meantime,on march,respondent requested a restraining order in california so that california authorities could prosecute her if she continued to harass him.on the same date,respondent filed a motion for modification and termination of spousal support based on appellant acts of domestic violence.

ii.discussion 
termination of spousal support 
section,subdivision a states in any proceeding for dissolution of marriage where there is a criminal conviction for an act of domestic violence perpetrated by one spouse against the other spouse entered by the court within five years prior to the filing of the dissolution proceeding,or at any time thereafter,there shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that any award of temporary or permanent spousal support to the abusive spouse otherwise awardable pursuant to the standards of this part should not be made.
relying on section,appellant contends that the trial court erred in applying section in the present case.section,subdivision c states in relevant part that a n agreement for spousal support may not be modified or revoked to the extent that a written agreement specifically provides that the spousal support is not subject to modification or termination.here the parties agreed that spousal support would not be modified or terminated unless appellant cohabited with a partner or appellant suffered a loss of income.respondent counters that enforcement of the settlement agreement would violate the public policy against domestic violence.
in determining whether a contract violates public policy,courts essentially engage in a weighing process,balancing the interests of enforcing the contract with those interests against enforcement.but the cases make clear that the judicial power to declare public policy in the context of contract interpretation and enforcement should be exercised with great caution.the power of the courts to declare a contract void for being in contravention of sound public policy is a very delicate and undefined power,and,like the power to declare a statute unconstitutio
