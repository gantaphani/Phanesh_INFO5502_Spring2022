in this case of first impression,we conclude that before appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in a welfare and institutions code section proceeding,the parent right to due process requires an informal hearing and an opportunity for the parent to be heard.the failure to provide the parent with an opportunity to be heard in this case requires reversal of the jurisdictional and dispositional orders.
procedural background and facts 
a petition was filed on september,alleging that sara,born in september,came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to section,subdivisions b and c.count i alleged sara mother,appellant taylor,was unable to control sara extreme behavior,placing sara at risk of serious harm or illness.it also alleged taylor home was considered a health and safety hazard as a result of a visit on september,and taylor allegedly suffered from a bipolar disorder and personality disorder requiring various prescription medications rendering her unable to care for sara.sara father,louis,allegedly failed to maintain a relationship with sara and failed to protect the child from the neglect of taylor.
count ii alleged sara has suffered or is likely to suffer serious emotional damage as a result of taylor conduct as evidenced by sara behavior and arguments between sara and taylor.
a contested jurisdictional hearing was scheduled for november.on that date,the court relieved taylor appointed counsel and continued the hearing to november.on november,taylor appeared with new counsel and testimony was received from jenee morris,the social worker assigned to the case by respondent kern county department of human services department.on december,the contested jurisdictional hearing resumed,and testimony was received from taylor therapist,terrance willey.the matter was then continued to december.
on december,the court appointed a guardian ad litem for taylor.the events preceding the appointment form the basis for this appeal.before presenting any testimony on the,the attorneys requested a conference with the judge in chambers.taylor did not attend the conference.bruce meier,taylor appointed attorney,told the court he was having difficulty communicating with taylor.he felt she either did not appreciate or understand the concepts or issues which were being presented to the court,and she was confused about the proceedings.meier requested that he be relieved as counsel for taylor or that the court appoint a guardian ad litem for her.
the court stated taylor conduct appeared to be consistent with the features of the borderline personality defect diagnosed by her therapist.the court concluded a guardian ad litem should be appointed because it had already relieved one attorney as counsel for taylor,they were in the middle of a contested hearing on jurisdiction,and it would probably be more beneficial to taylor to have a guardian ad litem appointed to assist meier in preparation for the hearing and assist her in understanding the proceedings.
the court then reconvened in the courtroom and chose a continued date for the jurisdictional hearing.after the date of january,was selected,the following occurred 
the court counsel is there any one who is not going to be available on the in the afternoon i set it for the in,januar y,make request for guardian ad litem 
the court the court will refer the matter for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the mother.department is to provide extended overnight visitation with the father.
on january,taylor,meier and taylor guardian ad litem were present in court.without presenting any further evidence,meier informed the court that,after consulting with taylor guardian ad litem and therapist,he had reached an agreement with the other attorneys on a resolution of the jurisdiction issue.under the agreement,the allegation that the home was a health and safety hazard was stricken,the allegation that taylor suffered from a bipolar disorder was amended to reflect that she suffered from a borderline personality disorder as testified by her therapist,and count ii was dismissed.with these amendments,meier and the other attorneys submitted the jurisdiction issue to the court based on the recommendations contained in the social study.the court found it had jurisdiction and set a dispositional hearing for january.
on january,the court granted the request of taylor guardian ad litem to be relieved and appointed a new guardian ad litem.the dispositional hearing was continued to january.evidence,including the testimony of taylor and louis,was received on january and february.at the conclusion of the testimony,the court awarded louis legal and physical custody of sara,with taylor granted only supervised visitation rights.the court then dismissed the petition.
discussion 
taylor raises two challenges to the appointment of the guardian ad litem.first,she challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the appointment.second,she argues that the procedure used in this case violated her rights to due process.
a.the standard for determining incompetency on a motion for appointment of a guardian ad litem is set by either probate code section or penal code section.
code of civil procedure section provides that in any proceeding in which an incompetent person is a party,that person shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is pending.as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree on what standard a trial court should use in determining whether an adult is incompetent and requires the appointment of a guardian ad litem.appellant,citing sarracino superior court argues that the correct standard is to be found in probate code section while respondent,citing in re christina argues the correct standard is found in penal code section 
in sarracino,a mother was appointed the guardian ad litem for her year old daughter in support proceedings against the father.the petition to appoint a guardian ad litem alleged the daughter was not competent to manage her own financial affairs or to protect her own property.the application included a declaration which set out facts to support these grounds and a consent to the appointment signed by the daughter 
on appeal,the father contended the appointment of the guardian ad litem was improper because the petition did not set forth facts to bring the daughter within the provisions of code of civil procedure section.the supreme court held the allegations in the petition sufficiently described a person for whom a conservator could be appointed and that such allegations also described a person who was incompetent within the meaning of code of civil procedure section 
in christina,the court held the proper standard to determine competency was whether the preponderance of the evidence established the mother lacked the capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the juvenile court proceeding,or that she was unable to assist her attorney in the preparation of her case the court rejected the test found in probate code section because it addressed an individual ability to provide for material needs and did not speak to the court primary concern,the ability of a person to take part meaningfully in the proceedings.
in re impliedly adopted the test for incompetency found in penal code section.a mother appealed to this court from a judgment which terminated her parental rights pursuant to former civil code section now,et.the mother had mild developmental disabilities as well as a dependent personality disorder.she argued that she received inadequate assistance of counsel because her attorney did not request the court to inquire into her competency.this court rejected the mother argument,concluding that despite her conditions,the record established that n either the trial court nor the mother trial counsel ignored evidence that the mother abilities were so limited that she was effectively rendered incompetent to understand the nature of the proceedings or to assist her counsel in representing her interest so as to require appointment of a guardian ad litem.
in in re lisa the court found error in the trial court failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother after the trial court made express findings that the mother was not able to understand the dependency proceedings in which she was a participant.
we do not read the language of code of civil procedure section providing that an incompetent person includes a person for whom a conservator may be appointed,as indicating that probate code section is the exclusive standard for determining when an adult is incompetent.christina correctly observed that the primary concern in section cases is whether the parent understands the proceedings and can assist the attorney in protecting the parent interests in the companionship,custody,control and maintenance of the child we follow that standard here and conclude a guardian ad litem should be appointed if the requirements of either penal code section or probate code section are met.we also agree with christina that the trial court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent comes within the requirements of either section 
due process is required before a guardian ad litem may be appointed.
we know of no case law addressing the procedure for appointment of a guardian ad litem for an allegedly incompetent adult.this may be because most cases in which a guardian ad litem is appointed involve consensual appointments situations in which a guardian ad litem is required as a matter of law,when a minor is a party to a lawsuit.in such situations,the attorney seeking to have the guardian ad litem appointed is taking the necessary steps to represent the interests of his or her client.since no conflict of interest occurs,appointment of the guardian ad litem involves little exercise of discretion by the court 
in dependency cases,courts and attorneys find themselves in a different position.the parent s whose custody of the child is being challenged often have various problems physical,mental or emotional which may make it difficult to understand the legal process to which they are exposed and may make it difficult for them to provide assistance to their appointed attorney.the attorney may find it difficult to communicate with the client.accordingly,the attorney may determine that in order to protect the client rights,a guardian ad litem should be appointed.
if the parent attorney concludes that a guardian ad litem should be appointed,the attorney must either a approach the client and request consent to the appointment,or b not consult with the client and approach the court directly.if the attorney consults with the client and receives consent for the appointment of a guardian ad litem,the due process rights of the parent will be protected,since the parent participated in the decision to request the appointment.
if the parent does not consent,or the attorney forgoes consultation with the client and approaches the court directly,the court will find itself in a significantly different position.the court is being asked to dramatically change the parent role in the proceeding by transferring the direction and control of the litigation from the parent to the guardian ad litem.in general civil litigation,a guardian ad litem has broad powers that include,with court approval,the ability to compromise a claim,to agree to an order or judgment,to satisfy a judgment,or to release or discharge a claim the guardian ad litem also has the power to control the lawsuit,including controlling procedural steps necessary to the conduct of the litigation,making stipulations or concessions with court approval,waiving the right to a jury trial,and controlling trial tactics while not all of these powers are applicable in a section proceeding,the decisions made can affect the outcome of the dependency proceeding,with a corresponding effect on the parent.therefore,the parent has a direct and substantial interest in whether a guardian ad litem is appointed.
the question then arises whether the interest we have identified is entitled to the protections of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions 
it is settled that the interest of a parent in the companionship,care,custody and management of children is one of our most basic civil rights.before the state can deprive a parent of this interest,it must provide the parent with a hearing and an opportunity to be heard 
we have not found any case directly on point.most guardian ad litem appointments are either required by law a minor appearing before the court,consensual or the incompetent person is provided an opportunity in the trial court to contest the appointment in sarracino,the supreme court specifically reserved the question of whether notice to the alleged incompetent was required before a guardian ad litem could be appointed in in re christina,the appellate court affirmed the appointment of a guardian ad litem,finding the evidence adduced at the hearing supported the trial court order,but it did not address the procedure used in the trial court.
a parent right to due process in custody proceedings has been established in a variety of contexts.the court in in re stacy found the mother right to due process was violated when the court entered her default after she failed to appear at a settlement conference without first informing her of the consequences of failing to appear.in in re amy the court found a due process violation when the lower court refused to allow the parents access to the child prior to the hearing and refused to allow the child to testify.long held due process required that each party was entitled to a copy of the social study,an opportunity to examine the officer who prepared the report,and introduce rebuttal evidence.the appellate court in in re nemis held the trial court violated a father right to due process when it denied his attorney the right to witnesses after the father failed to appear at a hearing as ordered 
while there are differences between custody and dependency proceedings,the fundamental interest of a parent in the companionship,care,custody,and management of the child is the same in each,as is the potential impact on that interest by the ultimate disposition of the proceeding.transferring direction and control of the litigation through appointment of a guardian ad litem in a dependency proceeding may jeopardize the parent interest as much,if not more,than any of the actions taken in the cited custody cases finding a due process violation.therefore,we conclude taylor was entitled to due process before the court appointed a guardian ad litem for her.in reaching this conclusion we are also influenced by the breadth of the due process protections statutorily provided the parent throughout section cases if a court can transfer the direction and control of the litigation from the parent without due process,the remaining protections seem hollow.
respondent argues taylor due process rights were protected because her appointed attorney participated in the decision to appoint the guardian ad litem.we disagree.while meier undoubtedly acted to protect taylor due process rights in the context of retaining custody of the child,the conflict between taylor and meier on the issue of appointment of a guardian ad litem raises due process concerns.in a situation in which the parent does not consent to appointment of a guardian ad litem,or counsel approaches the court directly,an unusual tension is introduced into the relationship because the attorney is acting either against the client wishes or without the client knowledge.therefore,the court can not completely rely on the attorney,acting as an agent for the client,to ensure the parent rights are protected.
respondent also argues that taylor due process rights were satisfied because it is permissible to appoint a guardian ad litem on ex parte application however,absent extraordinary circumstances,even ex parte applications require notice to all parties of the application the day before the ex parte hearing 
respondent cites briggs in arguing that the court was not required to give notice to taylor.in briggs,the court cited granger as authority for the proposition that the validity of the appointment of a guardian ad litem for an insane person is not affected by the fact that notice
