the mother of daniel appeals from a welfare and institutions code section order terminating her parental rights as to daniel and freeing him for adoption.the mother argues that the trial court failed to inquire into and make orders for sibling visitation between daniel and his sisters,and daniel and his sisters suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because a they were all represented by the same attorney despite their conflicting interests in sibling visitation,and b their attorney failed to pursue sibling visitation.we affirm,concluding that the mother lacks standing to raise these issues because they are all based on the minors alleged interest in sibling visitation.
statement of facts 
at the time these proceedings were instituted,the mother had several children,including sister a age,sister b age,sister c age,sister d age,and daniel,the subject of this appeal.
on july,the department of public social services dpss took custody of sister a and sister c when their mother failed to pick them up after they returned from a summer camp.sister a and sister c were immediately placed in a shelter home.
the next day,dpss found the mother and observed sister b,sister d,and daniel.the family was homeless,but daniel was healthy and well fed,and sister b and sister d were animated and did not appear to have been mistreated.dpss also interviewed the maternal grandmother.the grandmother claimed that the mother abused drugs.the grandmother said that the mother and the minors had lived with her for a few months,and during that time,the mother would come home early in the morning and take one or two of the daughters with her,leaving at least one of them to take care of baby daniel.she said that sister b was the daughter that the mother depended on the most.dpss concluded that the mother relied heavily on the girls,sister b in particular,and that sister b appeared overworked and overstressed,and was at risk of becoming ill if not removed from the situation.the minors did not seem to be a priority for the mother,who was unconcerned about the family transient lifestyle.
at the detention hearing,the court found probable cause for the initial detention of sister a and sister c,and ordered that the minors be placed with their mother and that dpss assist the mother in finding suitable housing.the mother subsequently established residence in a motel that was frequented by drug dealers.
prior to the jurisdictional hearing,the mother missed three appointments with dpss.on a surprise visit,however,dpss was able to talk to the mother.the mother admitted to using marijuana recently,but agreed to take a drug test.the mother said that she gave her food stamps to the kids to buy junk at the convenience store.sister a and sister b indicated that the maids paid them to help clean the rooms.the report stated that sister a and sister b clearly run the household,taking care of each other and their siblings and running errands for their mother,and the m inors have established a sense of family.
on september,the mother and the minors left the motel they were staying at and disappeared.they were discovered on october,when the mother came into the dpss office on business relating to her food stamps.the mother said they had moved to another motel and she had a deposit down on a home,but the minors were immediately taken into custody.sister a,sister b,and sister c were placed in one shelter home,and sister d and daniel were placed in another.when sister a and sister b were told that sister d and daniel would be placed elsewhere,they were shocked and wondered who would take care of daniel.
on october,a hearing was held.the court concluded that the children all came within the court jurisdiction and placed the children with dpss.
on march,the mother was arrested on outstanding warrants,and sentenced to days in jail with credit for days of time served.in the meantime,daniel began developing dramatically,learning to walk and talk,and became very bonded to his foster parents.on april,during a visit with the mother in jail,daniel cried the entire time and clung to the social worker,but eventually went to sister a as they were leaving.sometime around then,sister a was moved to a separate shelter home.the children generally used the weekly visits with their mother to play with each other,and a contact log entry dated march,stated that a sibling visit went well.additionally,the sisters began openly discussing sexual abuse they had suffered while in their mother custody,and physical abuse they had witnessed while living with their relatives.sister a confided in her foster mother daughter that she began using drugs with her mother when she was and had been molested.
on june,the court terminated reunification services as to daniel and scheduled a selection and implementation hearing under section.the court continued services for the girls.
a prospective adoptive family was identified for daniel,and they indicated that they were not interested in having daniel visit with his family,but they would work with dpss to help the children say.the updated case service plan indicated that sibling visitation would occur as directed by the adoptive parents.
the section report indicated that during visits,daniel liked to play alone with trucks rather than with the things his sisters were playing with.an updated contact log indicates that during a may,sibling visitation,sister a played with daniel,while the other girls played separately.allegedly,the children had been playing and talking together before a social worker entered the room and began talking to them.during a june,sibling visitation,the children all played together and had fun.during a june,visitation,the children played and talked appropriately.the children also seemed to enjoy a july,visit,but they got out of control and began running around to other visitation rooms.during a visit with the mother in jail,daniel appeared interested in the toys,but not the people,and the mother let sister b take care of daniel.sister d became very sad whenever daniel prospective adoptive parents came to see him.
the mother was released from jail on september,and on october,the court terminated parental rights and placed daniel for adoption.the subsequent section report regarding the girls indicates that the girls were reluctant to agree to having daniel adopted,but have realized that he is in good hands.
discussion 
the mother complains that the trial court failed to order sibling visitation,the children attorney failed to pursue sibling visitation,and the same attorney improperly represented all the minors despite their conflicting interests regarding sibling visitation.as is apparent,these arguments all have one thing in common sibling visitation.we find that the mother lacks standing to raise that issue,in any of its various forms.
case law consistently holds that a parent lacks standing to raise the issue of sibling visitation,reasoning that the minor interest in maintaining a relationship with siblings is unrelated to the parents interest in reunification.see,in re cliffton th,d cliffton in re frank th,d frank.this line of cases easily disposes of the mother argument that the trial court erred in not ordering sibling visitation.that issue can only be raised by the minors.but what about the mother ineffective assistance of counsel arguments do parents have standing to raise sibling visitation issues indirectly by using them as the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
although the answer seems to us,it has actually been a source of some controversy.in re cliffton,supra,th at pages,and footnote,d fourth appellate district,division three,and in re candida th,d candida sixth appellate district,both held that parents had standing to argue that counsel improperly represented multiple children with conflicting interests on the issue of sibling visitation.cliffton and candida both relied on a line of cases generally holding that parents have standing to argue that their children are entitled to independent counsel,reasoning that independent representation of the child interests affects the parent interest in the relationship.see,in re p
