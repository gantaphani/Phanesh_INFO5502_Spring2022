this case involves the effort by a sperm donor jason to establish that he is a legal parent of a child conceived through in vitro fertilization ivf using his sperm,and that he is entitled to joint legal and physical custody of the child with the child mother danielle.the case is before us on appeal for the second time.the first appeal was taken by jason from the family law court judgment in favor of danielle on jason petition to establish parental relationship.the family law court found that family code section,subdivision b hereafter,section b precluded jason from establishing parentage we reversed,holding that section b only preclude s a sperm donor from establishing paternity based upon his biological connection to the child,and does not preclude him from establishing that he is a presumed parent under section,subdivision d hereafter,section d based upon postbirth conduct.jason danielle th,jason i.we remanded the matter with directions to the family law court to conduct further proceedings to determine whether jason qualifies as a presumed parent under section d.id.at.
as directed,the family law court conducted those proceedings,and concluded that jason met the requirements to be a presumed parent.the court then conducted further proceedings on custody and awarded danielle sole legal custody for six months,after which danielle and jason would exercise joint legal custody,provided that jason satisfied certain conditions.the court also ordered a plan to a shared parenting arrangement,and ordered jason to pay child support,retroactive to the date of entry of the court statement of decision regarding parentage.
in this second appeal,danielle challenges the family law court finding that jason is a presumed parent and the court custody order.she contends the court erred by misapplying the statutory requirements for presumed parentage and improperly relied upon jason biological connection in finding him a presumed parent and improperly awarded jason custody in contravention of section,which creates a presumption against awarding custody to a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence.we conclude the family law court correctly applied the law governing presumed parentage,and its finding that jason is a presumed parent is supported by substantial evidence.we also conclude,however,that the court award of joint custody was premature because it had not yet received evidence that jason completed the requirements the court deemed necessary to rebut the section presumption.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment as to the parentage finding,but conditionally reverse the judgment as to the award of custody.on remand,the family law court is directed to conduct limited proceedings to determine and make findings as to whether jason satisfied the conditions the court deemed necessary to rebut the section presumption.if the court determines he has done so,it may reinstate its award of joint custody.if the court determines he has not done so,it shall enter a new custody order,taking into account that the section presumption has not been rebutted.
background 
the family law court issued very detailed statements of decision regarding parentage and custody that included extensive findings of fact and credibility determinations.our discussion of the facts is based upon those findings,which were supported by substantial evidence.see th,when reviewing a court finding of presumed parentage,w e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the ruling,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of the judgment.citation.we defer to the trial court credibility resolutions and do not reweigh the evidence.

in september,danielle bought a home near jason in santa monica.she was staying with family on the east coast at the time she bought the property.when she came back to california,she stayed at jason house,and lived there for the first six months of.she testified that she stayed at jason house because there was construction going on at her home,but she told her cousin in an email that she moved back in with him temporarily for us to try to figure things out.
in november or january,jason gave danielle a long handwritten letter in it,jason discussed his inner turmoil and emotional struggles,and the troubles in their relationship.toward the end of the letter he wrote there is no doubt in my mind that you were meant to be a mother.you know it and feel it so deeply.there is also no question that you would and will be a wonderful one.you will give all the love you never had,plus all the love you learned,lived,and shared.you are ready to be a mom right now.whether due to time,or need,once again it does matter time says now.i am not ready to be a father.can i be of course.i can assume the responsibilities,and march along as i always have.but i want to be excited about the idea,the process,the anticipation.i do want to be grudgingly brought into being a daddy.and i say this knowing that maybe i never be so sure and at ease with the commitment.maybe it not my lot.but i would hope that it could be.i really do.i hope my fucked up life and misaligned choices have not ruined me.i truly do.i just know that i need to have my best effort at clarity,if not surety,to have the chance of family,and being fulfilled as a creative force.i need to go away for several months and try and write something that can fix me.i know you ca wait.i do want you to.i have to find my way dan.it only then that i can give to anybody.i do know if i ever be a dad.but i know if i ever had a kid,and i needed someone to care and raise them,i would trust you.everything you are.i want you to know that if you want to use my sperm,you have my blessing.it all i can give you right now.maybe ever.i so lost.maybe in a few months i be clear.maybe i have needs and vigor to cho o se them.and maybe i feel the same way.alone,needing space,or will have changed in ways unknown.but what i will know,is that i was able to give a gift to you.one that one day i may be able to feel and embrace.and if not,i will know that you are fulfilled in that part of your journey and a piece of me is living through you and in the world.it just has to be between you and that all i ask.
in january,danielle underwent an iui procedure using sperm that jason provided,rather than using the anonymous donor sperm.the procedure was unsuccessful.
in march,danielle underwent ivf using jason sperm.jason took her to california fertility partners for the egg retrieval on march,and took her back for the transfer of the embryo on march.the ivf resulted in a viable pregnancy.
the only people danielle initially told about her pregnancy and that jason was the biological father were her brother,her sister elisabeth liz,and her two closest friends,ellen rapoport and joshua weinstein,but she asked each of them not to reveal who the biological father was.she later explained to her cousin that jason did want anyone to know because he so private and.although jason denied to some people that he was the father of danielle baby during the pregnancy,he did tell his close friend bryony atkinson and her husband scott seiver,his personal trainer flavio de olivira,and cynthia burton,the mother of his former girlfriend,that danielle was pregnant with his baby.
after the ivf,danielle stayed in the guest room at jason house until she was approximately or weeks pregnant.jason was gone for much of that time.however,he was home when,at around weeks,danielle started to bleed,and he took her to the emergency room.she was put on bed rest for seven or eight weeks,and stayed at jason house until she was able to work again.at that point,she moved into her home.
danielle made all the arrangements for the baby room in her home,except buying a crib her grandmother bought the crib and had it delivered to jason home because she believed it was bad luck to send baby items to danielle home before the baby was born.danielle also made arrangements for a doula and a night nurse,and selected a pediatrician.her sister liz set up a registry for gifts for the baby.jason was not involved in any of those activities,nor did he attend any childbirth classes with danielle however,shortly before the baby was born,jason sent an email to danielle telling her to make sure her midwife and nurse have all been vaccinated for swine flu.i f not they ca be used.jason and danielle also discussed names for the baby.danielle chose the name gus theodore gus was for one of danielle family members,and theodore was for one of jason family members.
b.the period from gus birth to his first birthday 
gus was born in early december.shortly before gus was born,jason discovered that a caretaker for his grandmother,who lived in new york and with whom he was very close,was stealing from her.because jason was responsible for his grandmother care,he had to fly to new york to take care of the situation and find a new caretaker.
while jason was in new york,danielle went into labor.liz took danielle to the hospital and stayed with her for most of the nearly two days in which danielle was in labor.ultimately,danielle had an emergency caesarean section.jason flew back to los angeles,but did not arrive in time for the birth he got to the hospital shortly after danielle came out of the recovery room.jason did not hold or ask to hold gus he testified he was overwhelmed and afraid of hurting him and did not take any photographs or ask to have any photograph taken of him with gus.
jason stayed at the hospital for about a.he did not tell anyone at the hospital that he was gus father,did not make arrangements to have his name put on the birth certificate,and did not sign a voluntary declaration of paternity.he testified that he did not put his name on the birth certificate for privacy reasons.he explained he wanted anonymity for his child as long as possible,because he was a celebrity and grew up in a celebrity family both his father and grandfather were quite famous,and appeared in theater,television,and movies,and he found the attention that brought to be extremely intrusive.he did,however,tell all of the people that were close to him about gus birth.
liz drove danielle and gus home from the hospital.jason testified that he did not drive them because he had to go pick up danielle favorite bagels for her,get celebratory balloons,and walk the dogs to prepare for her arrival.
when gus was first brought home from the hospital,liz and a night nurse assisted danielle.jason spent time at danielle house in the days after gus was born,to help burp gus and tuck him in in the evening.when gus was eight days old,jason took danielle and gus to a medical appointment to have gus circumcised.for gus first christmas,a few weeks after gus was born,jason brought a christmas tree and decorations to danielle house,and gave gus a onesie that had baby first christmas written on it.
during,jason often was away from los angeles he went to new york every four or five weeks to take care of his grandmother and conduct business,and was in canada for work for three weeks.although jason testified that he went to danielle house to see gus almost every day that he was in los angeles liz,who helped danielle with gus at least three or four times a week,testified that she saw jason with gus only sporadically.similarly,danielle friend joshua weinstein,who saw danielle at her house almost weekly,testified that he rarely saw jason there in,and did not see jason do anything that suggested he was parenting gus instead,he usually was watching television or on the computer.
danielle and gus,accompanied by liz,went to new york three times in.they did not stay at jason apartment,but instead stayed at danielle and liz father home.danielle and gus visited with jason while they were there,and went to parks with him.danielle also took gus to visit jason grandmother,and took a photograph of gus with her.
throughout gus first year,jason and danielle exchanged emails with information about raising children,vaccinations,and events in gus development,and occasional requests from danielle for jason to babysit gus.in late june,danielle decided to take time away from jason while he was in canada for work they agreed they were not going to talk while he was gone.danielle told weinstein that jason was only worried about not seeing gus even though i told him i would never keep gus from him.
their time away from each other was.in august,jason and danielle were at the brentwood country mart with gus when they ran into erin dignam,a longtime friend of jason who also had known danielle for years.dignam and her two daughters spent most of the day with jason,danielle,and gus.dignam assumed that jason was not gus biological father because danielle had told her in that she and jason had fertility problems.based on jason and danielle behavior,however,she believed that jason was gus father.
c.the period from gus first birthday to the filing of the petition 
in december,jason attended gus first birthday party at danielle house.in december or january,jason and danielle resumed their romantic relationship,and jason began working in new york on a broadway play.the play started rehearsals in january,opened in march,and ran through.
in early january,danielle father sent danielle an email expressing concern about her renewed relationship with jason,which her father worried might be an abusive relationship.danielle responded that she was not in an abusive relationship and said that she want s and intend s for gus to have two and parents.
jason got to new york in january,and hired dena douglass as his assistant.when jason interviewed douglass for the job,he asked her if she had any experience with children douglass told him her previous job had been as a nanny.jason explained that he had a son,gus,and that her job duties would include taking care of danielle and gus when they were in town.they discussed various things regarding gus,such as items that would be needed while gus was there,issues,and setting up the house in preparation for his visits.the day after she interviewed for the job,douglass went to jason apartment,and jason showed her around.she saw a jogging stroller,baby clothing,diapers and baby ointment,a child toothbrush,toothpaste and shampoo,a crib,a baby toilet,a high chair,and a gate,along with children books and toys.she also noticed photographs of gus,and of jason and gus,in both bedrooms.
danielle and gus visited jason in new york four or five times while jason was there for the play,staying for about a week each trip jason paid for their airplane tickets,and also gave danielle money to make up for the fact that she had to miss work.their first visit was in late january.douglass met them on their second visit,in february.when douglass arrived at the apartment the first morning of their visit,danielle and gus were there,and jason was feeding gus breakfast.over the course of their visit,douglass observed jason feeding gus,playing with him,and taking gus to the park.jason called gus his son,and gus called him dada danielle also referred to jason as dada and encouraged gus to do so.
danielle and gus returned to new york to attend the opening night of jason play in early march.on march,while back in santa monica,gus became ill and was hospitalized for four days.jason was doing eight performances a week in the play at that time the only day without a performance was monday.he spoke with danielle more than times during gus hospitalization,and asked if he should come home danielle assured him that gus was stable,and he did not need to come home.he also called his friend erin dignam because she had a lot of doctors in her family,and asked for her help dignam called danielle to offer her assistance.
danielle told jason that gus was going to be released from the hospital on sunday,march.jason decided to fly from new york to los angeles after the sunday matinee performance.he arrived in los angeles just before midnight,and went directly to danielle house,arriving at around on monday,so he could be there when gus woke up.he spent the entire day with gus,and took a flight back to new york on tuesday morning when he landed in new york,he went directly to the theater to be there in time for that evening performance.
danielle and gus went to new york again in.during that trip,jason arranged for gus and danielle to visit the set of his play.there was a trophy that was the centerpiece of the play,and each of the actors was allowed to have the name of a family member engraved on it.jason chose gus theodore for his engraving.jason was photographed showing gus the trophy.there also was a video taken onstage,in which danielle referred to gus as a chip off the old block.when she and gus were back in santa monica,danielle made a video of gus looking at the playbill from jason play and asking him to point to dada in the photograph on the cover.she also made a video of him looking at a photograph of jason hands while she asked him if those hands were dada hands.
jason returned to los angeles after the play closed,and spent several days and nights at danielle house in june.during that time,gus was attending a toddler program at a preschool in santa monica,the first school.the daughter of jason friend kristen prouty also attended the program.prouty testified that she observed jason participate in circle time at the school,during which the parents mostly mothers sat in a circle and asked the teachers about child development and issues they were going through with their children.
throughout the rest of,jason continued to go back to new york every four or five weeks to take care of his grandmother.in addition,he was away for much of the month of july,working on a show in chicago.
danielle testified that in july and august of,jason started to become more abusive and began to insert himself into how she was parenting and raising gus.on july,he made remarks to danielle,who is jewish,and then left for chicago.despite this,danielle emailed him six days later,and again a couple of weeks later,telling him that she and gus missed him.on july,she sent him an email telling him she was looking forward to him being back in santa monica for many reasons,one of which was that it would make it easier to wean gus.
jason was back in santa monica in august.around august or,jason made another remark to danielle in gus presence,and made another in late september during circle time at gus toddlers program in front of some teachers,parents,and children.
jason,danielle,and gus went on a vacation together to hawaii in september.in connection with that trip,danielle emailed a travel agent,telling her that she would like to plan a trip with my boyfriend jason and our month old son.the three of them were photographed by paparazzi during that trip.
in late september,danielle and jason argued about how to help gus sleep through the night danielle did not like that jason had gus sleep all night on her couch with him.jason sent an email to danielle,telling her he was extremely upset,and complaining that she was us ing gus and the implicit threat of access to him,as a power chip in their relationship.in her response,danielle suggested that they return to therapy,and said i will not allow myself to be strung along without a proper discussion about what our plans are it seems like that what you avoiding every time you go to nyc to see your grandma and extend your stay and i find it dishonest.you want to live your double life,but you expect me to be always available and accountable.the arguments that we have about gus are arguments that any other couple with children might have,but they get complicated by the lack of definition that continues to plague our relationship.w hen gus cries for me to pick him up at the park sometimes and you say to me do pick him up,i listen to you.i respect your plan and know that we as parents need to not undermine each other cuz then gus will play us against each other and feel like there is no order or structure.even tho we may have our own styles of parenting,we still have to not undermine one another.
in november,jason and danielle took gus to get his first haircut.gus sat on jason lap while getting his haircut,during which gus asked dada to play with a toy alligator that was next to the chair.jason also attended some of gus appointments with his pediatrician in october and november,and was identified in the doctor records as gus father.
in early november,danielle and jason had an argument about what jason fed,or attempted to feed,gus one evening.danielle sent an email to jason,explaining why she did not want jason to feed gus what he tried to feed him.she noted,you made it clear you think i do know what i talking about when it comes to this.i know you disagree,but i beginning to think you doing this just to exert.she told him she felt he treated her in an abusive way,speaking with contempt and bullying her.in jason response,he accused danielle of pulling rank on him when it came to parenting decisions.danielle responded,pull rank bullshit.i am g us mama and you are his dada.how does rank factor in you see yourself in competition with d ira as well.i did anoint myself boss of gus.i his primary caretaker.you don t want to be.
gus second birthday was celebrated in early december.jason and danielle planned a party for him.although the invitation that was sent out listed only danielle as the host,jason made the arrangements for the birthday cake,the music,and other entertainment.a video taken at the party shows jason holding gus as gus blows out the candles on his cake.
shortly after gus birthday,jason and danielle met with the preschool director at little dolphins school and toured the school.the director understood that danielle was gus mother and jason was his father.danielle wrote a note to the director thanking her for taking the time to meet with jason and me today and for feeding us yummy treats too.we tend to be listeners and you certainly answered all of our questions and more.
danielle had been exploring preschools for gus for a few months.she had applied to some schools in late and early,and did not list jason as gus father she listed herself as a single parent.gus was not accepted at any of them.jason and danielle had several discussions about whether gus should attend the first school,where he was attending a toddlers program,or little dolphins,and ultimately chose little dolphins.when danielle filled out the application to little dolphins,she listed jason as gus father and submitted a photograph of the three of them together.
when gus was enrolled in the school in february,both danielle and jason signed the enrollment contract.jason provided a check for for the initial deposit jason contact information was provided for the emergency contact information section.in response to a question in the health history report asking about how the child gets along with parents,brothers,sisters,and other children,danielle wrote yes.both mother and father and dogs.
jason and danielle relationship remained unsettled in early.they continued to argue,and danielle continued to feel that jason was abusing her and trying to control her through gus,yet they continued to express affection for one another.jason continued to be a presence in gus life.when jason was in town,he would go to danielle house in the mornings to feed gus his breakfast or take him to the park,sometimes with,and sometimes without,gus nanny galindo.he also occasionally would go to danielle house in the evening to help put gus to bed.on one occasion,he took gus to the pediatrician by himself although danielle joined them minutes after the appointment started.on easter weekend,danielle,jason,and gus spent the weekend in malibu with jason friend atkinson,her husband,and their young son.in late april,danielle asked jason whether they should have gus attend a summer spanish immersion camp.
in may,jason was in canada shooting a movie.he kept in touch with gus through tons and tons of skype sessions.danielle made a video showing her encouraging gus to say thank you to dada for a present jason sent to him.jason asked danielle to come for a visit in canada with gus,but danielle did not want to take gus on such a long trip she testified that she also was worried that jason would take gus from her.
events leading up to and following the filing of this lawsuit 
danielle testified that she broke up with jason in may,and that on may and june,jason threatened to sue her,telling her,if you breaking up with me,be prepared to spend a lot less time with gus.i am going to go for full custody.both parties spoke to lawyers about their disputes.on advice of her counsel at the time,danielle agreed to allow jason visitation with gus four times a week during the early part of summer.
on june,danielle sent jason an email in which she said that she was prepared to meet with a child specialist regarding custody.she told him,i have no interest in denying gus a relationship with his father.it the opposite.i promote it.it is in gus best interest that we spend time with him one on one,so he gets used to you taking him on outings by yourself.after noting that jason had been gone for much of the time after gus birth and had not changed a diaper,she asserted that he was trying to log in as many hours as possible with gus for the record and to assert control over both gus and me.you know the truth,so please stop lying.
first trial and appeal 
jason filed the petition to establish parental relationship the next day.he contended that he was not a sperm donor within the meaning of section b,and that he was a presumed parent under d.the family law court stephen maloney granted jason pendente lite visitation pending the outcome of the trial on the petition.the court ordered that the case be tried in phases,with the issue of the applicability of section b to be tried first.
after close of evidence in the first phase,the family law court mark juhas granted danielle motion for nonsuit,finding that jason was a sperm donor within the meaning of section b,and that,under steven deborah th,he therefore was precluded from establishing paternity.on february,the court vacated the pendente lite visitation order and denied jason request for custody of visitation with gus during pendency of the appeal the court filed a statement of decision and a judgment on april.
jason appealed from the judgment.on may,we reversed the judgment in a published decision,and remanded the matter with directions to the family law court to conduct further proceedings to determine whether jason qualifies as a presumed parent under section.jason i,supra,th at.
domestic violence restraining orders 
after the family law court issued its statement of decision finding no parentage,jason engaged in harassing behavior.he sent a series of intimidating emails to danielle,texted her,and called her.he threatened danielle father in an email,and sent intimidating emails to danielle friend weinstein and gus nanny.
danielle sought a domestic violence restraining order against jason.the court stephen moloney granted danielle request on november,finding that jason disturbed danielle peace within the meaning of section by sending harassing messages after the family law court parentage ruling.the court specifically found that danielle did not show domestic violence under section,subdivisions a,b,or c jason was ordered not to h arass,attack,strike,threaten,assault sexually or otherwise,hit,follow,stalk,molest or c ontact danielle directly or indirectly,by any means,including,but not limited to,by telephone,mail,or other electronic means.the court did not issue a stay away order as to danielle or gus.
danielle filed a request to renew the restraining order on november.the family law court maren nelson found that the evidence presented at the hearing on the renewal request showed that jason had not read the terms of the original restraining order,and believed he had the right to contact any person who lied about the case.the court found that jason made several contacts with weinstein,even after weinstein asked him not to contact him,and that he made inappropriate contact with danielle father.danielle contended that these contacts made her fear that jason would once again disturb her peace if the restraining order were lifted.the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for renewal of a restraining order in light of the standard established for such renewals,and renewed the restraining order for the minimum term permitted.
second trial 
on remand,jason requested a pendente lite visitation order.the family law judge,maren nelson,denied his request,and set the matter for trial.the court ordered that,as to third party witnesses,it would take their testimony by way of the reporter transcript from the first trial.danielle filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of jason conduct.she observed that in our decision reversing the denial of jason petition we held that a mother may limit a sperm donor contact with the child to prevent him from becoming a presumed parent,and argued that jason conduct should not be used by him to establish presumed parentage because the family law court had imposed a visitation order right after the petition was filed.the family law court granted the motion.
the family law court conducted a trial.the first part,which addressed the presumed parentage issue,took seven and a half days,from september to september.the court issued a proposed statement of decision regarding parentage on october,and a final statement of decision regarding parentage on december,in which it concluded that jason met his burden to show that he is the presumed father of gus and that danielle did not rebut the presumption.
the second part of the trial addressed custody and visitation.the family law court heard four days of testimony and issued an oral tentative statement of decision on january.a written proposed statement of decision was served on february,and the final statement of decision regarding custody and visitation orders was filed on march.
the court found,among other things,that jason failed at this time to rebut the section presumption against custody for parents who have perpetrated domestic violence.however,the court noted that the domestic violence in this case did not involve any physical violence and instead consisted of jason inappropriate verbal harassment.the court concluded that,in light of the nature of the domestic violence at issue,the successful completion of individual counseling by jason and participation in joint counseling by both jason and danielle would be sufficient to rebut the presumption.the court also found that it was in gus best interest to reduce the level of conflict between his parents,particularly related to the litigation,by providing a mechanism for future joint legal custody and a parenting plan.therefore,the court ordered that danielle would have sole legal custody for six months,and that after six months danielle and jason would exercise joint custody,provided that jason completed a course of counseling for the purpose of helping him to develop tools to deal with his anger and frustration.the court also ordered a parenting plan,to begin immediately after danielle and jason met with a designated counselor to obtain advice on how to communicate with gus regarding jason being reintroduced into his life that counseling was previously ordered to take place on february.
the third and final part of the trial addressed child support and attorney fees.the court took testimony over five days in april and issued a proposed statement of decision in june.the final statement of decision was issued on july.the court ordered jason to pay danielle for child support,retroactive to december,the date the final statement of decision regarding parentage was filed.the court denied danielle request that jason be ordered to pay her attorney fees,and ordered that jason bear his own attorney fees.
the final judgment was entered on september.danielle timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
on appeal,danielle challenges the family law court finding that jason is the presumed father of gus and the court order awarding joint custody.
presumed parentage issues 
as noted,we held in the first appeal that section b precluded jason from establishing that he is gus father based upon his biological connection,but the statute did not preclude him from establishing that he is gus presumed parent under section d based upon his postbirth conduct.jason i,supra,th at.
section d provides that a person is presumed to be the natural parent of a child if t he presumed parent receives the child into his or her home and openly holds out the child as his or her natural child.we explained in our earlier decision that t he statutory purpose of section is to distinguish between those fathers who have entered into some familial relationship with the mother and child and those who have not.citation.a biological connection to the child is not necessary for the presumption of paternity to arise.citation.nor is it necessary for the person seeking presumed parent status to have entered into the familial relationship from the time of conception or birth.t he premise behind the category of presumed father is that an individual who has demonstrated a commitment to the child and the child welfare regardless of whether he is biologically the father is entitled to the elevated status of presumed fatherhood.citation.jason i,supra,th at.as the supreme court has observed,the paternity presumptions are driven by state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concern for the welfare of the child.the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.in re nicholas cal th.
danielle contends that,in finding that jason was gus presumed father,the family law court improperly relied upon jason biological connection to gus erred by liberally interpreting the statutory requirement that the presumed parent must receive the child into his or her home,and ignored that this requirement requires evidence of parental caretaking improperly found that jason met the statutory requirement that the presumed parent must hold the child out as his or her own because jason did not unequivocally hold gus out as his own to the community improperly allowed jason to belatedly pursue fatherhood after he initially rejected it and improperly relied upon danielle behavior in finding that jason was a presumed parent.we are not persuaded.
the court did not rely upon jason biological connection to gus 
in contending that the family law court improperly relied upon the fact that jason has a biological connection to gus in finding that jason is gus presumed father,danielle points to the opening sentence of the court statement of decision,in which it refers to jason as the biological father of gus rather than as the sperm donor.she contends that t he court disregard of the paucity of fatherly conduct on jason part can only be explained as impermissible reliance on this headline fact,because the rest of the evidence was so thin.her contention is not supported by the record.
although the court referred to jason as gus biological father a true statement rather than as a sperm donor,it expressly stated that i t is not jason status as a sperm donor that gives rise to his status as a presumed father under section d.rather,it is his conduct,encouraged by danielle,after gus was born.if there were any doubt,the body of the statement of decision makes clear that the court relied solely on jason conduct in concluding that jason met the requirements of section d and developed a parental relationship with gus.for example,in finding that jason had developed a familial relationship and commitment to gus,the court noted that even though jason and danielle were not in a dating relationship in,jason frequented danielle home and spent time with gus there and at his home in santa monica when he was in town,and by june he was worried about not seeing gus when danielle told him she wanted to take time away from him while he was working in canada.the court identified this conduct as jason taking tentative steps to build a relationship with gus,encouraged by danielle.the court also observed that once jason and danielle renewed their romantic relationship,danielle made great efforts to encourage jason to build a familial relationship,teaching gus to call jason dada and involving jason in feeding and playing with gus.
the court acknowledged that danielle had been gus primary parent since his birth,assisted by her sister liz and a nanny,and that jason was not a paragon of parenting.he used language in front of gus that was disrespectful and demeaning of danielle.he failed to respect danielle as gus primary parent.gus never spent the night at jason home with only jason.jason never changed gus diaper.jason was absent from gus life for long periods,due in part to work commitments and in part to his own choices regarding his personal life.jason never paid danielle money directly earmarked as child support,and he did not directly name gus as the beneficiary of his estate.the court found,however,that t hose facts do not mean jason did not take on the role of a parent in gus life or is not committed to his welfare.while the parties did not equally share parenting responsibilities,this is often the case in family situations where a parent travels for a living or otherwise,and leaves much of the child rearing to the other parent domestic help.
the court pointed to examples of jason conduct in which he took on a parental role when gus was hospitalized,he was in regular contact with danielle and came to los angeles to see him as soon as his work permitted,he participated in the selection of gus school,he participated in circle time at the first school and little dolphins,he went to some of gus lessons at gus request,he taught gus music,he helped in potty training,and he sought to be involved in parenting decisions regarding gus.the court also noted that third parties,such as dignam,gus pediatrician,and personnel at little dolphins perceived jason as gus father,and that danielle herself recognized jason as a parent to gus,reminding him that the two should not undermine each other and that there was no rank between them i am gus mama and you are his dada.
in short,the statement of decision makes clear that the court finding that there was a relationship between jason and gus was based upon jason conduct,rather than his biological connection to gus.to the extent danielle argues that this finding was erroneous because jason failed to satisfy many of the factors identified in in re th,such as whether the presumed father helped the mother with prenatal care,whether he paid pregnancy and birth expenses,whether he promptly took legal action to obtain custody of the child,and whether he sought to have his name placed on the birth certificate her argument fails because the factors identified in in re are simply factors that courts may consider there is no requirement to show that all or even most of them are satisfied.charisma kristina th,charisma.
the court properly applied the receiving into the home requirement 
in describing section d requirement that the child be received into the presumed parent home,the family law court noted that it requires that the child be physically received into the home,and that constructive receipt is insufficient.citing adoption of kelsey cal th,kelsey.but the court also noted that h istorically there has been a liberal interpretation of receiving as used in the statute.see in re richard cal d.thus,where a child does not live with the person seeking presumed father status,occasional temporary visits were sufficient to meet the receiving requirement particularly where the child has a residence elsewhere.however,where a party has only sporadic visitations with a child or sees the child only incidental to his relationship with the child mother,he will not be found to have received the child into his home,even if the child spent time at the home.a party seeking to establish he is a presumed parent is not required to show that he acted as a parent to the child for a specific period.charisma kristina th,receipt of the child into the home must be sufficiently unambiguous as to constitute a clear declaration regarding the nature of the relationship,but it need not continue for any specific duration.
addressing whether jason satisfied the receiving requirement,the court rejected jason contention that the parties lived as a family in both his santa monica home and danielle home,but it found that jason did receive gus into his home in new york.the court based its finding on the facts that gus regularly spent time at the apartment when jason was living there,jason made arrangements with his assistant to accommodate danielle and gus during their visits,he and gus went to the park when he was not working,he fed,played music for,and read to gus,he arranged for an allergist to see gus in new york,he obtained a baby gate to prevent gus from falling down the stairs in the apartment,and there was a room in the apartment that was designated as gus room when he was there.the court concluded that g iven the historically liberal interpretation of acts sufficient to receive a child into the home and the case law specifically finding that no period of any specific length is required to meet the receiving requirement,the evidence is sufficient to make that finding.
danielle contends the family law court erred by relying upon cases that liberally interpreted the receiving requirement because the statute being interpreted in those cases was california legitimation statute,which provided a method for the father of a child born out of wedlock to legitimate his offspring.she observes that the courts applied a liberal interpretation to the receiving requirement due to the perceived disgrace associated with being an illegitimate child,and cites to kelsey,supra,cal th at pages to in support of her contention that courts have abandoned the liberal interpretation of the requirement.we disagree.
we do not read kelsey as holding that courts should not apply a liberal interpretation to any aspect of the receiving requirement instead,the supreme court held that the requirement no longer could be satisfied by an alleged father constructive receipt of the child into his home.kelsey,supra,cal th at.as the appellate court in charisma observed,a lthough the kelsey court declined to liberally construe the requirement in the case before it,the court did not suggest that actual receipt of a child for a significant duration is required.charisma,supra,th at,fn.omitted see also in re th,juvenile court found that the parental relationship was developed primarily through child visits with presumed father,rather than from living with him.indeed,i f the legislature had intended to require an alleged parent to live with a child for an extended period of time,it would likely have used a different term than receives or added an express durational requirement when it enacted section d.charisma,supra,th at.
despite the family law court references in this case to the liberal standard applied in cases involving the former legitimation statute,the fact is the court applied the standard currently applied in section d cases,as articulated in charisma receipt of the child into the home must be sufficiently unambiguous as to constitute a clear declaration regarding the nature of the relationship,but it need not continue for any specific duration.charisma,supra,th at.in this case,the family law court set forth a list of activities by jason that unambiguously demonstrated a parental relationship with gus during his visits at jason new york apartment danielle assertion that jason conduct was no different than the conduct of a boyfriend of the child mother ignores the activities the court identified,and instead focuses only on what jason did not do.but a parent need not be a perfect parent to be found to have received a child into his or her home.he or she simply must demonstrate a parental relationship,however imperfect.substantial evidence supports the family law court finding that jason did so in this case.
the court properly applied the requirement that the parent hold the child out as his or her own 
addressing the holds out requirement,the court observed that the evidence showing jason was not committed to being a parent to gus at the time of his conception or his birth is strong.although he told a few close friends danielle was expecting his child,he was very selective in the people he chose to make his announcement and became upset when danielle told others.nonetheless,by december,if not earlier,he was actively holding out gus as his child.in support of its finding that jason held gus out as his child no later than december,the court cited the fact that jason went on a tour of little dolphins school that month,signed the school enrollment forms in february,and made a tuition payment.the court concluded the fact is jason publicly acknowledged gus as his child to the school.moreover,the school personnel believed jason to be gus father.
danielle argues that the court finding was improper because jason did not demonstrate that he unequivocally displayed a relationship to the community at large she contends that t he family court did not find that jason did anything more than belatedly identify gus as his biological offspring.we disagree.
first,danielle cites to no law to support her assertion that a presumed father must display his relationship with his child to the community at large,and we have found none.jason was not required to display his relationship to the general public.indeed,having grown up the child and grandchild of celebrities,jason expressed his desire to protect gus from the pressures of being the son of a celebrity a desire shared by many celebrities 
second,danielle contention that the court did not find that jason did anything more than belatedly identify gus as his biological offspring is demonstrably false.there is no question that jason conduct relating to the little dolphins school that the court cited in support of its finding is conduct demonstrating a parental relationship,rather than merely a biological relationship.that evidence is sufficient to support the court finding 
jason initial rejection of a parental relationship does not preclude a finding that he is a presumed parent based upon later conduct 
danielle contends the court finding that jason was a presumed parent was improper because he had categorically stated that he would not be conscripted into fatherhood,and he did not attempt to engage in conduct demonstrating a parental relationship if at all until well after gus birth.she argues that allowing a sperm donor who previously rejected a parental relationship to later seek such a relationship undermines the certainty given to the mother under section b regarding the sperm donor rights.we find no error.
as we noted in our earlier decision,it is not necessary for the person seeking presumed parent status to have entered into the familial relationship from the time of conception or birth.jason i,supra,th at.the fact that jason initially rejected the idea of being a father is irrelevant because with danielle encouragement and permission he slowly developed a relationship with gus.the state has an interest in protecting those kinds of relationships,even when they are belatedly developed,because they give young children social and emotional strength and stability.in re nicholas,supra,cal th at.
allowing jason to seek presumed parentage after he initially rejected the idea of being a parent does not undermine the certainty granted by section b.contrary to danielle assertion,jason did not unfairly ambush danielle with his belated claim for custody.from the time gus was born in december until shortly before jason filed his petition in june,danielle encouraged jason to establish a paternal relationship with gus.she referred to jason as gus dada.she allowed jason to come to her house a lot to spend time with gus in the first few months and asked jason to watch gus while she went for a jog or to yoga class,and was pleased that he was getting attached to gus.she kept jason apprised of medical issues regarding gus,and allowed him to accompany gus to appointments with his pediatrician,identifying jason to the pediatrician as gus father.she told her father in january that she intended for gus to have two and parents.she,jason,and gus went on vacations together as a family.in short,far from being ambushed,danielle fully supported jason developing relationship with gus.
the court reliance on danielle behavior was not improper 
finally,danielle contends the family law court improperly relied upon danielle conduct,rather than focusing only on jason conduct in determining whether jason was a presumed parent.the court reliance on danielle conduct not only was not improper,it was required under the circumstances of this case.
as we explained in our earlier opinion,o ur holding that a sperm donor is not precluded from establishing presumed parentage does not mean that a mother who conceives through assisted reproduction and allows the sperm donor to have some kind of relationship with the child necessarily loses her right to be the sole parent.a mother wishing to retain her sole right to parent her child conceived through assisted reproduction can limit the kind of contact she allows the sperm donor to have with her child to ensure that the relationship does not rise to the level of presumed parent and child.jason i,supra,th at.
the family law court examination of danielle conduct was appropriate and necessary to determine whether danielle attempted to limit the kind of contact jason had with gus to protect her right to be gus sole parent.the court properly found the evidence established that far from trying to limit jason contact to avoid establishing a parental relationship,danielle promoted the establishment of such a relationship having found that,with danielle support and approval,jason received gus into his home,held gus out as his son,and had a parental relationship with him,the court properly declared jason the presumed father of gus.
custody issues 
law governing custody 
in making a custody determination,the family law court must make an award that is in the best interests of the child based upon all the circumstances.burchard garay cal d,keith superior court th,keith.the purpose is to maximize the child opportunity to develop into a stable,adult.the child welfare is paramount and the overarching concern.citation.relevant factors include the child health,safety and welfare,the nature and contact with the parents,and any history of abuse by one parent against the child or other parent.and the friendly parent provision requires the court to consider which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent,subd.a.keith,supra,th at.
section establishes a rebuttable presumption that an award of sole or joint physical or legal custody of a child to a person who has perpetrated domestic violence is detrimental to the best interest of the child.this presumption may only be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,subd.a.the statute provides seven factors the court is to consider in determining whether the presumption has been overcome,subd.b.
the family law court findings 
in considering the health,safety,and welfare of gus,the family law court found that both parents are capable of caring for gus physical needs,based upon the care jason provided gus during the period he had visitation and the care danielle has provided throughout his life.but the court also found that b oth parents demonstrated some deficits in their respective abilities to be protective and supportive of gus emotionally.it found these deficits were evidenced in at least four ways neither parent had sought advice from mental health professionals as to how they should discuss jason into gus life or how to address the many references about this litigation now populating the internet that gus is likely to read at some point the tension between the parents was palpable,as both were still extremely angry and distrustful of the other,which poses a danger to gus emotional jason level of anger toward danielle resulted in him engaging in conduct that resulted in the issuance of a domestic violence restraining order in november and the renewal of that order in december and both parents engaged in a media campaign which was largely driven by their own emotional needs,rather than concern for gus,which is now chronicled on the internet for gus and his friends to read in the years ahead.
the court also found that jason was more likely to facilitate gus relationship with danielle.it found that b y her conduct danielle demonstrated that she intended to restrict jason time with gus.it noted that through her testimony,danielle made it clear that she does not support gus having a relationship with jason because she fears that jason will relay to gus a false narrative rather than her version of the facts related to the parties relationship.the court observed that the evidence compels the conclusion that danielle does not support gus relationship with jason and will likely not do so once the litigation is concluded.
addressing jason history of abuse,the court first observed that i n considering whether the presumption against joint legal or physical custody has been or can be rebutted,it is important to understand the form that the domestic violence took.there is insufficient evidence of any physical violence,and judge moloney expressly rejected such a finding.rather,what marked this relationship was that jason engaged in inappropriate verbal harassment of danielle and disturbed her peace when he did not get his way.the court noted that jason had recently begun taking domestic violence classes,but this was insufficient to rebut the presumption against joint custody at this time.instead,the court found that jason needs to engage in therapy directed to helping him understand that simple insistence together with disrespectful language is not appropriate if one is attempting to raise a child with another parent.further,in part because of jason conduct,the parties have a great deal of trouble communicating.it also is true,however,that danielle did not respond to jason reasonable inquiries.both parties contribute to the communication difficulties.
the court concluded that vesting sole legal custody with danielle,together with a period of counseling for both parties,followed by joint custody is in gus best interest,for several reasons.first,successful completion of a parenting class may rebut the presumption against joint custody.citing,subd.b.second,it is in gus best interest to reduce the level of conflict between the parties,particularly related to the litigation.thus,it is in gus best interest to provide a mechanism regarding future joint legal custody following counseling,as well as a parenting plan.third,there is no showing that communication between the parties so as to exercise joint custody will compromise danielle safety.considering the form the domestic violence took,completion of individual counseling by jason and participation in joint counseling by both parties will be sufficient to rebut the presumption against joint custody.finally,as described above,jason is the parent more likely to facilitate gus relationship with the other parent.in these circumstances shared physical custody is thus ultimately in gus best interest.the sharing of joint physical custody,without joint legal custody,would present numerous practical difficulties which would not benefit gus.
danielle arguments on appeal 
arguments raised in appellant opening brief 
danielle contends in her opening brief that the family law court erred by concluding that the section presumption against awarding joint custody to a person who has perpetrated domestic violence carries less force when the domestic violence did not involve physical violence and ordering joint custody before jason presented evidence that he had successfully completed the treatment to address his anger issues.
with regard to danielle first contention,we do not read the court discussion regarding jason domestic violence as concluding that the section presumption carried less force because it did not involve physical violence.rather,we understand the court observations about the conduct that led to the domestic violence finding to have been made in the context of determining what should be required to rebut the section presumption.
for example,one of the factors the court must consider in determining whether the presumption is rebutted is whether the domestic violence perpetrator has successfully completed a batterer treatment program,subd.b.the court reasonably could conclude,in light of the absence of evidence of physical violence,that completion of a batterer treatment program was not necessary to rebut the presumption,and instead that completion of a program of counseling to address the kind of harassment involved in this case was sufficient.we find no error in this conclusion.
danielle second contention has some merit.at the time the court entered its custody order,it found that jason had not yet rebutted the section presumption,but that the presumption would be rebutted once jason completed six months of individual counseling focusing on helping him to develop tools to deal with his anger and frustration,and he and danielle participated in joint counseling focused on raising the level of trust between them and improving their communication.the court also found it was in gus best interest to provide a mechanism for future joint legal custody,because a ny other result would require that the court make only interim orders that would result in further litigation and again raise the level of parental conflict,which is not beneficial to gus.
the court was rightly concerned about making an order designed to avoid further litigation.the animosity shown by the parties in this litigation who had spent almost million in attorney fees by the time judgment was entered was substantial.but as beneficial as it might be to gus to avoid further litigation,the section presumption must be rebutted by evidence.see,subd.a this presumption may only be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.and at the time it made its custody order,the court had not yet received any evidence that jason and danielle had participated in the counseling needed to rebut the presumption.therefore,the court was not empowered to award joint custody to jason,even if that joint custody was to be delayed for six months.
our conclusion that the court could not award jason joint custody at the time it entered the custody order does not mean that the order must be unconditionally reversed in its entirety.two years have passed since the order was entered.if,during these two years,jason has completed the ordered individual counseling and he and danielle have participated in the ordered joint counseling,there would be no need to disturb the custody order.therefore,we will conditionally reverse the order and remand the matter with directions to the family law court to conduct limited proceedings to make a determination based on evidence as to whether the ordered counseling has been completed such that the section presumption has been rebutted the court has discretion to limit the scope and nature of the evidence necessary to make this determination.if the court determines the section presumption has been rebutted,the court may reinstate the custody order.if the court determines the presumption has not been rebutted,it shall enter a new custody order,taking into account that the section presumption has not yet been rebutted.
arguments raised in appellant reply brief 
in addition to the two contentions she asserted in her opening brief,danielle raised two new arguments regarding the custody order in her appellant reply brief.she argues that the family law court erred by considering which parent was more likely to facilitate gus relationship with the other parent in making its custody order,in contravention of section,subdivision b hereafter,section b citing ellis lyons th ellis,and by ordering a visitation schedule despite the section presumption citing celia hugo th celia.
ordinarily,we would not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief,because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.reichardt hoffman th.but we will consider them in this case because the arguments are based upon two cases that were decided after the opening brief was filed we need not provide jason an opportunity to counter the arguments because they do not affect the outcome of this case.
as to danielle first argument,we disagree with parts of the analysis in the case upon which she relies,and in any event,the case is distinguishable.
in ellis,the mother and father shared joint legal and physical custody of their child.ellis,supra,th at.after the father got into a physical altercation with his adult in the child presence,the mother obtained a domestic violence abuse prevention order from a court in massachusetts,where she lived.id.at.the mother then filed in california a request for modification of the child custody and support orders,seeking sole legal and physical custody of the child,with supervised visitation in massachusetts for the father.id.at.the family law court in california conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the incident on which the domestic violence order was based,and found that the incident lasted less than one minute,there were no injuries,and the child was not harmed and did not fear for her safety.id.at.it concluded that the child best interests would not be served by restricting the father custodial rights.id.at.the court made no reference to section in its ruling,and expressly relied upon section in concluding that denial of the mother request for sole custody was in the child best interest.ibid.
our colleagues in division five found the family law court committed reversible error by relying on section in determining the best interests of the child because it was precluded from doing so by section b.ellis,supra,th at.
the court began its analysis by stating the outcome of this appeal turns almost entirely on the dictates of section.the statute establishes a rebuttable presumption that joint or sole custody for a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence is not in a child best interests.this presumption,which shifts the usual burden of persuasion,need only be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.but what a court may not do under the statute and what the family law court did here is rely in whole or in part on section preference for frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent,subd.b.ellis,supra,th at.
the court found that despite the family law court belief that the incident at issue did not rise to the level of domestic violence,the issuance of a domestic violence abuse prevention order by the massachusetts court meant that the section rebuttable presumption necessarily applied.ellis,supra,th at.the appellate court observed that there was no indication that the family law court applied the section presumption or expressly considered the factors that section directs a court to consider in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted,and noted that other courts have held that thi
