danilo reed husband had an extramarital relationship with plaintiff rhina mejia that led to the birth of a child.in a later divorce proceeding,husband and violeta reed wife entered into a marital settlement agreement msa under which husband transferred all his interest in jointly held real property to wife.plaintiff claimed that the purpose of this transfer was to prevent her from collecting child support,and she asked the court to impose a lien on the real property.the trial court rejected her contentions and entered summary judgment for husband.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court,holding that a transfer of real property under an could be found invalid under the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.because that holding conflicted with another court of appeal decision,gagan gouyd th,d,we granted review.we conclude that the court of appeal in this case correctly held that the provisions of the ufta apply to marital settlement agreements.
that conclusion requires us to address an additional issue.under the ufta,a transfer can be invalid either because of actual fraud,subd.a or constructive fraud,subd.b,one form of constructive fraud is a transfer by a debtor,without receiving equivalent value in return,if the debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer or rendered insolvent by the transfer.the court of appeal held that there were triable issues of fact relating to both actual fraud and constructive fraud.husband sought review only of the holding relating to constructive fraud that holding rested on the proposition that a person is insolvent under section if the person assets are less than the discounted cumulative value of future child support obligations.we disagree,and hold that the discounted value of future child support,because it is generally paid from future income rather than current assets,should not be considered in determining solvency under section.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the case for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
the facts are taken from the court of appeal opinion.husband and wife were married in.in,husband had an extramarital relationship with plaintiff.their daughter was born in february.in may,wife petitioned for dissolution of her marriage to husband.they entered into an under which husband conveyed all his interest in the couple real estate to wife,and she conveyed her interest in husband medical practice to him.the provided that husband would be solely responsible for his extramarital child support obligation.the was merged into a judgment of dissolution entered in august.

plaintiff,who had a pending paternity suit against husband,filed a lis pendens against the real property awarded wife under the msa.the trial court in the paternity action awarded plaintiff child support of per month,but it ruled that plaintiff had no standing to challenge the transfer of property under the msa.the court later increased child support to per month plus per month for day care,or a monthly total of.

in response,plaintiff asserted that the transfer was accompanied by certain badges of fraud from which the trier of fact could infer intent to defraud.she presented an expert evaluation appraising the fair market value of husband medical practice at.another expert calculated the discounted value of future child support at to on the assumption that child support,based on husband earning potential,would be set at to monthly plus per month for child care expenses.under the lowest of these figures,the discounted value of future child support would still exceed the appraised value of husband practice.
the trial court assumed that the ufta applied to the msa,but it granted husband summary judgment motion on the grounds that no evidence was presented of actual intent to defraud,and the transfer did not render husband insolvent.the court of appeal reversed,holding that although the ufta applies to marital settlement agreements,triable issues of fact precluded summary judgment.

following these principles of statutory construction,we turn first to the text of the ufta and the family code.
a.the statutory texts 
the uniform fraudulent transfer act 
the ufta was enacted in it is the most recent in a line of statutes dating to the reign of queen elizabeth this act,like its predecessor and the statute of elizabeth,declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims.legis.com,west ann.ed.foll.under the ufta,a transfer is fraudulent,both as to present and future creditors,if it is made w ith actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.even without actual fraudulent intent,a transfer may be fraudulent as to present creditors if the debtor did not receive a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.
on its face,the ufta applies to all transfers.civil code,section,subdivision i defines t ransfer as every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset the ufta excepts only certain transfers resulting from lease terminations or lien enforcement,subd.e.thus,the ufta on its face encompasses transfers made under an msa.consequently,most decisions of other states construing parallel provisions of the ufta hold that it does apply to marital property transfers,including those in connection with divorce.see,scholes lehmann cir,applying law kardynalski fisher d,dowell dennis,greeninger cromwell,see also federal deposit ins.malin cir,under new york law,ufta applies but was good faith purchaser for value but see britt damson cir,law witbart witbart.civil code section provides expressly that the ufta shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law among states enacting it.
husband here points to section of the ufta,which provides unless displaced by the provisions of this chapter,the principles of law and equity,including the law merchant and the law relating to principal and agent,estoppel,laches,fraud,misrepresentation,duress,coercion,mistake,insolvency,or other validating or invalidating cause,supplement its provisions.he argues that family code section is a law that supplement s the provisions of the ufta by,in effect,establishing an exception to its provisions.but to supplement the ufta means to provide something additional to the law,not to narrow or nullify the law.this point is illustrated in monastra konica business machines,th,d.the defendants there argued that compliance with the bulk sales act cal,et immunized a transfer from attack under the ufta.the court of appeal disagreed,concluding that the protections given creditors under the bulk sales law supplemented,that is,added to the protections of the ufta.monastra konica business machines,supra,at,d.
the family code 
before,a spouse who received community property after a dissolution of marriage was liable for the community debts incurred by the other spouse during the marriage.dawes rich th,d see packard arellanes cal.frankel boyd cal.thus,a creditor of one spouse could often reach any property transferred to the other without resorting to an action to set aside a fraudulent transfer.nevertheless,that remedy was available when needed to invalidate a fraudulent transfer made under an msa.see,mcknight superior court d.
in,however,the legislature substantially changed the postmarital liability of spouses.the legislature determined that,under most circumstances,after a marriage has ended,it is unwise to continue the liability of spouses for community debts incurred by former spouses.dawes rich,supra,th at,d.it enacted former civil code section,which provided in pertinent part that,upon the dissolution of the marriage,the property received by a married person in the division is not liable for a debt incurred by the person spouse before or during marriage,and the person is not personally liable for the debt,unless the debt was assigned for payment by the person in the division of the property.stats,ch.when the family code was enacted in,civil code section became family code section.
when the legislature enacted former civil code section,it contemplated that i n allocating the debts to the parties,the court in the dissolution proceeding should take into account the rights of creditors so there will be available sufficient property to satisfy the debt by the person to whom the debt is assigned,provided the net division is equal.lezine security pacific fin.services,cal th,d,quoting recommendation relating to liability of marital property for debts cal.law revision com,fn.omitted.family code section,however,provides except upon the written agreement of the parties,or on oral stipulation of the parties in open court,or as otherwise provided in this division,in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation of the parties,the court shall divide the community estate of the parties equally.italics added.whenever,as in this case,the parties agree upon the property division,no law requires them to divide the property equally,and the court does not scrutinize the to ensure that it sets out an equal division.in re marriage of cream th,d.
the only statutory exception to family code section grant of immunity from liability is a provision that preserves the liability of property subject to a preexisting lien,subd.a the statute does not mention fraudulent transfers.thus,on its face,family code section would appear to protect transfers of marital property incident to divorce from being set aside under the ufta.we note,however,that section states that it applies n otwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.similar language appeared in former civil code section.this language indicates that section may be subordinate to other statutes,such as the ufta,not included in the same chapter of the family code as section.
canons of statutory construction 
the parties call our attention to familiar canons of statutory interpretation,but these offer no assistance in resolving the apparent conflict between the statutes at issue here.husband argues that the principle that specific provisions take precedence over general provisions see code civ,collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d,is controlling.he asserts that family code section,because it discusses only transfers in an msa,is more specific than the ufta,which regulates all transactions,and should therefore prevail over the ufta.but one could as easily describe the ufta as pertaining to only fraudulent transactions,and thus at least as specific as section,which concerns all marital settlement transactions.neither statute appears to be significantly more specific than the other.
plaintiff bases her argument on the adage of expressio unis est exclusio expression of some things implies the exclusion of things not expressed.she argues that the legislature,when it enacted the ufta,knew how to make a specific exemption for transfers under an it made exceptions for some other she asks us to infer from the absence of an exception for marital settlements that the legislature must have intended the ufta to apply to marital settlement transactions.but one can equally argue that the legislature,when it enacted former civil code section and later recodified that provision as family code section,knew how to make an exception for fraudulent transfers,but chose not to do so.both the ufta and the family code govern discrete subject areas,and the legislature failure to legislate expressly with respect to the rare instance in which they overlap does not suggest any legislative intent as to which should prevail.
legislative history 
husband argues that the history of former civil code section the predecessor to family code section shows that the legislature did not intend to allow creditors to challenge an msa.in,when the legislature was considering former section,carol bruch,a law professor at the university of california at davis,proposed that the new law provide for notice to creditors and grant them a right to intervene in the dissolution proceedings.in connection with this proposal,she suggested amending the measure to provide that the section would not bar recovery by a creditor who was not notified,or did not approve the proposed marital settlement,and successfully challenges the property division as a fraudulent conveyance in a motion to set aside the property division filed within years after entry of the judgment dividing the property.carol bruch,davis law school,suggested amendments to assem.bill reg.sess.the law revision commission rejected professor bruch suggested amendments,saying carol proposes adoption of a bankruptcy or probate type scheme for imposing liability after dissolution of marriage,involving notice and an opportunity to appear for creditors,and fraudulent conveyance standards.while this scheme is theoretically interesting,the commission rejected it because of the extensive procedures involved.it would transform simple divorce cases into elaborate proceedings involving many parties.we are unwilling to burden our bill with this carol can prepare and sponsor her own bill next session to adopt this sort of scheme if she is able to perfect it.nathaniel sterling,cal.law revision,letter to assemblyman alistair mcallister.this historical account could support an inference that the legislature did not intend to permit creditors to attack an msa,
