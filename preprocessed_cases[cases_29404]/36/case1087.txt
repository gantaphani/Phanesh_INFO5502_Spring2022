in connection with the jurisdictional hearing,the social worker recommended that under section,subdivision b and,father not be granted reunification services because he had failed to reunify with older brother,had failed to comply with the case plan,and thereafter had not made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to the brother removal.the court sustained an amended petition under section,subdivisions b and j.dcfs was ordered to review the prior dependency case concerning and provide a supplemental report on the status of father current counseling,if any.
dcfs reported in february that during the prior dependency case,father and mother had been ordered to complete parenting education classes and individual counseling to address domestic violence issues.father had completed a parenting course,but had enrolled in individual counseling only after family reunification services had been terminated.father did not successfully complete the program.as to the present case,dcfs reported father telephone number was out of service,he had not provided a new number,and he had not kept in touch with the social worker since detention.father had not visited during the past three weeks.the dcfs report recommended that family reunification services not be offered to father.
