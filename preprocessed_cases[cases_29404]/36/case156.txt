opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from the denial of a petition for the return of a child to australia under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction.the principal issue is whether the district court correctly held the petitioner consented to the removal or retention of the child under article a of the hague convention,defeating his claim for return.see baxter baxter,d.we will reverse and remand.
henry baxter initiated this proceeding on may,by filing a petition in the district court of delaware seeking the expedited return of his old son torin to australia.the petition alleges that his wife,jody amanda baxter,wrongfully retained torin in the united states under the convention,and that torin custody should be decided by an australian court.
although the parties disagree on the reasons for baxter and torin trip to delaware,the factual background is straightforward.on september,baxter and torin traveled to the united states from australia without baxter.they took up residence at the home of baxter mother and sister in selbyville,delaware within two weeks of her arrival,baxter commenced a relationship with kelly stidham,a local contractor working on a project at her mother house.fourteen days later,baxter and torin moved in with stidham.a few days thereafter,baxter telephoned her husband in australia and demanded a divorce.baxter and torin have since been living in the home of stidham.
before september,torin and his parents lived together as a family in australia their lifestyle was itinerant.during the first four years of torin life,the family lived in several remote settlements in the australian outback,and also spent a year in ireland.baxter moved from job to job,and the family moved from place to place.the baxters last home together was on bathurst island,an aboriginal community in the tiwi islands,in australia rugged northern territory.by all accounts,their stay there was short and troubled.the community was beset with problems,including petrol sniffing and domestic violence.the couple eventually decided the environment was unsuitable for their child,and that baxter and torin should leave bathurst island and travel to the united states to visit torin grandmother and aunt,whom the child had never met.
the parties dispute whether the purpose of the trip to delaware was to relocate definitively in the united states or to visit relatives for a time while giving the family an opportunity to plot a new course.the evidence demonstrates that baxter and torin flew to the on tickets,and that baxter took with her important personal and family documents at the same time,they left behind in australia with baxter a large number of possessions,including personal effects and toys.
the district court conducted a full evidentiary hearing where the parties and other witnesses testified.affidavits were entered into the record without objection.baxter testified that before learning of his wife affair with stidham,he had planned to rejoin his family in delaware for the christmas holidays.he sent a letter to his employer on the tiwi islands asking for leave in december,and purchased an airplane ticket to the united states.baxter testified that he was open to the idea of looking for work in the during the trip,but that it might not prove feasible.otherwise,he claims the plan was that the family would probably return to australia,once he found a new job and a new place for them to live.the parties agree there was no talk of divorce or separation prior to baxter and torin departure.
for her part,baxter testified that the idea of the trip was to escape the troubled community on bathurst island while baxter tried to establish a new business selling water purifiers to remote outback dwellings.she testified that the move to the united states was permanent,because baxter did want to worry about us.on the other hand,she admitted that the plan was for baxter to rejoin her and torin in delaware over christmas.she also testified that it was until she met stidham that everything changed and she decided to end her marriage and live with stidham.
the testimony from baxter family is also inconclusive about the trip purpose.her sister testified,based on telephone conversations prior to baxter and torin arrival,that the primary goal of the trip was to visit family,and that exploring the possibility of a move to the was secondary.her mother,on the other hand,testified that baxter and torin were coming over to live,and to establish a home,education.baxter mother enclosed a porch in her house to create a play space for torin benefit,indicating her expectation that the visit would be.
the district court found under the hague convention that australia was the habitual residence of the child until the time of the move to delaware.baxter,d at.the court noted that a purpose of the trip was to explore the possibility of a permanent move,but found there was no intent to resolve this matter until after baxter and torin arrival.id.at.nevertheless,the court concluded that baxter had consented to torin removal to the united states,defeating his claim for return of the child under the hague convention.id.baxter filed this timely appeal.
we have appellate jurisdiction under.the district court had jurisdiction under,as this action arose under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,and its implementing legislation,the international child abduction remedies act,et.icara.under icara,state and federal district courts have concurrent original jurisdiction over actions arising under the convention.a.
we review the district court findings of historical and narrative facts for clear error,but exercise plenary review over the court application of legal precepts to the facts.delvoye lee,cir feder,cir see also beta spawn,ffe transp,cir this court has plenary review over the district court choice and interpretation of legal standards,and its application of those standards to the facts of the case.
the hague convention has two main purposes to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.hague convention.any person seeking the return of a child under the convention may commence a civil action by filing a petition in a court where the child is located.b.more broadly,the convention procedures are designed to restore the status quo prior to any wrongful removal or retention,and to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases.see feder,at.the convention is not designed to settle international custody disputes,but rather to ensure that cases are heard in the proper court.see hague convention,art.a decision under this convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.
under article of the convention,the removal or retention of a child is wrongful where 
it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention.to obtain an order for the child return,the petitioner bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal or retention was wrongful under article.e a.if this burden is met and the petition is filed within the appropriate time frame,the convention requires courts to order the return of the child forthwith.hague convention.
wrongful removal or retention claims under article of the convention typically raise four issues for analysis when the removal or retention at issue occurred,the country in which the child was habitually resident prior to the removal or retention,whether the removal or retention breached the custody rights of the petitioner,and whether the petitioner was exercising those custody rights at the time of the removal or retention.see mozes mozes,cir see also feder,at holding wrongful retention inquiry centers on whether petitioner custody rights under law of country of habitual residence were breached by the retention,and whether petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of the retention.if the court finds wrongful removal or retention,the burden shifts to the respondent to prove an affirmative defense to the return of the child to the country of habitual residence under article of the convention.the respondent must prove the defense of consent or acquiescence to the removal or retention by a preponderance of the evidence,or the defense of a grave risk of harm by clear and convincing evidence.e.the affirmative defenses are narrowly construed to effectuate the purposes of the convention,and even finding an exception under article does not automatically preclude an order of return.see hague international child abduction convention text and legal analysis,friedrich friedrich,cir.
baxter contends on appeal that the district court misapplied article of the convention by failing to give proper consideration to his wrongful retention claim.the court terminated its analysis after holding that baxter consented to torin removal from australia at the time of his departure.it did not address wrongful retention,even though this was the principal contention of baxter petition.the crux of baxter appeal is that his consent to torin trip to united states was under the assumption that the family would reunite at christmas and then in all likelihood return to australia.he contends that his wife decision to retain torin permanently in delaware was unilateral and breached his custody rights.
as a preliminary matter,the district court ruled that torin habitual residence prior to the contested removal or retention was australia.although not an issue contested on appeal,the finding is supported by the record.we have defined a child habitual residence as the place where he or she has been physically present for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and which has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.feder,at delvoye,at.the inquiry must focus on the child and consists of an analysis of the child circumstances in that place and the parents present,shared intentions regarding their child presence there.feder,at delvoye,at.on the facts here,delaware does not qualify as torin habitual residence prior to removal.
the district court found the baxters disagreed whether the move to the united states was permanent or merely intended as a first step towards finding a suitable residence for the child outside australia.baxter,d at.the finding that the baxters had decided to leave australia definitively is unsupported and will be set aside as clearly erroneous.the finding is belied by the court own conclusions that australia remained the country of habitual residence at the time of removal,and that the baxters were undecided about their next residence.the court found it is clear from the evidence that the parties did not intend to resolve this question in any event until after respondent and the child had moved to the united states.id.the only uncontradicted record evidence of settled intent by the parties was to move away from the harsh circumstances of the tiwi islands.at the time of baxter and torin departure in september,nothing in the record indicates that a subsequent return to australia,to a more tolerable location for torin,had been ruled out.the record establishes that the parties saw the trip in the first instance as an opportunity to escape from the disagreeable circumstances of bathurst island,to visit family,and to buy time to plan their next move.this falls short of the settled purpose required under the convention for a finding that the country of habitual residence has been abandoned.
after addressing habitual residence,the district court proceeded directly to examine baxter affirmative defense of consent without analyzing the remaining elements of baxter article claim.see hague convention,mozes,at noting that article raises four issues for courts to determine when the removal or retention at issue occurred,the country of habitual residence,whether the removal or retention breached petitioner custody rights,and whether petitioner was actually exercising those custody rights at the time of the removal or retention.the district court analysis focused only on the circumstances of the departure from australia removal,not baxter subsequent decision to remain permanently in delaware with torin retention.the court focus was too narrow.as noted,the crux of baxter claim was wrongful retention,not wrongful removal the relevant heading in his petition was titled the removal and wrongful retention of torin.
nor did the district court address whether torin removal or retention breached baxter custody rights under australian law,or whether baxter actually exercised his custody rights at the time of the removal or retention hague convention.baxter does not dispute that baxter has rights of joint custody over torin under australian law.furthermore,the record demonstrates that baxter actually exercised his custody rights under article at the time of the removal and retention.baxter alleged in her submission that after their arrival in delaware,her husband provided no financial support and his only contact with his son consisted of infrequent phone calls.but they had only been gone a few weeks before baxter told her husband she had decided to remain in delaware with torin.reduced contact or lack of financial support over such a short period of time is insufficient under the convention to demonstrate that a parent has ceased exercising custody rights.prior to their departure,the baxters lived together as a family and there was no allegation of.moreover,as with the article a defenses of consent and acquiescence discussed in part iii.b,infra,the test for finding the of custody rights under the hague convention is stringent.see friedrich,at the only acceptable solution,in the absence of a ruling from a court in the country of habitual residence,is to liberally find exercise whenever a parent with de jure custody rights keeps,or seeks to keep,any sort of regular contact with his or her child i f a person has valid custody rights to a child under the law of the country of the child habitual residence,that person can not fail to exercise those custody rights under the hague convention short of acts that constitute clear and unequivocal abandonment of the child.see also sealed appellant sealed appellee,cir.
in holding that baxter consented to torin removal,the district court relied on its finding that and baxter agreed it was in the best interests of the child to remove the child to the united states.baxter,d at.the court pointed to the family negative experience in the tiwi islands,the purchase of tickets,taking the family documents,and hiring the contractor to enclose the porch of the house in delaware as facts pointing to consent to removal.id.at.but the court did not address the nature or scope of baxter consent.nor did it address whether baxter consented to or even contemplated his wife permanent retention of torin in delaware.
baxter contends that under the convention,once a court finds the petitioner has consented to the child initial removal,the inquiry ends and there is no need to address retention.this argument is based on the text of article a provision that a child need not be returned if the petitioner had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention.baxter contends that analyzing retention as well as removal would amount to rewriting article a to read in the removal and retention.
this argument misreads the convention.the words removal or retention refer to whichever may be relevant to the case at hand,and create a multiple,not alternative,obligation.in other words,the use of the word or in article a of the convention is not disjunctive in the sense of indicating an alternative between mutually exclusive things.see wanninger wanninger,the hague co
