by petition for writ of mandate or prohibition,john eisendrath seeks relief from orders of the trial court regarding his mediation confidentiality rights under evidence code sections and et.
after eisendrath filed a motion to correct a spousal support agreement reached through mediation,real party in interest kathryn pratt rogers sought to depose the mediator.eisendrath requested a protective order intended to bar discovery and evidence regarding mediation communications,with the exception of certain conversations between himself and rogers that formed the basis of his motion to correct the spousal support agreement.the trial court found that eisendrath had impliedly waived his confidentiality rights,denied the protective order,and decided to hold an in camera hearing on the mediator potential testimony to determine whether it should be admitted.
we conclude that the trial court erred on these matters.however,we also conclude that unless eisendrath and rogers execute suitable express waivers,any protective order must also bar admission of all confidential conversations between eisendrath and rogers that may be cited in eisendrath motion to correct the spousal support agreement.
we therefore grant the relief requested in the petition in part,deny it in part,and remand for further proceedings.
relevant procedural background 
eisendrath and rogers were married in.their marriage produced two children,maxwell,born in,and samuel,born in.
eisendrath filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in february.in february,eisendrath and rogers began mediation with ronald rosenfeld as mediator.
before commencing mediation,they executed a mediation agreement that expressly states that the mediation was governed by evidence code sections and et.in addition,the mediation agreement provides we agree that what is said in our sessions with ronald rosenfeld will be treated as confidential information,and that all communications with ronald rosenfeld are privileged and not admissible in court or subject to discovery.we further agree that ronald rosenfeld will not be called as a witness,nor will his notes memoranda be subpoenaed by either of us in any legal proceeding.we further agree that ronald rosenfeld notes memoranda shall not be released to either of us under any circumstances,and ronald rosenfeld may destroy said materials at his discretion.
on april,the trial court filed a stipulated judgment of dissolution that contained orders regarding child custody and visitation,child support,and spousal support.under the heading family support,the judgment provides in paragraph eisendrath is ordered to pay rogers as family support child support and spousal support per month for months commencing november,and continuing for a period of months thereafter furthermore,paragraph.g of the judgment provides if rogers remarries,or cohabits with another person in a relationship,eisendrath shall nevertheless remain obligated to pay rogers the family support set forth in paragraph above,but rogers in her sole discretion may elect to modify or limit eisendrath remaining family support obligation by reducing the spousal support component the sum of per month 
eisendrath and rogers each remarried following the judgment of dissolution.on october,eisendrath filed a motion to correct or reform the judgment under code of civil procedure section and family code sections and the motion contended that paragraphs and.g of the judgment did not accurately reflect their agreement.according to the motion,eisendrath was not represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of the judgment,and he missed language which was contrary to those provisions upon which the parties had already agreed.
in support of the motion,eisendrath submitted a declaration that he was not represented by counsel while he and rogers negotiated and executed the judgment.according to the declaration,b efore and during the execution of the judgment,they discussed generally how to handle support in a way that would be most beneficial to both of them financially.
regarding paragraph,eisendrath stated that he specifically recalled one conversation prior to the signing of the judgment in which he and rogers agreed that family support was to be taxable.eisendrath further indicated that he had overlooked the term family support when he reviewed and signed the judgment.
regarding paragraph.g,eisendrath stated that in negotiations and conversations during the time period mediation was proceeding,he understood that not to have the discretion to continue spousal support if rogers remarried.according to eisendrath,he and rogers discussed these provisions numerous times before and during the execution of the judgment.eisendrath further stated that upon rogers remarriage,she had expected him to continue to pay spousal support,even though this was inconsistent with the position she took when we negotiated,signed and otherwise discussed those provisions of the judgment.
on october,rogers filed a motion for a continuance so that she could depose rosenfeld.she stated that she was willing to waive her confidentiality rights regarding the mediation,and contended that eisendrath had constructively waived any privilege relating to settlement negotiations and mediation by discussing these matters in his declaration.she also indicated that rosenfeld had asserted the mediation privilege,and would not agree to be deposed.
eisendrath opposed this motion,and requested a protective order barring rosenfeld deposition,discovery into the mediation,and admission of any communication during the mediation sessions.he argued that his motion to correct or reform the judgment rested solely on conversations with rogers outside the mediation sessions.although he conceded that these conversations did not represent the totality of the discussions,he stated that he would not rely on discussions within the scope of mediation confidentiality.
furthermore,eisendrath contended that the confidentiality statutes and confidentiality provision of the mediation agreement barred rogers discovery.according to eisendrath,in addition,his confidentiality rights under evidence code section et,could not be waived absent his express consent,which he had not given,and that evidence code section barred testimony from rosenfeld.
following a hearing,the trial court filed an order on january,that denied eisendrath request for a protective order found that eisendrath and rogers had impliedly waived the mediation privilege in evidence code section et,and their right to assert rosenfeld immunity under evidence code section and ordered an in camera hearing to determine whether rosenfeld should be compelled to testify 
petitioner filed his petition and request for a stay on january.on february,we issued an order to show case and a temporary stay.
discussion 
eisendrath contends that the trial court erred in finding that he had impliedly waived his confidentiality rights under evidence code section et,and in ordering an in camera hearing to assess potential testimony from rosenfeld,notwithstanding section.he argues that the statutes governing mediation confidentiality do not permit implied waivers of confidentiality rights,and bar testimony from rosenfeld.
rogers disagrees,contending that eisendrath statutory confidentiality rights are akin to the statutory privileges defined in section et.these privileges can be waived by conduct amounting to consent,subd.a,and in some cases,by the tendering of claims that raise issues within the scope of the pertinent privilege.rogers argues that unless eisendrath confidentiality rights are subject to these implied waiver principles,he will seek to alter their spousal support agreement while unfairly preventing her from presenting evidence regarding the negotiation of that agreement.similarly,she argues that testimony from rosenfeld is necessary for proper resolution of eisendrath motion to correct the agreement.
the trial court agreed with rogers on these matters.in our view,this was error.as we explain below,confidential mediation communications are not admissible absent eisendrath express consent see pt,post,and testimony from rosenfeld is absolutely barred under the circumstances of this case see pt,post.
nonetheless,we also conclude that eisendrath motion to correct the judgment itself relies wholly,or in large measure,on confidential mediation communications that are admissible only with the parties express consent see pt,post.we will therefore remand the matter to the trial court to give the mediation participants including,if necessary,rosenfeld an opportunity to enter express waivers regarding the confidential communications relevant to eisendrath motion to correct the judgment,and absent such waivers,to enter a protective order barring discovery into,and admission of,rosenfeld testimony and all confidential communications,including any such communications cited in eisendrath motion.
statutory scheme governing mediation confidentiality 
because the resolution of these issues hinges on the proper interpretation of the statutes in question,we begin with a description of the pertinent statutory scheme as our supreme court explained in foxgate homeowners bramalea california,cal th,d,foxgate,this statutory scheme implements a strong legislative policy regarding the confidentiality of mediation.
under this scheme,mediation means a process in which a neutral person or persons facilitate communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement,and mediation consultation means a communication between a person and a mediator for the purpose of initiating,considering,or reconvening a mediation or retaining the mediator,subds.a,c.the scheme applies to all mediations,with limited exceptions not applicable here.
section states the fundamental rule regarding confidentiality of mediation communications.it provides a no evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the evidence shall not be compelled,in any civil action in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.c all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions by and between participants in the course of a mediation or a mediation consultation shall remain confidential.
the statutory scheme places several limits on this broad rule.to begin,section provides that a mediation ends for the purposes of confidentiality when the parties execute a suitable settlement agreement,or when the participants execute a writing terminating the mediation.thus,the confidentiality protections do not apply to any later proceedings,such as attempts to further refine the content of the agreement.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.supp.foll.nonetheless,confidential communications made before the end of the mediation remain confidential after the mediation ends.
other provisions state exceptions to the confidentiality rule for mediation agreements,disclosure of the mediator identity,and settlement agreements that emerge from the mediation,and some categories of evidence used in the mediation.finally,the statutory scheme specifies two circumstances under which mediation participants may agree to the disclosure of mediation communications.
first,the statutory scheme permits mediation communications to be disclosed or admitted if a ll persons who conduct or otherwise participate in the mediation expressly agree in writing,or enter into a recorded oral agreement that is memorialized in writing in a timely fashion,subd.a.the phrase a ll persons,as used here,includes not only parties but also the mediator and other nonparties attending the mediation cal.law revision com,pt.west ann,supra,foll,italics added.
second,communications prepared by or on behalf of fewer than all the mediation participants may be disclosed or admitted upon such waivers from the relevant participants,provided that these communications do not disclose anything said or done or any admission made in the course of the mediation,subd.a.
the statutory scheme also limits disclosures by the mediator.section provides that absent a written agreement or suitable oral agreement from all the parties to the mediation,n either a mediator nor anyone else may submit to a court or other adjudicative body,and a court or other adjudicative body may not consider,any report,assessment,evaluation,recommendation,or finding of any kind by the mediator concerning a mediation conducted by the mediator,other than a report that is mandated by court rule or other law and that states only whether an agreement was reached 
this restriction supplements section,which provides with qualifications that are not applicable here no mediator shall be competent to testify,in any subsequent civil proceeding,as to any statement,conduct,decision,or ruling,occurring at or in conjunction with the prior proceeding 
no implied waiver 
the first issue raised by eisendrath is whether mediation participants can waive their confidentiality rights in an implied manner,by raising a claim about the agreement reached through mediation.although there is no case law on point,we find guidance on this issue in foxgate,supra,cal th,d.
in foxgate,a mediator submitted a report to the trial court stating that a participant had engaged in misconduct during mediation proceedings.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.after the trial court awarded sanctions,the court of appeal reversed and remanded the matter because the trial court order was insufficiently detailed under code of civil procedure section.foxgate,at,d.
for the guidance of the trial court,the court of appeal addressed whether the mediator report could support sanctions.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.despite the unqualified ban on mediator reports in section,it concluded that policy considerations warranted a nonstatutory exception to this ban for reports of misconduct.id.at,d.applying the rule that unambiguous statutes are subject to judicial construction when literal interpretation would lead to an absurd result or defeat manifest legislative purposes times mirror superior court cal d,fn,the court of appeal reasoned that the nonstatutory exception was necessary to ensure good faith conduct in mediations.foxgate,at,d.
our supreme court rejected the court of appeal determination on this matter.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.it determined that the language of sections and was clear,as was the legislative intent underlying the statutory scheme,namely,to promote mediation by ensuring confidentiality.foxgate,at,d.furthermore,it determined that the nonstatutory exception was not needed to avoid absurd results or to expedite legislative goals,reasoning that in enacting the scheme,the legislature had balanced the policy that promotes effective mediation through confidentiality against a policy of encouraging good faith conduct in mediation through disclosure of misconduct.id.at,d.
the court in foxgate thus stated to carry out the purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality,the statutory scheme,which includes sections,and,unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
nonetheless,the foxgate court left open the possibility that mediators may be compelled to disclose confidential communications in extraordinary circumstances,notwithstanding the statutory scheme.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.it discussed two cases in which the courts had permitted such testimony,and distinguished these cases on their facts,without rejecting them.ibid.
in the first of these cases,rinaker superior court th,d rinaker,two youths were charged with vandalism after they allegedly threw rocks at a car,and the car owner also brought a civil harassment action against them.the owner and the youths then participated in a voluntary mediation to resolve the harassment action.ibid.during juvenile delinquency proceedings,the youths sought to impeach the owner with testimony from the mediator that the owner had admitted in the mediation that he had not seen the rock throwers.ibid.the court in rinaker concluded that the statutory ban on the disclosure of mediation communications yielded to the youths constitutional rights to confr
