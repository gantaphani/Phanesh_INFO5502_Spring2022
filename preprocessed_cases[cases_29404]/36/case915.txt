in this paternity action,appeals an order requiring him to pay child support for his young twins.he contends the trial court abused its discretion by including in his income for purposes of guideline support bonuses he received from his indian tribe,and attorney fees the tribe paid on his behalf.we agree with on the second issue,and reverse the order and remand the matter for further proceedings.additionally,for the court guidance on remand,we hold it may properly include the bonuses in his gross income.
factual and procedural background 
in november initiated this action to establish as the biological father of her unborn twins,and for an order requiring him to pay child support.gave birth to twins prematurely in january,and genetic testing later confirmed that is their father.
submitted an income and expense declaration that claimed no income and in monthly expenses.is a member of the sycuan band of the kumeyaay nation.he submitted income and expense declarations that stated he was unemployed and had in monthly income from the tribe,including in regular distributions and in bonuses.it also claimed in monthly expenses,including in child support.his federal income tax form showed the tribe paid him a total of that year,including in regular disbursements in bonuses for education and training for tribal life insurance and for legal fees.the tribe withheld in federal income tax and he does not pay state income tax.
in february the court awarded per month in temporary child support.it also ordered to pay toward attorney fees.the court set the matter for a continued hearing and requested supplemental briefs from the parties.
a hearing was held on july.submitted an updated income and expense declaration,which claimed no income and in monthly expenses.she argued that the entire amount stated on federal income tax statement should be included in his annual gross income,including the amounts for attorney fees and educational expenses.she stated that in responses to special interrogatories dated june,admitted the tribe had paid in legal fees on his behalf thus far in.also argued that received a,home on the reservation free of charge,and the value of that benefit should be considered additional income.she advised the court that had neither met the twins nor requested visitation.
advised the court that in he continued to receive per month from the tribe in regular disbursements,which was reduced to after taxes,and he had received a bonus in the gross amount of.conceded he had free housing on the reservation.he also,however,owned a condominium for which he claimed nearly in monthly expenses.his attorney explained that was not currently renting the condominium because he initially was afraid that if he rented it,the court would automatically count that as income,even though it ran at a negative number,however,was trying to rent it now.
opposed the inclusion of benefits in his income,such as free housing and the payment of attorney fees.he argued the court should deviate downward from guideline support,because guideline support exceeds the needs of the twins,and it actually supports and her mother,who lived with rent free.he also argued the court should impute at least minimum wage income to.he challenged the validity of claimed expenses.
the court took the matter under submission,and it announced its ruling at a hearing on august.the court imputed no income to noting she was a teenager with no high school education who had recently given birth prematurely to twins.the court did order her to apply for benefits from her own indian tribe,and to notify counsel of her efforts.
the court also imputed no income to at this time.the court determined he had deductible mortgage interest of per month and property taxes of per month,and child support of per month.the court included in income the bonuses he received from the tribe,and explained that although they were distributed in june and november they should be calculated on an annualized basis,resulting in a monetary amount of per month.the court also included in income the the tribe paid for attorney fees he personally incurred in,noting the tribe reported this income to the internal revenue service as taxable income to.the court did not include the value of free housing on the reservation,educational expenses the tribe covered or free trips.the court found shared no time with the children.
additionally,the court determined did not meet his burden of rebutting the presumption of guideline child support.the court explained that w hile certain expenses identified in petitioner income and expense declaration do not appear credible,that and other factors presented are not sufficient to rebut the presumption.it ordered him to pay per month in support retroactive to january.
discussion 
contends the court improperly included his speculative bonus income in his gross annual income for purposes of calculating child support.we disagree.
a child support order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.citations.we determine whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.citation.we do not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court,but determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order.in re marriage of schlafly th,d.
because of california strong public policy in favor of adequate child support,courts are required to calculate child support under the statutory guidelines.citations.a dherence to the guidelines is mandatory,and the trial court may not depart from them except in the special circumstances enumerated in the statutes.citations.citation.the guideline amount of child support,which is calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the parents incomes,is presumptively correct.in re marriage of williams th,d.
the mandatory formula for calculating child support takes into account both parents net monthly disposable income citation,which is determined based upon the parents annual gross income.in re marriage of alter th,d alter.i ncome is broadly defined for purposes of child support.citations.subject to certain statutory exceptions,which do not apply here,annual gross income means income from whatever source derived,subd.a.although it specifically lists more than a dozen possible income sources,by the statute express terms,that list is not exhaustive.citations.rather,the codified income items are by way of illustration only.income from other sources should properly be factored into the annual gross income computation.citations.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.the judicially recognized sources of income cover a wide gamut.ibid.
ignores that section,subdivision a expressly includes bonuses as part of a parent annual gross income.he also ignores county of placer andrade th,d,which explains the court can not deduct predictable bonuses in determining a parent prospective earnings merely because they occur sporadically.the mechanism for calculating a parent net disposable income is a monthly average.the question is whether the bonuses are likely to reoccur.absent a determination that the monthly net disposable income figure does not accurately reflect the parent prospective earnings,it would be error for the court to exclude bonuses in its calculation.the court can disregard past bonus payments from the calculation only if it determines that the parent is unlikely to receive them in the future.county of placer andrade,supra,at,d.bonuses are included in income because past income is a good measure of the future income from which the parent must pay support.id.at,d see also seymour hunter iowa,court rejected indian tribe member argument per capita payments from tribe were not income subject to child support because they were unguaranteed,speculative,and left totally to the whim of the tribal council,explaining t o ignore recent experience would be to invite manipulation of the guidelines by arrangements with friendly employers,earmarking part of the expected earnings by labeling them as bonuses.
the employee parent has the burden of demonstrating past bonus income is not likely to be continued.courts are very skeptical of such claims made by the employee party alone.counsel should therefore obtain declarations from the employer to the effect bonus pay will be curtailed and why.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
the only evidence cites is his own declaration,which states i received a bonus from the sycuan tribal government in the total amount of for the year.however,i may or may not receive a bonus every year.he did not submit anything from the tribe supporting the notion he may not receive bonuses in the future.further,he advised the court in july,before it made the child support award,that he had already received one bonus in,and it was of the total bonuses he received in.we find no abuse of discretion as did not meet his burden of proof,and to the contrary his evidence indicates it is likely the bonuses will continue on schedule.
as discussed below,we find abuse of discretion on another issue and reverse the order with directions.on remand,however,the court may include the bonuses in gross income under section,subdivision a.
reliance on in re marriage of mosley th,d mosley,is misplaced.in mosley,the father paul,a real estate attorney,lost his lucrative job because of the downturn in the market.he took a job in february as counsel with a homebuilder that paid a base salary of,a fraction of his former base salary,with the possibility of a bonus of up to percent of his base salary dependent on both his performance and the success of the housing industry.id.at,d.the evidence showed paul was awarded a bonus in,that was paid in december as percent of the bonus awarded,and that was paid in march as the remaining percent.id.at,d.
in january paul moved for modification of his spousal and child support obligations.he explained that from his base salary he had net pay of to per month,and after making monthly support payments of,he had less than for his own monthly expenses.mosley,supra,th at,d.the trial court found no change of circumstances,because paul total income of exceeded his income in when judgment was entered.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed the order.the court explained the evidence showed that during the marriage the parties were ample spend ers,and thus paul had no nest egg to rely on in making support payments for an entire year before receiving any bonus.mosley,supra,th at,d.after paying support,he had to borrow money to meet his living expenses,and he expected that he would have to borrow percent of his living expenses for the remaining six months of the year.id.at,d.the court noted that while he may be eligible for a whopping bonus of up to percent of his base pay,no one disagrees that he may get zero.the bonus is completely discretionary.and,paul works for a homebuilder.and,the residential housing industry is in the dumps,due to the subprime mortgage crisis and the sluggish economy.id.at,d.the court held it exceeded the bounds of reason to require paul to pay nearly percent of his pay in support payments,on the assumption,based on only a history with the homebuilder,that he would continue to receive a bonus each subsequent year.it placed him in a position of having to borrow for his living expenses,and thus resulted in a miscarriage of justice.id.at,d.the court added that i t would be an abuse of discretion for the court to leave paul near penniless while he awaits the potential of a bonus each year,especially in light of the current plight of homebuilders.id.at,d.
the court remanded the matter to the trial court,and directed it to base its support award on paul base salary,exclusive of a speculative bonus.mosley,supra,th at,d.the court explained,however,that any bonus actually received must be counted as part of paul annual gross income for the purposes of spousal and child support obligations.consequently,the court must include in its order a method for requiring paul to pay support obligations based on any bonus income that he may in fact receive.it may,for example,fashion an additional award,over and above guideline support,expressed as a fraction or percentage of any discretionary bonus actually received.ibid.
the facts of mosley are readily distinguishable.it is a foundational principle that t he language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case,and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.here,is unemployed and he receives his entire income from the sycuan tribe.he produced no evidence from the tribe or otherwise that there is any plight in the indian gaming industry that may affect future bonuses,either in frequency or amount.indeed,the evidence shows that in june received a bonus that was the amount of total bonuses he received in.
additionally,since the tribe distributes bonuses twice a year,is not required to advance the portion of support payments based on the bonuses for an entire year as was the case in mosley.he submitted a declaration before the july hearing that states,after payment of support,i do not have significant funds to pay for my own living expenses.i am often late on bills because i do not have the money to pay them.i receive a bonus twice per year,but the monthly child support order includes the bonus amount.this creates a financial strain on me,since child support is calculated on an income i do not receive monthly.at the hearing,however,conceded he had not been renting his condominium,but he was then trying to do so.there is no actual evidence he can not budget his bonus payments in a manner to cover his monthly child support obligations.
under all the circumstances,we find no abuse of discretion.it appears likely the bonuses will continue,but if they do not,can petition for modification of the child support order.
attorney fees 
we are,however,persuaded by contention the court abused its discretion by including the tribe payment of his attorney fees in his gross annual income under section,subdivision a for purposes of the guideline support calculation.we agree with that because the payments go directly to his attorneys,and are not part of his income or cash flow available for child support,the attorney fees benefit may be considered only under section as a circumstance potentially warranting an upward departure from guideline amount 
it is undisputed that for the tribe included on federal income tax statement it paid on his behalf for attorney fees.see b d n et revenues from any class ii gaming activities conducted or licensed by any indian tribe may be used to make per capita payments to members of the indian tribe only if the per capita payments are subject to federal taxation and tribes notify members of such tax liability when payments are made.claims this justifies the inclusion of that amount in gross income under section,subdivision a.
a parent gross income,as stated under penalty of perjury on recent tax returns,is considered presumptively correct for purposes of child support.returns are,after all,ultimately enforced by federal and state criminal penalties.hence it is not surprising that tax returns are the core component of determinations under the guideline formula.in re marriage of loh th,d loh.although federal law is not conclusive on the interpretation of section,it is persuasive,because t he operative language in subdivision a of section,annual gross income means income from whatever source derived,was lifted straight from the definition of income in section of the internal revenue code.in re marriage of scheppers th,d scheppers.
ordinarily,a party challenge to the presumption of correctness is based on the argument that income or benefits not included on the other parent federal tax returns should nonetheless be included in gross income for calculation of guideline support.for instance,in scheppers,supra,th at page,d,the court rejected the father argument that a life insurance benefit was within the scope of the mother gross income.the court explained life insurance benefits are not income under the federal internal revenue code and the inclusion of such benefits in income would be impractical.as to the last point,the court pond
