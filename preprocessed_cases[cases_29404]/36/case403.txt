in state of california dep t of soc.servs.thompson,cir referred to as rosales,after enedina rosales,we rejected a department of health and human services hhs interpretation of the statute determining eligibility for the aid to families with dependent care program see.we remanded to the district court to implement what we held to be the proper interpretation of the statute.the district court subsequently issued an injunction against hhs and the california department of social services cdss enforcing the rosales eligibility standard.we now consider whether hhs and cdss are entitled to relief from judgment due to a statute enacted after rosales and whether the district court failed to respond appropriately in the face of evidence that cdss may not have complied with the injunction.
background 
on remand,the district court ordered cdss to provide for the review of all foster care cases open on or after march,for benefits eligibility under rosales construction of cdss was to pay benefits due for the entire period,subsequent to december,in which the child was entitled to payments under rosales and was otherwise eligible for such benefits and those payments were not paid.new applications were,of course,to be considered under the statute as construed in rosales.to begin the process,cdss was ordered to issue an all county letter to the county officials who implement its programs,directing them to review their cases to determine eligibility in accordance with rosales and consistent with the district court judgment.the review was to be completed no later than april,with benefits paid within days of an eligibility finding 
whether cdss complied with the district court august order is the question at the core of this case.it is clear that cdss did send an all county letter in september.but whether any review was conducted,or any benefits were paid,has not been documented the all county letter itself ordered such steps,requiring that all cases open on march,shall have the broader eligibility criteria applied retroactively,recommending that counties immediately review any case identified as potentially eligible emphasis in original and providing two claim for administrative costs associated with implementing the district court order and one for the rosales payments themselves.according to the letter and accompanying forms,counties were to record,among other details,the amount of the new federal payments they were claiming as a result of the reviews,along with a persons count of parties receiving payments under county,state,and federal programs as a result of the reviews,and,if the county sought administrative costs,the number of rosales cases that were shifted into payment eligibility after the reviews.even if a county had no costs to report,it was still to complete and certify the form indicating zero expenditures.the forms were to be submitted no later than april.the counties were ordered to retain all supporting documentation for audit purposes.
on april,after the mandated review period ended,rosales counsel wrote to counsel for cdss to request a list of the number of cases reviewed,the number of cases approved,the number of cases denied and the reason s for the denials,along with assurance that every county met the mandated deadline.cdss counsel replied on may,after the deadlines set by the order and by the all county letter had elapsed,that while claims data had been submitted,the information rosales counsel sought was not ascertainable from the claims submitted by the counties,that cdss had no such data,and that no such evidence of compliance was required by the court order in rosales.
counsel for rosales served a request for production of documents on cdss the following january,requesting,inter alia,all documents relating,regarding or referring to your efforts to comply with rosales,including,but not limited to,all communications regarding your compliance efforts all documents relating,regarding or referring to all payments by you to all foster care cases in which dependency jurisdiction was open on or after march,based on the redetermination of eligibility in accordance with the district court order all documents relating,regarding or referring to the all county letter any communications to anyone after issuance of the letter regarding its subject matter and all documents relating,regarding or referring to the contentions set forth in cdss counsel may letter that data listing the number of cases reviewed,the number of cases approved,the number of cases denied,and the reasons for denial was not ascertainable from claims submitted by the counties.
cdss refused to provide the requested information,in part because the discovery requests ha d been propounded after entry of judgment,and i n the absence of threshold determinations by the court regarding the existence and scope of an issue that requires resolution and that discovery is necessary to resolution of any such issue,the discovery requests were premature,unauthorized,and unduly burdensome.rosales did not move to compel discovery.see.a.
on february,congress passed the deficit reduction act of dra,which,among other effects,amended to foreclose the statutory construction set forth by rosales,stat.in march,cdss issued an all county letter directing that the counties must immediately track all rosales cases,for which federal foster care benefits were paid starting on october,and thereafter until clarification on the effects of the statute was received from the district court and hhs.not long afterward,both hhs and cdss moved under rule b for relief from judgment based on the dra.while the motions were pending,on june,hhs directed that the dra eligibility provision should be implemented on a rolling basis as cases came up for annual eligibility reviews,children previously receiving benefits under rosales but now ineligible under the dra would have their benefits terminated.
rosales to enforce the judgment,joined in a separate motion by five other foster caregivers in rosales motion,she requested t hat the court authorize limited discovery for the purpose of ensuring complete and effective compliance with this court judgment.along with the motion,she included cdss response,quoted above,declining to provide the requested discovery.also accompanying rosales motion was a declaration by her counsel,marjorie shelvy,stating that,after the judgment on remand,shelvy had represented more than a dozen claimants who had been denied benefits in direct contravention of the rosales decision.rosales declared that she had not received payments she believed she was entitled to for a recent period of foster care.the five other foster caregivers also supplied declarations that they had been denied benefits owed to them.
the motions to enforce the judgment,relying upon shelvy declaration and upon the individual cases of the movants,argued that cdss had not complied with the judgment.rosales charged that cdss had a policy of ignoring the district court judgment,and had continued to apply the old,legal standard in at least the dozen cases referred to in shelvy declaration,as well as in her own case.the other caregivers similarly argued that cdss continues to ignore the district court judgment compelling compliance with rosales and that cdss continues to deny proper review of open benefit cases and denies benefits to foster care families entitled to benefits under the rosales standard,including in their own cases.rosales asked,at a minimum,that the court ensure that all claims for past due benefits be reviewed consistent with the court prior judgment and past due benefits be promptly paid.in this regard,in their consolidated reply in support of their motions to enforce the judgment,rosales and the other caregivers argued that l imited discovery is necessary in order to learn what the cdss and the counties did to implement the court judgment,as well as what the state decided to forego in enforcing the judgment.
as one way of protecting claimants rights and of gathering reliable compliance data,rosales and the other caregivers also asked that the court require cdss to provide notices of action noas,which are formal statements of the agency benefits decision,to all program applicants who had been denied benefits before rosales and who were again denied during the review.see cal.dep t of soc.servs.manual of policies and procedures describing notice requirements.rosales also opposed granting relief from judgment with regard to parties receiving,or entitled to receive,benefits under rosales,arguing that such relief would be an impermissibly retroactive application of the dra.
the district court granted cdss and hhs relief from judgment as of june,the date of hhs directive concerning the implementation of the dra,forward.the court largely denied the motions to enforce the judgment looking for evidence of noncompliance in the denial of benefits to rosales and the other caregivers,the district court held that in three of the cases the materials submitted indicate that the child was not entitled to benefits,and that in the remaining two cases the evidence was insufficient to determine whether the parties are eligible for benefits.the court also opined that if cdss wrongly denied benefits in two or potentially five individual cases,this showing is insufficient to demonstrate that cdss has failed to comply.not mentioning shelvy declaration indicating that cdss had failed to apply rosales in more than a dozen cases,the district court concluded that neither rosales nor the other caregivers have provided any evidence that cdss has not complied with the court order.the court refused to require noas,as they were not explicitly require d by its order.the court did not expressly discuss the request to authorize discovery,but also did not order discovery,thereby implicitly denying the request.
rosales and the other caregivers timely appealed.they argue that relief from judgment should not have been granted with regard to claimants who received,or were entitled to,benefits under rosales before the passage of the dra,because such relief would impermissibly apply the dra retroactively the district court should require noas for parties who were ineligible and who were still deemed ineligible after the review and the court should at least require cdss to provide verification of its compliance with the rosales decision,including i the number of cases reviewed,ii the number of cases denied pursuant to the review,and iii the number of cases approved pursuant to the review.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the grant or denial of rule b motions for relief from judgment,as well as the grant or denial of motions to enforce injunctions,for abuse of discretion.see united states asarco,cir rule b motions are reviewed for abuse of discretion paulson city of san diego,cir en banc same for decisions concerning enforcing injunctions.
a denial of a request for discovery is also ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.hallett morgan,cir.here,however,because the district court only implicitly denied the request to authorize discovery,it did not exercise its discretion.see garrett city and county of san francisco,cir.in the rule f context,where the district court did not exercise its discretion concerning ordering discovery,the issue of whether or not it should have presents a legal question which is subject to de novo review.garrett,at see also clark capital credit collection,cir the district court failure here to exercise its discretion by addressing the merits of the request to authorize discovery before considering whether to enforce its judgment presents an analytically identical question.we therefore review de novo whether the district court should have addressed the merits of the request.
motions for relief from judgment 
turning to the merits,we first address cdss and hhs motions for relief from judgment.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by granting the relief,allowing cdss and hhs to use the eligibility standard mandated by the dra for all cases going forward.the dra removed the legal basis for the continuing application of the court order a change in law of this type entitles petitioners to relief under rule b.agostini felton,d.
rosales and the other caregivers nonetheless argue that cdss and hhs are implementing the dra retroactively by applying it to existing benefits cases.this purported retroactive application,they argue,is impermissible.we disagree.
there is,in the first place,no per se rule barring retroactive application of statutes,although retroactive application is generally disfavored.see landgraf usi film products,d.more importantly,the dra is not being applied retroactively in the sense contemplated by landgraf.the statute does not impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.beneficiaries have no right to continued payments based on their past eligibility.congress power to define the scope of statutory entitlements going forward is plenary.see bowen gilliard,d.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by allowing the agencies to implement the dra as congress intended.
motions to enforce the judgment 
we next consider the motions to enforce the judgment,addressing both the noa and discovery issues.
we first conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to require cdss to provide noas to previously ineligible parties who remained ineligible after the review.the august order,issued after substantial opportunity for comment by the parties,did not require noas in such circumstances noas might well have served a useful notice function,as rosales and the other caregivers argue.but that potential utility does not convert the district court refusal to import an noa requirement into its judgment after the fact into an abuse of discretion.
the request to authorize discovery 
as part of her motion to enforce the judgment,rosales requested permission to engage in limited discovery.the request was tailored to determining whether reviews had occurred as ordered and whether claimants eligible under rosales were,in fact,paid retroactive benefits for the period before the dra was given effect.although the district court opined that there was not any evidence that cdss was not in compliance,it did not directly address the question whether discovery should have been allowed,as requested,to develop admissible evidence regarding compliance.we conclude on de novo review that the district court should have addressed the merits of the request to authorize discovery before denying the bulk of the motions to enforce the judgment.
in so determining,we begin from the recognition that t here is no question that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt.shillitani united states,d.here,rosales requested limited discovery to aid the court in determining whether cdss had complied with a judgment in her favor.the request was one the district court could have granted,as part of its inherent power to enforce its judgments.richmark timber falling consultants,cir referencing discovery wilkinson fbi,cir same,abrogated on other grounds by kokkonen guardian life ins.of america,d flores arizona,d.see also,natural gas pipeline energy gathering,cir discussing the inherent power to order discovery and various exercises of that power.a permitting discovery i n aid of the judgment or execution for money judgments.
indeed,a district court should give careful attention to a request for discovery to establish noncompliance with one of its judgments.hallett,which is,as far as we can determine,the only case of this court to address a failure to allow discovery concerning noncompliance with a judgment,demonstrates as much.that case concerned a civil contempt motion for noncompliance with a prison reform consent decree,filed along with a motion to compel discovery.at.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on compliance,id.at,and further reviewed the materials subject to the discovery request in camera,determining them to be minimally relevant,before denying the discovery motion,id.at.in that context,where evidence of compliance and noncompliance had been thoroughly
