we must decide whether the children of dimitris and yvette papakosmas were habitual residents of greece within the meaning of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction and therefore wrongfully removed from that country to the united states by their mother.
the following facts emerged during an evidentiary hearing on november and,before the district court,district judge margaret morrow presiding.dimitris and yvette papakosmas were married in las vegas,nevada,on august,and subsequently resided in the los angeles,california area.the couple have two children together,a son,born on march,and a daughter,born on december,both children were born in los angeles.and papakosmas owned and operated two hotels in hollywood,the liberty hotel and the hollywood international hotel,and leased and operated a third hotel,the hollywood international youth hostel.
in december,the papakosmas family left california for greece,the birthplace of dimitris.at the evidentiary hearing,he testified that the couple had always discussed the possibility of moving to greece,but had made the ultimate decision in april or may of,after the september attacks resulted in a negative effect upon the hotel business.in october,dimitris completed the sale of the couple two hotels,the liberty and the hollywood international.yvette asserts that she learned only in november that one of the hotels had been sold,never learning of the other sale until the family was in greece.dimitris also asked yvette to sign a quitclaim deed on a property owned by the couple in malibu,conveying her interest to dimitris in full.after yvette executed the deed,dimitris promptly sold the property.in addition,in the months leading up to the move,yvette began selling or disposing of the couple furniture and also sold the family dog,although she contends that such sale was unrelated to the move but instead a result of the dog behavior problems.
the family arrived in greece on december or,and spent the christmas holiday with dimitris family in orei,located three hours from athens.on january,they went to athens,where dimitris had rented an apartment.on january,yvette returned to california to check on the management of the hostel and to make a lease payment.dimitris contends that yvette trip was to deal with a bounced check and to return a passport to her son from a previous marriage.
upon returning to greece on february,yvette learned from her daughter that dimitris alleged mistress from the united states,slima boudour,was also in greece.dimitris concedes that he had a stand with boudour,but denies that she was his mistress.before judge morrow,yvette testified that she considered leaving greece after dimitris refused to send boudour home,but that she could not because dimitris controlled the children passports and her own.yvette contacted the united states embassy,which advised her to seek legal representation in greece.
on february,in athens,yvette wrist was cut and she was hospitalized.yvette contends that dimitris cut her after she refused to accede to his wish that boudour be allowed to live in the apartment with the family.dimitris testified at the evidentiary hearing,and a greek doctor also offered medical testimony,that yvette wound was.after yvette was released from the hospital,she hired an attorney and succeeded in getting a restraining order from the greek courts.meanwhile,dimitris moved the family belongings from the athens apartment to a new apartment in orei.yvette restraining order dissolved after three days,at which time she returned to the united states embassy seeking assistance.after the embassy conducted its own investigation,it determined that it would help yvette and gave her plane tickets and passports.on april,she and the children left greece for the united states.
on august,dimitris instituted this action under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction convention and the international child abduction remedies act,et,icara,in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking the return of the children to greece following the evidentiary hearing noted above,on december,the district court filed an order denying dimitris petition.
in its order,the district court first concluded that dimitris and yvette agreed to move to greece on a conditional basis,and therefore determined that there was no shared,settled intent to abandon their habitual residence in california.next,judge morrow concluded that at no time after their arrival in greece did they form such a settled intent.finally,the district court concluded that the objective facts do not point unequivocally to the conclusion that greece had become the children new habitual residence.accordingly,because the court determined that dimitris had failed to meet his burden of proving that greece is the children habitual residence,it found that dimitris could not establish a prima facie case for wrongful removal and dismissed the action.dimitris filed a timely notice of appeal.
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction is intended to prevent the use of force to establish artificial jurisdictional links on an international level,with a view to obtaining custody of a child.mozes mozes,cir citing elisa,explanatory report,in hague conference private international law,acts and documents of the fourteenth session,child abduction.the convention has been implemented by congress through the icara,et.the convention focus is not the underlying merits of a custody dispute but instead whether a child should be returned to a country for custody proceedings under that country domestic law.holder holder,cir holder ii 
under article of the convention,the removal or retention of a child is wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention,at.in mozes,we stated that a court applying this provision must answer four questions when did the removal or retention at issue take place immediately prior to the removal or retention,in which state was the child habitually resident did the removal or retention breach the rights of custody attributed to the petitioner under the law of habitual residence was the petitioner exercising those rights at the time of the removal or retention at see also von kennel gaudin remis,cir.
as was true in mozes,the district court here denied dimitris petition based on its answer to the second question it found that as of april,the children habitual residence was in the united states and not greece.although the term habitual residence is intentionally left undefined in the convention,we have developed an analytical framework to provide intelligibility and consistency in the determination of a child habitual residence.holder ii,at citing mozes,at.thus,in determining whether a child has acquired a new habitual residence,we first ask whether there is a settled intention to abandon a prior habitual residence.mozes,at.in this inquiry,the intention or purpose which has to be taken into account is that of the person or persons entitled to fix the place of the child residence.id.at citing clive,the concept of habitual residence,jurid.here,as in most cases,those persons are the parents.see feder,cir looking to the parents present,shared intentions regarding their child presence.
the parents settled intention is not alone sufficient to change a child habitual residence.mozes counsels that such a transformation also requires an actual change in geography,and the passage of an appreciable period of time,one sufficient for acclimatization.at.importantly,h abitual residence is intended to be a description of a factual state of affairs,and a child can lose its habitual attachment to a place even without a parent consent.id.at emphasis in original.thus,even when the settled intent of a child parent is not clear,a district court should find a change in habitual residence if the objective facts point unequivocally to a person ordinary or habitual residence being in a particular place.id.citing zenel haddow,scot.div.
as a threshold matter,dimitris asserts that the standard of review of a district court judgment on an icara petition is de novo.we have previously stated that a determination of habitual residence under the hague convention is a mixed question of law and fact.mozes,at see also feder,at ruiz tenorio,cir adopting mixed standard of review.under this standard,we accept the district court historical or narrative facts unless they are clearly erroneous,but exercise plenary review of the court choice of and interpretation of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the facts.mozes,at citing feder,at.the question of whether there is a settled intention to abandon a prior residence is a question of historical fact as to which we defer to the district court.id.at.
in holder ii,we acknowledged the flexible,nature of the habitual residence inquiry envisioned by the convention.at.nonetheless,we stated that d espite the factual focus of our inquiry,our conclusion rests on a legal determination after scrutinizing the circumstances of a particular case,we must determine whether the discrete facts add up to a showing of habitual residence.id.in making this legal determination,we must be mindful that we are interpreting a treaty,and that uniformity and consistency of interpretation is our goal.see mozes,at to achieve the uniformity of application across countries,upon which depends the realization of the convention goals,courts must be able to reconcile their decisions with those reached by other courts in similar situations.
thus,our proper function is not to engage in a full de novo review instead,we are to determine whether,giving appropriate deference to the district court findings of fact and credibility determinations,the evidence adds up to a showing of habitual residence.holder ii,at.
dimitris first contends that the district court erred in its conclusion that there was no mutual settled intention between yvette and dimitris to abandon their prior residence in california.such conclusion is a finding of historical fact entitled to review under the clearly erroneous standard.ruiz,at citing mozes,at.
the district court made three key credibility determinations in reaching its conclusion.first,it found that yvette account of the family move to greece and subsequent events was credible.second,it found that dimitris account was not credible and that he had lied or misrepresented significant facts,including facts related to the couple disposition of property.finally,the district court found the testimony of key third parties,such as yvette mother,the children teachers,and the hostel manager,mazam mazzal,to be credible and supportive of yvette claim of conditionality.these credibility determinations are supported by the record,and therefore were not clear error.see united states lang,cir reviewing credibility determinations under a clear error standard ruiz,at upholding district court finding of no shared intent to abandon united states as a habitual residence where,among other things,the court expressly credited the wife mother who testified that the husband had promised that if it did not work out in mexico,they would come back to the united states.
in particular,the district court finding on dimitris lack of credibility is supported by the fact that he lied about the date he entered into a lease extension on the hostel property.he alleged that the decision to move to greece was made by mutual agreement in april or may of.however,mazzal,the property manager of the hostel,testified that he witnessed dimitris sign a lease for the property on may.in addition,while dimitris testified at the hearing that he never signed such an extension,the leasing document with dimitris signature was entered into evidence.
the district court credibility finding is also supported by the circumstances surrounding yvette execution of a quitclaim deed on the malibu property.although dimitris testified that this legal maneuver was performed so that only he would need to return from greece when the company wanted to sell the property,he actually sold the property less than a week after yvette signature.yvette testified that she did not learn of the sale of the property until she returned to the united states in april.the logical inference from this sequence of events is that dimitris was attempting to sell the malibu property without yvette knowledge.if the couple had agreed to sell their stateside property before they moved to greece,then the execution of a quitclaim deed a mere seven days before the sale of the property was an unnecessary step 
nor do the objective facts surrounding the family departure for greece particularly support dimitris version of events such that it was clear error for the district court to find that yvette intended the move to be conditional.the court found the cards written by dimitris classmates to be ambiguous at best and,in many cases,supportive of yvette contention that the move was temporary.it also found the lack of a going away party to be an additional factor disproving dimitris testimony.finally,and perhaps most importantly,the district court did not err in concluding that the papakosmas family intended to continue doing business in the united states.the court accepted as credible the testimony of yvette that she returned to the united states early in to make lease payments on the hostel and to check on the business.the existence of such payments was corroborated by mazzal.the ongoing business venture in the united states and yvette trip back are objective factors weighing in favor of a finding that there was no mutual intent to abandon completely the family residence in california.
we are particularly sensitive to our duty to strive for uniform interpretation of the provisions of a treaty.see b b stating that in enacting icara,congress recognized the need for uniform international interpretation of the convention.as part of our mixed standard of review under mozes,therefore,we consider whether the district court ultimate conclusion that there was no shared settled intention on the part of the parents to shift the children habitual residence is consistent with the body of treaty law under the hague convention.such consideration is intended to further the goal of intelligibility and consistency of application that mozes quite correctly identified as a crucial purpose of the treaty.at.
we are satisfied that the district court conclusion that the family move to greece was conditional is consistent with the reasoning of other courts interpreting the convention.the eleventh circuit recent decision in ruiz tenorio is particularly on point,as the district court itself recognized.at.in that case,melissa tenorio and juan ruiz decided,after seven years in the united states,to move to mexico i n an attempt to save the marriage.id.at.juan testified that he intended the family to move permanently,while melissa and a testified that the move was on a trial basis.id.the ruiz family started out in mexico living with juan family,but eventually moved into an apartment and even began building an house.id.at.as in this case,there was evidence that the couple continued to fight in mexico and that melissa returned with the children to the united states twice during the months that the family lived in mexico.id.at.the district court determined that there was no shared intention between juan and melissa to make mexico their permanent residence instead,melissa had agreed to the move on a conditional basis only.in reaching its decision,the district court in that case,as did the district court here,expressly credited the testimony of the mother and family members who testified on the mother behalf.relying upon these credibility findings,as well as the objective facts indicating melissa conditional intent,the eleventh circuit found no clear error in the district court conclusion and affirmed.id
