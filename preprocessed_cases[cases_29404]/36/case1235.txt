introduction 
the role of the juvenile court and the orange county social services agency ssa in dependency proceedings is twofold to ensure the safety,protection,and of children who are at risk of abuse,neglect,or exploitation,while preserving the family whenever possible.welf.inst.code,all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code,unless otherwise noted.the juvenile court was created both to protect children and to preserve and strengthen children family ties.in re sade cal th,fn,d.
in this case,the juvenile court asserted jurisdiction over david and under section,subdivisions b and j in order to ensure their safety and.we conclude,however,ssa failed to meet its burden of proof that there was a substantial risk of serious harm to david and at the time of the jurisdiction hearing.the juvenile court findings that david and are within the court jurisdiction are not supported by substantial evidence.we therefore reverse the court jurisdiction order.
summary of petition and evidence 
david and were detained by ssa in december,when david was two years old and was just two days old.ssa filed a dependency petition alleging failure to protect and abuse of sibling,subds.b,j.as we shall explain,there is a great distance between what was alleged in the petition and the evidence adduced at the jurisdiction hearing.while the petition contains many serious allegations,ssa failed to meet its burden of proof on those allegations at the hearing.
in the petition,ssa alleged david and mother,cheryl mother,tested positive for marijuana metabolites at the time of birth mother used marijuana during her pregnancy with mother had an extensive,unresolved history of substance abuse david and father,also named david father,reasonably should have known of mother substance abuse during her pregnancy and failed to protect from harm mother had failed to obtain timely,appropriate,and consistent prenatal care father reasonably should have known of mother failure to receive prenatal care and failed to protect mother had a history of mental illness,and suffered from a delusional disorder with somatic type,cannabis abuse,and a personality disorder,rendering her incapable of caring for david and father had a mental disability and had been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression,rendering him incapable of caring for the children and david and half sibling,aaron mother son,had been declared a dependent child of the juvenile court because mother had used marijuana during her pregnancy with aaron,was incarcerated at the time of aaron birth,was unable to care for aaron,and the whereabouts of aaron father were unknown 
at a team decisionmaking meeting in december,the following family strengths were identified mother and father love their children mother and father provide a good home environment for their children mother and father provide a clean home and a supportive family david godparents are supportive and feel they can adequately provide care for the children mother is motivated to comply with services offered to her family and father is willing to cooperate in any way to recover his children.
a contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing was conducted in april.mother testified she had used marijuana off and on between and,but had never used it since then,and denied ever having used it while pregnant with mother claimed her positive test for marijuana metabolites was due to being in the presence of others who were using marijuana.mother had allowed one of her friends,who smoked marijuana,to babysit david on a few occasions.
mother started receiving prenatal care in september,when she learned she was pregnant with mother claimed she tried to receive prenatal care starting in may,but was told she was not pregnant.tested negative for all controlled substances,including marijuana,at the time of his birth.he was completely healthy at birth.did experience some muscle stiffness and tremors,although there was no evidence connecting those problems to mother use of marijuana during her pregnancy.
in connection with aaron dependency proceeding,mother had been evaluated by a medical expert appointed under evidence code section,and diagnosed in august as being delusional,and as being impaired due to her long history of marijuana use.no current evaluation of mother mental condition was conducted in connection with david and dependency proceedings.mother had never been hospitalized or involuntarily committed due to her mental disorders.the social worker testified the only evidence that mother was currently suffering from a psychiatric or psychological disorder was the diagnosis,coupled with the social worker lack of any information that mother had sought treatment since her diagnosis i uncovered no new information to discern whether or not she would currently be diagnosed with the same illness.
mother and father met in a sober living home.mother believed father would be able to care for david and without her assistance.although father was concerned about the dependency proceeding involving aaron,he had no concerns about mother ability to care for david and father admitted suffering from social and anxiety disorder and depression,but denied being diagnosed a schizophrenic.father did not believe his mental conditions or the effects of the medications he took to control them had any impact on his ability to care for david and,although his anxiety disorder prevented him from maintaining employment.father refused to sign medical releases to allow ssa to speak with his doctors.the social worker testified she was concerned about father dependence on social security supplemental income because he is impaired and unable to work i f he impaired in some areas,it might impair his ability to care for the children.
the social worker testified that she verified mother positive marijuana test with the toxicologist,and that the quantity of marijuana metabolite indicated mother had used marijuana within approximately three weeks of the test date.the social worker never spoke to anyone who had seen mother use drugs during her pregnancy with,or had seen her in possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia.
the social worker also testified that she had no evidence mother was unable to care for or protect david,and that because was taken from mother custody immediately after birth,there was no ground for saying mother was unable to care for or protect him.mother and father had obtained regular,appropriate medical care for david from the time of his birth until he was detained.
the juvenile court expressed significant concerns in terms of mother credibility,and i think that mother has given false testimony on material points.after the hearing,the court amended the petition.the court then found the allegations of the amended petition were true by a preponderance of the evidence.based on its findings,the court determined david and were within the court jurisdiction,pursuant to section,subdivisions b and j the court would find that both the extensive history of substance abuse,the delusional nature of mother mental condition,her selection of caretakers,the father court finding as to the father court would find that there is a present substantial risk of harm to both david and if the mother and father were to provide care to these children.we presume the court intended to refer to father mental condition as a ground for concluding david and were within its jurisdiction.
the court declared david and to be dependent children of the juvenile court,subd.d.the parties then stipulated to disposition.mother and father separately appealed from the juvenile court jurisdictional findings.
discussion 
we review the juvenile court jurisdictional findings for sufficiency of the evidence.in re heather th,d in re kristin th,d.we review the record to determine whether there is any substantial evidence to support the juvenile court conclusions,and we resolve all conflicts and make all reasonable inferences from the evidence to uphold the court orders,if possible.in re savannah th,d.however,substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence.citations.a decision supported by a mere scintilla
