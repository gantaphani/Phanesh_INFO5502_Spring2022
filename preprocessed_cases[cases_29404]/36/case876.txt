craig father appeals from the jurisdictional and dispositional orders issued by the juvenile court.he contends the petition fails to state a cause of action and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the court jurisdictional findings.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
father and his mother are the parents of seven children a son,christopher born in,twin sons,william and kyle born in,and quadruplets,brittany,heidi,collette,and wesley born in.the family has been the subject of referrals to the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs.three led to voluntary family maintenance services and one led to a dependency court case in.
the family came to the attention of dcfs in the current case in october of.as the investigation unfolded,some of the children alleged that father sexually abused them and that their siblings engaged in substantial sexual conduct.one accused his brother of sexually abusing him in father presence.the children who did not accuse father of abuse claimed that mother physically abused them and coached them to tell lies against father.what followed was a series of inconsistent statements that left the juvenile court at a loss when it tried to determine whether any of the allegations were true.
in october,after mother reported to police that william told her that he saw father and christopher having sex,officers interviewed the children.william reported that he saw father penis and christopher buttocks while both were naked in bed.collette claimed to have seen christopher and father naked under the blanket doing nasty stuff.
when asked whether father had ever touched him inappropriately,william said that no one had ever touched his private parts.heidi and brittany denied sexual abuse by father however,collette said father touched her vagina over her clothing.
a police detective who was present when the children were interviewed in october believed that mother was coaching them.relying on past claims of sexual abuse reported by the family and the subsequent investigations,the detective opined that mother had a pattern of bribing the children to get them to do as she wanted.the detective noted that at the station the children were more interested in the hamsters that mother had just bought them.the detective told the social worker,d uring the interviews with all of the kids,they just seemed disinterested.i would think that children that have been through what these allegations are saying would be withdrawn and concerned about what they were talking about.these kids were withdrawn.they just spoke like they knew what to say and they just did seem interested.the officer who conducted the october interviews concurred with the detective assessment.
a social worker also interviewed the children that day.william told her that he saw father place his penis in christopher rectum.he said that father forced christopher to shave his legs and wear women clothing.even though william had told the police that no one had ever touched his private parts,he informed the social worker that father had done so.he also accused christopher of trying to touch his private places.william said that he really wants father to go to jail.
christopher denied father had sexually abused him.although christopher acknowledged that he dressed like a woman,he said that was his choice.
brittany told the social worker that father had touched her private parts during a visit which had occurred two weeks prior.according to the social worker,the child changed her story throughout the interview and took excessive time to answer the questions.
during the december interviews with another social worker,william,kyle,collette,brittany,and heidi all disclosed sexual abuse by father.the social worker noted that when kyle,collette,and heidi were interviewed by another worker in october,they denied being abused by father.
the children,with the exception of christopher,underwent forensic sexual abuse exams.the results were normal.christopher,who consistently denied that he had been the victim of sexual abuse,refused to be examined.
in january,the children were interviewed at the child abuse crisis center at harbor ucla medical center.william now denied he had been sexually abused by father,but repeated his claim that he had observed father and christopher engaging in sexual activity.he said father takes off his clothes and does something disgusting to christopher.when asked what something meant,william replied,he father gets on christopher and goes up and down on top of him.william claimed that father threatened to hurt him if he told anyone about what father and christopher were doing.william said he reported the threat to his babysitter,who called an police officer.according to william,the officer arrived at father house and saw father and christopher naked.william also alleged that christopher sodomized him on two occasions and kyle witnessed one of the acts.
kyle maintained that father touched and squeezed his penis.he said father touched him in places that i really do want him to touch.kyle alleged that father threatened to kill him if he told anyone about the touching.
brittany said father had touched her vaginal area over and under her clothing,which caused her to bleed and experience pain.the evaluator who spoke to brittany noted she had a limited ability to provide a coherent narrative or minimal contextual details and that she required prompting to elaborate on her brief replies.at one point in response to a question she said,i do know the rest.when the evaluator pointed out that brittany had given different answers at first,she said father touched her over her clothing and later claimed he had done so under her clothing,brittany responded,wait.i messed up.she reported that father also touched heidi,wesley,and christopher.
collette stated that father touched her private parts over her clothing.she said,h e touches me hard,and then i get blood there.collette also claimed she saw father touch wesley inappropriately.
a week later,the social worker went to the school where the quadruplets attended to conduct separate interviews in a more neutral setting.wesley said that mother told him to lie about father touching their private parts.wesley alleged that mother hits the children with a back scratcher and a metal stick that used to be part of a broom.he claimed that on the previous day,mother hit heidi on the head with the metal stick.wesley disclosed that he saw collette suck kyle and william penis and the three engage in sexual intercourse.
heidi said mother told me to tell them that daddy touched me on my private parts,but he does.she alleged mother also told william and kyle to lie.heidi stated that mother hit her on the head with the metal broomstick and also abused brittany by pulling her hair.heidi repeated wesley claim regarding the sexual activity engaged in by collette,kyle,and william.
father denied the sexual abuse allegations and accused mother of coaching the children.mother denied telling the children to fabricate the sexual abuse claims and physically abusing them.
on january,dcfs filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a,b,c,d,and j,alleging physical abuse by mother and sexual abuse by father 
in a later interview in january,although william and kyle continued to allege that father and christopher had engaged in some form of inappropriate behavior,william did not want to talk about it and kyle could not describe what he saw.
mother claimed that she heard christopher saying to father on the telephone,what,you want me to go home just so i can be your wife when she asked him if father had done anything to him,christopher would not answer.however,he did tell her to do something so william does go back to dad house.and do let kyle go because he going to be next.
in her report,the social worker wrote that it was difficult to ascertain whether the sexual abuse allegations were true.she noted that the children made inconsistent statements,reporting sexual abuse to one social worker and denying it occurred to another.she referred to past allegations of similar conduct which led to inconclusive findings.
with respect to the family history with dcfs the social worker wrote it is also worth noting that in reviewing the extensive history of referrals a total of prior referrals,starting from to the present,there is an obvious presence of serious emotional distress among all of the children resulting from the parents bitter custody battle.she pointed out that the children reports of their parents treatment of them shifted back and forth between favoring father and mother.the worker concluded it is tremendously disturbing that the immense discord between the mother and father has continued for so many years despite the obvious adverse effects that their broken relationship has had on each of the children.in an interview with the father,father described the child william as having a fractured mind as a result of the mother relentless manipulation.after a thorough review of this family history,it is clear that each of the seven children have,in the past,and now continue to suffer with fractured minds due to the parents juvenile ways.
on march,the court began the contested jurisdiction hearing.after receiving dcfs reports into evidence,it heard christopher testimony.
christopher denied having any inappropriate contact with father.nor did he have knowledge of such contact between father and any of his siblings.in,he saw mother strike the quadruplets.she would slap them,pull their hair,throw them on the floor,and hit them with a back scratcher.christopher admitted saying to father during a telephone conversation,i do want to be your wife anymore.however,he claimed that mother suggested that he make the comment.christopher testified he moved out of father house and into mother in order to record her when she hit his siblings.he said he told father about his plan and father bought him the tape recorder and tape he claimed that he ran away from mother home because he could no longer take the emotional abuse,which he described as her making fun of him,forcing him to clean,and calling him names.he also could take seeing the kids getting hit anymore.christopher stated that after he left mother home,he stayed at a friend house before his social worker placed him in a shelter.
william testified that he stopped visiting father in january because father was touching him and kyle.he explained that father only touched him while they were driving in a car.william claimed that while he sat next to father in the front seat,father would put his hand next to william private part.he stated father touched kyle in the same way.william denied mother told him to say anything about father.he said mother did not hit him.he asserted mother did not hit any of the children and his siblings did not tell him that she had done so.he said father hit him,sometimes with a closed fist.william told the court he would not be okay with living with father or christopher and he wants to live with mother.he claimed christopher took his and william clothes off and got on top of him in father presence.william said he saw father humping christopher by putting his private part into christopher butt.
william admitted telling a social worker that he wanted father to go to jail.when asked why,he replied,i do want to talk about it.he said the subject made him uncomfortable.he gave the same response on several occasions.
kyle took the witness stand.he recalled telling a social worker that father was touching his private parts.he demonstrated where father touched him by pointing to his groin and rectum.kyle said father would call him up to father bedroom and start touching him when he got into the room.kyle said the last time father touched him,he,william,and christopher ran from the house.christopher told kyle that if father touched him again kyle was to tell him.kyle claimed father never touched him while they were in the car,and father always touched him over the clothing.he said he did not see father touch william.nor did he ever see william sit in the front seat of father car 
kyle stated mother did not tell him to say bad things about father.he denied that mother struck him or his siblings.nor did his siblings complain to him that she had.when asked if he loved father,he said,i do know.
the court recessed the hearing,stating that the quadruplets would testify the next day.
the next day,march,the court noted that it had met with counsel for the parties in chambers.their discussion was not on the record.the court stated it was not sure what the posture of the case was at that point.the following colloquy took place 
mother counsel your honor,at this point i willing to rest and submit based on the court indicated in chambers.
the court all right.
mother counsel and to address the court concerns,we would stipulate that the court may conform the petition to its findings,to the evidence.
the court so you waiving any notice if the court amends to conform to proof 
mother counsel yes,waive notice.
the court all right.thank you 
father counsel and your honor,i waiving the notice as well.after conferring with my client,we agreed that we will rest as well and have the court make its findings.
the court all right.so all parties are resting on the court tentative am i correct 
counsel for dcfs and counsel for william and kyle answered yes.
without objection,the court amended the petition by interlineation to add the following allegation pursuant to subdivisions b and c.there exists a severe dysfunction within this family resulting in an ongoing severe family law conflict,resulting in cross allegations of sexual abuse,physical abuse,and coaching and there also exists evidence of the failure of the mother and father to properly supervise the children,all of which places the children at risk of serious physical and emotional harm.
prior to making its findings,the court discussed the long history of discord within the family.it made a specific reference to the toll the task of providing testimony took on christopher,william,and kyle.it noted that virtually every professional who had contact with the parents concluded they were in an alternative universe that infected the family.the court noted the tortured and conflicting testimony offered by the children and concluded,t hey are so damaged by this ongoing fight that they do even know what true and not true anymore.and that just obscene.what the court does know,and what the court can say very clearly in this case,is that there is a severe dysfunction in this family between the mother and the father.and that a result of an ongoing,severe conflict which has resulted in of sexual abuse,physical abuse,coaching,to the point where,as the court indicated,it really irrelevant as to whether it true or not.the fact that it exists on this level and to this extent is damaging to the children and puts them at risk.additionally,to whatever extent,this dysfunction has resulted in neither parent being properly able to supervise their children.and that places these children not just at risk of physical harm,but serious physical harm and,more importantly,serious emotional harm.and i think that that would be sufficient for the court to sustain the b and c on that language under welfare and institutions code section.
with the exception of christopher,who was allowed to remain in father home,the court ordered the children placed in the care of dcfs.it ordered reunification services for the parents,which included psychotherapy,counseling,and monitored visitation with the children in a neutral therapeutic setting.the children were to be provided with counseling with a licensed therapist and christopher was to continue with his individual counseling.
discussion 
father forfeited his claim that the petition fails to state a cause of action 
father contends that the amended petition did not state a cause of action under either subdivision b or c of section.dcfs argues father forfeited the claim by failing to object in the trial court.we agree with dcfs.
father does not dispute that he failed to object,waived notice of the amendment,and did not demur to the petition as amended.he urges,however,that there is a split of authority with respect to whether a failure to challe
