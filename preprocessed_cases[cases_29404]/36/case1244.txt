compliance with icwa 
mother and father argue that the prior placement order must be vacated because the department failed to comply with the notice provisions of icwa.they do not identify any order in which the court addressed compliance with icwa.instead,noting that the issue of compliance with icwa may be raised at any time,they assert that the department and juvenile court violated the icwa because there is no evidence that the social worker made any further inquiry or,at the very least,sent notice to the bureau of indian affairs this is not a case of adequate proof of notice before the juvenile court,but of no notice at all.
the department first received information that mother might have native american heritage in april.mother told a social worker in reno,nevada that she was part native american,which she claimed was part of the reason for her alcohol problem.w hen the juvenile court knows or has reason to believe the child may be an indian child,notice must be given to the particular tribe in question or the secretary.a citations.i t was actually the duty of the department to notify the tribe or the secretary of the interior of the filing of the petition by registered mail,return receipt requested.a.in re desiree th,d.rule f of the california rules of court mandates the following notice procedure notice must be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested,and additional notice by first class mail is recommended.notice to the tribe must be to the tribal chairperson unless the tribe has designated another agent for service.notice must be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian or the tribe can not be determined,notice must be sent to the specified office of the secretary of the interior,which has days to provide notice as required subdivision g provides that a tribe determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.rule g.substantial compliance with the notice requirements of icwa may be sufficient under certain circumstances.in re christopher th,d.the failure to provide the necessary notice requires this court to invalidate actions taken in violation of the icwa and remand the case unless the tribe has participated in or expressly indicated no interest in the proceedings.citation.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.
the department is required to file with the court a copy of the notice sent and the return receipt,as well as any correspondence received from the indian entity relevant to the minor status.in re marinna th,fn,d.notice to the bureau of indian affairs is required only if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian or the tribe can not be determined rule f see a.
the department has filed a motion to consider additional evidence on appeal on this issue.this additional evidence consists of copies of letters and forms sent by the department to various indian tribes and to the bureau of indian affairs,the responses to these letters,as well as the transcript of a november,hearing at which the court mentioned icwa issues 
at the november,hearing,the court indicated that there were some possible indian child welfare act noticing issues.the department has sought to correct those issues by.part of our discussions included a somewhat informal discussion regarding mother interest in attempting to determine whether or not she is related culturally to any of the existing tribes at this point.i have suggested to counsel and i will suggest to mother if she is further interested,if she has other tribes to notice,we will be happy to notice them for her,meaning the department so at this point i think the noticing issues have been addressed.so i am a hundred percent clear,if mother has other tribes she wishes to have noticed,those tribes will be identified and given to the department and they w
