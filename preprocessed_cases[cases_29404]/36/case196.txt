today we take up one aspect of the bedeviling issue in bankruptcy law of how to deal with property held by debtors as tenants by the entirety.we hold that when a husband and wife in virginia file a joint chapter bankruptcy petition,and they from their mortgage individual creditors,the two spouses may exempt a home they own as tenants by the entirety to the extent of their equity.see b b.the spouses may take the exemption notwithstanding the joint administration or substantive consolidation of their individual bankruptcy estates.
we have before us consolidated appeals that arise from two bankruptcy cases.in the first case peter bunker and michelina bonanno,who are husband and wife,filed a joint,voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the eastern district of virginia.the list fifteen unsecured creditors with claims totaling.each claim is listed against either the husband or the wife none is identified as a joint claim against both.in schedule a real property the list as an asset their home in falls church,virginia,noting that they own it as tenants by the entirety.according to the schedule,the home has a current market value of and is subject to mortgage liens,representing the only joint debt,totaling.when the filed their joint petition,only bunker claimed the home as exempt on schedule c,valuing the exemption at roughly the equity.he asserted the exemption under b b of the bankruptcy code,which governs a debtor exemption of property held as a tenant by the entirety.the bankruptcy trustee filed an objection to bunker claim of exemption.
in the second case joseph thomas and myrtle thomas,also husband and wife,voluntarily filed a joint chapter petition in the eastern district of virginia.except for their mortgage debt,the thomases had no joint debts at the time of filing.together,the thomases list unsecured creditors with claims totaling.each unsecured creditor is owed by only one of the debtor spouses,either thomas or thomas.the thomases list as an asset the home they own in reston,virginia,as tenants by the entirety.according to the schedules,the home has a current market value of and is subject to a mortgage lien of.because the home is held as entireties property,each thomas spouse claimed it as exempt valuing the exemption at under b b.the trustee objected to the claims of exemption.
the filing of a joint bankruptcy petition by a husband and wife does not consolidate the separate bankruptcy estates of the two spouses.in the thomas case the estates of the two spouses were substantively consolidated by order of the bankruptcy court.consolidation has not been ordered in the case.there,the estates of the two spouses are being jointly administered pursuant to local rule.see.loc.the two cases,the case and the thomas case,are assigned to the same bankruptcy judge,and gordon peyton serves as trustee in both.the bankruptcy court used one proceeding to consider the central issue in both cases,whether to allow the exemption for the home owned by the debtors as tenants by the entirety.
the trustee sought to block the exemptions so that he could administer the entireties properties to benefit the individual creditors,who are unsecured.in each case the trustee would sell the home,pay off the mortgage debt,and use the balance to satisfy the claims of the individual creditors.the bankruptcy court,in sustaining the trustee objections to the claims of exemption in both cases,issued a single opinion,in re thomas.the court held that while the b b exemption shields property held in a tenancy by the entirety from the claims of individual creditors when only one spouse files for bankruptcy,it is not available when spouses file jointly.when spouses file jointly,the court said,the trustee possess es in the two estates the entire ownership of the property and may,just as the spouses could before bankruptcy,unite the two interests in the execution of a single deed and thereby convey the property to a third party.thomas,at.in the thomas case the bankruptcy court held in the alternative that the substantive consolidation of the spouses estates allows the trustee to administer the entireties property for the benefit of all creditors,joint and individual.id.at.the bankruptcy court disallowed the claim of exemption for the entireties property the home in both cases.
the and the thomases appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.in the meantime,after the bankruptcy court had rendered its decision,the amended their schedule c to reflect bonanno claim of the entireties exemption with respect to the home.see fed.a providing that a schedule may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at any time before the case is closed.in reviewing the bankruptcy court decision,the district court assumed that the bankruptcy court would have also denied the exemption to bonanno.thomas peyton.the district court reversed,concluding that the debtors should have been allowed to claim their homes as exempt entireties property under b b.the district court emphasized that the statutory exemption applies to any entireties property interest held by the debtor to the extent that the interest is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.id.at quoting b b.section b b pointed the court to virginia strong common law rule protecting entireties property from the claims of individual creditors.id.in allowing the exemption for each of the four debtor spouses,the district court held that the trustee could not administer the entireties property in either case for the benefit of individual creditors.
the trustee has appealed the district court order reversing the bankruptcy court and allowing the exemptions.an order allowing or disallowing a bankruptcy exemption is a final,appealable order.sumy schlossberg,cir.we apply the same standard of review that the district court applied to the bankruptcy court decision.because only legal conclusions are challenged,the review is de novo.in re southeast hotel props,cir.
before analyzing the specific exemption question presented in this case,we review some basic principles about the creation of a bankruptcy estate,the bankruptcy code exemption scheme,and the nature of the tenancy by the entirety in virginia.
the filing of a chapter petition creates a bankruptcy estate to be administered by the bankruptcy trustee.a.the estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.id.thus,a debtor interest in entireties property becomes part of the bankruptcy estate.see sumy,at greenblatt ford,cir,aff g in re ford.parenthetically,we note that when spouses file a joint chapter petition,separate bankruptcy estates are created.after an estate is created,the debtor may exempt eligible property.b.exempted property is not available to satisfy the debtor obligations.id.c.
the bankruptcy code provides two alternative schemes of exemption.under b a debtor may elect the specific federal exemptions listed in d.or,under b a debtor may choose the exemptions permitted under i state law,ii general nonbankruptcy federal law,and iii b b,covering interests held as a tenant by the entirety or as a joint tenant.section b allows a debtor to choose the first alternative the federal list unless applicable state law restricts the debtor to the exemptions that are available under b,the second alternative.virginia,like most states,has opted out of the federal exemption scheme,restricting its debtor citizens to the second alternative.see ann.michie.a debtor in virginia thus has available the commonwealth list of exemptions,federal nonbankruptcy exemptions,and b b entireties and joint tenancy exemption.under b b a debtor may exempt any interest in property in which the debtor had,immediately before the commencement of the case,an interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant to the extent that such interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.b b.the thomases and the claim the entireties exemption under this provision,and the trustee objects.the ultimate question,which we consider in part iii,is whether the debtors in
