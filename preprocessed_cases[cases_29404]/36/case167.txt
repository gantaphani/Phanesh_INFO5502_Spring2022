opinion of the court 
this is the second time we have been asked to resolve issues stemming from divorce and custody proceedings involving peter and pamela hughes.in this appeal,peter hughes challenges the district court grant of summary judgment,dismissing his civil rights claims under and his state law claims against defendants lynn long and patrick mchugh.hughes argues that the district court erroneously granted defendants absolute prosecutorial and witness immunity for his civil rights claims and that the supreme court of pennsylvania recent decision in llmd of michigan,jackson cross,precludes immunity for his state law claims.we affirm the district court dismissal of hughes civil rights claims,although for reasons different from those set forth by the district court we also affirm the district court dismissal of hughes state law claims because we predict that,if faced with the issue,the pennsylvania supreme court would not extend its holding in llmd to witnesses.
hughes claims against long and mchugh stem from an acrimonious child custody proceeding that took place in the court of common pleas of chester county between hughes and his former wife,pamela hughes.the custody dispute began when,in the midst of her divorce from hughes,pamela filed a petition for temporary custody of the children.in response to this petition,the court scheduled a conciliation conference before a custody conciliator.the custody conciliator recommended that appellee long,a licensed clinical social worker,conduct a full custody evaluation.the court adopted this recommendation,ordering hughes and pamela to participate in psychological evaluations with long.according to the order,long was to report the results of the psychological evaluations to the court and make any recommendations appropriate to a child custody determination.although the court appointed long to conduct the evaluation,long entered into a private contract with the parties whereby each agreed to pay fifty percent of her fee.
in accordance with the court order,long conducted the evaluation.she interviewed hughes,pamela,the children,and others.she also referred hughes and pamela to kathleen lacey,a psychologist who worked with long in her custody evaluations,for psychological testing.because lacey was not licensed at the time of the evaluations,she practiced under the supervision of appellee mchugh,a licensed clinical psychologist.mchugh did not directly supervise the tests administered by lacey,but he did review the results and approved her recommendations.
it is not clear what occurred at the conclusion of the psychological testing.apparently,after completing the psychological tests,long informally told hughes her custody recommendation for the children.for reasons unexplained,hughes was dissatisfied with this recommendation and therefore he hired his own expert,gerald cooke,to evaluate the results of the tests that long and lacey administered.according to hughes,long and lacey refused to give cooke the information upon which they based their conclusions,despite repeated requests and a court order.hughes claims that,rather than complying,long fabricated new data to support her report and that lacey and mchugh produced new psychological tests and results that were more favorable toward pamela.he contends that long,lacey,and mchugh gave these false reports to cooke and destroyed the original data.
during the custody hearing,hughes presented his allegations of fraudulent behavior by long,lacey,and mchugh.all three testified during the hearing and denied creating false reports,destroying any originals,or intentionally failing to comply with the court order to release their raw data.long testified in person and the depositions of lacey and mchugh were read.despite hughes allegations of fraud,the court adopted long formal recommendation and awarded joint custody to hughes and pamela.
hughes appealed the order of joint custody to the superior court of pennsylvania but later withdrew the appeal.after abandoning his state court appeal,he filed suit against the appellees in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,alleging interference with his familial rights in violation of the fourteenth amendment and his civil rights under and.hughes also alleged the following state law violations abuse of legal process defamation,false light,and invasion of privacy civil conspiracy fraud tortious interference with familial relations breach of contract and breach of implied contract.in response to hughes complaint,appellees filed their respective motions to dismiss.the district court granted those motions on the basis of the rooker feldman doctrine,which holds that a federal court does not have jurisdiction to review the final adjudications of a state highest court or to evaluate constitutional claims that are inextricably intertwined with the state court custody proceeding.in dismissing hughes claims,the court relied solely on this doctrine and did not rule on appellees arguments that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity pursuant to our decision in ernst child youth,cir.
on appeal,we reversed the district court with respect to its holding that the rooker feldman doctrine warranted a dismissal of hughes claims.see hughes macelree,cir.we also refused to affirm the dismissal of hughes complaint on the alter native basis that long and mchugh are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity under ernst.we found that an evidentiary record of appellees precise functions with respect to their participation in the underlying custody case had not been developed.
on remand,long and mchugh filed a motion for summary judgment,reasserting their argument that they are entitled to prosecutorial immunity under ernst.the district court granted long and mchugh motions,agreeing that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity from hughes and claims.alternatively,the court held that long and mchugh were entitled to witness immunity.the court also held that under pennsylvania law,long and mchugh were entitled to immunity from hughes supplemental state law claims.on december,hughes filed a timely notice of appeal.
hughes first argues that the district court erred by holding that long and mchugh are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity pursuant to our holding in ernst.he argues that appellees did not function as advocates for the state like prosecutors and child welfare workers.further,he argues that,in contrast to prosecutors and child welfare workers who initiate criminal and dependency proceedings,appellees did not initiate the custody proceedings.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment.see mardell harleysville life ins,cir.
section provides that e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured.on its face,it contains no defense of official immunity.in tenney brandhove,however,the supreme court held that congress did not intend to abrogate immunities well grounded in history and reason.in determining whether an immunity meets this standard,a court must first determine whether an official was accorded immunity from tort actions at common law when the civil rights act was enacted in.malley briggs,d.if a counterpart is found,a court must next determine whether history or purposes nonetheless discourage recognition of the same immunity in actions.see id.
even if an official did not enjoy absolute immunity at common law,she may still be entitled to immunity if she performs special functions that are similar or analogous to functions that would have been immune when congress enacted.see butz economou,d.this functional approach looks to the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it and evaluates the effect that exposure to particular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of that function.see forrester white,d.the official seeking immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question.see id.
under its historical and functional approach,the supreme court has recognized the defense of absolute immunity from civil rights suits in several contexts involving the judicial process.this immunity has given functionaries in the judicial system the ability to perform their tasks and apply their discretion without the threat of retaliatory litigation.thus,a judge acting in his judicial capacity is absolutely immune from suits,unless he acts without any colorable claim of jurisdiction.see stump sparkman,d pierson ray,d.witnesses,including public officials and private citizens,are immune from civil damages based upon their testimony.see briscoe lahue,d.the court has also granted absolute immunity to prosecutors for activities that are intimately associated with the judicial process such as initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution and presenting the state case in court.imbler pachtman,d.a prosecutor administrative and investigative duties,however,are not immune.see id.at.at.
we have provided social workers absolute immunity for actions involving the initiation and prosecution of child custody or dependency proceedings.in ernst child youth servs.of chester county,cir,we held that child welfare workers are entitled to absolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for,initiating,and prosecuting dependency proceedings,and that this immunity was broad enough to include the formulation and presentation of recommendations to the court in the course of the proceedings.in reaching this conclusion,we first reasoned that,similar to prosecutors who are responsible for the initiation of criminal proceedings,child welfare workers are responsible for bringing dependency proceedings and must exercise independent judgement in deter mining when to bring such proceedings.we also noted that,like prosecutors,child welfare workers often have to make decisions in a short amount of time and with limited information.see id.at.
additionally,we explained that child services workers are like prosecutors because they are advocates for the state and serve in a function intimately associated with the judicial phase of the child protection process.id.quoting imbler,at.at.specifically,we noted that child welfare workers are directly responsible for recommendations made to the court in dependency proceedings and for their actions in determining those recommendations and communicating them to the court.we concluded that this direct responsibility was similar to a prosecutor in criminal prosecutions.see id.
next,we reasoned that public policy considerations support absolute immunity for child welfare workers.see id.we noted that the fear of personal liability would compromise a worker independent judgement,rendering her overly cautious in dangerous situations where immediate action on behalf of a child is needed.we also noted that the likelihood of suits in retaliation for the initiation of dependency proceedings was great,given a parent predictable resentment of state interference in the relationship.finally,in concluding that child welfare workers deserve absolute immunity,we recognized that alternative mechanisms exist to prevent unconstitutional conduct by child welfare workers.these mechanisms include appellate review of a judge decision in a dependency hearing and agency supervision of a child welfare worker.see id.
here,the district court held that the functions of long and mchugh in the child custody proceeding were similar to roles of prosecutors and child welfare workers.according to the court,even though long and mchugh were initially impartial,once they arrived at a recommendation they became de facto advocates for their recommendations.we disagree and hold that long and mchugh enjoy judicial immunity because they acted as arms of the court,similar to a guardian ad litem or a doctor or psychologist,a person who fulfills a role at the court request.
to explain our analysis,we must examine the precise functions of long and mchugh in the custody proceedings.as indicated above,long was the custody evaluator.in that role,she interviewed hughes,his former wife,their children,and other relevant parties.she also administered parenting tests to hughes and his former wife and sent them to lacey for psychological testing.as directed by the court,long made a recommendation regarding a custody arrangement for the hughes children.mchugh role was slightly different.he was not appointed by the court,but as lacey supervisor,he reviewed and verified the psychological test results and the reports lacey prepared for long.thus,he assisted in the completion of long testing,which was an essential and primary component of long recommendation.without his assistance,long could not have completed the psychological evaluations.like long,mchugh also reported his findings to the court.
although long and mchugh acted like prosecutors and child welfare workers in formulating and presenting recommendations to the court,their roles differed in other significant respects.most notably,long and mchugh did not initiate the custody proceeding.indeed,the court appointed long after the proceeding began and,thus,long had no discretion to initiate or prosecute the custody proceeding.similarly,mchugh only became involved after the proceedings began.
next,in formulating and making their recommendations to the court,long and mchugh were not advocates of the state like prosecutors and child welfare workers.rather than making arguments,long and mchugh merely offered their opinions,based upon,in order to aid and inform the family court.long contract states w henever possible,i make every reasonable attempt to serve as a court appointed impartial examiner,rather than an advocate in custody litigation.at.thus,long and mchugh functioned more like witnesses or assistants to the court than advocates.
finally,although not a dispositive difference,long and mchugh were not acting under any time constraints and were not forced to make any snap judgments based on incomplete information,as is often the case with prosecutors and child welfare workers.rather,long and mchugh took six months to complete their evaluations and did so in a deliberate,methodical,and thorough fashion.although the district court discounts this difference,we expressly recognized it as a factor in holding that child welfare workers are analogous to prosecutors in ernst.see at 
although not cloaked in prosecutorial immunity,long and mchugh are entitled to judicial immunity because they acted as arms of the court and per formed functions integral to the judicial process.specifically,the court appointed long to gather information,conduct an evaluation,and make a recommendation to aid the custody determination.mchugh,although not directly appointed,was indirectly assigned this task because his review of the psychological evaluations was necessary for their completion.in essence,long and mchugh functions were to engage in neutral and advise the court.these functions are intimately related and essential to the judicial process because they aid and inform the court in its discretionary duties.in the absence of the extensive and recommendations of evaluators,courts would be required to make custody recommendations with little,if any,unbiased information about the family.given this integral relationship to the court,we hold that long and mchugh are entitled to judicial immunity.
long and mchugh similarity to a guardian ad litem,an individual who enjoys judicial immunity,supports this conclusion.a guardian ad litem is a person appointed by the court in custody proceedings to serve as an investigator and gather information about the parents and the children and report back to the court recommending which parent should receive custody.see cok cosentino,cir a gal typically gathers information,prepares a report and makes a recommendation to the court regarding a custody disposition.raven lidman,the guardian ad litem in child custody cases the contours of our judicial system stretched beyond recognition.same.characterized as agents of the cou
