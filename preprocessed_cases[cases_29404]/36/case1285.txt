introduction 
appellant hosanna homes and respondent families first are both foster family agencies ffas utilized by respondent county of alameda the county for placement of foster children in the underlying action,hosanna homes alleged it was damaged by an illegal rollover instituted by families first and the county.the rollover occurred when a foster family with two foster children severed its relationship with hosanna homes,and retained the children in their home after becoming certified as a foster family with families first.hosanna homes appeals the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of families first and the county.
it is undisputed that the rollover in question was requested by the county,the public entity entrusted with the foster children welfare,and was sanctioned by order of the alameda county juvenile court,the ultimate legal authority over the foster children.furthermore,the undisputed facts reveal that no statute,rule,regulation or contract was ignored or broken when the foster family left hosanna homes and became a certified foster family with families first.consequently,we affirm the trial court grant of summary judgment,concluding there is no basis in law or fact for hosanna homes claims that the conduct of the county and families first was wrongful in any respect.
facts and procedural history 
we take the facts from the statement of undisputed material facts filed in support of the summary judgment motion and from the supporting documentary evidence.on december,the juvenile court entered an order committing the foster children,james and victoria,to the care,custody and control of the alameda county social services agency for placement in a foster home.welf.the foster children had been severely abused and neglected by their birth parents.on august,the county and hosanna homes entered into a written contract for placement of the foster children in the certified family home of richard and rebecca robbins the robbins.hosanna homes had recruited the robbins as foster parents and officially certified them on february.this certification permitted the robbins to operate as a foster family through hosanna homes.the robbins had also entered into a written contract with hosanna homes.
the robbins provided the children with a stable and loving environment for several years before problems arose with hosanna homes.in,the robbins and hosanna homes began to have conflicts regarding continued psychotherapy for james m.the robbins believed that james needed more psychotherapy due to a variety of factors,including wetting the bed at age,anger management issues,and severe problems at school.hosanna homes believed that continued psychotherapy for the child was unnecessary because after two and a half years of therapy with no improvement,further therapy might be unwise.
around this time,hosanna homes social work director,paulette krieger,wrote to all of hosanna homes foster families concerning several disturbing incidents which necessitated hosanna homes conveying an extremely urgent and serious message to each of our foster families.in her memorandum,director krieger reiterated the following hosanna homes policy under no circumstances,except extreme emergencies where you are unable to reach your hosanna social worker or the social work director,should you contact or communicate with a county child welfare worker,attorney,or other agent,without specific prior approval from your hosanna social worker.underscoring in original.hosanna homes policy was succinctly stated in the memorandum no agent from the department of social services is to enter your home or interview you or your family without the presence of a hosanna homes worker.
the memorandum went on to explain that direct,unsupervised contacts between foster parents and social service workers were believed to be circumventing hosanna ability to interpret and to protect the families from unnecessary confusion,conflicting instructions,unnecessary interruptions to your schedule,possible serious allegations and removal of foster children without hosanna knowledge.the memorandum warned that unauthorized communications exposes you to a potentially very intrusive public bureaucracy from which you may need protection,and communication should only take place within the confines of the protective buffer offered to each of you by the hosanna social work staff.director krieger memo explained that the policy was being emphasized for the protection of the foster parents and hosanna homes.
robbins ultimately contacted the county child welfare worker assigned to the foster children,judith guerra,regarding continued psychotherapy for james m.in,a meeting was held at the robbins home with guerra and representatives from hosanna homes.after the meeting was concluded,and contrary to the hosanna homes policy prohibiting direct,unsupervised contacts between foster families and department agents,guerra and the robbins met in private.guerra described multiple alternatives to the robbins if they could not reach agreement with hosanna homes,including adoption,guardianship and the possibility of a rollover to another ffa.
the robbins subsequently investigated a variety of ffas and determined that giving up their certification with hosanna homes and becoming certified by families first was their best alternative.verne teyler,the executive director of hosanna homes,expressed his vehement opposition to this plan,even going so far as to threaten to remove the foster children from the robbins home.the robbins were very attached to the foster children and became fearful that the children were going to be removed from their home by hosanna homes.
the robbins then visited families first for an initial meeting after making a telephone call to them.a representative of families first told them to attempt to work out their problems,and they were referred back to hosanna homes.however,the problems between hosanna homes and the robbins only grew worse.
the robbins again contacted guerra in an attempt to enlist her support for a rollover to families first.eventually,guerra spoke with a representative of families first,and indicated her support for the rollover.guerra also obtained the approval of her supervisor before agreeing to the rollover.in september,families first gave hosanna homes notice of the anticipated rollover.however,the attempted rollover to families first was abandoned because hosanna homes threatened to sue families first for interference with contract.
nonetheless,the problems between hosanna homes and the robbins persisted.teyler continued to threaten termination of the foster family relationship.teyler admitted warning the robbins that unless they cooperated with hosanna in following the proper procedures to determine what was in the best interests of the foster children,hosanna might have to decertify the robbins as a foster family if the robbins were decertified,then they would not qualify as foster parents.
the robbins provided several written and oral notifications to hosanna homes that they no longer wanted to be certified by hosanna homes,and that they wanted to rollover to families first.hosanna homes repeatedly refused their requests,while also threatening to remove their foster children.
on october,teyler wrote to the alameda county department of children and family services and the attorney appointed to represent the foster children acknowledging that the robbins had requested to rollover to another ffa.teyler confirmed that hosanna homes refused to agree to a rollover.he referred to the robbins as rogue foster parents who feel they can be independent and not accountable.teyler claimed the robbins were ill advised and may now be well beyond the salvage point.as a result,teyler asked the county to remove the children from the robbins home and place them in another hosanna homes certified home.that same day,teyler wrote to the robbins advising them that hosanna homes had contacted the county seeking the relocation of james and victoria to another home.
in late,guerra took another position within the county social services agency.she was replaced by paul wright as the county social worker on the case.
in the spring of,a conference was held with representatives from hosanna homes jim mehlfeld,the county ffa placement specialist paul wright the robbins and others.the same issues were once again addressed,and there was no resolution.several mental health professionals at the meeting,such as james psychologist and psychiatrist,believed the child psychotherapy should continue.hosanna homes treatment team,including its consulting psychologist,believed james should take a break from therapy,at least temporarily,as he had been in therapy for two and years with no improvement.given the dispute between the robbins and hosanna homes,the professionals in favor of continued therapy concluded that rolling over to families first was probably a good idea.this included james therapist,psychiatrist,foster parents,the county social worker,and the supervisors from the county,the child attorney,and others.it was only the representatives of hosanna homes,in reliance on hosanna homes consulting psychologist,who objected to the continued psychotherapy and to the anticipated rollover to families first.
on march,the county notified hosanna homes in writing that the rollover was going to take place.on march,the robbins sent a letter to hosanna homes indicating w e wish to be decertified as foster parents with your agency effective may.please release relevant information to families first,hosanna homes retained counsel to prevent the transfer,who wrote a letter to the county director of children and family services on may.in part,this letter requested that the county not discuss placement issues with the robbins,including,transfer,decertification,certification,guardianship,or adoption,unless or until so invited by hosanna homes the exclusive use current certifying foster family agency.
on may,kenneth shaw,program manager for the county children and family services,sent a letter to teyler indicating that the county was removing the foster children from placement with hosanna homes.the letter indicated,this plan will allow us to maintain the court ordered placement of these two minors in the robbins home and do so under the certification of another foster family agency.the letter further stated it was the county understanding that the robbins certification with hosanna homes had expired as of february,the county asked families first to certify the robbins home on may.
on may,mehlfeld,the county ffa placement specialist,requested that the court issue an order approving the rollover to families first.he explained,this placement is a rollover,in which the sic and robbins will transfer their certification from hosanna to the families first ffa and the children will remain in the robbins home.the reason is that the robbins want to transfer and alameda is in agreement with,and supports this transfer in order to allow the family to receive improved services.on june,juvenile court referee claudette brooks approved the rollover,and on june,the order was filed with the court.teyler was outraged by the conduct of the robbins,families first and the county.he wrote to a state official,kathy eddings,a licensing program analyst with community care licensing,the county,and families first,indicating his refusal to accept the rollover.
less than a month after entry of the juvenile court order,hosanna homes filed this lawsuit against the county,families first,and the robbins.hosanna homes sought recovery for common law breach of contract and tort claims,as well as an injunction prohibiting the robbins from d iscussing placement issues with the county unless specifically invited to do so by hosanna homes.
the complaint went through several amendments.the iteration before us,the third amended complaint,alleges causes of action against the county for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,inducing the robbins to breach their contract with hosanna homes,and negligently and intentionally interfering with hosanna homes prospective economic relationship with its certified foster family.causes of action against families first include unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section,inducing breach of contract,and negligent and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the monetary damages allegedly sustained by hosanna homes were described as follows the county breach caused hosanna damages in that hosanna had to refund money paid for the robbins foster children and lost the revenue it would have received from the county had the robbins remained with hosanna,estimated to be and consisting of the revenue hosanna would have been entitled to through the foster children birthdays.in addition,hosanna is entitled to revenue for any other foster children that would have been placed with the robbins.
after three years of discovery and more than days of depositions,families first and the county filed a motion for summary judgment the trial court granted summary judgment to both defendants in light of the order of the juvenile court.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to identify those cases in which there is no triable issue as to any material fact.code civ,subd.c.for practical purposes,an issue of material fact is one which,in the context and circumstances of the case,warrants the time and cost of factfinding by trial.martin lockheed missiles space th,d.in other words,not every issue of fact is worth submission to a jury.on summary judgment the trial court must separate those cases in which there are material issues of fact meriting a trial from those in which there are no such issues.
on appeal,we review the trial court decision to grant or deny the summary judgment motion de novo,on the basis of our independent examination of the record.sangster paetkau th,d villa mcferren th,d union bank superior court th,d jambazian borden th,d.we also independently review the trial court determination of questions of law.to that end,we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons or rationale.in short,we review the summary judgment without deference to the trial court determination.citations.eisenberg alameda newspapers,th,d.like the trial court,we must consider all the evidence properly identified in the papers submitted,except evidence to which objections have been made and sustained by the court.code civ,subd.c barber marina sailing,th,fn,d.
the questions before us in this appeal are pure questions of law.the material facts necessary for summary judgment are undisputed.the issues framed by hosanna homes third amended complaint all embody the conclusion of law that if the original ffa refuses to accept the surrender of a foster family certification with that agency,any subsequent rollover to another ffa is illegal.the essence of its claim is that the statutory scheme governing ffas makes the relationship between each ffa and its certified foster families an exclusive one.this exclusivity prohibits rollovers without the consent of the original certifying ffa.also,hosanna homes asserts that a rollover would result in the foster family having overlapping dual certifications one from the original ffa and one from the ffa to whom the family would rollover,a situation not sanctioned by the statutory scheme.
in order to understand hosanna homes arguments,some examination of the statutory scheme governing ffas is necessary.when the juvenile court orders removal of a dependent child from his or her parents under the authority of welfare and institutions code section,its alternatives for the child care include placement under the supervision of the social worker with an ffa to be placed in a suitable foster family home which has been certified by the agency as meeting licensing standards.welf,subd.e.
placement of dependent children in certified family homes is further governed by the california community care facilities act hereafter the act health,et.the act provisions reflect a legislative determination that because of the more difficult nature of foster children and the increased costs of caring for them,it is becoming difficult to recruit and train foster
