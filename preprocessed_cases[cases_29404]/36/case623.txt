a family home in westlake village was purchased during marriage with a downpayment from husband separate property funds and the proceeds of a loan in husband name.title to the property was taken in husband name,as a married man,as his sole and separate property.approximately months later,husband completed the sale of a separate property home he owned prior to marriage and used the proceeds to retire the loan on the new home.wife moved out several years later.in dissolution proceedings,the trial court found the westlake village home was community property.the court awarded reimbursement of husband separate property contributions under family code section the court also charged husband for the fair market rental value of the home from the time wife moved out to the date of judgment.
on appeal,husband contends there is no evidence that he transmuted his separate property to community property.instead,he asserts the trial court should have found both separate and community property interests were established in the westlake village home proportionate to the respective contributions to the equity in the property.in the published portion of the opinion,we hold that if property is acquired during marriage with both separate and community funds,the transmutation requirements of section must be satisfied before the reimbursement provisions of section apply.the documents in this case do not contain an express transmutation of husband separate property,and therefore,husband separate property contributions remained husband separate property.he held a separate property interest in the property proportionate to the separate property funds that he contributed.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we address husband contentions that wife quitclaim deed should not have been set aside for undue influence,he should not be charged for the rental value of the property unless the court has ordered exclusive use of the property to one spouse,the rental value of the property should have been offset by husband separate property payments to maintain the property,and sanctions should have been issued in the amount of husband attorney fees for wife excessive litigation of claims to husband separate property.we conclude substantial evidence supported setting aside the quitclaim deed.the amount charged based on the rental value of the property must be recalculated to reflect the community proportionate interest in the property.the denial of attorney fees as sanctions was within the trial court discretion.
we reverse the portion of the judgment concerning the ownership and division of westlake village property and the charges for the rental value of the property,and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

procedural background 
after approximately years of marriage,wife filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage on september.in july,the parties stipulated to bifurcate the characterization of the westlake village home and one other issue which was eventually withdrawn.in wife trial brief,she argued that the westlake village residence was presumed to be community property under section because it was acquired during marriage.the common law presumption based on the form of title under evidence code section did not apply.the westlake village residence was community property because the proceeds of a loan during marriage are presumed to be community property unless there is evidence that the lender relied on separate property in extending credit.the lender must have intended to rely on husband community property income for repayment,because husband employment income was listed on the loan application,and the other source of income listed was less than the amount of the mortgage payment.the quitclaim deed should be set aside as a product of undue influence,because wife did not have full knowledge of the facts,did not understand the legal effect of the transaction,no consideration was provided,and the transaction was not fair.
husband argued in his trial brief that the westlake village property was his separate property,subject to a pro tanto community property interest under moore marsden the downpayment for the westlake village property came from his separate property.the mortgage on the property was paid within two years with proceeds from the sale of his separate real property.wife executed a quitclaim deed at the time the property was purchased,but any advantage to husband from the quitclaim deed was trivial because the community interest was negligible.

the trial court made the following findings.the westlake village property was presumed to be community property because it was acquired during marriage.wife testified that husband promised the property would be held jointly as community property and her name would be put on the title.she understood he was investing his separate property in the residence and the investment would remain separate.she denied any agreement that the home would be his separate property with no community interest.husband explanation to wife that the quitclaim deed was a means to keep his separate property separate was inadequate,because the law presumed the house was community property and provided for reimbursement of his separate property contribution to the purchase of the marital home under section.knowledge of this law was imputed to husband as a real estate broker,and he failed to meet his obligation to explain it to wife.the trial court found wife testimony concerning the quitclaim deed was more credible and the presumption of undue influence had not been rebutted.with respect to the quitclaim deed,husband had not demonstrated the highest good faith and fair dealing as to wife.the court found husband failed to meet his burden to rebut the presumption the westlake village home was community property.the trial court also found husband had a claim under family code section for reimbursement of his separate property contributions to the purchase of the property.on june,the final statement of decision on the bifurcated issue became the order of the court.

characterization of westlake village home 
husband contends separate and community property interests were established in the westlake village home in proportion to the separate and community contributions to equity.wife contends husband is simply entitled to reimbursement of his separate property contributions,without interest or appreciation,in accordance with the provisions of section.we conclude the trial court finding that the westlake village home is community property is not supported by substantial evidence.the evidence shows the home was purchased with a downpayment from husband separate property and loan proceeds attributable to the community.husband did not sign an express written declaration transmuting his separate property to community property as required to change the character of the property under section.therefore,his contribution to the purchase of the westlake village home maintained its separate property character and did not become community property.the requirements of the transmutation statute must be met before the reimbursement provisions of section apply.we agree that there are both separate and community property interests in the westlake village home in proportion to the equity contributions.

spouses can agree to alter the character of their property haines,supra,th at,but the evidence required to prove their agreement has changed over time in re marriage of weaver d.under early case law,the form of title was evidence of the parties agreement and raised a presumption that the ownership of property was as shown in the title document.lucas,supra,cal d at see,gudelj gudelj cal d,siberell siberell cal.the form of title was not conclusive.in re marriage of aufmuth d,aufmuth.it could be overcome by evidence of an oral agreement or understanding that ownership was actually held in another form,but it could not be rebutted simply by tracing the source of the funds for the purchase.lucas,supra,at.

the supreme court applied the presumptions arising from the form of title in lucas,supra,cal d.in lucas,a home was purchased during marriage and title was taken in joint tenancy.id.at.the wife used her separate property for the downpayment,and the couple assumed a loan for the remainder of the purchase price.appellate decisions conflicted about whether an agreement between the parties was necessary to maintain a separate property interest in a home purchased during marriage in joint title.id.at.
the lucas court began its analysis with the form of title.lucas,supra,cal d at.under former civil code section,a single family residence held in joint tenancy was presumed to be community property at dissolution.as a result of the express designation of ownership in the title document,a greater showing was required to rebut the presumption than merely tracing the source of the funds.id.at.the lucas court held that when parties have specified a joint form of title,the spouse claiming a separate property interest needs to show an agreement or understanding that the separate property contributions will remain separate.ibid.
the lucas court reasoned that the noncontributing spouse needs to be aware of the expectation of reimbursement to have an opportunity to obtain alternate financing to preserve the joint ownership of the property.lucas,supra,cal d at.the act of taking title in a joint and equal ownership form is inconsistent with an intention to preserve a separate property interest.accordingly,the expectations of parties who take title jointly are best protected by presuming that the specified ownership interest is intended in the absence of an agreement or understanding to the contrary.ibid.
the lucas court noted that a spouse who uses separate property for community purposes during marriage is presumed to have intended a gift to the community.lucas,supra,cal d at citing case law about the use of separate property for community expenses,not for assets existing at dissolution.a contributing spouse is entitled to reimbursement only if the parties have an agreement providing for reimbursement.ibid.the absence of a statutory right to reimbursement together with basic equity considerations led us to conclude that the husband acts with a donative intent that transmutes his separate property into community property.citation.in re marriage of epstein cal d,fn.omitted.

the aufmuth court calculated the separate and community interests in a property purchased during marriage on a pro rata basis in proportion to the separate and community funds invested in the property.aufmuth,supra,d at.the wife separate property share was the amount of equity paid from her separate funds plus the amount of capital appreciation attributable to her separate funds,while the community share was the amount of equity paid by community funds added to the amount of capital appreciation attributable to community funds.ibid.amounts that did not increase the equity in the property,including taxes,maintenance and insurance,were not included.ibid.
the lucas court applied the same presumptions to determine the ownership of a motor home as well.the couple had traded in a community property vehicle during marriage toward the purchase of a family motor home.lucas,supra,cal d at.the wife used her separate property for the balance of the purchase price.title was taken in the wife name alone,without any objection by the husband.the lucas court concluded the husband made a gift of his community property interest in the motor home to the wife,because title to the motor home was taken in the wife name alone,the husband was aware of it,and he did not object.id.at.
community contributions to property acquired before marriage 
a few months after deciding lucas,in moore,supra,cal d,the supreme court found both separate and community property interests were established in property acquired before marriage in one spouse name and purchased with both separate and community funds.the supreme court calculated the community share of the property based on the formula in aufmuth that was approved in lucas.id.at.the wife had purchased a house before marriage,took title in her name as a single woman,and made some of the loan payments.during marriage,the parties made loan payments with community funds.id.at.the moore court held that upon dissolution,the community shared title to the property in proportion to the amount contributed to the purchase price.id.at.to calculate the separate property share,the separate property contributions the downpayment and the loan proceeds,minus the amount by which community funds reduced the principal balance of loan are divided by the purchase price.id.at.the separate property percentage is multiplied by the property total appreciation during marriage to determine the capital appreciation attributable to the separate funds.ibid.the separate property share is the equity paid from separate property plus the appreciation attributable to separate property.ibid.to determine the community property share,the amount that community funds reduced the principal is divided by the purchase price.id.at.the community property percentage is multiplied by the total appreciation of the property during marriage to calculate the community share of appreciation.ibid.the community share is the equity paid by community funds and the appreciation attributable to community funds.id.at.amounts that do not increase the equity value of the property,including interest,taxes and insurance,are not included in the calculation of the parties interests in the property.id.at.

statutory scheme enacted in response to lucas 
the legislature enacted several statutes in response to lucas,including provisions governing the transmutation of property,ownership of jointly titled property,and reimbursement of the contributions to acquire property.
transmutation requirements 
in,the california law revision commission the commission reported that under existing law,it was easy for spouses to transmute real or personal property based on oral statements or conduct,which reflected the informality of interspousal transfers,but generated extensive litigation in dissolution proceedings.it encourages a spouse,after the marriage has ended,to transform a passing comment into an agreement or even to commit perjury by manufacturing an oral or implied transmutation.recommendation relating to marital property presumptions and transmutations,cal.law revision com.commission report.
to solve the problem of unreliable evidence in transmutation cases,the legislature adopted the transmutation requirements of former civil code sections through,now family code sections through.estate of macdonald cal d,valli,supra,cal th at.section provides a transmutation of real or personal property is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made,joined in,consented to,or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected,subd.a.a married person may transmute the character of property from separate to community or from community to separate by agreement or transfer,with or without consideration,but the transmutation must meet the statutory requirements to be valid.haines,supra,th at.
the statute requires formalities to increase certainty that a transmutation occurred.commission report,supra,at.to satisfy the requirement of an express declaration,a writing signed by the adversely affected spouse must expressly state that the character or ownership of the property at issue is being changed.estate of macdonald,supra,cal d at.valli,supra,cal th at.an express declaration does not require use of the terms transmutation,community property,separate property,or a particular locution.citation.in re marriage of starkman,supra,th at.though no particular terminology is required citation,the writing must reflect a transmutation on its face,and must eliminate the need to consider other evidence in divining this intent.citation.in re marriage of benson cal th.the express declaration must unambiguously indicate a change in character or ownership of property.citation.a party does not slip into a transmutation by accident.citation.in re marriage of starkman,supra,at.
the transmutation statute applies to property transactions between spouses,as well as to property purchased from third parties.valli,supra,cal th at.it does not apply to a gift between spouses of personal items that are used primarily by the recipient and are not substantial in value taking into account the circumstances of the marriage,subd.c.
courts have adhered closely to these requirements and declined to find a valid transmutation without a clear understanding in writing that the document changes the character or ownership of specific property.in re marriage of starkman,supra,th at trust language stating any property transferred to the trust was community property unless identified as separate property did not unambiguously establish spouse was effecting a change of ownership of separate property in re marriage of barneson th,written instructions to transfer stock to spouse name,and form stating the undersigned hereby sells,assigns and transfers unspecified shares of stock to spouse,did not expressly state the characterization or ownership of the property was being changed estate of bibb th,registration of separate property automobile in the name of husband or wife was not a valid transmutation,because dmv printout was not signed by adversely affected spouse and did not contain clear and unambiguous expression of intent to change character,but deed granting property from husband to husband and wife as joint tenants was a valid transmutation,because it was signed by the adversely affected spouse and grant is the word historically used to transfer an interest in real property in re marriage of leni th,escrow instructions to split proceeds from sale of community property did not satisfy transmutation requirements,because there was no express declaration that the character of the property was being changed compare in re marriage of holtemann th,transmutation agreement stating character of listed property was transmuted from husband separate property to community property of both spouses was a valid transmutation in re marriage of lund th,agreement stating husband separate property is hereby converted to community property of husband and wife was a valid transmutation.
to show an agreement changing the character of property from separate to community,or community to separate,the requirements of the transmutation statutes must be met.if the form of title to property changes the character of the property without meeting the requirements of section,then the title presumption of evidence code section does not apply.valli,supra,cal th at.
in this case,the westlake village property was acquired with both separate and community funds,and title was taken in husband name as his separate property.husband did not sign any writing containing an express declaration that he was changing the character of his separate property.in fact,every document that husband signed reflected an intent to maintain the separate character of the property.husband use of his separate property in the acquisition of the westlake village home did not meet the statutory requirements of section to change the character of his separate property.
we note the presumption of evidence code section based on the form of title does not apply in this case,because it conflicts with the transmutation requirements.the loan proceeds used to purchase the property were found to be community property.the transmutation requirements had to be met for the character of property purchased with community loan proceeds to become husband separate property as stated in the conveyance of title.wife did not sign any of documents conveying title to husband other than the quitclaim deed that was set aside.once the quitclaim deed was set aside,none of the remaining documents in the case satisfied the statutory requirements to transmute wife community property interest in the westlake village property to husband separate property.because the presumption based on the form of title conflicts with the transmutation requirements in this case,the form of title presumption does not apply.
joint title presumption of family code section 
the legislature also changed the rule that a spouse could rebut the presumption of community property for a joint tenancy residence with evidence of an oral agreement that it was separate property.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.in,the legislature enacted former civil code section,now section,which expanded the joint title presumption of civil code section for single family residences to all property acquired during marriage in joint form.in re marriage of buol cal d.under section,property acquired in joint title during marriage is presumed to be community property upon dissolution the presumption of section may be rebutted only by a clear statement in the title document or proof of a written agreement that the property is separate and not community property.the requirement of a writing provides a reliable test by which to determine the understanding of the parties.it seeks to prevent the abuses and unpredictability that have resulted from the oral agreement standard.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
this appellate court recently held the requirements of section must be met to transmute separate property to joint title before the joint title presumption of section applies.in re marriage of lafkas th.
reimbursement 
the lucas court holding that separate funds used to acquire a community asset were a gift to the community unless the party could prove an agreement otherwise was widely considered to cause injustice to persons who contributed their separate funds for use by the community and then lost the funds entirely to the community at dissolution of marriage.often the parties were unaware that taking title in joint tenancy had the effect of making a gift of the separate property to the community.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
in,the legislature adopted the statutory reimbursement provisions of former civil code section,now section.section provides a limited reimbursement of separate property contributions as part of the division of the community estate under the family code contributions to the acquisition of community property are reimbursed to the extent a party traces the contributions to a separate property source,unless the party waived the reimbursement right in writing or signed a writing that has the effect of a waiver,subd.b.the amount reimbursed does not include interest or appreciation,and can not exceed the net value of the property at the time of division.ibid.
contributions include funds used for downpayments,improvements and the reduction of the principal of a loan that financed the purchase or improvement of the property,subd.a.contributions do not include the interest paid on the loan or payments for maintenance,insurance,or taxes.ibid.
under section,in case of dissolution of the marriage,a party making a separate property contribution to the acquisition of the property is not presumed to have made a gift,unless it is shown that the parties agreed in writing that it was a gift,but is entitled to reimbursement for the separate property contribution at dissolution of marriage.the separate property contribution is measured by the value of the contribution at the time the contribution is made.under this rule,if the property has since appreciated in value,the community is entitled to the appreciation.if the property has since depreciated in value,reimbursement may not exceed the value of the property if both parties are entitled to reimbursement and the property has insufficient value to permit full reimbursement of both,reimbursement should be on a proportionate basis.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
the commission noted that the joint title and reimbursement provisions also govern a spouse separate property when title to the property is taken in joint form during the marriage.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.the measure of the separate property contribution under section in such a case is the value of the property at the time of its conversion to joint or community property form.ibid.
in,the legislature added subdivision c to section in,which provides for reimbursement of a party separate property contributions to the acquisition of the other spouse separate property during marriage,unless there has been a transmutation in writing or a written waiver of the right to reimbursement.stats,ch.
priority of family code section 
we conclude that the transmutation provisions of section must be satisfied to change the character of separate property to community property before the reimbursement provisions of section apply.
it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in determining such intent t he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.citation.estate of macdonald,supra,cal d at.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.in re marriage of walrath cal th.canons of statutory construction may assist in determining legislative intent,including the duty to harmonize statutes on the same subject if possible,the presumption against implied repeals,and the rule that a specific statute prevails over a general one.medical bd.of california superior court th,fns.omitted.
by the plain language of the statute,section applies to contributions to the acquisition of community property.in other words,it applies to separate property contributions that are traceable from a community property asset at dissolution.section does not purport to apply to separate property used during marriage to acquire an asset that retains its character as separate property.in order for section to apply,the asset purchased during marriage must be characterized as community property,and in order for separate property to become community property,the transmutation provisions must be satisfied.
in valli,the supreme court explained the rationale for applying the transmutation statutes over the presumption of evidence code section based on the form of title.valli,supra,cal th at.the court r
