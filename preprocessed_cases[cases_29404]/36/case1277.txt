discussion 
isharon appeal must be dismissed 
sharon argues her appeal should not be dismissed because her notice of appeal was timely filed because the trial court granted a hearing on her motion for reconsideration of its march,order awarding annette attorney fees,the effect of which was to vacate that order and we should consider the trial court order denying her motion for reconsideration to be appealable in the circumstances of this case.alternatively,sharon requests that we consider her appeal to be a petition for writ relief.
we first address the timeliness of sharon notice of appeal of the trial court march,order awarding annette attorney fees and whether its grant of a hearing on her motion for reconsideration of that order vacated that order for purposes of appeal under appellate rules.
