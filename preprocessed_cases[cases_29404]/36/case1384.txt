at issue before this court is a preliminary question in an appeal brought by trial counsel for two dependent children,ages four and one.the question is whether the children appellate counsel has the authority to seek dismissal of their appeal based on her analysis of their best interests.on review,we hold appellate counsel has no such authority.
factual and procedural history 
in august,the kern county superior court adjudged josiah and infant gabriel dependent children of the court and removed them from parental custody.the court previously determined the children came within its jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b after gabriel tested positive for drugs at birth not only were the children at substantial risk of physical harm or illness due to their mother drug abuse,their father had been physically abusive of their mother.
after both parents failed to reunify with their sons,the court in july terminated reunification services and set a section hearing.having made its setting order,the court then granted a request by the children attorney for a hearing on relative placement.the paternal grandparents previously requested placement of the children in their home,but their request was denied.claiming she did not know the reason for the denial,children trial attorney claimed a right to a hearing on the issue.
the court conducted the evidentiary hearing in september.respondent kern county department of human services the department made a showing that each of the paternal grandparents had a criminal record and the paternal grandmother own children had been juvenile dependents due to her neglect.further,the placement worker for the department and later her supervisor denied the paternal grandparents requests for an exemption.the court found the department did not abuse its discretion in denying the paternal grandparents placement.it then separately considered and denied the paternal grandparents current request for placement.trial counsel for the children appealed on her clients behalf.
discussion 
as is our practice,we appointed new counsel through the central california appellate program ccap to represent the children as appellants before this court.soon thereafter,appellate counsel requested travel funds to visit her young clients and assess their current situation and wishes.she explained that,in her professional opinion,it was not in the children best interest to pursue the appeal and if,after visiting the children,she still believed dismissal of the appeal was in their best interest,she would move to dismiss the appeal.because counsel request involved the expenditure of taxpayer funds,we ordered briefing on appellate counsel authority to seek dismissal of her minor clients appeal based on her analysis of their best interests.in other words,if appellate counsel was not authorized to seek dismissal of her minor clients appeal based on her analysis of their best interests,there was no good cause shown to grant her request for travel funds.on review,appellate counsel fails to cite and our own independent research does not reveal any persuasive,let alone binding,authority to support her position.
in her original request to this court,appellate counsel claimed a duty to take a fully independent,informed position in representing the minors on appeal and to obtain input from all necessary sources.she cited language from this court opinion in in re david d.david as well as a portion of the ccap panel attorney manual ccap manual which references david 
david was a parents appeal from an order terminating parental rights under former civil code section.in re david,supra,d at.in part,the parents claimed their child trial counsel was ineffective.this court did not speak to the ineffectiveness claim given that we were reversing the judgment on alternative grounds.nevertheless,we did address the proper role of an attorney appointed to represent a minor in a former civil code section or other custody proceeding.in re david,supra,d at.at the time,former civil code section gave the juvenile court the discretion to appoint counsel for a minor when the interests of the minor required such appointment.this court observed 
the role of counsel for the child is not merely to act as a mouthpiece for the minor child.but neither is counsel to act as a mouthpiece for the governmental agency concerned.the whole purpose behind section is to provide independent counsel,when necessary,for the protection of the minor interests.we suggest,at a bare minimum,counsel for the minor should thoroughly review the record,interview the child when appropriate,considering such factors as health and age,and consider some type of contact with the child foster and natural parents in order to make an informed judgment on behalf of his client.independent medical and psychological assessment might be necessary in appropriate cases.only by such endeavor can the court be assured that counsel for the minor is truly independent and is informed enough to represent the child best interests.in re david,supra,d at.
it was this portion of david which appellate counsel cited as authority to independently evaluate her young clients best interests.however,in doing so she took this court words out of context.as noted above,the issue we addressed was the proper role of an attorney appointed to represent a minor in a former civil code section or other custody proceeding.furthermore,the counsel to whom we referred was trial,not appellate,counsel.even accepting the notion that a minor appellate counsel has a duty to take a fully independent,informed position in representing the minor on appeal,our words do not stand for the proposition that it is also appellate counsel duty to independently evaluate her young clients best interests and decide whether to pursue the appeal based on that evaluation.
appellate counsel subsequent briefing effort remains unpersuasive.to begin,the legislature has not spelled out the duties of appellate counsel appointed to represent children in dependency appeals.by contrast,section,subdivision e outlines the duties of trial counsel appointed to represent children in dependency proceedings.it provides 
the counsel for the child shall be charged in general with the representation of the child interests.to that end,the counsel shall make or cause to have made any further investigations that he or she deems in good faith to be reasonably necessary to ascertain the facts,including the interviewing of witnesses,and he or she shall examine and witnesses in both the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings.he or she may also introduce and examine his or her own witnesses,make recommendations to the court concerning the child welfare,and participate further in the proceedings to the degree necessary to adequately represent the child.in any case in which the child is four years of age or older,counsel shall interview the child to determine the child wishes and to assess the child,and shall advise the court of the child wishes.counsel for the child shall not advocate for the return of the child if,to the best of his or her knowledge,that return conflicts with the protection and safety of the child.in addition counsel shall investigate the interests of the child beyond the scope of the juvenile proceeding and report to the court other interests of the child that may need to be protected by the institution of other administrative or judicial proceedings.the attorney representing a child in a dependency proceeding is not required to assume the responsibilities of a social worker and is not expected to provide nonlegal services to the child.the court shall take whatever appropriate action is necessary to fully protect the interests of the child,subd.e.
our supreme court has specifically ruled that the legislature did not intend the provisions of section to apply to counsel appointed for children in dependency appeals.in re zeth cal th,d,zeth.zeth arose out of one appellate court willingness to receive and consider evidence particularly from a child appointed appellate counsel and rely on such evidence,which was outside the record on appeal,to reverse a judg
