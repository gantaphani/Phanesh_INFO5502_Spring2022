the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction allows a parent to petition for the return of a child when that child has been removed or retained from her habitual residence country in violation of the parent custody rights in that country.the petition at issue in this case concerns two children and retained by their mother in the united states who hail from the caribbean island of saint martin.that square mile island is comprised of two legally distinct,yet highly integrated,countries french saint martin where the children went to school and dutch sint maarten where the children had their home to complicate matters further,the hague convention is recognized by french saint martin through france but is not recognized by dutch sint maarten 
the extraordinary facts of this case require us to decide an issue of first impression may a child have two habitual residence countries at the same time under the hague convention concurrent habitual residence we conclude that the text of the convention does not permit concurrent habitual residence.we therefore look to the ordinary meaning of the term residence and hold that the children were habitual residents only of the country in which they lived dutch sint maarten.because dutch sint maarten does not recognize the convention,the convention does not apply to this case.
accordingly,we will vacate the district court judgments and dismiss the petition.because the district court granted the petition as to,we will also instruct the district court to order that be returned to the united states forthwith.
factual background and procedural history 
factual background 
the parties dispute in this case revolves around two children and is the biological son of petitioner maurice marie didon didon and respondent alicia dominguez castillo dominguez,and is the biological daughter of dominguez from a prior relationship.dominguez moved to dutch sint maarten in,leaving behind in the dominican republic.dominguez subsequently met didon in and moved into his apartment in dutch sint maarten in.on november,was born,and shortly thereafter,in,moved into the dutch sint maarten apartment.
after moved in,didon and dominguez petitioned the french consulate to change birth certificate to list didon as her father.that petition was granted and a new birth certificate was issued for listing didon as her father and dominguez as her mother.although didon characterizes this process as an adoption of,the parties never appeared before a court or otherwise formally engaged in the adoption process.app.vol.i at.
the family resided at the dutch sint maarten apartment for the next three years.throughout this time period,although the family resided in dutch sint maarten it was primarily oriented to french saint martin where didon worked,and where the children attended school,went to doctor appointments,app.vol.i at.further,the family administrative affairs,such as the children insurance,were managed in french saint martin.app.vol.i at.
in july,didon filed a custody action in french civil court seeking full custody of and dominguez was neither served with papers in the action nor otherwise notified of the custody proceeding.during the pendency of the action,dominguez informed didon that she would be taking and to new york city on august,to attend her sister wedding.dominguez advised didon that she and the children would return on september,and showed didon three airline tickets from dutch sint maarten to new york city to that effect.
on september,didon contacted the children school to inform the school that would be absent due to a vacation to the united states.didon was told by school administrators that the school was not expecting to return because dominguez had disenrolled the children.didon immediately contacted the police,who were able to get in contact with dominguez by telephone on the same day.didon claims that dominguez promised on the call to return with the children the following day,as planned,but dominguez claims not to have made such a promise.dominguez did not return with the children on september.
in the children absence,didon continued to pursue his french custody action and,on march,the french court granted full custody of and to didon in an ex parte order at the same time,didon had hired a private investigator to look for the children and,in the summer of,the investigator located them in hazleton,pennsylvania.
procedural history 
on august,didon filed the instant hague convention petition in the middle district of pennsylvania seeking the return of and to french saint martin didon also filed an ex parte motion seeking a temporary restraining order and an expedited hearing on the merits of his petition.
on august,the district court held an ex parte telephone hearing with didon counsel,after which it entered an order directing the marshals service to serve a copy of the order and petition on dominguez,and to confiscate the passports and other travel documents of dominguez,and.the district court also granted didon request for a temporary restraining order and enjoined dominguez from removing and from the middle district of pennsylvania pending a hearing on the merits of the petition.the district court subsequently held hearings in the matter on september and september,during which both parties presented testimony and other evidence.
on september,the district court rendered judgment,granting didon petition as to and denying the petition as to.the district court began by fixing the date of retention as september,the day on which dominguez had promised to return from the united states with the children.it then examined where the children were habitually resident prior to that date.it observed the parties testimony reveals that the border between dutch sint maarten and french saint martin is so permeable as to be evanescent,and is regularly and readily traversed by residents and travelers alike f or most purposes of its residents daily life,the island is essentially undivided.app.vol.i at.it highlighted testimony about the family extensive contacts with both countries and concluded that the record facts,in addition to the nature of the island itself,support a finding that and were habitual residents of both dutch sint maarten and french saint martin.app.vol.i at.
in support of its conclusion,the district court distinguished cases holding that a child may have only one habitual residence country at a time as deciding whether the child had abandoned a prior habitual residence in favor of a new one.app.vol.i at.it also invoked dicta from mozes mozes,cir.referencing the rare situation where someone consistently splits time more or less evenly between two locations,so as to retain alternating habitual residences in each.app.vol.i at internal quotation marks omitted quoting mozes,at.
the district court bifurcated the remainder of its analysis.with respect to,the district court noted that the parties were in agreement that didon had custody rights under french law because is his biological son.the district court also noted that didon was exercising those custody rights until dominguez took to the united states.because dominguez retained from his habitual residence in violation of didon custody rights under french law,the district court concluded that was wrongfully retained under the hague convention and granted the petition as to 
with respect to,the district court began by observing that didon did not have custody rights over through adoption because his purported adoption did not satisfy the requirements of french law to vest custody.the district court also rejected didon argument that the french court ex parte custody order vested him with custody rights over at the time of retention because the judgment was not issued until more than six months after the alleged wrongful retention date of september.app.vol.i at.because didon did not have custody rights over under french law at the time of retention,the district court concluded that was not wrongfully retained under the convention and denied the petition as to 
dominguez filed a motion for an emergency stay of the district court judgment with respect to pending appeal,which the district court denied without comment on september.was subsequently transferred from dominguez to didon on that same day didon and dominguez filed from the district court judgments with respect to and,respectively.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over the hague convention petition pursuant to and a.we have jurisdiction over the parties of the district court judgments pursuant to.
we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error karpenko,at.accordingly,we will uphold the district court factual findings if its account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record,even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting tsai yi yang fu chiang tsui,cir.
iii.analysis 
the hague convention was designed to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases.karpenko,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting tsai yi yang,at.to that end,it provides a return remedy that seeks to restore the status quo that existed prior to the wrongful removal or retention of a child from her habitual residence country.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting tsai yi yang,at.the convention deems a removal or retention to be wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention,supra,at.
in evaluating whether the petitioning parent has made that showing,a court must determine when the removal or retention took place where the child was habitually resident immediately prior to the removal or retention whether the removal or retention violated the petitioning parent custody rights under the law of the child habitual residence and whether the petitioning parent was actually exercising those custody rights at the time of the removal or retention,or would have exercised those rights but for the removal or retention karpenko,at.
in this case,we need only examine the second question habitual residence,which proves dispositive.the district court concluded that the hague convention permits the children to have concurrent habitual residence in dutch sint maarten and french saint martin.we conclude that the hague convention does not permit concurrent habitual residence and hold that the children were habitually resident only in the country in which they lived dutch sint maarten.because dutch sint maarten does not recognize the hague convention the convention does not apply to this case.see hague convention,supra,at karkkainen kovalchuk,cir.legal analysis,supra,at t he convention may be invoked only where the child was habitually resident in a contracting state and taken to or retained in another contracting state.accordingly,the petition must be dismissed.
a.the hague convention does not permit concurrent habitual residence 
in determining whether the hague convention permits concurrent habitual residence,we begin our analysis with the text of the treaty.see abbott abbott,d the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.internal quotation marks omitted quoting medellin texas,d.as with a statute,where the text of a treaty is unambiguous,we apply the treaty as written and the analysis is complete.see chan korean air lines,d united states duarte acero,cir.
we conclude that the text of the hague convention unambiguously contemplates that a child may have only one habitual residence country at a time.rather than referencing a state of habitual residence or the states of habitual residence,the convention repeatedly refers to the state of habitual residence.see,hague convention,supra,at preamble the states signatory to the present convention,desiring to establish procedures to ensure the prompt return of children to the state of their habitual residence emphasis added id.at the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the retention emphasis added see also f t he term authorities,as used in article of the convention to refer to the authorities of the state of the habitual residence of a child emphasis added.such language is not susceptible to any construction whereby a child may have more than one habitual residence country at a time.see in marriage of flr,austl.rhona schuz,policy considerations in determining the habitual residence of a child and the relevance of context,transnat l pol y,linda silberman,interpreting the hague abduction convention in search of a global jurisprudence,davis.
this textual conclusion finds support in the convention explanatory report,which is generally recognized as the official history and commentary on the convention.whiting krassner,cir.quoting legal analysis,supra,at accord feder,at.the explanatory report similarly makes clear that a child may have only one habitual residence country at a time 
the practical application of the wrongful retention principle requires that the signatory states be convinced that they belong,despite their differences,to the same legal community within which the authorities of each state acknowledge that the authorities of one of them those of the child habitual residence are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access.
elisa pérez vera,explanatory report,in hague conference on private international law,acts and documents of the fourteenth session emphasis added.
thus,it is unsurprising that the overwhelming majority of united states cases that have addressed the issue have concluded that a child may have only one habitual residence country at a time.see,sorenson sorenson,cir.a person may have only one habitual residence.quoting silverman silverman,cir.en banc robert tesson,cir.same miller miller,cir.same foreign cases addressing the issue have reached the same conclusion.see,in marriage of hanbury brown flr,austl.t he notion of concurrent habitual residence is simply inconsistent with the wording of the convention,and with all known judicial pronouncements upon it.kaniuch pontes,carswellalta,para.can.alta.wl re v abduction habitual residence flr,eng.cameron cameron sc scot.
courts have not strayed from this bedrock principle even where a child has meaningful connections to two countries.for example,in shuttle custody situations,a child spends a roughly equal amount of time in two countries because her parents,who live in different countries,agree to split custody.see supra note.in a recent shuttle custody case,rather than considering the possibility of concurrent habitual residence,the ninth circuit adopted the theory of alternating habitual residence whereby a child habitual residence alternates between those two countries valenzuela michel,cir.
in concluding that concurrent habitual residence is possible under the convention,the district court relied on an earlier ninth circuit decision mozes mozes,cir.in mozes,the ninth circuit observed in dicta that,although the view held by many courts is that a person can only have one habitual residence at a time under the convention,t he exception would be the rare situation where someone consistently splits time more or less evenly between two locations,so as to retain alternating habitual residences in each.id.at emphasis added.the court went on to observe that,if a child spent regularly alternating periods with each parent,the child might acquire dual habitual residences.id.at emphasis added.in support of its observations,the court cited to a commentator that advocates for the possibility of concurrent habitual residence paul beaumont peter mceleavy,the hague convention on international child abduction.
after carefully reviewing mozes,it is not clear to us whether the ninth circuit was endorsing concurrent habitual residence or alternating habitual residence in that case the ninth circuit later opinion in valenzuela appears to interpret mozes to have endorsed alternating habitual residence.see valenzuela,at.however,to the extent that mozes can be read to support concurrent habitual residence,we reject that interpretation of the hague convention as inconsistent with the convention unambiguous text.
we are mindful that,in cases where a child has meaningful connections to two countries,the determination of which is the child habitual residence may sometimes be difficult.however,that is the determination required by the text of the hague convention courts are permitted only to interpret existing treaty provisions not those provisions.see lozano montoya alvarez,d.t o alter,amend,or add to any treaty,by inserting any clause,whether small or great,important or trivial,would be on our part an usurpation of power,and not an exercise of judicial functions.it would be to make,and not to construe a treaty.chan,at.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting in re the amiable isabella,wheat.at.therefore,remaining faithful to the text of the treaty,we hold that a child may have only one habitual residence country at a time under the hague convention.
b.the children habitual residence country is dutch sint maarten 
given our conclusion that the convention does not permit concurrent habitual residence,we must now determine in which country the children were habitually resident dutch sint maarten or french saint martin.
the hague convention does not define the phrase habitual residence.see feder,at.however,we interpret the words of treaties in accordance with their ordinary meaning.see santovincenzo egan.abbott,at.in re del,cir.habitual residence is defined as a person customary place of residence.habitual residence,black law dictionary ed.we therefore look to the ordinary meaning of the term residence,which is incorporated into the phrase habitual residence as a matter of language and definition.see koch koch,cir.guzzo cristofano,cir.simcox simcox,cir.residence is defined as t he place where one actually lives,or,put another way,where one has a home.residence,black law dictionary ed.residence,merriam webster dictionary online,last visited,see live,merriam webster dictionary online,last visited.
in our view,it would disregard the ordinary meaning of the term residence to find that a child is habitually resident in a country in which she has not lived.consider,for example,a child whose home is in new jersey but who travels to new york each day to attend elementary school and engage in various other daily activities.on those facts,regardless of how much time the child spent each day in new york,an ordinary person would not say that the child is a resident of new york a state in which she does not live.see in re del,at.indeed,the parties have not pointed us to any case in which a child was found to be habitually resident in a country in which she had not lived 
although drawing such a distinction between two relevant countries may seem somewhat arbitrary,it is the result of a difficult choice of law question faced by the drafters of the hague convention how to determine which country custody law to apply where two countries have a potential interest in the application of their own custody law.the drafters of the convention decided to resolve this question by according priority to the country of habitual residence,believing authorities in that country to be in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access.pérez vera,supra,at.such distinctions are common in conflict of laws analyses,which often resolve difficult choice of law questions by reference to rules viewed as predictable and.see generally kermit roosevelt,conflict of laws examining the territorial theory of the restatement first of conflict of laws under which the law of the location of a legal event generally governs in following the ordinary meaning of the term residence and requiring that a child have lived in a country for a finding of habitual residence,we are honoring the choice of law rule provided by the drafters of the convention.
the adoption of a living requirement for habitual residence also fits harmoniously within existing habitual residence jurisprudence.such a requirement is consistent with principles of habitual residence to which we have looked in the past.see whiting,at all that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does has a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled.emphasis added quoting feder,at in re application of adan,at same delvoye lee,cir.where a child is born while his mother is temporarily present in a country other than that of her habitual residence the child will normally have no habitual residence until living in a country on a footing of some stability.first alteration in original emphasis added quoting clive,the concept of habitual residence,the jurid.part.it is also consistent with cases from other courts.see guzzo,at defining habitual residence as the place where a child usually or customarily lives emphasis added barzilay barzilay,cir.observing that an agreement between two parents purporting to set a child habitual residence in a country where the child has never lived would be ineffectual.moreover,in a typical hague convention case where a child is moved from one country to another and a court must determine which is her habitual residence,see valenzuela,at,the child has lived in both countries and so the requirement would be satisfied no matter which country the court determines to be the child habitual residence.
we therefore conclude that a child must have lived in a country before that country can be considered her habitual residence under the hague convention.we take this opportunity to outline the analytical structure that courts should use in determining a child habitual residence country.
in answering the question of where a child is habitually resident,we have traditionally followed several principles.the inquiry into a child habitual residence is a determination that can not be reduced to a predetermined formula and necessarily varies with the circumstances of each case.karkkainen,at.as a general matter,a child habitual residence is the place where the child has been physically present for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and which has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.baxter baxter,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting feder,at.this approach considers a child experience in and contacts with her surroundings,focusing on whether she develop ed a certain routine and acquire d a sense of environmental normalcy by form ing meaningful connections with the people and places she encountered in a country prior to the retention date.karkkainen,at alterations in original quoting whiting,at.we also consider the parents present,shared intentions regarding their child presence in a particular location,tsai yi yang,at alteration in original quoting baxter,at,especially w hen a child is too young to have an intent regarding her habitual residence,in re application of adan,at.
within this framework,the living requirement logically comes before any question of where a child is acclimatized or the shared intentions of her parents it is a prerequisite to a finding of habitual residence.a court adjudicating a hague convention petition should first ask whether the child at issue has lived in the purported habitual residence countries.if that requirement is satisfied for those countries,the court should then engage in the inquiry laid out in the preceding paragraph.viewed in this way,the living test is used to determine whether a child has multiple residence countries,and the inquiry is used to determine,among those residence countries,which is the child habitual residence.
in this case,although the children attended school in french saint martin,it is clear that the country in which they lived,had a home was dutch sint maarten because there is only one country in which the children lived,our analysis is complete and we need not proceed to the inquiry.we hold that the children were habitual residents of dutch sint maarten alone.because dutch sint maarten does not recognize the hague convention the convention does not apply to this case and the petition must be dismissed see hague convention,supra,at.
vi.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the district court judgments and dismiss the petition.we will also instruct the district court to order that be returned to the united states forthwith.the clerk of court will issue the mandate immediately.

we will use the term saint martin to refer to the entire island,french saint martin to refer to the french country,and dutch sint maarten to refer to the dutch country.

the authorities on this issue are inconsistent in their usage of terminology.the phrases concurrent habitual residence,alternating habitual residence,and dual habitual residence are sometimes used interchangeably.however,concurrent habitual residence refers to a situation where a child is habitually resident in two countries at the same time,whereas alternating habitual residence refers to a distinct situation where a child is moved in between two countries on a regular basis known as shuttle custody such that her habitual residence alternates between those countries.dual habitual residence can be used to refer to either or both situations.for the sake of clarity,we will refer to the phrases concurrent habitual residence and alternating habitual residence in the manner just described and will not use the term dual habitual residence.
the following facts are taken from the district court factual findings and are unchallenged by the parties unless otherwise noted.
the district court acknowledged that didon owned a apartment building in french saint martin,which the family used both as a rental unit for tourists and for personal use.app.vol.i at.however,on the basis of testimony that the family did not reside there permanently and only stayed there together five or six times per year,the district court concluded that the apartment was not the parties primary residence and was only used periodic ally.app.vol.i at.
dominguez argues that only attended school in french saint martin,but the record contains evidence suggesting that attended school in french saint martin as well.see app.vol.ii at.the district court finding that both children attended school in french saint martin was not clearly erroneous.
dominguez alleges that didon procured this judgment by fraud.she argues that we should deny his petition because he seeks equitable relief and comes before us with unclean hands.however,we have expressly rejected the application of the unclean hands doctrine to hague convention petitions.see karpenko leendertz,cir.
under icara,a petition must be filed with a court authorized to exercise its jurisdiction in the place where the child is located at the time the petition is filed.b.
the result of our decision today is that must be transferred back to the united states from saint martin.after that transfer,will have been relocated between saint martin and the united states three times in two years.we are naturally concerned that these multiple relocations of the child have been or will be detrimental to his.see chafin chafin,d.accordingly,we reiterate here that a district court issuing a return order in a hague convention matter should seriously consider the possibility of staying that order pending appeal.while we do not endorse r outine stays in such matters,a district court should carefully consider the traditional stay factors when considering whether to stay a return order whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding and where the public interest.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting nken holder,d.
didon argues that the district court determination that the children were concurrent habitual residents of dutch sint maarten and french saint martin is a factual finding that we must review for clear error.however,didon argument conflates the related,but distinct,questions presented by this determination of where a child is habitually resident is a mixed question of law and fact.feder evans feder,cir.on such questions we employ a mixed standard of review,accepting a district court historical or narrative facts unless they are clearly erroneous,but exercising plenary review of the court choice of and interpretation of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the facts.id.under this standard,the question of whether a child may have concurrent habitual residence countries under the hague convention defines the concept of habitual residence,id.and therefore is a classic legal question over which we exercise plenary review.
because didon permitted dominguez to travel to the united states with the children,didon has alleged only a wrongful retention of the children.see feder,at.therefore,we will not discuss wrongful removal.
once the petitioner meets its initial burden,the respondent may oppose the child return by proving one of five affirmative defenses.karpenko,at.before the district court,dominguez unsuccessfully sought to invoke the affirmative defense that there is a grave risk that return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.id.at.dominguez does not present any argument on this point on appeal and so has waived our consideration of the affirmative defense.see tsai yi yang,at.in any event,as the district court concluded,the sketchy and sharply disputed evidence of didon alleged abuse of does not approach the level of clear and convincing evidence required to prove the affirmative defense.karpenko,at.
