as part of their dissolution of marriage proceedings,appellant kathryn lund and respondent earl lund,contested whether earl transmuted his separate real properties into community property by way of a written agreement executed in the court below,conducting a bifurcated trial of this issue pursuant to california rules of court,rule,determined earl had not transmuted his separate property and,even if he had,kathryn did not meet her burden of establishing she had not unduly influenced earl in the execution of the agreement at issue.we granted kathryn motion to appeal the court interlocutory order cal.rules of court,rule d and now reverse.earl made an express declaration in writing of his unambiguous intention to transmute all of his separate property as of the date he executed the agreement,subd.a.the court erred in finding the agreement to be ambiguous and in finding earl was unduly influenced.a valid transmutation of earl separate property occurred.
kathryn and earl married in august.kathryn had one daughter from a previous marriage,earl had a son and daughter from a previous marriage both of whom kathryn adopted,and the parties together had a son following their marriage.kathryn petitioned for dissolution of marriage in march,and earl response to the petition also included a request for dissolution of marriage.
the issue before us is whether a document executed by the parties on december,entitled agreement to establish interest in property of earl lund,and anne lund effectively transmuted various real properties from the separate property of earl to the community property of earl and kathryn.on that day,kathryn spent approximately minutes at a law firm reviewing and signing various documents along with the aforementioned agreement,the last will and testament of anne lund and the earl lund.trust.she had not reviewed any of the documents before her arrival at the law office.kathryn met earl at the law office on his lunch hour there is no testimony in the record regarding earl level of familiarity with or understanding of the documents at issue earl did not testify.
the parties disagree as to the meaning of the agreement to establish interest in property,and further disagree as to whether the other documents executed on december,should play any role in the interpretation of the agreement at issue.we quote in detail below relevant provisions of the various documents signed by the parties on december.

trial of bifurcated issue 
the court commenced proceedings in may to determine whether the agreement to establish interest in property transmuted earl separate property to community property.the court led off by expressing its uncertainty as to interpreting the meaning of the contract i t seems like the issue as framed is if we assume there are sufficient magic words to transmute the separate property a question arises what does for estate planning purposes mean does it mean that the parties are merely reciting the motivating reason behind this transmutation of property,or is it some sort of king x i do know whether item e in the agreement to establish interest in property is something that makes the contract ambiguous.the court invited the parties to call expert witnesses to assist the court in determining whether the repeated use of the phrase for estate planning purposes was intended as a term of art which would affect the overall meaning of the agreement to establish interest in property.the court further framed the issue for trial here what i do know.if it his separate property,can they for estate planning purposes and for tax basis,say the magic words,for community property,then it community property,but for all other purposes it not 
the parties each called a qualified expert in the field of estate planning law.the experts discussed the tax advantages of community property separate property upon the death of one spouse.earl expert discussed in detail the way in which the various estate planning documents,which he defined to include the agreement to establish interest in property,would work together in the hypothetical event of the death of one of the parties had they remained married.the estate plan the trust,combined with the agreement to establish interest in property only provided tax benefits if the couple was married when one died thus,the trust revoked upon separation of the parties.earl expert opined that the agreement to establish interest in property would be accepted by the irs as transmuting the property into community property.but,in his opinion,the internal revenue service irs acceptance of the document in the hypothetical does not equate to an actual transmutation occurring under california law language in the agreement indicating it is for estate planning purposes and language in section e providing i t is not intended by this agreement to make any transfer of property between the parties hereto negates the contrary indications that the agreement actually transmutes earl separate property as of december.
the court issued a statement of decision on june.the statement of decision states in relevant part the court finds no effective transmutation occurred.the agreement is ambiguous,particularly when read in conjunction with the trust,and if it is not,the most reasonable construction of the documents is the parties objectively intended the agreement to change separate property to community property only if they were married when one spouse died.in this case,the language of the agreement is certainly an express declaration connoting an intent to change respondent separate property to community property.but the court must not read that language in a vacuum.the agreement,the trust,and the wills were executed the same day.the parties wills provide all of the estate planning documents are integrated.the court considers them as a whole.although the language convert in the agreement is clear and unambiguous when read alone,other language in the documents is contrary to it,or at least makes the parties objective intent ambiguous.a party intent to effect a transmutation must be unambiguous taken together,the estate planning documents create an ambiguity about what the parties intended.concerning the second issue,the court finds that even if the agreement effected a valid transmutation,it was the product of undue influence.
discussion 
transmutation of property interests 
the first issue before us is whether the court correctly interpreted the agreement in finding earl had not unambiguously declared his intention to transmute his separate real properties to community property.m arried persons may by agreement or transfer,with or without consideration,t ransmute separate property of either spouse to community property.a transmutation of real or personal property is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made,joined in,consented to,or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected,subd.a.a writing signed by the adversely affected spouse is not an express declaration for the purposes of section,subd.a unless it contains language which expressly states that the characterization or ownership of the property is being changed.estate of macdonald cal d.section,subdivision a,does not require use of the term transmutation or any other particular locution.id.at.however,t he express declaration must unambiguously indicate a change in character or ownership of property.citation.a party does not slip into a transmutation by accident.in re marriage of starkman th,d starkman.
in deciding whether a transmutation has occurred,we interpret the written instruments independently,without resort to extrinsic evidence.citations.under the circumstances,we are not bound by the interpretation given to the written instruments by the trial court.starkman,supra,th at,d.
the most factually similar california case to the instant one is in re marriage of holtemann th,d holtemann,a case published after the court reached its decision in this case.in holtemann,a married couple executed a spousal property transmutation agreement and a trust one year before their separation.id.at,d.an introductory provision in the transmutation agreement stated t he parties are entering into this agreement in order to specify the character of their property interests pursuant to the applicable provisions of the california family code.this agreement is not made in contemplation of a separation or marital dissolution and is made solely for the purpose of interpreting how property shall be disposed of on the deaths of the parties.ibid.the transmutation agreement,in its substantive provisions,stated husband agrees that the character of the property at issue is hereby transmuted from his separate property to the community property of both parties.id.at,d.the transmutation explicitly referenced the trust,and the wife acknowledge d that the transmutation of husband separate property into community property herewith was undertaken upon the express condition that the disposition of the trust estate of said trust,upon the death of husband and of wife shall remain in effect,and not be amended,modified or changed by wife ibid.
the holtemann court affirmed the trial court in finding an unambiguous transmutation occurred regardless of the motivations underlying the documents,they contain the requisite express,unequivocal declarations of a present transmutation.moreover,the documents reflect that husband was fully informed of the legal consequences of his actions.holtemann,supra th at,d.w e are not aware of any authority for the proposition that a transmutation,once effected,can be limited in purpose or otherwise rendered conditional or temporary in other words,husband wishes to have his cake and eat it too.he argues that,in the event of either his or wife death,the survivor would be able to use the transmutation agreement to claim the property as community property,thus obtaining a full step up in basis to the fair market value of the property at date of death,while at the same time denying the validity of the transmutation agreement as an instrument which created community property.id.at,d.we conclude,however,that his chosen language speaks to a contrary intent.ibid.
interpretation of agreement to establish interest in property 
interpreting the agreement at issue in this case as a whole,and analyzing it alongside holtemann,supra,th at,d,we conclude that it unambiguously effects a transmutation of earl separate property into community property.two substantive provisions of the agreement make clear all of the property previously held as earl separate property should be considered community property as of december.section b,part states all property,real and personal,of the parties hereto,whether title thereto is held in the names of one or the other of the parties or both of the parties as joint tenants or otherwise,is the community property of the parties hereto,each having a present,existing,and equal interest therein.section c states all of the property,real and personal,held in the name of husband having its origin in his separate property no matter how received earned,is hereby converted to community property of husband and wife,and shall thereafter be the community property of the parties for estate planning hereto,each having a present,existing,and equal interest therein.italics added.although the agreement does not use the word transmutation,sections b and c clearly and unambiguously evidence an intent to transmute earl separate property into community property in december 
the parties elimination of section a further confirms that the intent of the agreement was to transmute all of earl separate property,as this section identified earl real property as his separate property.by removing section a from the agreement,the parties manifested their intent to eliminate any potential argument that the real properties identified in section a were not subject to the transmutation provided for in section 
the court was influenced in its interpretation of the agreement by language in the recitals and in section e of the agreement indicating the agreement was executed for estate planning purposes,as well as the existence of other estate planning documents the trust and the wills.but,as correctly stated in holtemann,supra,th at,d,the motivations underlying the documents are irrelevant the relevant question is whether they contain the requisite express,unequivocal declarations of a present transmutation.it simply does not matter that the agreement,the trust,and the wills were all executed together as part of a single estate planning strategy.the parties hotly dispute the question of whether we should interpret the agreement alone or in conjunction with all of the estate planning documents.but all the estate planning documents show is the parties had a comprehensive estate plan which would operate to provide the surviving party with tax benefits had the marriage survived until the death of the other party.the estate planning documents do not have any bearing on whether the agreement at issue contains the requisite express,unequivocal declarations of a present transmutation.holtemann,supra,th at,d.
there is one important textual difference between the document interpreted in holtemann and the agreement before us.in section e of the agreement here,it states it is not intended by this agreement to make any transfer of property between the parties hereto,nor shall this agreement be construed for any purpose to affect any such transfer,but this agreement is executed solely for the purpose of recognizing as between the parties the type of ownership of the properties acquired and now owned by them.in addition,the parties agree to join in the execution of such other deeds,assignments or documents as may be required to reflect the formal record ownership in accordance with this agreement.earl argues and the court below agreed section e creates ambiguity as to earl intent to transmute his previously separate property,and therefore no transmutation occurred because there is not an unequivocal declaration taking section e into consideration,if there is an unambiguous meaning of the contract,it must be that earl did not actually intend to transmute the property but only intended to execute a document capable of convincing the irs that a transmutation had occurred and there is no evidence in the record indicating the parties executed other documents to bring formal record ownership into accordance with the agreement,and thus the parties must not have meant to transmute the separate properties.
we disagree with each contention.interpreting section e to simply undo or call into question the work done by sections b and c violates basic principles of contract interpretation.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other,a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violation the intention of the parties,an interpretation which gives effect is preferred to one which makes void.sections b and c clearly transmute earl separate property into community property if at all possible,section e should be interpreted to be consistent with sections b and c.this can
