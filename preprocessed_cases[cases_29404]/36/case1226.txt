factual and procedural background 
termination of deborah parental rights 
in october deborah and michael,married at the time,entered into a stipulation for judgment providing michael would have sole legal and physical custody of their two children,michael,and paris deborah was granted visitation rights.deborah and michael marriage was dissolved in april.approximately six months later deborah decided to stop visiting the children because,according to her,the visitation was not working out for various reasons.deborah agreed to a modification of the earlier child custody judgment,relinquishing her visitation rights.
in october deborah filed a motion to terminate her parental rights.deborah declaration in support of her motion stated,michael has been a wonderful father to the children and i do not wish to share parenting responsibilities with michael because he is doing so well without me.i want to forever give up any and all rights pertaining to the children because i believe that by doing so,it is in the children best interests.deborah also stated she fully understood the implications of relinquishing her parental rights.
at the hearing on deborah motion,which michael did not attend,michael counsel stated michael did not oppose deborah motion and counsel was there to facilitate a record that will allow the motion to be not only granted but enforceable.deborah was examined under oath by her counsel,as well as by michael counsel,to ensure she in fact wanted her parental rights terminated and fully understood the consequences of her action the court granted deborah motion,finding that,deborah has left the minor children in michael exclusive custody for a period in excess of one year.during such period,deborah has not communicated with the children.deborah believes that it is in the best interest of the minor children that her parental rights be terminated based on deborah belief that it is in the best interest of the minor children that they remain in michael exclusive custody without contact by deborah,the court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence to terminate deborah parental rights pursuant to family code b.
deborah ex parte application for an order to show cause for modification of,among other things,child custody and child support 
more than two years after deborah motion to terminate her parental rights had been granted,she filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause seeking,among other things,temporary exclusive custody of the children pending completion of a psychiatric evaluation to assist in determining what permanent custody would be in the best interest of the children.the application stated deborah now sought temporary custody because of concerns arising from michael criminal prosecution and press reports michael had associated with the nation of islam,whose members deborah believed do not like jews.because she is jewish,deborah feared the children might be mistreated if michael continued his association with the nation of islam.michael opposed deborah ex parte application in part on the ground deborah lacked standing to request the court make any orders regarding the children because the court had previously terminated her parental rights 
after several rounds of extensive briefing on a myriad of legal theories and following oral argument,the court on april,granted in part and denied in part deborah ex parte application.the court found its earlier order terminating deborah parental rights the termination order void because it had failed to order an investigation or consider appointment of counsel for the children,as required by family code sections and.however,the court found there was no basis at that time to permit deborah visitation or contact with the children.the court also ruled deborah request for psychiatric evaluation was not an emergency warranting ex parte relief but could be renewed through a properly noticed motion.
michael motion to vacate the portion of the court order declaring the termination order void 
on september,after retaining new counsel,michael moved to vacate that portion of the court april,order declaring the termination order void on the ground the order was final and could not be directly or collaterally attacked.in response deborah argued a void order could be collaterally attacked at any time.relying on in re goodarzirad d.goodarzirad stipulations between parents involving the minor children which attempt to divest the court of jurisdiction are void,deborah asserted for the first time the termination order was void because it had been impermissibly based on michael and her stipulation to terminate her parental rights.
the court denied michael motion to vacate,finding that,even though michael had not stipulated in writing to the termination of deborah parental rights,the termination proceeding was the functional equivalent of a stipulated agreement between the parties and as such void under goodarzirad.notwithstanding its own statement in october that termination was in the best interest of the children,the court found in fact no inquiry had been made by the court at that time.the court explained,not a single thing was done to enlighten the trier of fact as to the best interests of the children.the children interests were not brought forth through any of the means that our codes provide.and goodarzirad stands for the proposition that parties can not by themselves stipulate to termination of parental rights.if there ever was a case where the parties stipulated to the termination of parent rights and nothing further was done,this was such a case.
contentions 
michael contends he did not stipulate to the termination of deborah parental rights and the termination order is therefore not void or otherwise subject to collateral attack and the failure of the court to follow proper procedures in conducting the inquiry into termination was invited error and,in any event,harmless 
discussion 
the trial court had jurisdiction to decide deborah collateral attack on the october judgment terminating her parental rights 
deborah contends,because the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in entering the october termination order,that order is void and properly subject to collateral attack.although collateral attacks on judgments are disfavored see,robert leslie th,d,in some cases,if the court has awarded relief to one of the parties the law declares can not be granted,as deborah contends occurred here,that judgment may be collaterally attacked.
lack of jurisdiction in the most fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.citation.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,a trial court has no power to hear or determine the case.citation.and any judgment or order rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is void on its face citation.in a broader sense,lack of jurisdiction also exists when a court make s orders which are not authorized by statute.polin cosio th,d.i t seems well settled that when a statute authorizes prescribed procedure,and the court acts contrary to the authority thus conferred,it has exceeded its jurisdiction abelleira,at,see polin,at,d judgment awarding custody exceeded statutory authority goodarzirad,supra,d at.stipulated judgment to terminate paternity was void and subject to collateral attack.
if the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear or determine a case and personal jurisdiction over the parties,an order or judgment rendered in excess of the court jurisdiction,such as by its failure to follow fundamental procedures prescribed by statute,remains valid but voidable.neumann melgar th,d in re andres th,d.a stipulated judgment or other order in excess of the court jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked absent unusual circumstances or compelling policy considerations.in re marriage of hinman th,fn,d.thus,appellate courts have repeatedly allowed acts in excess of jurisdiction to stand when the acts were beneficial to all parties and did not violate public policy in re andres,at,d see,cowan superior court cal th,d,trial court allowed defendant to plead guilty to a lesser included offense or when allowing objection would countenance a wholly unacceptable trifling with the courts.see,kristine lisa cal th,d,in re griffin cal d,trial court as a result of defendant actions revoked probation after expiration of probation period.on the other hand,appellate courts have voided acts in excess of jurisdiction when the irregularity was too great or when the act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy.goodarzirad,supra,d at.stipulation of parties to deprive court of authority to modify child custody and visitation orders in dissolution proceeding people mendez d.reducing felony conviction to misdemeanor and sealing conviction record people blakeman d,banishment as condition of probation.whether the voidable order is enforced depends,in large part,on the degree of the procedural irregularity and whether the court act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy.in re andres,at,d adoption of matthew d.
as we discuss below,the termination order exceeded the trial court jurisdiction and contravenes the public policy favoring that a child has two parents rather than one.kristine lisa,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,deborah collateral attack on that order is not precluded 
the termination order was impermissibly based on the parties agreement to terminate deborah parental rights 
a court can not enter a judgment terminating parental rights based solely upon the parties stipulation that the child mother or father relinquishes those rights.kristine david th,d the public policies favoring creation of a relationship as a source of emotional and financial support trump any policy that would favor private ordering of parenthood after the birth of a child goodarzirad,supra,d at.in re matthew d.
in goodarzirad the trial court approved a stipulation in a divorce proceeding in which the husband relinquished his custody and visitation rights in return for the wife waiver of her right to collect all child support,both delinquent amounts currently due and any future support.goodarzirad,supra,d at.after the trial court denied the husband subsequent motion to vacate the judgment terminating his parental rights,the court of appeal reversed,holding the stipulation attempted to divest the court of jurisdiction over the parties minor children and was,therefore,void on public policy grounds.id.at.this continuing jurisdiction is vested in the court,and is to be exercised,in the interests of children.it is their right to have the court hear and determine all matters which concern their welfare and they can not be deprived of this right by any agreement of their parents.the welfare of children is of interest to the state.the legislature has fixed the period within which such powers may be exercised by the courts as that of the minority of the children,and it is not within the power of the court to fix a shorter period.in every decree of divorce which has provisions respecting the custody and support of children the law becomes a part thereof and the decree is subject to the further order of the court,whether or not it is so stated citation.while parents have a right to contract with each other as to the custody and control of their offspring and to stipulate away their respective parental rights citation,this right so to stipulate is subject to the control of the court in which the matter affecting the child is pending,and the court is not required to award the custody in conformity with such stipulation.citation.where the welfare of children is involved as in divorce cases,parents can not by contract so bind themselves as to foreclose the court from an inquiry as to what that welfare requires.id.at.accord,kristine david,supra,th at,d the uniform parentage act protects the child right to establish paternity and obtain support irrespective of the parent intent to foreclose that right.see also in re marriage of lambe meehan th,d goodarzirad and similar cases convince us that the policy underlying stipulations involving minor children must be extended to adult indigent children.
michael contends the public policy underlying goodarzirad is inapplicable in this case because he did not stipulate to terminate deborah parental rights he did not sign any document agreeing to the termination he did not attend the hearing on deborah motion to terminate and he did not have any advance notice deborah intended to move to terminate her parental rights.thus,michael argues,there is no basis for the court finding the termination hearing was the functional equivalent of a stipulated agreement between the parties.
substantial evidence supports the court finding the termination hearing was a stipulated proceeding a stipulation is a n agreement between opposing counsel ordinarily entered into for the purpose of avoiding delay,trouble,or expense in the conduct of the action,citation and serves to obviate need for proof or to narrow the range of litigable issues citation citation.a stipulation in proper form is binding upon the parties if it is within the authority of the attorneys.mileikowsky tenet healthsystem th,d.although michael did not attend the proceeding,clearly he was aware in advance of the october,hearing date that deborah sought to terminate her parental rights he agreed with her decision and he authorized his counsel to attend the hearing and ensure the enforceability of the termination order at the outset of the hearing michael counsel stated,we have not filed any opposition or paperwork.we do not oppose it.and i here to facilitate a record that will allow the motion to be not only granted but enforceable.in fact,michael counsel examined deborah at the hearing on her motion,testing her resolve to terminate her rights.and significantly,when the court announced its findings,it characterized the hearing as a stipulated proceeding.although michael counsel may not have realized the import of the court characterization,he did not object it was inaccurate.
additionally,the same highly experienced retired superior court judge who had granted deborah motion to terminate in october heard deborah ex parte application in april and michael october motion to vacate.that judge was familiar with the history between the parties and fully understood the factual context in which the court had approved the parties agreement.at the hearing on michael motion to vacate,the court explained,it was an arranged deal from the beginning.the terms of the deal were in flux.they changed.part of what was happening was that they were changed in a way that rowe did like.this was not mom and dad saying,hey,let have a family that we going to raise.when you start with an understanding of what went on between rowe and jackson,you then see what progressed to the october hearing,and what progressed to the october hearing was what i would have to find factually was a deemed stipulated hearing,and i do so find there was never a question in this judge mind,in my mind,that i was going to have to make a factual decision based upon any evidence that would be produced at that hearing.there was never a question in my mind that i was going to have to take notes so that i could make sure that i found the right facts in order to support a decision.it was a preordained hearing.the ruling was preordained.how much of this had been worked out by counsel in advance,i do know.i have no idea that is based in fact.i have a good idea based in reality and based in common sense,but i certainly ca say i have any hard evidence to support it.but there was never a single suspicion that this hearing was going to be anything other than what you might call a gim me.rowe was going to come in.she was going to recite the things that she had to recite.michael counsel,representing his client,made sure that everything he thought had to be there was going to be there.he did examine her in the sense of trying to have the court come up with a finding contrary to what rowe wanted.they were both after the same thing.rowe was there seeking termination,and jackson was there seeking termination.there is no question about it.so i have to agree with rowe that this was for all purposes a stipulated hearing,that this was a hearing based upon an agreement of the parties that rowe parental rights would be terminated,and we did it in a manner that was inconsistent with the law.
substantial evidence supports the court finding,if there ever was a case where the parties stipulated to the termination of parental rights and nothing further was done,this was such a case.
even if michael were correct,however,and he did not effectively stipulate with deborah for the termination of her parental rights,the result would be no different if,based solely on deborah uncontested motion to terminate her parental rights,the trial court had granted the requested termination without first ordering an investigation of the children circumstances by the department of children and family services or other appropriate agency as required by family code section considering appointment of counsel for the children pursuant to family code section and actually considering the interest of the children involved.see kristine david,supra,th at,d it is only under specified circumstances,and upon specific findings that include the interests of the child,that a court has authority to terminate parental rights neumann melgar,supra,th at,d statutes authorizing an action to free a child from parental custody and control are intended foremost to protect the child.see the purpose of this part is to serve the welfare and best interest of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are otherwise missing from the child life.this part shall be liberally construed to serve and protect the interests and welfare of the child.
the fundamental problem in goodarzirad,supra,d,was not simply that the trial court had entered an order based on the parties agreement,but that it did so without itself evaluating what would serve the best interest and welfare of the parties minor children.id.at.former civil code sections et contain very precise criteria and procedures which must be followed before parental custody and control can be terminated.it is clear that the legislature wanted these specific procedures followed without deviation from the statutory scheme.the foremost interest in termination proceedings is to serve and protect the welfare and interests of the child.citation.the fundamental rights of the parent and child should not be allowed to be tampered with by a confession of judgment which removes all determinations surrounding the propriety of the action.indeed,should a mother and father stipulate to terminate one or both parents rights,if the court follows all the procedures mandated by the family code,orders an independent investigation and then bases its findings of best interest and the order of termination on the investigator report and other evidence presented at the hearing,it would be difficult to argue either considerations of policy or the analysis or holding of goodarzirad authorizes a collateral attack on the court judgment.simply put,it is the court total abdication of its responsibilities,not the mere fact that the parties agree,that makes a stipulated judgment to terminate parental rights invalid.
deborah challenge to the october termination order is not barred by judicial estoppel 
the doctrine of judicial estoppel has frequently been invoked to bar a party from contesting the validity of a judgment procured by that party.kristine lisa,supra,cal th at,d,see in re griffin,supra,cal d at.whether estoppel will actually be applied depends on the significance of the procedural irregularities,whether the court act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme and considerations of public policy.neumann melgar,supra,th at,d adoption of matthew,supra,d at.we agree with michael that deborah actions trifle with the courts and to a limited extent also contravene public policy favoring speedy determinations of parentage and the finality of paternity judgments.see adoption of matthew,at.nonetheless,compelling policy considerations militate against applying judicial estoppel here.ibid.as explained by the goodarzirad court,the entire scheme underlying custody decrees is that primary consideration must be given to the welfare of children.citation.the ultimate aim of the court is to serve the best interest and welfare of the minor children.citation.based on these strong public policy reasons,stipulations between parents involving the minor children which attempt to divest the court of jurisdiction are void and the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not apply.goodarzirad,supra,d at.see neumann,at,d refusing to apply principles of waiver or estoppel when trial court ignored procedural protections provided in,et,which were all calculated to promote the best interests of the affected children.
a central factor in determining whether to apply judicial estoppel to preclude a party from challenging an order based on an agreement determining parentage is whether the order promotes or undermines this state public policy favoring that a child has two parents rather than one.kristine lisa,supra,cal th at,d,see also elisa b superior court cal th,d,by recognizing the value of determining paternity,the legislature implicitly recognized the value of having two parents,rather than one,as a source of both emotional and financial support,especially when the obligation to support the child would otherwise fall to the public,subd.b public policy of california is to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage,or ended their relationship except where the contact would not be in the best interest of the child.thus,in goodarzirad,at pages.to,the stipulated judgment at issue would have deprived the child of one of his two parents the court of appeal held judicial estoppel did not bar the husband successful challenge to that order although he had previously agreed to it.in kristine lisa,supra,at page,d,in contrast,the supreme court held the biological mother of a child was estopped from attacking the validity of a old stipulated judgment declaring that she and her lesbian partner were the joint legal parents of the child,which would have deprived the child of one of her two parents following the couple separation.
similarly,in adoption of matthew,supra,d at page,the estoppel doctrine was applied to preclude a party a surrogate to a stipulated judgment of paternity,which had assured the child had two parents,from challenging the validity of the judgment.and in in re marriage of hinman,supra,th at page,d,judicial estoppel was invoked to prevent a wife from attacking the validity of a judgment to which she had stipulated as part of dissolution proceedings in which she had listed five minor children of the marriage,including two children who had been born prior to the marriage and had been fathered by the wife former husband.the parties had stipulated wife and husband would share joint physical and legal custody of all five children,and a judgment was entered.the wife subsequent attempt to deprive the husband of all custody over the two children fathered by her former husband,based on the argument the stipulated judgment was in excess of the court jurisdiction because the husband had no biological connection to the children,was rejected as barred by judicial estoppel having initially invoked the court power to determine custody,the wife then stipulated to a judgment giving the hu
