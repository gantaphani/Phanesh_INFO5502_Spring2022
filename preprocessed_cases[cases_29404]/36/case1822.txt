background 
as an initial matter,we note that this case has had a tortuous litigation history.because the instant appeal is limited to reviewing the appellate court ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal of certain orders entered by the circuit court,we recount only those facts here which are pertinent to the issues raised in the matter before us.
and are attorneys who shared office space together.from to,and engaged in an extramarital sexual affair while each was married to other individuals.a male child,was born to during this affair on january.husband,was listed as father on the child birth certificate.however,in february,after the affair between and ended,the the urging of to perform a deoxyribonucleic acid dna to determine paternity.the results of this test allegedly established that was the child biological father.thereafter,in july,told her husband,about her affair with and the possibility that was father.continued to raise as his own son,and and remain married.
on september,filed a petition in the circuit court of will county to determine the existence of a relationship with.this petition was filed pursuant to the parentage act ilcs et west and named as the respondent.in his petition,alleged that he was the biological father of 
approximately six weeks later,on october,and her husband,filed in the circuit court of will county a petition to adopt related child pursuant to the adoption act ilcs et west and named and the minor child,as respondents.the adoption petition alleged that husband,is not only the biological father of,but that is also the presumed father of because and were married at the time of the child birth.in addition,the adoption petition alleged that was an unfit person within the meaning of the illinois adoption act because,inter alia,he evidence d his intent to forgo his parental rights,as manifested by his failure t o commence legal proceedings to establish his paternity under the illinois parentage act of.
in addition to filing the adoption petition,the marital couple also filed on that same date a petition to terminate the parental rights of.the petition alleged that is an unfit parent and his parental rights should be terminated because,inter alia,he did not commence legal proceedings to establish his paternity of 
on november,filed in the circuit court a pleading styled motion to stay adoption proceedings pending determination of paternity.in his motion,referenced the february dna test and attached a lab report which allegedly disclosed that had a probability of being the biological father of asked in his motion that a determination of the paternity of the child take place prior to any proceedings in the adoption case in light of the fact that the paternity of the child is the threshold question in the adoption.accordingly,requested that the adoption proceedings be stayed pending the court ruling on whether the parties would be ordered to take dna tests to determine the paternity of the child.
also on november,and filed a motion to strike motion to stay the adoption proceedings.this motion attacked statements with respect to the prior dna testing in february,contending that the allegations made in motion and the attached lab report were a blatant attempt to introduce inadmissible evidence,and thereby prejudice the court,as is well aware that there exists no documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or tissue samples,nor the requisite affidavit or certification necessary to establish the chain of custody concerning the alleged blood tests.
on november,filed with the circuit court a motion to strike and dismiss the petition to terminate his parental rights.this motion,brought pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,alleged that the petition to terminate his parental rights filed by the marital couple was inconsistent with their previously filed petition to adopt related child and,therefore,should be dismissed.specifically,noted in his motion that the petition to terminate his parental rights was premature and inconsistent,as it stated that he was an unfit parent and his parental rights should be terminated despite the fact that there had not yet been any judicial determination that was,in fact,the biological father of the child.requested that the court either dismiss the petition to terminate his parental rights or at least stay proceedings on that petition pending a determination by the court with respect to whether is the natural father of 
also on november,additionally filed a motion to strike and dismiss the adoption action filed by the marital couple.this motion,which was brought pursuant to sections and of the code of civil procedure ilcs,west,alleged that the adoption petition was flawed not only in that it pled two separate causes of action in one count,but also that the statements pled were completely and entirely inconsistent to the extent that the document stated that it was a petition to adopt a related child,but also stated that is the child biological father.argued that if were indeed biological father,then there would be no need for to file a petition to adopt his own child.
in turn,on february,and filed a motion in the circuit court pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west not only to dismiss parentage action,but also to dismiss as a party to the adoption proceedings.the marital couple argued that failure to comply with the putative father registry provisions contained in section of the adoption act ilcs west barred him from maintaining any action to assert any interest in,either through the adoption or the parentage action.the marital couple concluded their dismissal motion by contending that because was statutorily barred from bringing any action to assert any interest in the child,he therefore lacked standing to file any motion concerning the paternity of or the validity of the adoption petition.
on june,the circuit court entered an order in which it ruled on the various motions filed by the parties.all motions filed by were denied.the circuit court,however,granted and motion to dismiss as a party to the adoption proceeding based on his failure to register with the putative father registry.finally,the circuit court denied and motion to dismiss parentage action,thereby allowing that action to proceed forward.
thereafter,on june,the circuit court entered an order staying the adoption proceedings pending the outcome of the parentage action.in addition,the court stated in this order that it was taking motion to reconsider and vacate its june,order under advisement.according to the record before us,however,it appears that the circuit court never made a subsequent ruling on motion to reconsider and vacate the june order.
as parentage action proceeded forward,the marital couple filed a motion to hold a hearing to determine whether it was in the best interests of the child,to proceed with the parentage litigation and to order dna testing.the circuit court granted this motion and held a hearing.it appears from the record that the proceedings were conducted on a periodic basis over the span of a year,with both parties testifying and calling witnesses,including several experts.on november,the circuit court issued oral findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to its determination.the court found that the best interests of the child were served by denying request for dna testing and dismissing his parentage action in its entirety.on december,the court entered a written order which adopted its november oral findings and conclusions and dismissed parentage petition with prejudice.on january,the circuit court entered an order nunc pro tunc to amend the december,order to include language pursuant to supreme court rule a a to allow an interlocutory appeal.
appealed the circuit court decision,arguing that the circuit court exceeded its authority under the parentage act by ordering a hearing prior to conducting dna testing.on review,the appellate court agreed with and held that the circuit court erred in holding a hearing as a prerequisite to ordering dna testing in an action filed pursuant to the parentage act,d,hereinafter,i.in its decision,the appellate court noted that section a of the parentage act mandates that a s soon as practicable,the court may,and upon the request of a party shall,order or direct the mother,child and alleged father to submit to dna tests to determine inherited characteristics.ilcs a west.the appellate court held that because the statute contains the mandatory word shall,the circuit court was required to order dna testing upon the request of,and it possessed no inherent authority to deviate from the statutory requirement and order a hearing prior to allowing dna testing to proceed.i,d at.accordingly,the appellate court determined that the circuit court erred in dismissing parentage petition,and remanded the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
the mandate from the parties first appeal in i issued in february.it appears from the record that the adoption case was reassigned to the original trial court judge so that he could rule on motion to reconsider and vacate the june,order which dismissed from the adoption action.as stated,it appears from the record that no such ruling was issued by that judge.
with respect to the parentage action,it appears that upon remand that cause was assigned to the presiding judge.on march,the circuit court ordered that,and submit to dna testing.the next month,and filed a verified petition to enjoin performance of dna testing until the resolution of the adoption action.thereafter,on may,the parentage and adoption cases were reassigned to one judge,and on may,that judge consolidated both cases for all purposes other than trial.thereafter,and filed,inter alia,a motion requesting the circuit court to sever the parentage and adoption cases.on june,the circuit court denied the marital couple petition for injunctive relief.subsequently,filed a motion requesting that husband also be required to submit to dna testing pursuant to supreme court rule.in response,the marital couple filed a motion to dismiss request for rule discovery.this motion was denied by the circuit court on june.subsequently,on august,the circuit court denied the marital couple motion to sever the adoption and parentage cases,ordered that the previously entered stay in the adoption case remain in effect pending the results of the dna test,and ordered the parties to submit to dna testing on september.
and filed a notice of interlocutory appeal with the appellate court on september.this appeal involved review of the following rulings rendered by the circuit court the circuit court denial of and motion to enjoin dna testing the circuit court denial of their motion to dismiss motion for rule discovery and the circuit court denial of their motion to sever the parentage and adoption actions and to lift the stay in the adoption case.during the pendency of this appeal,however,the circuit court proceeded forward on parentage action.in an order dated april,the circuit court entered a finding in the parentage action that is the biological father of 
on october,the appellate court filed a published decision in which it dismissed and appeal for lack of jurisdiction.d,hereinafter,ii.the appellate court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal based on the failure of to register with the putative father registry prior to filing his parentage action.first,the appellate court noted that,pursuant to the putative father registry provisions contained within section of the adoption act,a putative father is required to register no later than days after the birth of the child.ilcs b west.the appellate court further observed that under the putative father registry provisions,a putative father who fails to timely register in accordance with the statute is generally barred from thereafter bringing or maintaining any action to assert any interest in the child.ilcs g west.the appellate court then found that,in the matter at bar,it was undisputed that never registered with the putative father registry and that did not offer any evidence excepting him from making a timely registration.according to the appellate panel,because did not comply with the putative father registry provisions,the plain language of the statute prohibits from intervening in the adoption action and from initiating the parentage action.d at.
the appellate court also rejected argument that section a of the parentage act ilcs a west provides a statute of limitation within which he may petition to establish a relationship.the appellate court,reading section a of the parentage act in tandem with the putative father registry provisions contained within section of the adoption act,concluded that the statutes require that a putative father first satisfy the registry requirement in order to initiate a parentage petition.d at.based upon this reading of the relevant statutory provisions,the appellate court determined that b ecause failure to satisfy the registry requirement barred him from pursuing a parentage petition,all orders entered in the parentage proceeding are void ab initio,including the order declaring the child biological father and this court opinion previously issued in the parentage action.d at.
this court granted petition for leave to appeal.a.we subsequently allowed the illinois attorney general and the department of healthcare and family services to intervene as appellants in this case.
at the outset,we note that this cause has been unduly complicated by the fact that the parties have engaged in an extraordinary amount of litigation in the circuit and the appellate courts,with much of it being contradictory,inconsistent and incoherent.by filing his parentage petition,apparently set in motion an onslaught of legal maneuvering that has resulted in the filing of internally inconsistent pleadings,as well as the filing of pleadings that are at odds with each other.for example,after filed his action to declare a relationship in the circuit court in september,six weeks later the marital couple filed a petition to adopt related child in which they named as a respondent and in which it was alleged that plaintiff,is the biological mother of the child sought to be adopted herein and that her husband,is the biological father of the child sought to be adopted herein.these statements,alone,give us pause,as it is highly unusual for two persons alleging that they are the biological parents of a child and who have never lost rights to that child to file a legal proceeding to adopt their own natural child.
nevertheless,after stating that is the biological father of the child,the marital couple thereafter make the following inconsistent allegation in the adoption petition further,is presumed to be the natural father of,inasmuch as the marital couple are and have been married to each other and that irrespective of whether or not he is the biological father of the minor child sought to be adopted,he is in fact the psychological,apparent equitable father of said child.later in the adoption petition,the marital couple allege that is an unfit person to have because,inter alia,evidence d his intent to forgo his parental rights,as manifested by his failure t o commence legal proceedings to establish his paternity under the illinois parentage act of.again,we note that the marital couple allege that had not commenced legal proceedings under the parentage act even though he had filed a parentage action six weeks prior to the filing of their adoption petition.we also question why and alleged in their adoption action that was unfit and showed an intent to forgo his parental rights when no judicial determination had been made that was,in fact,the biological father of,and in light of the fact that they maintained the position that it was not was the biological father of 
other pleadings filed in this cause evince similar infirmities.for example,on the same day that and filed their adoption action,they also filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of to the minor child.in this pleading,they characterize as an unfit parent,doing so,again,despite the fact that no legal determination had been rendered that was the biological father of.in addition,the marital couple requested that the court terminate parental rights,even though the circuit court had not declared that had any parental rights to in the first instance.we further note that the petition to terminate parental rights is inconsistent with the marital couple petition to adopt because,as stated,in the adoption petition and claim to be the sole biological parents of,while in the termination petition,they claim that has parental rights which must be terminated.
these are only a few examples of the tumultuous litigation history we have discovered as a result of our examination of the record in this cause.we highlight these instances because we are seriously troubled by the course of the litigation in this matter.since this matter is being remanded,we take this opportunity to note,in general,that the trial court possesses the inherent authority to control its own docket and the course of litigation,including the authority to prevent undue delays in the disposition of cases caused by abuses of the litigation process.see sander dow chemical,bejda sgl industries.we are not unmindful that this case concerns the future of a young child,where the specter of delay is especially troublesome.
we now turn to the merits of the instant cause.the issue presented by this appeal is a narrow one whether the appellate court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal in this case and subsequently vacating all orders previously entered by the circuit court in the parentage action as being void ab initio because sought to establish a relationship pursuant to the provisions of the parentage act without first registering as a putative father within days of the child birth pursuant to the putative father registry provisions contained in the adoption act.the resolution of the question raised in the instant appeal requires us to interpret the relevant statutory provisions found within the parentage act and the adoption act.because the construction of a statute is a question of law,we review the merits of this cause de novo.wisniewski kownacki.
the applicable rules of analysis are familiar.it is well settled that in construing the meaning of a statute,the primary objective of this court is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.all other rules of statutory construction are subordinate to this cardinal principle.people ex rel.sherman cryns.in determining the intent of the general assembly,we begin by examining the language of the statute,which is the most reliable indicator of the legislature objectives in enacting a particular law.yang city of chicago.the statutory language must be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning in re detention of lieberman,and,where the language is clear and unambiguous,we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction.in re.we will not depart from the plain language of a statute by reading into it exceptions,limitations or conditions that conflict with the express legislative intent.petersen wallach.in construing a statute,we presume that the general assembly,in enacting legislation,did not intend absurdity,inconvenience or injustice.burger lutheran general hospital.
one of the fundamental principles of statutory construction is to view all provisions of an enactment as a whole.in re donald.accordingly,words and phrases must be interpreted in light of other relevant provisions of the statute and must not be construed in isolation.michigan avenue national bank,at.we clarify,however,that in the instant are two separate statutory enactments to be construed,this rule of construction does not mean that the provisions of the two separate enactments are to be construed together as a whole.to the contrary,we must construe each enactment separately,and only view the provisions within each enactment as a whole.therefore,in the matter at bar,we will separately construe each of the relevant statutory enactments.first,we will construe the provisions of the parentage act ilcs et west as a whole.thereafter,we will construe the putative father registry provisions.we note that the putative father registry is not an enactment unto itself but,rather,is wholly contained within section of the adoption act ilcs et west.accordingly,we will construe the provisions of the adoption act as a whole.we will then consider the interplay between these two statutory enactments.
in enacting the parentage act,the general assembly established a statutory mechanism that serves to legally establish parent and child relationships in illinois.in re estate of poole.in section of the parentage act,the general assembly declares that the purpose of this statutory enactment is to further the public policy of illinois to recognize the right of every child to the physical,mental,emotional and monetary support of his or her parents under this act.ilcs west see also in re parentage of john.the provisions of the parentage act underscore that the importance of parentage hinges upon the rights and responsibilities that are attendant to the parent and child relationship.as such,the parentage act defines the term parent and child relationship as the legal relationship existing between a child and his natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights,privileges,duties and obligations.ilcs west.
the parentage act provides that t he parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent,regardless of the marital status of the parents.ilcs west.accordingly,under the parentage act,a relationship may be established in a number of ways by presumption ilcs a west,by consent ilcs west,or by judicial determination ilcs west in re parentage of john,at.pertinent to the matter before us,section a of the parentage act provides that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other,even though the marriage is or could be declared invalid,and the child is born or conceived during such marriage.ilcs a west.the statute further provides,however,that this presumption is not conclusive and may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.ilcs b west.section a of the parentage act expressly provides that a man alleging that he is the father of a child has standing to bring an action to establish his relationship with that child,even if another man is already presumed to be the child father pursuant to section a of the act.ilcs a west an action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship,whether or not such a relationship is already presumed under section of this act,may be brought by a man alleging himself to be the father of the child or expected child.the parentage act allows a putative father to establish his parentage of a child up until the child attains the age of.ilcs a west an action brought by a party alleging that he is the child natural parent shall be barred if brought later than years after the child reaches the age of majority.
the parentage act also sets forth the procedure for establishing a relationship.the statute provides that a man has a right to request dna testing to determine if he is the biological father of the child,and that the circuit court must order the parties to submit to testing upon the man request.ilcs a west as soon as practicable,the court may,and upon request of a party shall,order or direct the mother,child and alleged father to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid dna tests to determine inherited characteristics.the parentage act further provides that i f any party refuses to submit to the tests,the court may resolve the question of paternity against that party or enforce its order if the rights of others and the interests of justice so require.ilcs a west.if the results of the genetic testing ordered pursuant to this section show that the presumed father is not the child biological father,the presumption in section of the act is rebutted.ilcs g west.however,even though dna testing may establish the man paternity of the child,this does not mean that the biological father will be automatically granted parental rights to the child.rather,any parental rights of the biological father,such as the right to have visitation with,or custody of,the child will only be granted upon a showing that such a grant is in the best interests of the child.section a of the parentage act provides that any decision regarding custody and visitation of the child shall be determine d in accordance with the relevant factors set forth in the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act ilcs et and any other applicable law of illinois,to guide the court in a finding in the best interests of the child.ilcs a west.
we now turn to a review of the provisions contained within the putative father registry enactment.section of the adoption act created the putative father registry,which is maintained by the department of children and family services.ilcs west.as stated,the putative father registry does not stand alone rather,all of the requirements of the putative father registry are contained within section of the adoption act and are to be read in that context.the general assembly has explicitly declared that the purpose of the putative father registry is to determin e the identity and location of a putative father of a minor child who is,or is expected to be,the subject of an adoption proceeding,in order to provide notice of such proceeding to the putative father.ilcs west.subsection b of section allows a putative father to register before the birth of the child,but mandates that he shall register no later than days after the birth of the child.ilcs b west.subsection g of that provision further provides 
except as provided in subsections b or c of section of th e adoption act,a putative father who fails to register with the putative father registry as provided in this section is barred from thereafter bringing or maintaining any action to assert any interest in the child,unless he proves by clear and convincing evidence that 
it was not possible for him to register within the period of time specified in subsection b of this section and 
his failure to register was through no fault of his own and 
he registered within days after it became possible for him to file.
a lack of knowledge of the pregnancy or birth is not an acceptable reason for failure to register.ilcs g west.
in turn,section b of the adoption act sets forth the conditions under which a father may provide or withhold consent for the adoption.if the father was married to the mother on or within days prior to the date of the child birth he has a right to provide or withhold consent.ilcs b b i west.in addition,if he is the father of the child under a judgment for adoption,an order of parentage,or an acknowledgment of parentage or paternity pursuant to subsection a of section of the illinois parentage act of he may provide or withhold consent to the adoption.ilcs b b ii west.further,a father may provide or withhold consent to the adoption if he has timely registered with the putative father registry,as provided in section of th e adoption act,and prior to the expiration of days from the date of such registration,commenced legal proceedings to establish paternity under the illinois parentage act of or under the law of the jurisdiction of the child birth.ilcs b b vii west.section b additionally provides differing standards with respect to whether the child sought to be adopted is more or less than six months of age when placed with the adoptive parents.if the child sought to be adopted is less than six months old when placed with the adoptive parents,fathers who establish that they satisfy one of the following criteria must be notified of any adoption and be provided with the legal right to provide or withhold consent during the first days after the birth of the child,he openly lived with the mother child and held himself out to be the child father ilcs b b iii west or the father made a effort to pay birth expenses and child support before the child was days old ilcs b b iv west.if the child was more than six months old when placed with the adoptive parents,then the father must meet one of the following categories to retain his right to provide or withhold consent to the adoption he maintained contact with the child,as shown by the payment of child support,and he engages in monthly visitation or regular communication with the child or the child legal custodian ilcs b b v west or,during six months of the period immediately preceding the child placement for adoption,he openly lived with the child and held himself out to be the child father.ilcs b b vi west.
in the case at bar,relying upon the statutory right granted him under section a of the parentage act ilcs a west,filed a petition in the circuit court of will county on september,seeking a judicial determination of his paternity of,who was approximately years of age at that time.the language of the parentage act is clear and unambiguous.the parentage act allows a putative father such as to establish the parentage of a child up until the child attains years of age.ilcs a west.it is uncontroverted that filed his petition to determine a relationship with within the statute of limitation contained in section a of the parentage act.in addition,the provisions contained within section a of the parentage act ilcs a west are clear and unambiguous that there is no bar against a as prevent him from alleging that he is the father of a child even if another man is already presumed to be the child father pursuant to section a of the parentage act.see ilcs a west.indeed,section b of the parentage act ilcs b west provides that a presumption arising under section a is not conclusive and may be rebutted by clear and convincing such as dna test results establishing that another man is,in fact,the child biological father.see ilcs g west.finally,the language of the parentage act is clear and unambiguous that once a man seeking to establish a relationship files a petition to determine parentage pursuant to the parentage act and requests dna testing,the circuit court must order that such tests be performed.ilcs a west.accordingly,we find that filed a valid petition to determine a relationship under the parentage act.
however,and in their brief to this the appellate court in its opinion that in the case before us it is improper to read the provisions of the parentage act in isolation.to the contrary,they assert that the parentage act provisions must be read in conjunction with the putative father registry requirements contained within section of the adoption act ilcs west.based upon their interpretation of the interplay between the provisions contained within these two separate statutes,and contend that the appellate court properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider their appropriately vacated all orders in the past seven years in the parentage action as void ab failed to file with the putative father registry.we reject these contentions.
looking,as we must,to the plain language of both the parentage act and the putative father registry provisions,we begin by observing that the general assembly specifically set forth separate and unique public policy purposes for each enactment.with respect to the parentage act,t
