between november and may,harold ortiz graulau,then age,carried on a consensual sexual relationship with a female identified as smn.shortly after the two became acquainted,smn dropped out of the ninth grade and moved into ortiz home for the next six months,ortiz and smn lived together as a couple.despite the large age difference between the two,their relationship was at the time legal under puerto rico law 
on several occasions ortiz brought rolls of film to be developed at a walgreens drugstore in san german,puerto rico.after walgreens employees noticed that some of the images appeared to depict a young girl engaged in sexual activities or posed in a sexually explicit manner,the store manager alerted authorities.a subsequent search of ortiz home uncovered photographs of these over either depicted sexual contact between ortiz and smn or showed smn in a sexually explicit position.
arrested and interviewed,ortiz admitted that he had a sexual relationship with smn and that he took the explicit photographs with the knowledge that she was fourteen at the time.united states ortiz graulau,d.but ortiz insisted that the photographs were not properly considered child pornography because he and smn were living together legally in a relationship.
on october,a federal grand jury in the district of puerto rico returned a indictment charging ortiz with possessing sexually explicit photographs of a minor,a b count i,and exploiting a minor for the purpose of producing the photographs,a count ii.after a failed effort to have the indictment dismissed,ortiz pled guilty to the former count but went to trial on the latter.
at trial,the government offered the photographs,information about their discovery,ortiz statement to the police upon his arrest,a portion of ortiz plea colloquy,and proof that smn birth certificate was in ortiz car.smn mother testified as to smn age and confirmed that the photographs depicted her daughter.the parties stipulated to the interstate or foreign commerce requirement in the exploitation statute.ortiz and smn did not testify.ortiz was convicted and sentenced to months in prison.
on this appeal,ortiz argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove count ii,that his count i plea colloquy was improperly admitted in the count ii trial,and that the sentence on count i was not adequately justified by the judge.the standard of review varies with the issue.we start with the statute,which provides the relevant framework for considering whether the offense was proved by the government.
the crime captioned s exual exploitation of children,charged in count ii,embraces one who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,subject to proof of a commerce element not here in dispute.a.neither does ortiz deny that various of the photographs portrayed sexually explicit conduct within the meaning of the statute.id.a.
rather,he says that the statutory purpose element was not proved because no evidence was presented showing that ortiz used or employed smn to engage in sexual activity and no proof offered that ortiz took the photographs to exploit smn or to traffic in child pornography.ortiz says the purpose was to memorialize their intimate relationship rather than to make pictures,that he was not aware that to do so was unlawful and that the jury was wrongly denied evidence that smn was living with ortiz in a lawful relationship.
this summary conflates several different arguments.evidence is indeed lacking as to the detailed circumstances surrounding smn conduct and the taking of the photographs but the argument that one would expect to follow is that therefore ortiz has not been shown by the government evidence to have employed or used smn,let alone enticed or coerced her,to engage in the sexual activity.but this argument is not explicitly made and if made would not be persuasive.
given the difference in ages versus and the fact that ortiz participated in some of the sexual contact and admitted to taking the photographs or at least many of them,the jury could reasonably infer that it was ortiz who instigated at least some of the conduct and ortiz does not argue that terms like employ or use require more than instigation,at least in the context of this statute.whether something less than instigation might suffice need not be decided.
the statutory argument that ortiz does develop relates to the statute requirement that the or at least a purpose of the defendant must be to foster sexually explicit conduct by a minor in order to make a visual depiction of it.ortiz seems to say that evidence of such purpose is lacking because there is no proof that sexual acts or poses were performed in order to make photographs,nor a rather different point were they done with the aim of peddling or displaying the pictures to others.
ortiz first point implies that the conduct was occurring anyway and just happened to be photographed.but the number of photographs,many of sexually explicit poses,permits a strong inference that some of the conduct occurred in order to make the photographs.see united states jesus,cir,cert.denied,d.this is not a case of a security camera mechanically picking up a random act.here,a jury could infer that at least some of the sexual conduct occurred in order to make a depiction of it.
as for ortiz intended use of the photographs,the statute language requires only that a visual depiction be made.perhaps congress mainly sought to suppress trafficking in child pornography but a pecuniary purpose requirement was earlier deleted from the statute,united states sirois,cir,and preventing exploitation of children could be aided by the statute broad ban on taking such photographs even for private use.gonzales raich,d.
ortiz probably did not understand that his conduct was criminal the government points to no proof that ortiz knew the law,and his lack of concealment and the age of consent in puerto rico support his factual claim.but neither the statute nor precedent suggests that this is a rare instance in which ignorance of the law is a defense,compare cheek united states,d,although this might well be relevant in sentencing.
ortiz also complains although this is an admissibility and not a sufficiency argument that the jury was not told of his ongoing relationship with smn.despite the language of the statute,congress may well not have intended to make it criminal for a husband and wife to take intimate photographs of each other for their private use this is so even if the instigator were and the other spouse seventeen,thus falling within the plain terms of the statute prohibition.if the government brought such a case,judges might seek to devise limits even on plain language indeed,some judges have even suggested constitutional objections based on marital or privacy rights 
but ortiz and smn were not married and could not have been without permission,see ortiz graulau,d at and the argument again is not properly developed.ortiz simply says that evidence of the relationship should have been allowed without explaining how it relates to any defensible reading of the statute.as presented,the argument looks simply like an effort to invite jury nullification.see generally united states manning,cir,cert.denied,d lafave,israel,king kerr,criminal procedure g ed.
in the district court,unsuccessfully opposing an in limine motion by the government seeking to exclude evidence of the relationship,ortiz did suggest briefly several reasons why the evidence might have been relevant,especially,to negate inferences of coercion inferences that apart from their relevance to a statutory element could easily have been prejudicial.but no such argument has been developed on appeal,and district judge discretion aside our precautionary review of the government closing argument shows no attempt to exploit any such inference.
the in limine motion had one other consequence.at trial,after the close of the government case and denial of a motion for a directed acquittal,the defense called smn to make a proffer outside the jury presence of testimony that she was prepared
