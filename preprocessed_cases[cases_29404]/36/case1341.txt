this case calls upon us to decide,as a matter of first impression in this state,whether an unmarried man who has expended funds to support a child,in reliance on the mother representation that he is the child father,may sue the mother on an unjust enrichment theory for the return of the funds after discovering that the child is not his biological offspring.as a matter of public policy,we conclude that such a suit can not be maintained.accordingly,we affirm the trial court judgment dismissing this case after sustaining the defendants demurrer.
facts and procedural background 
appellant richard mcbride was romantically involved with respondent garianne dashiell,then known as garianne boughton at some time during,presumably in the fall,mcbride moved to chile.in december,however,boughton contacted him in chile and informed him that she was pregnant with a child that she represented was his.based on this representation,mcbride returned to the united states and took a teaching job in order to support boughton and the child.
the child,a girl,was apparently born on or about may,during the month of may,mcbride and boughton orally agreed that mcbride would support boughton for a year so that she could stay home and take care of the child.in june,when the child was about a year old,boughton began working again,and mcbride resigned his job in order to become the child caregiver.it is not entirely clear from the complaint,but mcbride and boughton apparently lived together in the los angeles area during this time.
in december,boughton moved out of mcbride house,and told him,as alleged in the complaint,that she would soon stop paying the bills,and that he would have to return to work.the child was not yet ready to adapt to day care,however,so mcbride continued to act as her caregiver for about another five or six months.
in may,when the child was about two years old,mcbride went back to work,taking a position as a flight attendant.in june,mcbride and boughton agreed orally that mcbride would have custody of the child days each month.nevertheless,in september,boughton told mcbride that she was moving to san francisco,evidently with the child,and that he would be able to see the child only two weekends a month.in october,mcbride filed a paternity proceeding seeking custody of the child,who was by then almost two and years old.
in connection with the paternity proceeding,genetic tests were done,and the testing service reported that mcbride was excluded as the biological father of the child mcbride learned the results of the genetic tests in december.evidently,he then abandoned his efforts to seek custody of the child 
on december,mcbride filed the instant action seeking money damages against boughton and dashiell,who he alleges is the child biological father.his original complaint alleged causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation and for unjust enrichment,as well as a common count for money had and received.after respondents demurrer was sustained with leave to amend,mcbride filed a first and then a second amended complaint.each of the amended complaints omitted the tort causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation that had been included in the original complaint,pleading only unjust enrichment and a common count 
respondents demurred to both of mcbride amended complaints.the trial court sustained the demurrer to the second amended complaint,granting mcbride leave to amend only for the limited purpose of stating a cause of action against boughton for breach of contract.mcbride did not file another amended complaint within the time allowed,so the trial court entered a judgment dismissing the action.this timely appeal followed.
discussiona.
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context,and ignoring erroneous or confusing labels if the complaint pleads facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief.richelle,supra,th at,d see also quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,moore regents of university of california cal d.in short,our task is to determine whether the pleaded facts state a cause of action on any available legal theory.
mcbride second amended complaint includes two causes of action.the first is captioned as one for unjust enrichment.after incorporating the factual allegations summarized above,this cause of action avers that respondents were unjustly enriched by mcbride having paid for the care and support of boughton and the child,because respondents were legally responsible for the monies paid out by mcbride,and would have had to incur those expenses if mcbride had not done so.the premise of this claim is that mcbride expenditures for the support of the child unjustly enriched respondents,as the child biological parents,because mcbride was not the child biological father.
mcbride second cause of action is in the form of a common count for money had and received,alleging that respondents became indebted to mcbride for money paid,laid out and expended to or for defendants at defendants special instance and request.this cause of action also alleges that boughton promised in writing to repay the money mcbride spent to care for her and the child,and failed and refused to make any payments.
the trial court sustained respondents general demurrer to both of mcbride causes of action.in a written order,the court reasoned that all purported causes of action as to respondents are precluded by applicable public policy,citing nagy nagy d.nagy.
to the extent that mcbride second cause of action was an attempt to plead a cause of action for breach of an express written contract,the trial court sustained a special demurrer for lack of particularity,but granted mcbride leave to amend.as already noted,mcbride failed to do so.when a plaintiff elects not to amend after the court sustains a demurrer with leave to amend,we assume the complaint states as strong a case as possible,and we will affirm the judgment if the unamended complaint is objectionable on any ground raised by the demurrer.citation.gutkin university of southern california th,d,citing soliz williams th,d.the record does not make clear whether mcbride even intended to plead a cause of action for breach of an express contract,but on appeal,he does not argue that the trial court erred in sustaining the special demurrer.thus,we deem mcbride contract claim,like his tort claims,to have been abandoned 
in sustaining respondents general demurrer,the trial court relied on nagy,supra,d.in nagy,the plaintiff estranged wife revealed during a deposition in their dissolution proceeding that the couple child was not the plaintiff biological offspring.the court held that the former husband action against his former wife for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred because,among other reasons,it would be contrary to public policy to allow a putative father to recover damages for developing a close relationship with a child misrepresented to be his.id.at.the nagy court placed the plaintiff claims in the same category as betrayal,brutal words,and heartless disregard of the feelings of others,which are beyond any effective legal remedy and any practical administration of law.citation.ibid.
prior to the decision in nagy,this division reached a similar result in richard superior court d.richard.in richard,the plaintiff was a married man,gerald,who had separated from his wife.after the separation,the wife lover,richard,established that he was the biological father of the couple children.gerald then sued richard,alleging that richard had previously misrepresented to him that the children were biologically gerald,and had thereby induced gerald to support them and develop a relationship with them.we held that gerald tort claims seeking damages for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress,on the basis of misrepresentations as to paternity,were barred by public policy id.at,reasoning that the innocent children here may suffer significant harm from having their family involved in litigation such as this,and this is exactly the type of lawsuit which,if allowed to proceed,might result in more social damage than will occur if the courts decline to intervene.id.at.
richard is not dispositive of the present case,however.as mcbride brief in the present case correctly points out,in a footnote in richard,we expressly declined to foreclose the possibility that a man in mcbride position might be able to recover actual out of pocket costs incurred in supporting another man child on an equitable theory for reimbursement,such as unjust enrichment.richard,supra,d at,fn.we expressly noted that the issue was not before us,and that we were not required to decide it.ibid.
citing the richard footnote,mcbride contends that nagy is distinguishable because of the nature of the damages he is seeking,not general damages for the emotional impact of boughton conduct,but rather,reimbursement for the expenses he incurred in contributing to the child relatively ascertainable and quantifiable form of damages that was not involved in nagy,because the plaintiff in that case had waived any right to sue for them.nagy,supra,d at.thus,this case calls upon us to decide the question we noted,but left open,in richard 
whether respondents demurrer to mcbride second amended complaint was properly sustained depends,however,not on the nature of the damages mcbride seeks,but rather on the viability of the causes of action he has attempted to plead.the first cause of action is labeled as one for unjust enrichment.unjust enrichment is not a cause of action,however,or even a remedy,but rather a general principle,underlying various legal doctrines and remedies citation.it is synonymous with restitution.citation.melchior new line productions,th,d.unjust enrichment has also been characterized as describing the result of a failure to make restitution dunkin,supra,th at,fn,d,quoting lauriedale associates,wilson th,d lauriedale.
in reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a general demurrer,we ignore e rroneous or confusing labels if the complaint pleads facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief.citation.saunders cariss d.accord,richelle,supra,th at,d.thus,we must look to the actual gravamen of mcbride complaint to determine what cause of action,if any,he stated,or could have stated if given leave to amend.in accordance with this principle,we construe mcbride purported cause of action for unjust enrichment as an attempt to plead a cause of action giving rise to a right to restitution.
there are several potential bases for a cause of action seeking restitution.for example,restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express contract,but it was procured by fraud or is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason.see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.alternatively,restitution may be awarded where the defendant obtained a benefit from the plaintiff by fraud,duress,conversion,or similar conduct.in such cases,the plaintiff may choose not to sue in tort,but instead to seek restitution on a theory an election referred to at common law as waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit.see,murrish industrial indemnity d.election to waive tort and sue in assumpsit is a fiction that broadens remedies available to plaintiff,but does not create a contract where none existed see generally d may restitution and constructive contracts.in such cases,where appropriate,the law will imply a contract or rather,a without regard to the parties intent,in order to avoid unjust enrichment.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,discussing use of common count to seek restitution in lieu of tort damages.
in the present case,neither mcbride complaint nor his briefs on appeal makes clear upon which of these theories his unjust enrichment claim is based.it clearly is not based on the existence of a contract that is unenforceable,however,because mcbride has abandoned any claim that he and boughton had an express contract.thus,the only possible premise of mcbride cause of action for unjust enrichment is that he is entitled to restitution from boughton on a or assumpsit theory based on her tortious conduct.
under the law of restitution,a n individual is required to make restitution if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.citations.a person is enriched if the person receives a benefit at another expense.citation.first nationwide savings perry th,d first nationwide.however,t he fact that one person benefits another is not,by itself,sufficient to require restitution.the person receiving the benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances are such that,as between the two individuals,it is unjust for the person to retain it.citation.id.at,d,italics in original see also california medical aetna healthcare of california,th,d lectrodryer seoulbank th,d,restitution,com.c.
in keeping with the doctrine focus on the unjust nature of the enrichment,i t is well settled that restitution will be denied where application of the doctrine would involve a violation or frustration of the law or opposition to public policy.citations.lauriedale,supra,th at,d.thus,d etermining whether it is unjust for a person to retain a benefit may involve policy considerations.for example,if a person receives a benefit because of another mistake,policy may dictate that the person making the mistake assume the risk of the error.first nationwide savings perry,supra,th at,d.moreover,a person otherwise entitled to restitution may lose that entitlement if restitution would seriously impair the protection intended to be afforded by common law or by statute to persons in the position of the transferee or of the beneficiary,or to other persons,restitution.
applying these principles to the present case,we conclude that two of the most fundamental public policies of this enforcement of parents obligations to support their children,and the protection of children interest in the stability of their family relationships see,in re jesusa cal th,fn,d,county of orange leslie th,d preclude us from requiring boughton to make restitution to mcbride based on his claim of unjust enrichment.under circumstances such as those presented here,if we granted the former putative father the right to restitution from the child biological parents,who retain responsibility for its support,we would give priority to the former putative father desire to be made financially whole,to the potential detriment of the child ongoing needs,restitution,com.a,situations in which restitution should not be ordered for public policy reasons include those where the transferee is under the special protection of the law,a protection which would be weakened if restitution were permitted.
more importantly,at least from the child perspective,by declining to recognize an unjust enrichment claim,we create a disincentive for an unmarried man to form a parental bond with a child if the bond is likely to be severed upon the child proving to be another man genetic offspring.the potential emotional and psychic costs to the child of such a rupture are far more significant than any financial injury a grown man might suffer from mistakenly supporting another man child for a temporary period.
these considerations were similarly of paramount importance in susan jack th,d,in which the court applied the conclusive presumption of husband paternity to reject a mother paternity suit against a third party,despite proof that her husband was not the child biological father.in doing so,the court supported its holding by relying on the child interest in preserving the palpable and formative familial relationship id.at,d,fn.established between the child and the mother estranged husband,who had played a parental role for the first four years of the child life the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed and sibling relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.citation.this interest is served notwithstanding termination of the mother marital relationship with the presumed father.i n the case of an older child over two years of age the familial relationship between the child and the man purporting to be the child father is considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity.a man who has lived with a child,treating it as his son or daughter,has developed a relationship with the child that should not be lightly dissolved and upon which liability for continued responsibility to the child might be predicated.this social relationship is much more important,to the child at least,than a biological relationship of actual paternity citation.id.at,d.
the nebraska supreme court also made precisely this point in rejecting a similar unjust enrichment claim for past child support in day heller.in the words of that court,an assumpsit claim that seeks to recover for the creation of a relationship has the effect of saying i wish you had never been born to a child who,before the revelation of biological fatherhood,was under the impression that he or she had a father who loved him or her.citation.we decline to allow a party to use a n assumpsit claim as a means for sending or reinforcing this message.id.at.
moreover,our it is not unjust enrichment for a mother to retain child support she has an important public policy by sending the message to unmarried putative fathers that they should verify their paternity at an early stage if there is any doubt about the matter.significantly,the legislature has sent the same message to married men by providing a statutory incentive for them to resolve promptly any doubts they may have as to the paternity of their wives children.under the applicable statutory scheme,if a married man fails to request paternity testing within two years of the birth of a child to his wife,and he is neither infertile nor impotent,he will be conclusively presumed to be the child father,with all the concomitant responsibilities as well as rights,see in re marriage of freeman th,d requiring husband to pay child support even though child was determined to be offspring of wife lover,where biological tests were not done within two years of child birth rejecting constitutional challenge to statute making presumption of husband paternity conclusive after two years see also rodney karen th,d declining to allow married woman lover to challenge husband paternity rejecting constitutional challenge to conclusive presumption.
in addition,we note that determining whether boughton was unjustly enriched would involve inquiring into the very subjects which nagy,supra,d,and richard,supra,d,held public policy requires courts to avoid.issues of this type would include,but not be limited to the extent to which mcbride expenditures exclusively benefited the child,rather than boughton personally,and if so,the effect of that fact on the equities of mcbride restitution claim against boughton and dashiell if restitution is owed,whether its amount should be reduced by the value of any benefit,emotional or financial that mcbride received from his relationship with the child and how,if at all,the equities of mcbride restitution claim may be affected by his decision to end his relationship with the child rather than pursuing any rights he may have had under family code section,subdivision d 
because of the lurking presence of issues such as these,we concur with the richard court concern that the innocent child here may suffer significant harm from having her family involved in litigation which,if allowed to proceed,might result in more social damage than will occur if the courts decline to intervene.richard,supra,d at.we recognize that richard declined to consider whether this rationale would extend to a suit seeking only restitution for support paid rather than emotional distress damages,because the issue was not presented in that case.id.at,fn.having now considered it,in a case in which it is squarely presented,we have concluded that the type of harm to the child about which richard expressed concern is as likely to be realized here as it was in that case.
in short,for much the same public policy reasons on which nagy and richard relied in declining to authorize a tort claim for the loss of a purported father relationship with a child,we likewise decline to authorize a restitution remedy for support payments based on facts such as those pleaded in this case.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court properly sustained respondents demurrer to mcbride cause of action alleging unjust enrichment.
in reaching this conclusion,we have given due consideration to the opinion by division one of this court in dunkin boskey,supra,th,d dunkin.in dunkin,our colleagues followed nagy and richard in disallowing damages for emotional distress based on the plaintiff loss of a parental relationship with his nonbiological child.id.at,d.they went on to hold,however,that the plaintiff could recover his readily ascertainable economic loss,the cost of supporting the child under an unjust enrichment theory.citations.id.at,d.
dunkin involved an express written contract between an infertile man dunkin and a woman boskey,both unmarried,which granted dunkin parental rights to a child that boskey planned to conceive through artificial insemination from an anonymous donor.dunkin,supra,th at,d.when the child was about two years old,the pair became estranged,and boskey moved away and refused to allow dunkin to visit the child.dunkin suit to establish paternity and custody was dismissed for lack of standing.he then sued boskey for breach of their contract.boskey argued that the agreement was void and unenforceable as against public policy,and her demurrer was sustained.
on appeal,the court held that dunkin and boskey contract did not so offend public policy as to require us to find it illegal or invalid.dunkin,supra,th at,d see also id.at,d.thus,although the contract could not grant parental rights to dunkin that the law otherwise expressly denies to him,infringe upon the authority of the court to provide for the appropriate custody and support of the child,or abridge the rights of the child,as between dunkin and boskey it is binding.citations.id.at,d.
turning to the issue of remedies,the court held that t he preclusion of dunkin claim for general damages for emotional harm on public policy grounds does not operate to deny him recovery of special damages for readily ascertainable loss under an unjust enrichment theory.citations.dunkin,supra,th at,d.in so holding,the court noted that a contract unenforceable in its entirety for public policy reasons may still be enforced in part under compelling circumstances where the lawful and unlawful portions of the agreement may be separated.citations.id.at,d.in the case before it,the dunkin court reasoned,public policy only precluded enforcement of the contract by certain,specific performance or damages for emotional that the relevant public policy considerations would not be contravened by an award of compensation for dunkin economic loss.id.at,d.
although dunkin was decided in july,well over a year before mcbride filed his complaint in this case,the parties did not cite or discuss it either in the trial court or in their briefs on appeal.we accordingly requested supplemental letter briefs.not surprisingly,mcbride supplemental briefs contend that dunkin supports his position.respondents supplemental brief,on the other hand,argues that dunkin is distinguishable.for the reasons we will explain,we concur in respondents assessment.
the fact that mcbride claim is one for restitution,arising from boughton alleged misrepresentations about his paternity,sharply distinguishes the present case from dunkin.in fact,from a public policy prospective,dunkin presented the converse concern from that existing in the present case.
the dunkin court recognized the possibility that requiring the defendant in that case to reimburse the plaintiff could indirectly compromise the funds present
