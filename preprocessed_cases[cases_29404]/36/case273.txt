this case involves disturbing allegations of child molestation committed by a public school official.john doe and his mother jane doe contend that,while he was enrolled at franklin middle school in champaign,illinois,he was repeatedly molested by the school dean of students,brady smith,and that champaign community schools unit district and various school officials were deliberately indifferent to the abuse.the does filed this lawsuit under title vi of the civil rights act of et,title ix of the education amendments of et,the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,as enforced by,and various provisions of illinois law.prior to trial,the district court granted summary judgment to the school district and the individually named defendants on the does section claims.at trial,a jury found no liability on the remaining claims.
we affirm summary judgment for the defendants on the does section claims against the school district and school officials with the exception of brady smith,because titles vi and ix provide adequate statutory recourse for the alleged discrimination.we also affirm the district court decision to admit john doe criminal history,because it was relevant to his claim for compensatory damages.
however,we conclude the does are entitled to a new trial for three reasons.the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of brady smith,because titles vi and ix do not shield an alleged child molester from the prospect of individual liability for his constitutional tort,excluded smith conviction for soliciting another middle school student for sex,and denied the does motion to reconsider admitting a witness testimony that smith sexually abused him in the late.for these reasons,as discussed more fully below,we reverse and remand for a new trial on john doe section claim against brady smith and the does titles vi and ix claims against the school district and school officials in their official capacities.
background 
john doe first enrolled at franklin middle school in as a sixth grader the parties do not dispute that doe was a troubled child whose classroom conduct was disruptive at times.by doe year,brady smith,the school dean of students,had taken what appeared to be a benign and constructive interest in the boy,often counseling doe about his conduct and grades.in doe year,however,smith seemingly innocent conduct revealed his alleged ulterior motive.while supervising schoolchildren before school,smith would often seek out doe on the playground and order him to smith office because he was a troublemaker at trial,doe testified that he spent approximately percent of his year in the dean office,rather than in class.smith never helped doe with his homework or studies during these extended office visits instead,according to the does,smith used the time to sexually groom john doe 
for instance,one friday in february,while in the dean office,smith invited doe to have breakfast with him.this breakfast invitation,according to doe,was the beginning of the molestation.at trial,doe testified in detail about the first instance of sexual abuse.the two ate breakfast on a saturday at a local restaurant and thereafter ended up at smith home,where they watched football.at some point during the game,smith turned and said that doe needed therapy when doe asked what therapy meant,smith pulled down the boy pants,held doe hands behind his back,and performed oral sex on him.during the ride back to doe home,smith instructed doe that the therapy was their secret and directed him not to tell anyone.the following monday,smith ordered doe to his office where he again reminded him not to tell anyone about the weekend activities 
smith attention to doe persisted throughout doe year and into high school.it is undisputed that smith gave doe money and often bought him tennis shoes,video games,and sports tickets.at the end of his year,smith told doe that he needed more therapy to graduate from middle school and,despite failing every class in the eighth grade,doe was promoted to central high school.
perhaps the most egregious conduct doe alleges occurred on october.doe had been in an altercation with his gym teacher and landed himself in juvenile court for assault.smith came to court and,according to doe,before the hearing 
we went to a little section of the courthouse and he said i was going to go to juvenile doc but he could talk to somebody,the state attorney or somebody to help me but i had to agree for therapy for him to keep me out of prison.
at the hearing,doe received probation and,at the urging of smith and the state attorney,the juvenile court released him into smith custody,with the express understanding that smith would take him to register for school doe left the courthouse with smith but,rather than registering him for school as the court instructed,smith took doe to his home where he again performed oral sex on him 
smith often gave doe then years old and without a driver license the keys to his truck in exchange for therapy.the abusive relationship ended in october when doe wrecked smith suv.possibly to fend off raised eyebrows and suspicions of impropriety,smith reported the truck stolen,and doe again found himself in juvenile detention.while there,doe told his mother of the abuse and sent a letter to the juvenile court judge stating that he was finally ready to explain why he did not go to school 
smith was placed on administrative leave while the local police and the illinois department of children and family services investigated doe allegations.two weeks later,in early november,despite an ongoing police and state agency investigation,smith returned to work as the dean.indeed,the school district superintendent called smith and welcomed him back without imposing any restrictions on his contact with students in contrast to the open arms the school district allegedly extended to smith upon his return,doe did not return to school after reporting the abuse.no attempt was made to inform his mother of his truancy no support services were offered and his school records were irretrievably lost.in january,the state decided not to charge smith with sexually abusing doe.
ultimately,both smith and doe were convicted of felonies.smith was convicted in for soliciting another middle school student for a sex act.in,an african american middle school student reported that,while in the dean office,smith told the boy he would give him if the boy agreed to show himself in smith office.another middle school student also reported to police that smith had propositioned him for sex.police subsequently obtained a wiretapped conversation corroborating the boys stories.smith was initially indicted for aggravated sexual assault,sexual misconduct,and indecent solicitation.however,those charges were dropped and smith received probation for the remaining solicitation charge.doe has amassed three felony drug convictions over the years.
in,john doe and his mother sued the champaign community schools unit district,brady smith,and the following school officials in their individual and official capacities michael cain the school district assistant superintendent,kathryn fletcher the principal at franklin middle school,donald hansen the principal at central high school,and dianne shepard the dean at central high school the does sought relief under titles vi and ix,as well as state law.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the does section claims,allowing their titles vi and ix claims against the school district and pendent state law claims against smith and the district to stand.before trial,the district court ruled on several motions in limine.two are relevant to this appeal first,the district court denied the does motion to exclude john doe three felony drug convictions in contrast,the district court granted the defendants motion to exclude smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a child.ten days before the originally scheduled trial date,after hearing about the does case in the media,another putative victim,tyrone b,went to the police and reported that he too was molested by smith as an adolescent in the late.the district court denied the does emergency motion to admit tyrone b testimony because they failed to disclose him as a potential witness.after the trial was delayed for eleven months,the does asked the court to reconsider its earlier ruling excluding tyrone b testimony the district court denied the motion to reconsider.
four african american men,including john doe,testified at trial that smith sexually groomed and abused them as students at franklin middle school.the defendants countered that smith actions were benevolent,and the dean only wanted to help the troubled youths.after a trial,the jury found no liability on the does claims.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the does argue they are entitled to a new trial because the district court erred when it a granted summary judgment on their section claims,b excluded evidence of smith conviction for soliciting a minor for a sex act,c admitted evidence of john doe three felony drug convictions,and d excluded tyrone b testimony that smith molested him in the.we address the does arguments in turn 
preemption of the does section claims 
john doe and his mother sued the champaign school district,brady smith and the individually named school officials,claiming violations of titles vi and ix,as well as the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,as enforced by.
as to their claims brought under titles vi and ix,the does contend that john doe suffered unlawful race and discrimination that interfered with his federally funded education because smith specifically targeted african american boys for sexual grooming and abuse.title ix provides in pertinent part that,no person shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a when a claim for damages is based on the behavior of a teacher or of some other employee of the title ix recipient,the plaintiff must prove that an official of the defendant educational institution who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures has actual notice of,and is deliberately indifferent to,the teacher misconduct.delgado stegall,cir quoting gebser lago vista indep.school,d.title ix was modeled after title vi of the civil rights act of under which the does assert discrimination claims as well.the statutes are parallel except that title vi prohibits race discrimination,not sex discrimination,and applies to all programs receiving federal funds,not only education programs.see et gebser,at.because the two statutes largely operate in the same manner,both conditioning an offer of federal funding on a promise by the recipient not to discriminate,our discussion of the does title ix claim applies to their title vi claims as well.see cannon university of chicago,d.
the does also assert constitutional claims against the school district and school officials pursuant to.to state a claim under section,a plaintiff must allege two elements the alleged conduct was committed by a person acting under color of state law and the activity deprived a person of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.case milewski,cir gomez toledo,d citing.here,the does contend that the school district generally turned a blind eye to smith abuse of african american boys and,as such,the school district denied john doe equal protection and substantive due process as the fourteenth amendment requires 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the does section claims,reasoning that those claims were barred by titles vi and ix.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,see wyninger new venture gear,cir,and affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district and individually named school officials,but reverse summary judgment as to brady smith.
the question presented is this does title ix of the education amendments of foreclose a section suit against a federally funded school for an allegedly unlawful practice or policy,school officials tasked with implementing the educational program or policy,or school personnel who,under color of law,allegedly violated another federally protected rights in middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers ass n,d,the supreme court announced what has become known as the sea clammers doctrine when the remedial devices provided in a particular act are sufficiently comprehensive,they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under.the heart of the parties dispute here is whether the sea clammers doctrine precludes the does section claims against the defendants.
in delgado,we explored the contours of the sea clammers doctrine in the context of sexual harassment in a federally funded school.in that case,a college student,alleging her professor sexually harassed her,sued her university under title ix and the harassing university professor under section.in reversing summary judgment to the professor,we held that,in enacting title ix,congress did not intend to extinguish the right to sue under section in all cases.we note that the district court here granted summary judgment on the does section claims before our decision in delgado,which clarified this circuit precedent regarding title ix preemption of section suits.three principles buttressed our decision in delgado and are applicable here.
first,with respect to claims against a recipient of federal funds,we stated that title ix furnishes all the relief that is necessary to rectify the discriminatory policies or practices of the school itself.delgado,at.to be sure,the question of whether title ix preempted a section suit against a federally funded education program was not before us in delgado because,in that case,the college student did not assert a section claim against her university.thus,we bring to the fore in this case what was arguably dicta in delgado under the sea clammers doctrine,there is no parallel right of action under section against a federally funded education program where title ix provides a sufficient private right of action for the allegedly unlawful policy or practice.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the school district on the does section claims against it.
the second principle of delgado relates to section claims against school officials whose alleged liability arises only to the extent that they were responsible for implementing an unlawful practice or policy.regarding the effect of a title ix claim,there is a crucial line in our case law between suits against the alleged malefactor who is not shielded from section liability,see,delgado,at,and suits against school officials implementing the challenged education practice or policy who are shielded from individual liability,see,boulahanis bd.of regents,cir.in the latter instance,we have held that a section claim is not cognizable because title ix provides comprehensive recourse the loss of federal funds for the discriminatory practice or policy.congress intended to place the burden of compliance with civil rights law on educational institutions themselves,not on the individual officials associated with those institutions.waid merrill area pub,cir.
the does contend the district court erroneously held that title ix preempts their section claims against cain,fletcher,hansen,and shepard.importantly,the does claims against these school officials are essentially identical to their claims against the school district specifically with respect to african american boys,the school district through the school officials failed to follow its sexual harassment policy,resulting in a widespread practice of deliberate indifference toward the plight of smith victims.because the does claims against the school officials relates solely to their implementation of district policy,we conclude that title ix provides sufficient statutory recourse for the discrimination.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of school officials cain,fletcher,hansen,and shepard in their individual capacities.
the third relevant principle of delgado is simple enough title ix does not immunize from section liability a defendant who uses his position in a federally funded education program to sexually harass and abuse students.see delgado,at.title ix has two important objectives to avoid the use of federal resources to support discriminatory practices and to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.cannon,at.but it is quite otherwise in a case such as this,in which the malefactor is a teacher whose malefaction is not a policy or a practice for which the school could be held liable under title ix.delgado,at.title ix does not shield the malefactor from personal liability for his federal constitutional tort.the legislators who enacted title ix would be startled to discover that by doing so they had killed all federal remedies for sex discrimination by teachers of which the school lacked actual knowledge.id.at.
ruling on the plaintiffs motion for a new trial,the district court modified its opinion and held that,under our decision in delgado,the does could maintain their section claims against smith.the court concluded that summary judgment for smith was nonetheless proper because smith abuse was not state action,which is required to proceed under section.although not every action by a state employee occurs under color of state law,we conclude the district court erred in this case.action is taken under color of state law when it is made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.hughes meyer,cir quoting united states classic.internal quotation marks omitted.
smith was arguably clothed with the authority of the state when,at the october delinquency hearing,the juvenile court released doe to smith custody with the express agreement that the dean would take the boy to register for school.indeed,the state attorney told the court that releasing doe to smith custody was a good idea because smith had been the minor dean last year.of course,doe alleges that he was never taken to register for school that day,but was instead taken to smith home for further abuse.assuming doe version of the facts is true as we must do at the stage,smith opportunity to molest him that day was made possible because smith used his authority as the dean to persuade the juvenile court judge to release doe to his custody.
more generally,the does contend that,while supervising students on the playground,smith would often single doe out and instruct him to report to smith office,where allegedly he would isolate and sexually groom doe.viewing the facts in the light favorable to the does,a jury could reasonably conclude that smith was acting under color of state law when he withheld doe from class allegedly to sexually groom him for subsequent abuse.see west by through norris waymire,cir assuming without discussion that a police officer acted under color of state law when he molested a thirteen girl while escorting her home after curfew.because title ix does not preempt the does section claims against smith and because there is a triable issue of fact as to whether smith was acting under color of law when he allegedly abused doe,judgment as a matter of law was improper.therefore,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in smith favor.the does section claims against him must be reinstated.
evidentiary rulings 
admissibility of john doe felony drug convictions 
in an effort to establish his entitlement to compensatory damages,doe expert testified at trial that doe suffered from stress disorder ptsd as a result of smith abuse.the countered that,even if he suffered from ptsd,doe three felony convictions and stint in prison were the life stressors that caused his ptsd.the district court allowed evidence of doe convictions to come in for the limited purpose of informing the jury that john doe has been convicted of three felonies,what the felonies are for,what the sentence was for each felony and the length of his incarcerations and probation.the does contend that introduction of the felony convictions was inflammatory and therefore improper under the federal rules of evidence.we disagree.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,united states wilson,cir,and conclude that the court was not unreasonable in denying the does motion to exclude evidence of john doe criminal history.first,contrary to the does assertion,the felony convictions were only admitted into evidence because doe sought compensatory damages.the district court properly agree d with plaintiffs that john doe criminal history is not relevant to the issue of defendant liability for the civil rights claims in this case.
the does further contend that,even if the convictions were relevant to the issues of damages,they were racially inflammatory and only further confused the jury.when asked at oral argument whether a limiting instruction was sought regarding doe convictions,his counsel indicated that no such request was made.we have stated that a limiting instruction is most effective in reducing or eliminating possible unfair prejudice from the introduction of evidence of prior bad acts or convictions.see united states puckett,cir.in this case,because john doe convictions were admitted to rebut his claim for compensatory damages and because the does failed to seek a limiting instruction to minimize any prejudice or confusion the evidence may have caused,we can not conclude that the district court acted unreasonably when it admitted the evidence.
admissibility of brady smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a child 
in,five years after doe was allegedly abused,an african american male student at franklin reported to authorities that smith asked him to expose himself while the two were in the dean office during a subsequent investigation,another boy wore a police wire and recorded conversations in which smith asked him for oral sex in exchange for money.smith was subsequently convicted of indecent solicitation of a child.
at trial,the district court granted smith motion in limine to exclude evidence related to the conviction.the does argue on appeal that the district court erred because the conviction was admissible under federal rule of evidence.in reviewing the trial court evidentiary decision for abuse of discretion,see united states seals,cir,we agree with the does that smith conviction should have been admitted at trial.
congress enacted rule,together with rules and,as part of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat.particularly in sex offense cases,the rules were designed to supercede the general exclusionary principle set forth in rule b.united states cunningham,cir.thus,under rule,in civil cases where a party is alleged to have committed sexual assault or child molestation,evidence of that party commission of another offense or offenses of sexual assault or child molestation is admissible.a.the operational definition of sexual assault is set forth in federal rule of evidence d and is defined as any conduct proscribed under chapter or relevant state law smith was convicted of violating ilcs of the illinois code,which proscribes soliciting a minor for sex the question is whether,under rule d,smith solicitation amounted to an attempt to engage in the proscribed conduct the district court answered this question in the negative,concluding that soliciting a minor for a sex act does not constitute an attempt to commit an offense of sexual assault.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.dunlap hepp,cir.
the does argue that soliciting a minor for sex necessarily constitutes a substantial step toward committing sexual assault.there is forceful support in our case law for the does argument.for instance,in gattem gonzales,cir,the petitioner was convicted of indecent solicitation under illinois law for offering a minor cigarettes if she would engage in oral sex with him.we affirmed the board of immigration appeals decision that the petitioner solicitation conviction amounted to not merely attempt but an act of sexual abuse because the petitioner used persuasion or inducement in an effort to convince the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct.id.at.our holding in gattem was based upon the following principle 
t here is an inherent risk of exploitation,if not coercion,when an adult solicits a minor to engage in sexual activity.minors as a group have a less sense of judgment than adults,and thus are at greater peril of making choices that are not in their own best interests.
similarly,in gonzales,cir,the petitioner entered an internet and conversed with an adult undercover investigator,whom he believed to be a fifteen girl.the petitioner made plans to meet the minor for sex,but was arrested en route to the address the investigator supplied.in that case,we stated that solicitation,a partially completed offense similar to an attempt constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under a a.id.at internal citation omitted.
it is true that gattem and were immigration cases involving the definition of a sexual offense for purposes of the immigration and nationality act,whereas this case requires us to interpret what constitutes a sexual offense for purposes of the federal rules of evidence.beyond the immigration context,whether soliciting a minor for sex constitutes an attempt to commit sexual assault or child molestation for that matter is a question of first impression for this court.we begin our analysis with the definition of attempt the crime of attempt requires the specific intent to commit a crime and a substantial step towards the commission of that crime.united states johnson,cir.a substantial step is something more than mere preparation,but less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime.united states barnes,cir see doe city of lafayette,cir merely thinking sexual thoughts about children does not constitute a substantial step toward sexual abuse.
our dissenting colleague contends that the act of solicitation can not constitute an attempt,and that our opinion will have a deleterious effect on criminal and civil law.to the contrary,our decision today is consistent with our circuit precedent as set forth in united states rovetuso,cir.in rovetuso,the defendants were charged with attempting to interfere with the testimony of a government witness based upon evidence that they solicited an fbi informant to murder the witness.at trial,the court instructed the jury that solicitation may constitute an attempt to commit the target offense.on appeal,the defendants attacked the jury instruction and argued that their convictions should be reversed since solicitation alone can never constitute the required substantial step necessary to establish attempt.rovetuso,at.holding that the jury instruction was a correct statement of law,we affirmed and reasoned as follows 
the federal courts have generally rejected a rigid formalistic approach to the attempt offense.instead they commonly recognize that the determination by their particular conduct of what constitutes an attempt is so dependent on the particular facts of each case that,of necessity,there can be no litmus test to guide the reviewing courts.following this analysis,which we consider the better reasoned approach,several federal courts have concluded that a solicitation accompanied by the requisite intent may constitute an attempt.
rovetuso,at cir quoting united states american airlines,cir emphasis added.thus,as we recognized in rovetuso,solicitation may constitute a substantial step toward the target offense where the solicitation is strongly corroborative of the intent to commit the crime,in other words,if it went beyond mere asking.rovetuso,at.whether,given the facts of this case,smith solicitation amounted to attempt is a question we turn to next.
circuits that have addressed whether soliciting a child is a substantial step toward committing a sexual offense have reached varying conclusions.for example,in united states hayward,cir,the third circuit held that the defendant act of lying on a bed with a fourteen girl and repeatedly pushing her head toward his fully clothed penis did not constitute a substantial step toward oral sex and was therefore not an attempted sexual act.but see hayward,at fuentes,concurring in part and dissenting in part stating the majority repeated emphasis on hayward state of undress is misplaced and misleading and reasoning that a substantial step occurred when the only thing standing in the way of successful completion of a sexual act was a layer of fabric.similarly,in united states blue bird,cir,a fourteen year old girl testified that the defendant kissed her and fondled her breasts.relying on the third circuit decision in hayward,the eighth circuit concluded that the evidence was inadmissible under rule,the rule of evidence pertaining to criminal cases involving allegations of sexual assault.the court reasoned that the fact that he desisted and withdrew when the victim said that she was not interested,indicates that blue bird at most merely solicited some kind of sexual contact.without some more substantial step,we hold that this conduct can not constitute an attempted sexual act or an attempt to engage in sexual contact.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
oddly,courts have more liberally defined what constitutes a substantial step to commit a sex offense against a child in cases.in united states bailey,cir,the sixth circuit upheld a defendant conviction for attempting to engage in sex with a minor where the defendant emailed his telephone number to underage girls and tried to convince them to meet him for sex.the court reasoned that the substantial step that strongly corroborated the defendant intent to persuade the minor victims was simply the solicitous emails he sent to his putative victims.id.at.likewise,in another case,united states murrell,cir,the eleventh circuit held that a defendant electronic solicitation of a government agent,who the defendant believed to be a minor,constituted a substantial step to commit a sex act against a child.see also united states thomas,cir finding defendant took a substantial step toward child molestation by sending solicitous emails to an undercover officer posing as a twelve girl.
applying the principles set forth in gattem and,we recognize that there is an inherent risk of exploitation when an adult solicits sex from a minor who,due to his or her sense of judgment and susceptibility to coercion,lacks the capacity to consent.therefore,we hold that a defendant attempts to sexually assault a is,takes a substantial step toward committing the he solicits the child complacency in a sex act.in this case,smith solicitous conduct occurred both when he called a middle school student to his office and offered the boy to expose himself,and during subsequent recorded telephone conversations.although it is unclear from the record precisely what solicitous conduct ultimately formed the basis of smith guilty plea,in either instance,his conduct went beyond thinking about or planning to have sex with a minor.unquestionably,calling the minor to the dean office and telling him to expose himself for money evinces smith intent and substantial step toward sexual assault the wiretapped conversations between smith and a minor also satisfy our attempt inquiry.smith coded references to sex as therapy corroborate his intent.further still,smith made a substantial step toward completing the offense when he identified his home as the place where the sex would occur and stated that money would be the form of payment.smith conduct is analogous to the defendants conduct in cases like bailey and murrell.there is no appreciable difference between attempted child sexual assault using telephonic means,as in this case,and electronic means,as in the cases.we therefore conclude that smith solicitation of a child in constituted an attempt to commit a sexual offense against a minor.
the final question in our rule inquiry is whether the probative value of admitting smith conviction outweighs the prejudicial effect.we believe that it does.as representative susan molinari,the principal house sponsor for rules,commented in her floor statements,in child molestation cases a history of similar acts tends to be exceptionally probative because it shows an unusual disposition of the sexual or sadosexual interest in simply does not exist in ordinary people.cong.rec.the school district contends that,notwithstanding the admissibility of the conviction against smith,his conviction does not tend to establish any of the does claims against it.we disagree.smith pedophilic conduct is a fact of consequence that is intertwined with the school district potential civil liability.as we noted in our discussion of their section claims against the school district,in order to establish liability,the does must prove that some champaign school official who at a minimum had authority to institute corrective measures had actual notice of,and was deliberately indifferent to,smith misconduct.simply stated,if smith did not do anything wrong,then necessarily the school district can not be liable for deliberate indifference.smith conviction was highly probative of whether smith position as dean provided him with an opportunity to cultivate the boys trust and,also,the conviction tends to discredit the theory that smith was merely a benevolent educator.we therefore conclude that the prejudicial effect of smith conviction does not outweigh the probative value to the does case that he was convicted in of soliciting sex from another franklin middle schooler 
admissibility of tyrone b testimony 
after learning of the does case in the media,tyrone b,another putative smith victim,went to the police and reported that smith abused him in the late.tyrone b described himself as an isolated child from a family.according to tyrone b who was or years old at the time,smith who was then or years old cultivated tyrone b trust and friendship by giving him tennis shoes and appealing to his love of sports.eventually,tyrone b started spending nights at smith home and in smith bed more than once tyrone b would awake to smith performing oral sex,attempting to perform anal sex,or masturbating.
the does learned of tyrone b statement to police on june,ten days before trial was originally set to begin on june.because the period for discovery had closed,the does filed an emergency motion to admit tyrone b statement to police under federal rule of evidence.the trial court sua sponte continued the trial to november,then the court denied the does emergency motion to admit tyrone b testimony.in november,the trial was again delayed,this time at smith request.on november,the does asked the court to reconsider its earlier ruling excluding tyrone b testimony.on december,the district court,without explanation,denied the motion to reconsider.the trial ultimately occurred in may,nearly a year after the does initially sought to introduce tyrone b testimony.
we conclude that the trial court erred when it excluded tyrone b testimony from trial.the admissibility of witness testimony presents competing interests of the parties.on the one hand,the discovery of potential witnesses in a timely fashion is an important principle of litigation.the central aim of such rules is to minimize surprise at trial by requiring disclosure of witnesses in advance of trial.tyson trigg,cir.a party against whom an witness is offered is undoubtedly disadvantaged to some degree by the late disclosure.on the other hand,through no fault of its own,a party may learn of a critical witness only days prior to trial.given the competing interests at stake and given that the trial judge is in the best position to weigh such interests as they unfold,we have declined to fashion a rule regarding the admissibility of newly discovered witness testimony.id.instead,we review a trial court decision to exclude newly discovered testimony for an abuse of discretion and will reverse only if the court ruling was unreasonable.cincinnati ins.flanders motor service,cir.
federal rule of evidence b states a party who intends to offer evidence under this rule shall disclose the evidence to the party against whom it will be offered at least fifteen days before the scheduled date of trial or at such later time as the court may allow for good cause.notwithstanding our deferential standard of review,there is a strong argument that,in ruling on the does emergency motion,the court should have allowed in tyrone b testimony for good cause.the denial of the emergency motion to admit is not the sole basis of the does appellate argument,however after the trial was delayed for five months,the does filed a motion to reconsider the exclusion of tyrone b testimony.the trial court denied the motion to reconsider and it is that ruling that we find unreasonable.
the does contended that tyrone b was a crucial witness because his story bore striking similarities to smith other victims but,unlike doe,who was a convicted felon,tyrone b was more credible because he held a steady job and went to the police on his own initiative.moreover,tyrone b testimony,dating smith pedophilia as far back as the late,provided an important temporal context for this case.we agree that the evidentiary value of tyrone b testimony is apparent,and there was good cause for the does filing delay.as the district court noted,through no fault of their own,plaintiffs did not become aware of this witness until june.the court nonetheless reasoned that the testimony should be excluded because the delay was a violation of its discovery order.to call the does discovery of tyrone b an disclosure is somewhat misleading,however,given the delay between when tyrone b was disclosed and when trial eventually took place.any prejudice to the defendants caused by the late disclosure could have been mitigated by affording the defendants an opportunity to depose tyrone b during the delay.therefore,we conclude that the district court denial of the does motion to reconsider exclusion of tyrone testimony was an abuse of the court discretion.
to be sure,the jury verdict would stand if the court evidentiary errors were harmless.united states sutton,cir.an error will be found harmful only if it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we can not conclude on this record that the trial court evidentiary rulings were harmless error,however.the does argument that they are entitled to a new trial implies that the district court exclusion of smith conviction and tyrone b testimony prejudiced their ability to establish their titles vi and ix claims.in other words,the does assume their claims against the school district failed because the jury did not believe smith molested doe,and they would have successfully carried their burden of proof had the excluded evidence come in at trial.however,this assumption is not crystal clear from the record.there are other elements necessary to establish the district liability,whether smith molestation adversely affected doe whether the district knew of,but was deliberately indifferent to the abuse whether doe was damaged as a result and whether the district proximately caused the damages.plausibly,their claims may have failed on one of those elements.for example,the jury may have believed the district was not aware of the abuse or that doe,a convicted felon,did not suffer damages proximately caused by the district indifference.unfortunately,the jury was given only a general verdict form,leaving us without the benefit of its answers to interrogatories about the case.two scenarios that would have made the record clearer for our review are doe section claim against smith would have survived summary judgment,thus requiring the jury to determine implicitly whether smith molested doe or the verdict form would have required the jury to determine explicitly whether the sexual abuse occurred.neither of these scenarios is what we have here,and thus we do not know which element s of their titles vi and ix claims the does failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.in light of this ambiguity in the record,we can not say the district court errors were harmless.
iii.conclusion 
we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the school officials as to the does section claims against them in their individual capacities.however,because titles vi and ix do not preempt individual liability against the malefactor alleged to have committed the misconduct,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of brady smith on john doe section claim,and that claim is reinstated for trial.
we also find prejudicial error in two of the district court evidentiary rulings.the whole of the evidentiary record paints a compelling picture that,over the course of twenty years,smith used his various positions of authority to groom and abuse his victims sexually.by excluding tyrone b testimony that he was molested in the late and smith felony conviction for indecent solicitation of a child,the jury received an unreasonably fragmented tale of abuse.absent this fragmentation of the evidence,there is a substantial likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different.we therefore reverse and remand the case for a new trial on the does title vi and title ix claims against the school district and the school officials in their official capacities.
concurring in the judgment remanding the case for a new trial and dissenting with respect to the majority opinion,section.entitled admissibility of brady smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a minor.in my view,smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a minor over the telephone does not constitute an offense of sexual assault under rule d of the federal rules of evidence.thus,i agree with the magistrate judge conclusion that evidence of smith solicitation conviction was not admissible in smith civil trial.
in,two students at the franklin middle school in champaign,illinois informed the local police department that brady smith,the school dean of students,had propositioned them individually each one on separate occasions for sex.the record reflects that one of the boys told authorities that smith had offered him if he would show himself.the other boy claimed that smith in one instance had asked him for sexual favors undisclosed,allegedly stating that the boy owed him a favor because he helped him pass the eighth grade.based on this information,the police obtained a wiretap warrant authorizing the installation of a recording device on smith home telephone.see ilcs.with the cooperation of one of the boys,the police recorded a telephone conversation that corroborated the boy story.smith was subsequently charged with three crimes aggravated sexual assault sexual misconduct and indecent solicitation of a minor.those charges were later dropped as part of a plea agreement and smith agreed to plead guilty to one count of indecent solicitation of a minor over the telephone,in violation of ilcs a.
on july,one of smith alleged victims identified as john doe and his mother identified as jane doe filed this civil suit seeking to recover monetary damages in the united states district court for the central district of illinois.the does claimed inter alia that smith and the champaign school district violated title vi of the civil rights act of,title ix of the federal education amendments act of,and the equal protection and due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.at trial,the does sought to introduce in evidence smith illinois state conviction for soliciting a minor for sex.smith filed a motion in limine to exclude from evidence any testimony concerning his illinois state conviction,arguing that any evidence concerning the conviction was inadmissible evidence of a previous offense of sexual assault under the federal rules of evidence.see.d.the magistrate judge agreed and granted the smith motion,finding that smith previous conviction under illinois statute ilcs a did not constitute an offense of sexual assault as defined in rule d.the majority would have us reverse the magistrate judge ruling and goes on to conclude that smith prior conviction for indecent solicitation of a minor over the telephone does constitute an attempted offense of sexual assault under rules and d and thus admissible at trial.i disagree.
discussion 
in order for a prior criminal conviction to be admissible in a civil trial in federal court against a person for conduct constituting an offense of sexual assault or child molestation,it is required that the previous attempt comport with the definition of an offense of sexual assault,as set in the federal rules of evidence.according to rule d,the offense of sexual assault is defined as 
any conduct proscribed by chapter of title,united states code 
contact,without consent,between any part of the defendant body or an object and the genitals or anus of another person 
contact,without consent,between the genitals or anus of the defendant and any part of another person body 
deriving sexual pleasure or gratification from the infliction of death,bodily injury,or physical pain on another person or 
an attempt or conspiracy to engage in conduct described in paragraphs.
in contrast,the illinois statute under which smith was convicted in makes illegal the indecent solicitation of a child with the intent of committing aggravated criminal sexual assault,criminal sexual assault,predatory criminal sexual assault of a child,or aggravated criminal sexual abuse.ilcs a.the majority attempts to shoehorn smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a minor into federal rule of evidence d definition of a sexual assault by holding smith solicitation of a child over the telephone constituted an attempt to commit a sexual offense against a minor,and thus was admissible.majority opinion at.however,because solicitation per se can not constitute an attempt,without a substantial act in furtherance of the intended crime,and since there is no evidence in the record to suggest that smith did anything except converse over the telephone,i disagree.see infra.
in support of the majority conclusion that solicitation per se constitutes an attempt under rule d,it cites two decisions of this court which,although they may be considered somewhat analogous,are distinguishable.see,gattem gonzales,cir gonzales,cir.for example,gattem gonzales was a review of a removal decision under the immigration and naturalization act,et.while we held that the petitioner prior conviction for solicitation constituted sexual abuse,that decision was made in an immigration case under and a,which defines sexual abuse much more expansively than rule d.compare a,with.d see gattem,at.as we recognized in gattem,a,broadly defines sexual abuse to include,among other things,the inducement of a child to engage in a sexual act as well as other form s of sexual exploitation of children.id.at.in contrast,rule d is more limited in scope and,see supra,is nearly as broad as a in its definition of what constitutes sexual assault and conspicuously does not include the terms persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion.a thus,while the solicitation of a sex act over the telephone alone may conceivably,under certain circumstances,be sufficient to constitute an attempt to persuade,induce or entice a minor into a sex act under a,the same can not be said for rule d which requires proof of an attempt to commit actual sexual assault.
while the cases which the majority relies upon,and gattem,were not decided under the federal rules of evidence,the eighth circuit has addressed this precise issue,of whether solicitation of a sex act amounts to an attempt pursuant to rule d,and has held that it does not.see united states blue bird,cir.in blue bird,a witness for the government testified that when she was fourteen years of age she was approached by the defendant,blue bird,and solicited for sex.id.at.specifically,the girl stated that while she was resting on a couch,blue bird,held her hand,rubbed her stomach,pushed her up to just below her breasts,kissed her,and said,let do it.id.at.the girl understood these actions and words to be a manifestation of his intention to engage in a sex act with her.see id.she responded by telling blue bird that she was not interested and he did nothing more see id.applying the rule d definition of the offense of sexual assault,the eighth circuit concluded that while blue bird solicited some kind of sexual contact,w ithout some more substantial step this conduct can not constitute an attempted sexual act or an attempt to engage in sexual contact.emphasis added 
i believe that the eighth circuit approach is well advised and is the more prudent approach.and,we should apply similar reasoning in this case.for the eighth circuit decision in blue bird is much more in line with the congressional intent underlying rules and d than that proposed by the majority.while there are federal statutes,such as a and b,which criminalize solicitation per se,without an additional substantial act,solicitation per se does not constitute attempted sexual assault under rule d.numerous authorities,both scholarly and judicial,have long recognized that the mere act of solicitation does not constitute an attempt to commit the crime solicited.charles torcia,wharton criminal law see graham people,m ere solicitations do not prove an attempt state,there has been much debate whether mere solicitation constitutes an attempt most courts will answer no.quoting low,criminal law state otto,idaho.under criminal law,an attempt requires something more than thoughts or words an attempt requires that the defendant undertake a substantial act in furtherance of the intended crime,sexual assault.as this court has previously held,a substantial step is something more than mere preparation,but less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime.united states barnes,cir.the specific state law the smith before us was convicted of violating punishes solicitation only,and though this solicitation over the phone violated illinois statute prohibiting indecent solicitation of a minor,ilcs a,it does not fit within the parameters limits of rule d definition of an offense of sexual assault.indeed,in the case before us,the evidence in the record establishes only that smith solicited a minor for a sex act over the telephone.even were we to assume that smith had the intent to commit the crime of sexual assault,the record falls far short of establishing that there was a substantial act in furtherance of the alleged planned intended crime while i do not condone any of smith actions in fact i condemn them,the record is barren of any evidence which would suggest that smith did anything in this case but talk salaciously with and solicit a minor over the words alone do not rise to the level of being legally sufficient to constitute a substantial act in furtherance of the crime of sexual assault.see,state molasky,en banc in order for solicitation to rise to the level of an attempt,it must be accompanied by an attenuated substantial act an act,whether it be making a cash payment,delivering a weapon,journeying to a crime scene,waiting for a victim,has to have accompanied the conversation,thus evidencing the seriousness of purpose,and making the planned crime closer to fruition.see also ford state,so d,holding that solicitation must be accompanied by an overt act,a direct movement toward the commission of the intended crime after all the preparations are made.
this point is illustrated by the fact that the illinois statute that smith pleaded guilty to in illinois state court essentially criminalizes intent alone.see ilcs a.illinois statute ilcs a does not require that a substantial act in furtherance of the intended sex crime be performed and the record before us is barren and devoid of any such act.indeed,such a requirement would be redundant,for intent in addition to a substantial act in furtherance of the crime would amount to attempted sexual assault,and thus ilcs a would become superfluous.see,wharton criminal law stating that in jurisdictions,such as illinois,that have statutes that specifically criminalize solicitation,the imposition of attempt liability would constitute a circumvention of the legislative intent to the contrary.
the proposition that mere solicitation should not be classified as an attempt is further supported by the cybermolestor cases.as the eighth circuit pointed out in blue bird,supra,the cybermolestor cases are distinguishable from cases such as smith.see blue bird,at.the defendants in the cybermolestor cases have,without exception,engaged in something more than solicitation alone,such as substantial travel or the like to meet with the intended victim or the predator has been prosecuted under a statute which specifically recites and incorporates solicitation as an element of the crime,such as b.see,united states mitchell,cir defendant traveled from indiana to illinois with the intent to engage in sexual activity with what he thought was a united states bailey,cir defendant prosecuted under b the majority misinterprets these decisions when stating that some courts have more liberally defined what constitutes a substantial step to commit a sex offense against a child in cases.majority opinion at.the reason that courts have interpreted what constitutes a substantial step more liberally in those cases is that most cybermolestor cases prosecuted in federal court are brought under statutes such as b,which specifically incorporate actions that amount to solicitation into the statute.see mitchell,at united states murrell,cir.to support its untenable position,the majority cites to united states murrell for the proposition that solicitation of a minor for sex over the internet constituted a substantial step to commit a sex act against a child.majority opinion at.however,contrary to the majority reading of murrell,what the eleventh circuit actually held in that case is that,under b not under rule d,the defendant took a substantial step toward inducing a minor to engage in illicit sexual acts,thereby satisfying the second element of criminal attempt.the statutory language of rule d does not encompass crimes of inducement unlike,thus while solicitation alone may constitute a substantial step toward the commission of an offense under,it does not constitute an attempted offense of sexual assault under rule d.murrell,at emphasis added.d.just as this court has refused to read additional terms into a contract,we are obligated not to read additional language into the very specific statutory elements of legislation such as rule d simply to accomplish a desired result.see generally heller equitable life assurance society,cir in the absence of a clear,unequivocal and specific contractual requirement that the insured is obligated to undergo surgery to attempt to minimize his disability,we refuse to order the same.to hold otherwise and to impose such a requirement would,in effect,enlarge the terms of the policy beyond those clearly defined in the policy agreed to by the parties.jenkins heintz,cir we are obligated to apply the law as congress drafted it.we should not disregard plain statutory language in order to impose on the statute what we may consider a more reasonable meaning.an attempted offense of sexual assault as defined by rule d and inducement under are separate and distinct crimes,each requiring different elements of proof.
the majority,in an attempt to manufacture a substantial act,states that smith called a middle school student to his office and offered the boy to expose himself.see majority opinion at.in its attempt to have smith previous conviction fit within the parameters of rule d,the majority posits that undoubtedly,calling the minor to the dean office and telling him to expose himself for money evinces smith intent and substantial step toward sexual assault.however,the alleged unsubstantiated acts recounted above although most repugnant,were never presented to the magistrate judge as a basis for the motion in limine under review and are completely unrelated to smith conviction for indecent telephone solicitation of a child under ilcs a,and only serve to confuse the issue.smith motion in limine only concerned the introduction into evidence of smith conviction for indecent solicitation of a minor over the phone in violation of ilcs a and our review concerns only that conviction.any criminal activities that smith allegedly engaged in which are unrelated and not a part of his conviction under ilcs a for indecent solicitation of a minor have no bearing on whether that conviction const
