father and mother appeal the juvenile court april,order terminating parental rights in the minor,their daughter angel,and assumption of jurisdiction in this proceeding some years ago.based on events following the termination of parental rights order,respondent los angeles county department of children and family services concedes the minor is not adoptable and accordingly does not object to the order being reversed.however,respondent contends the portion of the appeal contesting the juvenile court subject matter jurisdiction should be dismissed for lack of an adequate record on appeal and in any case,the juvenile court properly exercised emergency jurisdiction in this proceeding and continues to have jurisdiction over the minor.we reverse the order terminating parental rights and hold the juvenile court properly assumed,and it continues to properly maintain,jurisdiction over the minor.
factual and procedural history 
the minor,then a little over two years of age,and her three siblings,ages six,four,and were detained in february,when father brought them to los angeles for a visit with their paternal grandmother.
father went on an errand,leaving the four children in the care of their grandmother,who was physically and mentally unable to care for herself.the grandmother was an outpatient at good samaritan hospital.two social workers from the hospital summoned the police when they made a routine visit to check on the grandmother and found the children in her charge.
according to the police report,the home was in a filthy and unsanitary condition that included a flea and fly infestation.the baby was crying with a saturated dirty diaper,and the older children were unfed and had defecated and urinated in their clothing.none of the children had language skills or knew their names.the two oldest children urinated in any location and did not know how to use a bathroom.the minor had a severe diaper rash with open wounds.
father returned to the home while the police were still present.he told the officers he believed the grandmother was an appropriate caretaker for the children,and he did not seem to understand the severity of the situation.he said he was visiting the grandmother because he had heard she was ill,but he had not realized she was senile.he was only in los angeles for a day to help the grandmother and see a doctor himself.he was unable to tell the police about the children mother.the officers took the children into protective custody.
father told the police officers he resided at an address on sandy via in baker,california.he also told a social worker for respondent that he lived in the desert in baker,california,giving the same sandy via address.he said there were no neighbors or telephones.mother telephoned the social worker from her place of work,a ranch in nevada.she identified herself but would not provide any information on the children,such as their birth dates,expressing a belief that the social worker was going to sell her children.she stated the children resided in nevada on a ranch and were well cared for.she denied the children had any speech problem.a relative told the social worker the parents lived out of a camper in the nevada desert and were transient.
respondent filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section an amended petition alleged under section,subdivision b,that the children were found to be in an unsanitary and unkempt condition,including filthy clothing saturated with urine that the minor suffered from severe diaper rash and the paternal grandmother had failed to obtain needed medical care for her that all of the children had special or unique problems,including developmental delays and that the parents had limited ability to deal with those problems.
the reports generated for both the detention hearing and the jurisdictional hearing showed that all four children had varying degrees of mental or social retardation and were delayed in their development.
the clerk transcript reflects that the parents were appointed counsel at the detention hearing,which took place in february.at the hearing,the court found a prima facie case for detaining the children and ordered respondent to contact nevada regarding an interstate compact on the placement of children icpc or some arrangement other than icpc.see,et.
for the dispositional hearing,respondent reported the social worker interviewed father telephonically.father stated he had driven all night to los angeles and the children had taken bottles before they left.he left his children with his mother to go to the store for an hour.he did not see fleas at his mother residence,and he was not planning to have the children stay overnight.he had arrived at and planned to return to nevada at.he said the children were clean when they left nevada,and they must have smelled of urine because of his mother cat.he also said the children did not answer to their names because he called them by other names.
in march,at the pretrial resolution conference,the parents entered no contest pleas and the juvenile court found allegations of the amended petition to be true.the court proceeded with the disposition,declared the children dependents of the court and ordered them suitably placed.both parents were ordered to participate in parent education and family counseling.respondent was ordered to contact nevada immediately for an icpc.the court further ordered respondent to contact a nevada judge judge smith and the mother employer and friend pastor lee.
in may,respondent informed the court in a progress report that its social worker had spoken with mother,a social worker from nevada division of children and family services,judge smith and pastor lee.respondent social worker had initiated an icpc with nevada,referred the children to the regional center and obtained copies of their psychological and developmental evaluations.respondent social worker learned from the nevada social worker that nevada was in a state of extreme financial crisis and there was no possibility of placing the children in a preexisting foster care home.the nevada worker said the icpc would enable the nevada department to evaluate the parents home and help the family obtain services for the children if they were to be returned home.he advised that the nevada agency could complete the home evaluation and licensing process if los angeles county could procure potential foster placements in nevada.
the nevada social worker indicated sandy valley,where the parents purportedly lived,is located partly in clark county,nevada,and partly in san bernardino county,california.he stated nevada department of children and family services was unable to provide services in sandy valley and could provide only limited family preservation services in las vegas.
respondent social worker also spoke with judge smith,who described sandy valley as a rural town consisting of a grocery store,two saloons,and a restaurant.there was no physician,but a county health nurse came out every three months.judge smith had known the family for some time before respondent involvement.the judge said the parents appeared to love their children as things,cuddly bears.she did not believe they had the ability to raise their children to functional adulthood.the judge stated she had contacted a facility in nevada to inquire about the children placement,but the facility was not available for children with such severe disabilities.
pastor lee raised with respondent social worker the possibility of finding community members who might be interested in becoming foster parents for the children.
respondent reported to the juvenile court that mother herself had been a regional center client in,when she was assessed as mentally retarded with an iq of.program services were terminated in at the request of mother father.
during the succeeding years,the court held periodic review hearings and,after numerous continuances,ultimately set a contested section hearing for september.at that time,the court found that although two and a half years had passed since the children detention,the parents had received no reunification services because they lived in nevada and nevada was unwilling to provide them services.the court admitted into evidence reports from respondent and father counsel,concluding the parents had been offered but not provided services because they lived in nevada and could not participate in services offered in california.the court found that the people and the government agencies in nevada would not supervise the case,would not take the children into nevada,and would not come up with a program to assist with services.the court noted that an icpc,though ordered,had not been possible for various reasons and the time for reunification services was extended as a result.a letter from the nevada child and family services division in evidence reported that neither parent expressed any awareness of the profound language deficits displayed by their two older children,whom the parents described as normal,pretty smart and very bright.both parents claimed their children had basic and toileting skills,and they had explained away the language deficits as shyness or discomfort around strangers.
a psychological evaluation of the parents ordered by the juvenile court concluded it would be a high risk situation for the children to be returned to the parents due to the children significant delays and special needs,which the parents did not seem to recognize.an addendum to the psychologist report stated reunification would not be in the best interest of the children because the parents would need highly specialized parenting instruction due to their low intellectual functioning and at times inappropriate social behavior.the report stated it would not be in the children best interests to refer them back to nevada as the services available in nevada did not match the current services the children were receiving in california.
the court found clear and convincing evidence the children were not likely to be adopted and ordered long term foster care for the children.
the next few years indicated renewed efforts by respondent to place the children in nevada with the court approval,temporary placements in nevada in june,and the eventual return of all of the children to california after those placements failed.during this period,the minor was diagnosed by one doctor as having a major depressive disorder with psychotic features and by a second doctor as having an obsessive compulsive disorder.she continued to be developmentally delayed and demonstrated escalating argumentative and confrontational social behavior.
in may,the minor was returned to california and placed in a home at the request of nevada social services department.the other children were returned to california in february,at the nevada agency insistence.the agency claimed the purpose of having the children placed in nevada was to reunify the children with their parents but,consistent with their past behavior of going through lengthy periods of having no contact with their children,the parents had not participated in the plan for a long time 
the court ultimately held a permanency planning hearing for the minor in april.by that time,the minor had been in placements since her initial detention.the court was advised that the most recent foster parent was committed to providing a permanent home for her through adoption,and respondent recommended termination of parental rights.both parents were present for the permanency planning hearing.counsel for father stated father was not in agreement with the plan of adoption,and counsel for mother expressed concern that the prospective adoptive mother had been ambivalent about adopting the minor.after questioning the prospective adoptive mother,the juvenile court found,by clear and convincing evidence,that the minor would be adopted and terminated parental rights.
father and mother timely appealed from the order terminating parental rights for the minor.
discussion 
the juvenile court properly assumed emergency and continuing jurisdiction over the children 
father and mother seek to set aside all orders of the juvenile court after the disposition hearing in february,contending that the juvenile court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to make any findings or orders beyond those necessary to address whether an emergency actually existed in february and to ensure the minor safety.in addition,they contend the juvenile court failed to contact the correspondent nevada court to determine whether it wished to exercise jurisdiction.
as a reviewing court,we are not bound by the juvenile court findings regarding subject matter jurisdiction but independently reweigh the jurisdictional facts.in re th,d.
the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,et,previously the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja former,et collectively,the uniform act,is the exclusive method of determining the proper forum for custody disputes involving other jurisdictions.the uniform act governs juvenile dependency proceedings as well as actions to terminate parental rights.in re nada th,d see also in re stephanie cal th,d.
as respondent notes,any error the court may have made in assuming jurisdiction occurred in march,when the court first made jurisdictional and dispositional orders.because the parents waited over years to challenge the juvenile court jurisdiction,the reporter transcript of oral proceedings dating from that time is no longer available the appellant has the burden of establishing error and,lacking an adequate record,a reviewing court will presume the evidence supports the judgment.kanner globe bottling d.we therefore assume the court found sufficient facts to assert jurisdiction over the children.we also assume the juvenile court found an emergency existed and the exercise of its jurisdiction was necessary to protect the children from actual or threatened mistreatment or abuse furthermore,both parents appeared,in person and through counsel,at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,and after having been advised of their rights,they signed a court ordered disposition case plan apparently without objection to the court assumption of jurisdiction over their children 
as the parents acknowledge,a california court can take temporary emergency jurisdiction over a child who is present in the state in order to protect the child from mistreatment or abuse.when the children were taken into custody in,former family code section,subdivision a,provided in pertinent part that a court of this state which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if t he child is physically present in this state and a the child has been abandoned or b it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise neglected or dependent.
present family code section,subdivision a similarly provides that a court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child,or a sibling,is subjected to,or threatened with,mistreatment or abuse.moreover,the legislature has provided,in family code section,subdivision b,that when,as here,there is no previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under the uccjea and a child custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under the uccjea,a child custody determination made under the section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under the uccjea.if a child custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under the uccjea,a child custody determination made under section,subdivision b,becomes a final determination,if it so provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.the legislature specifically declared its intent that the grounds on which a court may exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction be expanded and that they include those in existence under the uccja.id.subd.e.
we infer from this statutory scheme the legislature i
