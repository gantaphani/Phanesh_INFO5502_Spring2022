in february the illinois department of public aid,now known as the illinois department of healthcare and family services the department,filed a petition in the circuit court of adams county to establish everett warner respondent as the father of and respondent entered into an agreed judgment of parentage,and the court ordered him to pay child support.in october,in a separate proceeding,respondent parental rights were terminated.more than two years later in march respondent petitioned the circuit court to vacate the child support order.relying on section of the adoption act ilcs west,respondent argued that the termination of his parental rights had also ended his parental responsibilities,including the obligation to pay child support.the circuit court denied the petition,and respondent appealed.the appellate court reversed.d.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
debbie stover is the mother of,born december,and,born august.in february,the department petitioned the circuit court,on stover behalf,to establish respondent as the father of the two children,and to order him to pay child support.on march,the court entered a judgment of parentage,pursuant to the parties stipulation,finding that respondent was the father of and.the court ordered respondent to pay child support in the amount of per week.in september the department petitioned the court for a modification of the child support order.the petition,which alleged that the mother had custody of the children,claimed that there had been a significant change in circumstances since the initial child support order was entered.according to the department,there was a need for health insurance or some other means of providing for the children health care.the department asked that respondent be ordered to carry dependent health insurance and to pay any uninsured costs.on october,the court increased respondent support obligation to every two weeks.however,the court denied the department health insurance request due to the prohibitive cost to obtain such insurance for the dependents.the court added respondent agrees to the increase in the support obligation.
on october,in a separate proceeding in juvenile court,respondent and stover parental rights were terminated.the record in the case at bar contains no copies of the termination orders.
on february,respondent filed a pro se motion to end his child support obligation.in support of this motion,respondent noted that both his and stover parental rights had been terminated.at the hearing that followed,the department informed the court that respondent support payments were being used by the state to help pay for the children foster care.the department indicated it would oppose any motion to end respondent support obligation.according to the department,a parent obligation to support a child does not end with the termination of parental rights.that obligation would cease,the department asserted,only if the child were adopted.the circuit court continued respondent motion in order to allow him time to consult with an attorney.
respondent retained an attorney,and filed a petition to vacate the child support order.the petition was based on section of the adoption act,which provides that,after either a termination of parental rights or a judgment of adoption,the natural parents of a child sought to be adopted shall be relieved of all parental responsibility for the child.ilcs west.
on march,at a hearing on the petition,respondent and the department stipulated,in relevant part,that respondent had continued to pay child support of every two weeks even after his parental rights were terminated,the children had been in the custody and guardianship of the illinois department of children and family services dcfs since before the date of termination,and the state had received respondent child support payments since the date of termination.the circuit court took judicial notice of the juvenile court orders in cases ja and ja terminating respondent and stover parental rights,as well as the most recent order in those cases showing that the goal for the children remained adoption.
during the march hearing,respondent argued that,under section of the adoption act,he was relieved of all parental responsibility,including any obligation to pay child support.in response,the department argued that,under in re,the termination of parental rights does not effect a complete severance between a child and its natural parents.the parent still has a residual,common law duty to support the child,and this residual duty stands as an exception to section of the adoption act.according to the department,respondent in the case at bar retained a residual obligation to pay child support,even though his parental rights had been terminated.
on may,the circuit court entered an order denying respondent petition to vacate the child support order.the court stated 
pursuant to the clear language of in re,termination of the respondent parental rights did not extinguish his obligation to support his children,notwithstanding the language of ilcs,which was in effect at the time of the holding in in re 
respondent appealed,and the appellate court reversed.d.the appellate court held that,under section of the adoption act,a termination of parental rights ends all parental responsibility,including the obligation to pay child support.in reaching this decision,the court rejected the department arguments that section did not apply to the case at bar because neither nor was in the process of being adopted,and,alternatively even if section did apply,the termination of parental rights did not eliminate a natural parent common law,residual duty to support a child.with regard to the first argument,the appellate court acknowledged that section,by its terms,applies to the natural parents of a child sought to be adopted.d at,quoting ilcs west.the court also noted the department assertion that there was no evidence before the trial court suggesting that anyone was seeking to adopt or nevertheless,the appellate court concluded a fair reading of the statute includes situations where a child is available for adoption,whether or not someone is actively seeking to adopt that child,and where a child has been adopted.d at.the appellate court noted that respondent parental rights had been terminated and that the goal for and was adoption.according to the appellate court,and therefore were available for adoption,and section applied.
turning to the department alternative argument regarding the residual duty of support,the court pointed to,upon which the circuit court relied in concluding that respondent obligation to support his children survived the termination of his parental rights.the appellate court asserted that mentioning of the residual duty of support was part of a general discussion dealing with historical context.according to the appellate court,did not attempt to address the current viability of any residual duty of support.d at.the appellate court added that made no specific mention of section of the adoption act.
we allowed the department petition for leave to appeal.we also allowed the cook county public guardian to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the department.
before this court,the department advances the same two arguments it raised below.first,the department contends that section is inapplicable to the case at bar because neither nor is a child sought to be adopted ilcs west.alternatively,the department argues that even if section does apply,it does not eliminate a natural parent common law,residual duty of support,which survives a termination of parental rights.
to address the department first argument,we are required to construe section of the adoption act.our review is therefore de novo.in re detention of lieberman.the primary objective in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the intent of the legislature.harshman dephillips,lieberman,at.the most reliable indicator of the legislature intent is the language of the statute,which is given its plain,ordinary and popularly understood meaning.lieberman,at.we read the statute as a whole,considering all relevant parts.harshman,at.
section provides 
after either the entry of an order terminating parental rights or the entry of a judgment of adoption,the natural parents of a child sought to be adopted shall be relieved of all parental responsibility for such child and shall be deprived of all legal rights as respects the child,and the child shall be free from all obligations of maintenance and obedience as respects such natural parents.emphasis added.ilcs west.
according to its plain language,section applies to the natural parents of a child sought to be adopted.the term seek is defined as to make an attempt try.webster third new international dictionary.under this definition,a child sought to be adopted is one whom someone is attempting or trying to adopt.
section does not identify who may seek to adopt a child.this section could reasonably,although erroneously,be construed in isolation to mean that merely by making a child available for adoption the state seeks to have the child adopted.this is not the case.section of the adoption act provides that only individuals who meet certain requirements may institute an adoption proceeding.ilcs west.when section is read in conjunction with section,it is clear that the state can not seek the adoption of a child.
in the case at bar,there is no indication in the record that and who are and years old,respectively are now,or ever were,in the process of being adopted accordingly,under the plain meaning of the relevant statutory terms,neither of them is a child sought to be adopted ilcs west.
notwithstanding the foregoing,respondent argues that section should not be interpreted as applying only where the child is sought to be adopted.according to respondent,construing the statute in this manner would lead to an absurd result the statute would not apply to a child who is adopted and therefore no longer sought to be adopted.respondent appears to argue that,because of this absurd result,the sought to be adopted language should not apply after the entry of a judgment of adoption.according to respondent,this language also should not apply after the termination of parental rights.respondent argument,in essence,is that in construing section,we should ignore the sought to be adopted language.
section deals with the effect on parental rights and responsibilities of two distinct judicial actions an order terminating parental rights and a judgment of adoption.in the latter of these two the entry of a judgment of adoption the result is that the child is adopted.in such situations,where section applies after the entry of a judgment of adoption and the child is adopted,it would be illogical to limit the statute application to instances where the child is sought to be adopted.by definition,a child who is adopted can not simultaneously be sought to be adopted.the two terms cancel each other out.however,the same can not be said of an order terminating parental rights,which does not necessarily result in the adoption of the child.where the child is not adopted,there is no contradiction in terms as there is in the situation that would prevent the application of the sought to be adopted language.moreover,where the child is not adopted,there is a sound policy reason for limiting the termination of parental responsibilities to situations where the child is sought to be adopted.section contemplates that,once a prospective adoptive parent steps forward,the transition to an adoptive parent taking financial responsibility for the child can begin to take place.however,where no prospective adoptive parent has come forward,the termination of the natural parent support obligation would leave the child with only the state to look to for sustenance.by limiting the application of section to situations where the child is sought to be adopted,the general assembly clearly intended to avoid such a result.
we conclude that,after the entry of an order terminating parental rights,where the child is not adopted,section applies,as its plain language indicates,only where the child is sought to be adopted.conversely,after the entry of a judgment of adoption,where the child is adopted,the sought to be adopted language can not logically apply.in so holding,we adhere to the principle that a statute must be given a sensible construction,even though such construction qualifies the universality of its language.adams northern illinois gas,quoting in re illinois bell switching station litigation.we emphasize the limited scope of our interpretation.we are qualifying the reach of the sought to be adopted language,not eliminating it from the statute altogether.to hold that this language is of no effect,as respondent urges,would render the language superfluous or meaningless.such a construction is to be avoided,if possible.people ex rel.ryan agpro.
while respondent in the case at bar argues that the phrase sought to be adopted in section should simply be ignored,the appellate court below followed a different path to reach essentially the same conclusion.according to the appellate court,a fair reading of section includes situations where a child is available for adoption,whether or not someone is actively seeking to adopt that child.emphasis added.d at.in the appellate court view,and were available for adoption,and section therefore applied,regardless of whether and were sought to be adopted.we find this analysis unpersuasive.
we initially note that the phrase available for adoption does not appear in section.rather,the appellate court,without any citation to authority,construed the phrase sought to be adopted to include children available for adoption.the appellate court analysis ignores the fact that the phrase available for adoption has a precise meaning in the adoption act.see ilcs f west defining a person available for adoption.had the general assembly intended to include children available for adoption within the ambit of section,it could have specifically done so.it did not.we can not depart from the plain language of a statute by reading into it exceptions,limitations,or conditions not expressed by the legislature.in re michelle.
finally,we note respondent reference,in his appellee brief,to section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west.this provision was not raised by respondent in either the circuit court or the appellate court as the basis for his claim that the child support order should be vacated.respondent has therefore forfeited any argument based on section.see vine street clinic healthlink.in addition,before this court,respondent provides no argument with regard to section,nor does he explain how this provision relates to his claim.his reference to section in his brief consists solely of the quotation of the statute.without more,we are unable to review any contentions that might have been made with regard to this issue.h.we faced a similar situation in zaabel konetski,where the petitioner raised a point in his reply brief but offered no argument.in a unanimous opinion authored by justice garman,we held that the point therefore was waived.we noted that a forfeited issue may sometimes be addressed in the interest of justice,but stated i n this case the interest of justice does not require that we search for arguments that the petitioner himself has made no attempt whatsoever to provide.zaabel,at.
moreover,as previously noted,the record in this case contains no copies of the juvenile court orders terminating respondent and stover parental rights.it was the responsibility of respondent,as the appellant below,to present a sufficiently complete record to support a claim of error.webster hartman.the absence of the orders makes it difficult for us to discuss with any certainty the impact,if any,that section has on this case.under section,the termination of parental responsibility occurs in the context of the naming of a guardian.section provides that,in terminating parental rights,the juvenile court may authorize the guardian of the person of the minor to consent to adoption.an order so empowering the guardian to consent to adoption relieves the parents of all parental responsibility.ilcs west.in the case at bar,because the orders terminating parental rights are not in the record,we do not know if the juvenile court authorized the guardian to consent to adoption and thereby,under section,relieved the parents of all parental responsibility.under these circumstances,we can not determine if section is relevant to the instant case.thus,given respondent failure to properly raise the applicability of section below,his failure to properly brief the statute before this court,and his failure to provide a sufficient record,we decline to engage in discussion which,of necessity,would be mere speculation 
we express no opinion as to whether section could be considered in a case where the record contained support for the claim.we leave for another day the resolution of that question,when we are confronted with an appropriate case.
notwithstanding the foregoing,the dissent argues that section should have been included in our analysis,regardless of any forfeiture of the issue or deficiency in the record.according to the dissent,this provision of the juvenile court act is clearly relevant to construction of section of the adoption act.at.at,at kilbride,dissenting,joined by fitzgerald and karmeier,jj.we agree that the interpretation of section specifically,the sought to be adopted language is at the heart of this appeal.however,we find unpersuasive the dissent argument that section is essential to our analysis.
under section,as noted,the juvenile court,upon the satisfaction of certain conditions,may terminate parental rights and empower the guardian of the person of the minor,in the order appointing him or her as such guardian,to consent to the adoption.ilcs west.section provides further that a n order so empowering the guardian to consent to adoption deprives the parents of the minor of all legal rights as respects the minor and relieves them of all parental responsibility for him or her.ilcs west.in section,it is the order authorizing the guardian to consent to adoption that triggers the termination of parental responsibility.this contrasts with section of the adoption act,which provides that,after the entry of an order terminating parental rights,the natural parents of a child sought to be adopted shall be relieved of all parental responsibility for such child.emphasis added.ilcs west.here,the question of the termination of parental responsibility turns on whether the child is sought to be adopted.
in the case at bar,even if we were to consider section,as the dissent urges,the statute would provide no help in construing section.section simply has nothing to say about the interpretation of the term sought to be adopted in section for this reason,we reject the dissent contention that section should have been included in our analysis.
in sum,neither nor is a child sought to be adopted under section of the adoption act.contrary to the conclusion of the appellate court below,section does not apply to the situation in the case at bar.
because of our decision with regard to this issue,we need not address the department alternative argument that a natural parent common law,residual duty of support survives the termination of his parental rights.we recognize the importance of this issue.in addition,we acknowledge that there is disagreement within our appellate court on this question.compare bodine bodine,d,an adoption will not relinquish a natural parent obligation to support the child if the adoptive parent is unable to do so,with d at,a termination of parental rights ends all parental responsibility,including the obligation to pay child support.nevertheless,as we have already held,section of the adoption act does not apply to and.this decision disposes of the appeal in the case at bar.
the dissent takes a different view,arguing that section applies in this case and that,under section,respondent parental responsibilities ended with the termination of his parental rights.in support,the dissent points to in re adoption of syck,and in re,d.according to the dissent,these cases articulate a event that the termination of parental rights forever sever s all relations between parent and child.at.at,at kilbride,dissenting,joined by fitzgerald and karmeier,jj.the dissent notes that syck and were cited by respondent.at.at,at kilbride,dissenting,joined by fitzgerald and karmeier,jj.
there are three reasons why our analysis does not include syck and,which appear to support respondent claim that,under section,the termination of his parental rights ended his parental responsibilities as well.first,regardless of whether syck and support respondent position with regard to section,they are irrelevant to our opinion,which holds that section does not apply.a second,related reason for not incorporating these cases in our analysis is that,in his brief to this court,respondent cited syck and solely in opposition to the department alternative,residual duty of support argument,a claim which we expressly do not reach.under the department argument,a natural parent has a residual,common law duty of support which survives a termination of parental rights,and this residual obligation stands as an exception to section.see in re,observing that,w ith the exception of the biological parents residual duty to support their children citation adoption constitutes a complete and permanent severance of all legal and natural rights between such parents and children.syck and appear to contradict this contention.however,it is irrelevant whether syck and support or contradict this claim.as previously indicated,because of our holding that section does not apply to this case,it is unnecessary to address the department alternative argument regarding a residual duty exception to section.
a third reason why syck and are not incorporated in our analysis is that,while each of these opinions quotes section,neither deals with the central issue in the case at bar whether,under section,a termination of parental rights ends all parental responsibilities,including the duty to pay child support.in addition,neither syck nor expressly analyzes the sought to be adopted language in section.
for these reasons,syck and are not helpful in resolving the question of whether section applies to this case.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court,which reversed the judgment of the circuit court,and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.
appellate court judgment reversed circuit court judgment affirmed.
i respectfully dissent for two reasons.first,the majority narrow interpretation of section sought to be adopted language,as meaning exclusively the filing of a petition for adoption,creates untenable inconsistencies between section of the adoption act ilcs west,and section of the juvenile court act ilcs west,addressing parental obligations after the termination of parental rights.see in re,we consider the juvenile court act in concert with the adoption act.second,the majority holding is also inconsistent with prior judicial holdings on the effect of the termination of parental rights.the majority avoids these issues by inappropriately finding that warner procedurally forfeited the argument.a proper analysis of section requires the construction of sought to be adopted to include dcfs efforts to place and with an adoptive family.under a proper construction of the statute,warner duty of support to and ended with the order terminating his parental rights and dcfs setting a goal of an adoptive placement for the children.therefore,i disagree with the majority analysis and result.
to begin,section of the adoption act specifically mandates this act shall be construed in concert with the juvenile court act of.ilcs west.the majority construction of section of the adoption act conflicts with section of the juvenile court act.the majority acknowledges that we are required to read the statute as a whole,considering all relevant parts.at.at,at,quoting harshman dephillips.nevertheless,the majority ignores that section mandates that the adoption act be construed in concert with the juvenile court act and,instead,declines to address this argument because it contends that warner forfeited our review by raising pertinent sections of the juv
