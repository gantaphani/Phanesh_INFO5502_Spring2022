tiffany is the mother of,born in june.on september,was taken to the doctor with a swollen right thigh.was hospitalized with multiple rib fractures,fractures of the wrist,femur,feet,hands,and hip.the fractures were at different stages of healing and ranged from one to six weeks old.on september,the department filed a welfare and institutions code section petition,alleging serious physical harm,failure to protect,severe physical abuse of a child under five,cruelty,and abuse of sibling,subds.a,b,e,i and j.was put on hospital hold and her sister,born in july,was detained and placed in foster care.
was examined by brooke la duca,who found had mild osteopenia,which is a slight lack of bone density.however,this condition would not have caused many fractures,which were likely.did not appear to have osteogenesis imperfecta or any other bone disease that would have resulted in her injuries.even with bone breaks,babies do not always show bruising.genetic testing would need to be conducted to determine whether had osteogenesis imperfecta.did have closed lip schizencephaly,which was unrelated to child abuse,and meant that will likely be retarded and will need special care.
at the hospital,tiffany was interviewed.tiffany,who is,and father,jeremy,are not married.tiffany attends school mondays through thursdays.tiffany was living with her mother,older brother raymond years old,and her sisters michelle and monique years old.jeremy,who is,lives with his mother.monique has cerebral palsy,is blind in one eye,and can not walk.she crawls around the apartment.raymond does not like holding babies.when tiffany is not at home,whoever is around takes care of the children.tiffany told cynthia twiss,the case social worker csw that nobody in the family would hurt my kids,and there is no way that anyone else comes to my house and hurts my kids.tiffany denied that anyone in her home could have caused injuries.
when questioned by the csw concerning where she and her children slept,tiffany stated that she shares a bedroom with a bunk bed with her sisters,and sleeps on the floor.the csw questioned whether one of her sisters could have rolled on the baby or the sister with cerebral palsy could have accidentally crawled over the baby.tiffany denied this occurred.at the hospital,tiffany handled inappropriately,permitting her head to hang back over tiffany arm and bouncing her up and down.the csw informed tiffany of the correct way to hold her baby and advised her not to bounce tiffany seemed responsive,but did not seem to understand that she had to be more careful with a baby with broken bones.tiffany told the csw that had been colicky and whiny since birth.jeremy told the csw that he watched the babies when tiffany was at school.tiffany mother,donna,stated that monique could not have hurt the baby.neither parent had any explanation for how was injured.

the report for the jurisdictional hearing held october,indicated that the csw had visited tiffany home,karen home,and extensively interviewed tiffany and jeremy.tiffany stated that michele and monique shared a bottom bunk,while slept in a crib.tiffany slept by the door.jeremy slept near the bed,and slept next to him.sometimes would be next to the bunk bed.when visiting the home,the csw noticed that monique would roll out of the bed and land on the floor and crawl to the door.tiffany denied that anyone in the house would have hurt jeremy stated he would have noticed if someone had stepped on tixon,the director of the miller abuse and violence intervention center at long beach memorial hospital found that injuries were the result of gross child abuse.even with osteogenesis imperfecta,one would not see fractures like injuries.was placed in the foster home of zena 
at an ex parte hearing held october,the department advised the court it could not recommend placing with karen.instead,the department argued that needed to be placed in a medically fragile unit foster home.qualified as a medically fragile child because she had been diagnosed with closed lip schizencephaly,which could cause seizures,paralysis,developmental delay,and hydrocephalus.also had dual kidney malfunction.however,did not have osteogenesis imperfecta.furthermore,karen had a job,monday through friday,to karen day care provider did not have sufficient training to care for someone like e.at the adjudication hearing held january,the court ordered that would continue to be detained in shelter care.
at the hearing,the court took testimony.zena testified that she was licensed to care for medically fragile children.zena has taken to the doctor about times since came to her home in october.since has been living with zena,she has not sustained any further injuries.when came to live with zena,she could not hold her head up.now is very happy.has trouble making a fist with her right hand.
karen testified that she thought was a cry baby,because she cried too much.she one time,and did not observe any bruises on her body.when she visited at tiffany house and was holding her,would cry when karen shifted her from one position to another.she never saw tiffany hurt the child in any way.
patricia torres,the dependency investigator,testified that donna would not let her speak to monique.tiffany and jeremy told her conflicting stories about where they slept on the floor.tiffany and jeremy told her that monique never handled torres observed monique tumble out of the lower bunk bed,land on the floor,and crawl through the door to the living room.donna told torres that monique had cerebral palsy,was,and blind.torres suggested to the family members that monique might have caused the injuries to torres was told that somebody was always around,so that would not have been possible.
beverly wood testified that she reviewed.the fracture of right femur her right thigh bone was near the hip.the fracture was rotated and showed a large amount of new bone growth,making the break about five to seven weeks old.the large amount of new bone formation indicated that there was a great deal of motion which occurred at the site of the fracture following the fracture itself.wood opined that the fracture was.also had a fracture of the left femur which showed it was also a rotation injury.wood opined this fracture was about one and to two weeks old.rib fractures were about three weeks old.such fractures were commonly the result of shaking an infant.these fractures were also.her left arm fracture was acute,in that no healing had started,making it less than days old.this fracture was also caused by a twisting or pulling injury,and was.had a fracture of a bone in her fifth finger,which showed a bit of early healing,making it between days to two weeks old.her foot fracture was almost completely healed,making it more than a month old.such a fracture would have been caused by a squeeze to the foot or from striking the foot with an object.wood opined that bone density was normal for a child her age,with the exception of her right leg,which showed a lot of mineral resorption in the bone.such resorption results from not moving the leg,a normal response considering the pain the child was probably in.
a large amount of force would have to be applied to cause these fractures.infants have very flexible ribs and the ribs can be deformed a lot before they break.wood did not think it likely that most of the fractures were caused by being stepped on.infants that have osteogenesis imperfecta are usually born with fractures they sustain in utero,and their bones appear very deformed at birth.they have blue sclera,but blue sclera are present in most old infants.osteopenia generally is not a term applied to children it is demineralization of the bone,as in women.has osteoporosis of the right leg as a result of the fracture.the leg fractures could cause deformity and loss of blood supply at the top of the bone,which could result in arthritis.

respondents argued that subsection e contained a mens rea element,and the department had not met its burden of proving the child was being abused,or that the parents reasonably should have known someone else was abusing e.they argued the department implied attempt to rely on the presumption of section,subdivision a that injuries that ordinarily would not be sustained except as the result of abuse may be prima facie evidence to bring the child within section,subdivisions a,b and d was misplaced,because the statutory language specifically excluded subdivision e.thus,the issue was whether the department had established the injuries were caused and the identity of the perpetrator,and the evidence before the court was insufficient to support such an inference.
the department countered that the identity of the person who caused injuries need not be established,relying on in re christina d.the department also argued that it need not show intent to harm the child,relying on in re jeannie d.the department pointed out that in the instant case,because the parents were always present,it was reasonable to assume that the parents committed the abuse themselves or were aware of its infliction upon the child.
the court found that the evidence did not establish who injured the child.however,the court was convinced that the injuries were intentionally inflicted and were caused by someone in the household,but the court found there was no evidence that anyone knew that anything was happening to e.the court sustained the petition as to section,subdivisions a,b and j,but dismissed the allegations under section,subdivisions i and j.tiffany and jeremy were ordered to participate in counseling,and a parenting course through regional center with an emphasis on special needs children.
discussion 
the department contends the dependency court erred in dismissing the allegation made pursuant to section,subdivision e because there was no identified perpetrator.the department argues that on the contrary,the plain language of subdivision e does not require that the identity of the perpetrator be known where the abuse is caused by a parent it is only where the abuse is caused by someone other than a parent that the parent must know or reasonably should have known the person was abusing the minor.see in re joshua th,d.respondents argue that under subsection e,the department must establish that the parents had actual knowledge was being abused and that some person was committing the abuse.it is insufficient to merely establish the fact of the abuse.here,the parents had no idea was being abused,much less by whom.
section,subdivision e provides that the court has jurisdiction where t he child is under the age of five and has suffered severe physical abuse by a parent,or by any person known by the parent,if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was physically abusing the child.for the purposes of this subdivision,severe physical abuse means any of the following any single act of abuse which causes physic
