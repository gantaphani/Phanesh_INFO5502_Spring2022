a contested hearing was held on september.cfs had not interviewed in preparing its detention report or its report several attempts by the social worker to contact him were unsuccessful.nevertheless,the evidence considered at the hearing included statement of parentage,which he filed august.disputed claim to have been in.life since birth,calling it an outright lie.he asserted that he is the father of,and,and claimed that even while incarcerated he could have arranged for the care of the children with members of his immediate family,if he had known there was anything amiss.claimed that he had solely supported.and from birth until he was incarcerated,and that since then he had helped with clothing,school supplies,birthday gifts,food,as well as supervision by his mother,the children paternal grandmother as needed,for all three children.
was transported from prison to appear at the jurisdictional hearing.he testified that mother had told him he was.father when she became pregnant that he accompanied her to prenatal appointments,and was at the hospital when.was born and that he was listed as the father on.birth certificate.had lived with.from the child birth until early,when he was incarcerated.since then,and the children had communicated primarily though mail and phone calls.had written to most recently about a year before,and visited him in prison once,in.
at the jurisdictional hearing,testified that so far as he knew,he was.biological father.during her pregnancy with,mother told him that he could possibly be.father,but she was certain.had held.out as his son to his entire family,as well as to others outside of the family,such as teachers.never asked for a paternity test,and did not ask for one in these proceedings,because,in my mind,he is my son.he testified that it does matter whether.is his biological child as far as i concerned,he has been in my life for years.that my son.according to.refers to him as dad,and to his parents as grandma and grandpa.
did not know mother had been married to or living with until after was incarcerated.during her pregnancy with,and for the first three years of.life,mother apparently lied to about her whereabouts,telling him that she had moved to live with her father in oregon,when in fact she was living with in the san bernardino area.when.was born,was out of state for work,but mother called him that morning to let him know about the birth.he met.within the first month of his life.over the next few years,would visit with.from time to time whenever she said she would come down and visit from oregon,she would call me up and let me know she was around,and she would drop him off 
neither nor mother ever sought the involvement of the courts to establish paternity or set the terms of child support.and mother got along,and just told her whatever he needs to let me know.sent clothes,medicine,and money to oregon for mother and.until she said that she finally moved back while she was pregnant with,which was in.recalled that he threw a big party at his parents house for.third birthday,in,and pretty much after that.was coming around a lot.tried to have.over as much as he could when had to work,his wife,whom he described as a mother,would take care of him at their house.by or.would regularly spend weekends,holidays,and school breaks in household.

in accord with the recommendations of cfs,the juvenile court struck all petition allegations asserted against.it modified the allegations against the other parents,and sustained them as modified,finding among other things that,and.each fell within section,subdivisions a,b,and g.as relevant to the present appeal,the juvenile court sustained subdivision g allegations with respect to as amended to allege only that he is incarcerated,and dismissed the other allegations asserted in the initial petitions with respect to him.
the juvenile court did not immediately rule with respect to disposition,instead setting a further hearing so that icwa noticing could be completed.at the hearing on september,claimed possible apache ancestry.cfs therefore sent notices to various apache and sioux tribes.at the continued hearing regarding disposition,on october,clarified that t he tribe is actually two.it navajo and it tewa,but they from new mexico.my grandfather on my paternal side is an active member of the tribe and on the council.

ii.discussion 
jurisdictional findings with respect to 
has conceded that the juvenile court exercise of jurisdiction over the children was proper,challenging only one of the juvenile court several jurisdictional findings,specifically,its finding that,and come within section,subdivision g,because was incarcerated and unable to care and provide for them.the general rule is that the juvenile court exercise of jurisdiction over a child will be upheld if substantial evidence supports any one of the statutory bases for jurisdiction enumerated in the petition.in re th.the juvenile court various jurisdictional findings with respect to mother are not challenged in this appeal,and are independently sufficient to justify the juvenile court exercise of jurisdiction over,and see,in re ashley th,a s long as there is one unassailable jurisdictional finding,it is immaterial that another might be inappropriate.nevertheless,we exercise our discretion to reach the merits of arguments,because the challenged jurisdictional basis is the only one asserted against him,and the juvenile court true findings could conceivably have consequences for him beyond jurisdiction.in re th.
contends that no substantial evidence supports the trial court jurisdictional findings with respect to him under section,subdivision g.we agree.
at the jurisdictional hearing,the court determines whether the minor falls within any of the categories specified in section.citation.the petitioner in a dependency proceeding must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child comes under the juvenile court jurisdiction.citation.on appeal from an order making jurisdictional findings,we must uphold the court findings unless,after reviewing the entire record and resolving all conflicts in favor of the respondent and drawing all reasonable inferences in support of the judgment,we determine there is no substantial evidence to support the findings.citation.substantial evidence is evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value.citation.in re veronica th.
a parent incarceration may provide a basis for dependency jurisdiction under section,subdivision g,but only if that parent can not arrange for the care of the child.welf.inst.code,subd.g.there is no go to jail,lose your child rule in california.in re th.s ection,subdivision g applies when,at the time of the jurisdictional hearing,a parent has been incarcerated and does not know how to make,or is physically or mentally incapable of making,preparations or plans for the care of his or her child.in re aaron d.put another way,neither incarceration alone nor the failure to make an appropriate advance plan for the child ongoing care and supervision is sufficient to permit the exercise of jurisdiction under subdivision g.in re andrew th.moreover,n othing in section,subdivision g even requires an incarcerated parent to prove affirmatively the suitability of his or her caretaking arrangements.it requires only that he or she be able to make the arrangements.in re,supra,at.
there is no question that was incarcerated at the time of the jurisdictional hearing,as he had been since.there is no substantial evidence in the record,however,to support the conclusion that he does not know how to make,or is physically or mentally incapable of making,preparations or plans for the care of his children in re aaron,supra,d at.cfs never interviewed to determine what sort of arrangements he could make for the children.the burden of proof was on cfs to show could not arrange for.care,and he might have prevailed without making any factual showing at all.in re,supra,th at.nevertheless,affirmatively asserted his ability to make arrangements for their care with immediate family the record suggests that perhaps he had in mind his own mother,whom he indicated had previously provided some assistance in caring for the children,and who was in attendance at the dependency proceedings or perhaps his former,the maternal grandmother with whom cfs initially placed the children,and with whom and and their younger half siblings continued to be placed after they were found to be dependents of the court.moreover,although had not been able to physically care for the children since his incarceration,there was some evidence that he took an interest in them,and attempted to provide for them to some degree from prison.in re james th,upholding jurisdiction under,subd.g,finding lack of evidence incarcerated father ever showed interest in or attempted to care for children sufficient to infer that he was unable or unwilling to arrange for care.
because cfs presented no evidence that could not arrange care while he was incarcerated it failed to satisfy its burden of proof to establish jurisdiction based on his incarceration and his inability to arrange for the children care.in re andrew,supra,th at.we will therefore reverse the trial court true finding with respect to the exercise of jurisdiction under section,subdivision g based on incarceration and inability to arrange for the children care,while affirming the juvenile court exercise of jurisdiction over the children on other bases.
b.the juvenile court did not err in ruling to be a presumed father of.
contends that the trial court erred in finding to be a presumed father.he asserts,among other things,that the relationship between and.was that of a close family friend,not a father.we disagree,and find no error substantial evidence supports the juvenile court conclusions that a relationship developed between and,and that it would be detrimental to.if only were to be recognized as his presumed father.
presumed father status is governed by family code section,which sets out several rebuttable presumptions under which a man may qualify for this status,generally by marrying or attempting to marry the child mother or by publicly acknowledging paternity and receiving the child into his home.citations.biological fatherhood does not,in and of itself,qualify a man for presumed father status under section.on the contrary,presumed father status is based on the familial relationship between the man and child,rather than any biological connection.in re th,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in th.as relevant to the present case,family code section,subdivision d applies where the parent receives the child into his or her home and openly holds out the child as his or her natural child.
while the juvenile court may consider a wide range of factors in making a presumed parent determination,as appropriate to the circumstances see,in re th,the core issues are the person established relationship with and demonstrated commitment to the child.martinez vaziri th.in considering a challenge to a juvenile court finding regarding presumed father status,we apply the substantial evidence test,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving conflicts in the evidence in favor of the trial court ruling,and refraining from any reweighing of the evidence.in re th.
it used to be that a child could have only one presumed father,even if more than one individual might fulfill the statutory criteria.in re,supra,th at.in,however,the legislature amended family code section to permit the court to declare more than one presumed parent if it concludes recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child.fam.code,subd.c.in determining detriment to the child,the court shall consider all relevant factors,including,but not limited to,the harm of removing the child from a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.fam.code,subd.c.we review the juvenile court finding of detriment within the meaning of family code section,subdivision c for substantial evidence.in re donovan,th.
substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that meets the statutory criteria of a presumed father.testified that mother had told him that he could be the biological father of,that he had always viewed.as his son,and that he had always held him out as such to others.although.primarily lived with mother before april,received him into his home and his family as often as he could.particularly after was incarcerated in,the visits grew more extended,eventually encompassing entire summer breaks,in addition to numerous weekends and other shorter visits.there was evidence.had been cared for in household some of the time,and treated as part of the family not only by,but also his wife and extended family,since he was six months old.not only did view.as his son.also viewed as his father.in short,substantial evidence in the record supports the conclusion had an established relationship with,and a demonstrated commitment to him,so as to satisfy the requirements for being a presumed parent.
in arguing for the contrary conclusion,roland asserts that the chronology of relationship with mother verifies that could not be.biological father.as counsel for.aptly puts it in a respondent brief in this appeal,such paternity arguments may be a little naïve no doubt,the chronology establishes that mother was living with when.was conceived,and that the dating relationship between and mother was over by that time.nevertheless,it is reasonable to infer that had some cause to believe mother when she told him while she was pregnant with.that he could be the child biological father.as has been noted in a related context,the pattern of human relations is sometimes complicated.in re,supra,th at.
moreover,presumed parent status is based on the familial relationship between the man and child,rather than any biological connection.in re,supra,th at.in this case,no paternity testing has been performed to determine whether,or some other man is the biological father of.but even if paternity testing were to exclude the possibility that is.biological father,it would not negate the substantial evidence of demonstrated commitment to.and the established relationship between them,on which the juvenile court properly based its determination that should be deemed a presumed parent of.martinez vaziri,supra,th at.
suggests that the circumstance that.did not live with and his family full time until relatively recently means that family code section,subdivision d could not apply.not so.it is not the living arrangements,but the relationship between the child and the adult that is the primary factor in determining whether the adult should be deemed a presumed parent.for example,in th,the court of appeal affirmed a presumed parent finding in favor of a biological father who lived out of state,but who had received the child into his home on a regular basis to provide her paternal love and care,and who had held the child out as his daughter.id.at.similarly,here,the relationship between and.was developed primarily through visits,rather than.living with full time,but there is abundant evidence that had received.into his home on a regular basis for years increasingly often,and for longer periods of time to provide him with paternal love and care,and that he held him out as his son in all respects.that is sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements of family code section,subdivision d.
further argues that he is entitled to a conclusive marital presumption that he is parent under family code section,and that this defeat s claim to be a presumed parent under family code section,subdivision d.this argument fails in two respects family code section does not apply to the facts of the present case,and even if it did,it would not defeat claim to be a presumed parent of the child.
first,family code section provides that,subject to an exception not applicable here,the child of a wife cohabitating with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.fam.code.this statute applies,however,when the child was not only born during an existing marriage,but also conceived during the marriage.michael giovanna th,and mother married in march,several months after.was conceived.therefore is not entitled to the conclusive presumption of parentage provided by family code section.
second,the circumstance that is a presumed parent of.whether under family code section,as he proposes,or under family code section,subdivisions a and d,which is more likely the correct analysis does not render the court decision to deem a presumed parent erroneous.as noted,since,california law has permitted the court to declare more than one presumed father if it concludes recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child.fam.code,subd.c.under current law,status as a presumed father of.which has not been challenged by any party to this appeal does not defeat claim to be a presumed parent of.any more than status defeats they are simply both presumed parents of the child.
in re donovan,supra,th,relied on by,does not require a different result.in that case,the court of appeal ruled that the juvenile court erred by applying family code section,subdivision c in an attempt to promote a relationship between a third putative parent the biological father and a child,where the relationship did not yet exist.in re donovan,supra,at.looking to legislative history and statutory language,the court of appeal found that the statute was intended to preserve an existing,rather than potential,relationship between a putative third parent and the child.id.at.because the trial court determined there was no existing relationship with the child,no substantial evidence supported a finding of detriment under family code section,subdivision c.in re donovan,supra,at 
the existing,relationship between and.is fundamentally different from the potential relationship at issue in in re donovan for the reasons discussed above,the juvenile court ruling here falls squarely within the purposes of the statute,including to preserve a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.fam.code,subd.c.the juvenile court ruling does not require a finding of unfitness of or mother.ibid.nevertheless,its ruling regarding.best interests is also supported by the circumstance that can provide,as puts it in his briefing,a more ordered life than mother or have been able to provide.
there is an ample support in the record for the juvenile court conclusion that to recognize only and mother as.parents would be detrimental to,and its decision to designate both and as presumed fathers on that basis.we will not disturb the trial court ruling.
fails to demonstrate any abuse of discretion regarding the juvenile court custody or visitation orders 
objects to the juvenile court orders,upon termination of its dependency jurisdiction over,awarding full legal and physical custody,and allowing one hour of supervised visitation per month,beginning once he is released from custody.we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court orders.
we normally review the juvenile court decision to terminate dependency jurisdiction and to issue a custody or exit order pursuant to section for abuse of discretion citation and may not disturb the order unless the court exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd determination citations.bridget superior court th.
there is nothing arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd in the trial court determination that should have full legal and physical custody of.mother suffers from drug addiction had abandoned the children with the maternal grandmother and just took off had engaged in domestic violence with her boyfriend and had failed to protect the children from physical violence at the hands of her boyfriend.was in prison serving a sentence for attempted murder,had last been a parent of.in,and had only minimal contact with.since then.in contrast,the record strongly supports the conclusion that has accepted.as his son,and regularly provided paternal love and care since the child was an infant,even though.only came to live with him full time relatively recently,and even though they may or may not share a biological connection.as the juvenile court found,is ready and willing to provide stability and unconditional love in a home for.the trial court conclusion that it would be in.best interests for to have full legal and physical custody was hardly a stretch,let alone beyond the bounds of reason.
arguments in support of the contrary conclusion rest in part on the premise that is neither.biological nor his presumed father.this premise is not supported by the record.has not been excluded as the possible biological father of,but even if he had been,that circumstance would have no bearing on the propriety of the juvenile court custody and visitation orders.and,for the reasons discussed above,was properly designated as a presumed father of.
asserts that the trial court erroneous jurisdictional findings with respect to him,which we discussed above,are partly responsible for the trial court decisions regarding custody and visitation of.they are not.there is nothing in the record to suggest that,in making its custody and visitation orders,the juvenile court gave any particular weight to the technicality of whether or not.fell within section,subdivision g.the record does suggest that the court properly gave weight to,among other things,the undisputed fact that had been incarcerated for many years,and had only a limited relationship with.as a result.we find no reasonable doubt that if we were to remand the matter for reconsideration of the custody and visitation orders in light of our ruling on its jurisdictional findings,the juvenile court would reach the same conclusions it did the first time around.
notes that the juvenile court orders do not account for sibling visitation.there is no requirement,however,for the juvenile court to include such matters in its exit orders,even though of course it has the authority to do so,if it deems it necessary.see,subd a juvenile court has the authority to develop a visitation plan.there is no indication in the record that and the maternal grandmother who has custody of.siblings are not willing or able to arrange visitation between the siblings without court intervention,and no party asked the juvenile court to include specific orders on the issue.observation that the exit orders do not explicitly provide for sibling visitation does not demonstrate any error.
also complains about the substantial showing of changed circumstances he will have to make in order to convince the family court to modify the custody and visitation orders put in place by the juvenile court,in re michael th.nothing about the burden of obtaining modifications to the juvenile court orders from the family court,however,demonstrates that the orders are themselves erroneous.
because fails to demonstrate that the juvenile court exit orders are arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd,they will be affirmed.
mother and fail to demonstrate any reversible error based on icwa compliance.
both mother and challenge the adequacy of the efforts made to comply with the notice requirements of icwa mother raises this issue only with respect to,while raises it with respect to,and neither mother or,however,demonstrate any reversible error.
icwa notice is required to be sent whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved in a child custody proceeding within the meaning of icwa,which includes a proceeding for temporary or foster care or guardianship placement,termination of parental rights,placement after termination of parental rights,or adoptive placement,subd.d,subd.a,a.in such cases,notice must be sent to all federally recognized tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership.cal.rules of court,rule b.however,b y its own terms,icwa requires notice only when child welfare authorities seek permanent foster care or termination of parental rights it does not require notice anytime a child of possible or actual native american descent is involved in a dependency proceeding.in re alexis th,see also in re th,finding that icwa does not apply to a proceeding to place an indian child with a parent.
juvenile courts and child protective agencies have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a dependent child is or may be an indian child.in re th,see cal.rules of court,rule.t
