introduction 
we are called upon to consider whether a claimed biological father of a child born within days of the mother divorce from another man has standing under family code section to declare his paternity of that child the child was conceived while the mother was married but separated from her husband,was born after the mother divorce,and is being raised by the mother and,along with their two other children.the claimed biological father contends that applying the statutory paternity presumptions and standing requirements to deprive him of the opportunity to establish his paternity would violate a liberty interest protected by the united states constitution.
we conclude that california statutory presumptions and standing rules do not violate the biological father constitutional rights where the biological father has no existing relationship with the child.accordingly,we grant the mother writ petition and direct the trial court to grant her motion to quash the paternity action.
procedural and factual background 
lisa,the petitioner here,and guy were married in october by,they had two sons.in,while she was separated from guy,lisa became pregnant with dane.dane was born in may,almost six months after lisa divorce from guy.dane was given guy surname.in november,real party in interest phillip,who has never been married to lisa,filed a petition against her to declare his paternity of dane.phillip asked for rulings on child support,visitation,joint custody,attorneys fees,and that dane last name be changed to phillip surname.
in his supporting declaration,phillip stated the following he met lisa in september,they developed a romantic relationship,and she became pregnant in august he and lisa talked about becoming a blended family,but their relationship disintegrated lisa did not advise him when she gave birth in may he learned of the birth by calling the hospital,and did not have an opportunity to sign a declaration of paternity a month after dane birth,he gave lisa a letter stating he wanted a relationship with the child and would pay for dane insurance and support.
lisa moved to quash the paternity petition,contending only a statutorily presumed father has standing to bring an action to declare his paternity and that phillip did not qualify as a presumed father.lisa argued her guy was the only presumed father because dane was conceived during her marriage to guy and born within days of her divorce from period specified by the family code.
in support of the motion,lisa provided her declaration and that of two other persons.lisa declaration stated the following dane was conceived while she and her husband guy were still married she and guy have two other young sons she and guy were divorced on october,her relationship with phillip started during her separation from guy,it ended in june,and she and phillip were apart during the summer of phillip never volunteered to provide any type of emotional or financial support during her pregnancy or after dane was born except for a couple of short visits at her mother home in may and june,phillip made no efforts to visit dane or inquire about him phillip actively ignored her when they encountered each other on several occasions during the pregnancy,and he ignored lisa and dane during encounters after dane birth phillip never executed or asked her to execute a declaration establishing paternity she and her children,including dane,are supported by guy and her father she and her children,including dane,regularly visit and stay with guy at his home,and together they function as a attending parties,sporting events,social gatherings,and other events,as well as planning holidays and vacations guy has brought dane into his home and regularly takes care of him and dane last name is guy family name,which is listed in a variety of school,medical,and financial records.
the declarations filed by lisa friends stated they have consistently seen guy care for and support lisa and dane,and have seen dane baby things in every room of guy house,which one of the friends referred to as guy and lisa house.
the trial court denied lisa motion to quash.the court found denying phillip standing to establish paternity would violate his constitutional right to due process.the court also granted phillip request that lisa and dane undergo genetic testing.
lisa filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the denial of her motion to quash and asked for a stay of all proceedings,including the order requiring genetic testing.we stayed the proceedings and the testing,and issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
the threshold issue in this case is whether the family code grants phillip,the claimed biological father,standing to pursue his paternity action against lisa.if not,then we must decide whether applying the statutory paternity presumptions and standing requirements would violate a liberty interest protected by the federal constitution due process clause.
phillip has no standing under section.
section,part of the uniform parentage act,lists those persons who have standing to file an action to determine paternity.subdivision a provides,in relevant part,a child,the child natural mother,or a man presumed to be the child father under subdivision a,b,or c of section,may bring an action a t any time for the purpose of declaring the existence of the father and child relationship presumed under subdivision a,b,or c of section.subdivision b provides,any interested party may bring an action at any time for the purpose of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship presumed under subdivision d or f of section.thus,the essential inquiry in determining a man standing under section is whether he is a presumed father under the applicable subdivision of section.
section lists the conditions under which a man will be considered the presumed father of a child.only subdivisions a and d are potentially relevant here.under subdivision a,a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if h e and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage,or within days after the marriage is terminated by death,annulment,declaration of invalidity,or divorce,or after a judgment of separation is entered by a court.under subdivision d,a man is presumed to be the natural father if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
the presumptions arising under section are rebuttable presumptions affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action by clear and convincing evidence.citation.the uniform parentage act,however,restricts standing to challenge the presumption of a husband paternity to the child,the child natural mother,or a presumed father.citations.footnote reads in part as follows s ection,subdivision a,grants standing only to the child,the child mother,or a man presumed to be the child father as a result of his marriage to the child mother to bring an action to declare the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship presumed as a result of the mother marriage to the presumed father section,subdivision b,by contrast,allows a ny interested party to bring an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship presumed under subdivision d of section dawn superior court cal th,d,dawn,italics omitted.
the paternity presumptions are generated by society interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concerns for the welfare of the child.the state has an interest in preserving and protecting the developed relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability.in re nicholas cal th,d,quoting steven matthew th,d see also susan jack th,d applying the statutory presumption furthers the state interest in preserving the familial relationship between the child and the presumed father.these relationships are not always founded in biological reality.
it is clear in this case that phillip has no standing under the foregoing statutes because he does not qualify as a presumed father.indeed,phillip does not attempt to argue he is a presumed father.he was never married to lisa,he never received dane into his home,and he never held dane out to the world as his natural child.in contrast,it is guy who qualifies as the presumed father under subdivisions a and d of section because guy was married to lisa when dane was conceived,dane was born within days of their divorce,and guy has received dane into his home and has held him out to the world as his natural son.accordingly,because phillip is not a presumed father,his claimed biological link is insufficient to give him statutory standing to establish his paternity.
phillip has no protected liberty interest that overcomes the family code standing and presumption statutes.
acknowledging he does not qualify as a presumed father under section,and therefore has no standing under section,phillip argues his right to establish his paternity is a liberty interest protected by the due process clause of our federal constitution.specifically,phillip contends sections and are invalid as applied to him because dane was conceived while lisa was separated from guy,was born after their divorce,and is not being raised in a subsisting marital family.we conclude that these facts,although largely undisputed,are insufficient to invalidate the substantive paternity laws and the purposes they serve.
the overarching consideration in deciding if due process precludes the application of paternity laws in a given situation is whether an existing relationship between the unwed biological father and the child will be affected.brian ginger th,d brian.
the leading california exposition of the rule is found in dawn,supra,cal th,d.as the similarities and differences between the present controversy and dawn are important,we review the familial relationships in dawn in some detail.in january,dawn separated from her husband frank and began living with jerry.according to jerry,dawn told him she would marry him as soon as she legally could and that she wanted to start a family.jerry began building an addition to his home in anticipation of having a child,and submitted to fertility testing at dawn request.after she became pregnant,dawn told people the baby was jerry and that she intended to marry him.id.at,d.chin.in april,however,dawn moved back with her husband.that august,jerry filed an action to establish his paternity to the child after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a child support and visitation agreement with dawn and frank.jerry also completed a parenting course.in november,dawn gave birth to a son,who lived with dawn and frank.id.at,d.
dawn moved for judgment on pleadings,contending that jerry had no standing to establish paternity under section.the trial court denied the motion,finding that,because jerry had done all he could to demonstrate a commitment to his parental responsibilities,he had established due process rights that must be balanced against the state interest in enforcing frank statutory presumption.dawn,supra,cal th at,d.after the court of appeal denied a writ of mandate,our supreme court reversed and ordered that judgment be entered in dawn favor.
the supreme court held that a biological father mere desire to establish a personal relationship with the child is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.dawn,supra,cal th at,d.focusing on whether there was an existing relationship between jerry and the child,rather than simply a desire to form a relationship,the court held jerry did not have a constitutionally protected interest in creating a relationship with the child where none existed,and that application of sections and did not deprive him of due process.jerry claim failed because jerry has never had any personal relationship with dawn child,only an alleged biological link with an attempt to negotiate an agreement for child support and visitation.ibid.in other words,because jerry had not actually received the child into his home or developed a personal relationship beyond their biological connection,jerry had no constitutional liberty interest in establishing his paternity.jerry intent and dawn promises were essentially irrelevant.
our supreme court relied significantly on the united states supreme court decision in michael gerald,d michael.michael involved a series of events,including a more developed relationship between the biological father and the child than existed in either dawn or is present here.there,carole began an affair with michael while married and living with gerald.the child was born into the marriage,but carole and gerald separated five months later.carole and michael confirmed the child was theirs by blood tests and then lived together for two months,during which time michael held the child out as his own.carole then left michael and began living with another man.some months later,michael filed an action to establish paternity and rights to visitation.for eight months while the action was pending,carole and michael lived together and michael held the child out as his own.carole and michael even executed a stipulation stating michael was the natural father.before the stipulation was filed,however,carole reconciled with gerald and continued to live together with him,the child,and two other children born during the marriage.id.at.
a plurality of the united states supreme court concluded michael did not have a liberty interest in continuing his relationship with the child,notwithstanding that he had lived with carole and the child for a period of time and held the child out as his own.michael,supra,at.manifestly,those four justices necessarily rejected as well the position a biological connection without any actual personal relationship gives rise to a protected liberty interest.dawn,supra,cal th at,d.although three dissenting justices concluded the actual personal relationship between the biological father and the child was a protected liberty interest,those three acknowledged a biological connection alone was not sufficient.thus,seven of the nine justices agreed that an unwed father biological link to a child alone did not give rise to a constitutionally protected liberty interest a lthough an unwed father biological link to his child does not,in and of itself,guarantee him a constitutional stake in his relationship with that child,such a link combined with a substantial relationship will do so.michael at,fn.dis.op.of brennan,joined by marshall,blackmun,see also dawn,supra,cal th at,d.
it was the concurrence of views in the michael opinions on this issue that caused our supreme court in dawn to conclude that the question of whether a biological father without an existing personal relationship with a child has a protected liberty interest has a ready answer citing michael dawn,supra,cal th at,d.and the answer was that a father in that situation had no such liberty interest.ibid.we now apply these principles to the case before us.
here,phillip only link to dane is his contention that he is the biological father.phillip has no relationship with dane.and,other than his letter offering to provide dane with insurance and support which lisa denies receiving and two short visits with him between may and june,phillip made no substantial efforts to establish a relationship with dane or provide for his or lisa support.contrary to phillip assertion that he nonetheless has a constitutional liberty interest in the opportunity to develop a relationship with dane,this was precisely the test proposed by the dissent in dawn and specifically rejected by the majority of that court.dawn,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d,dis.op.of chin,
phillip cites several cases for the proposition that a biological father has a constitutional right to establish paternity where the mother marriage to the presumed father terminated shortly after the child was born.he contends under the circumstances of this case,where dane was born after lisa and guy divorce,that the paternity presumptions do not further the state interest in the sanctity of marriage.he points out that in neither dawn.nor michael did the mother and presumed father divorce.careful analysis of phillip authorities reveals they are not helpful.
the first of the three is in re lisa cal d,lisa.there,the juvenile court ruled that under former parentage statutes,the biological father had no standing to participate in juvenile dependency proceedings.by the time the trial court made its ruling,the marital father and the mother,both of whom had a history of substance abuse,had died.the child was in foster care.the biological father and mother had lived together both before and after lisa was born.the biological father was named in the birth certificate and had contributed to support.only when the mother had returned to live with the marital father and had taken lisa with her was the biological father deprived of custody.when he eventually learned of juvenile dependency proceedings,the biological father appeared at a scheduled hearing and sought to introduce evidence of his paternity.the juvenile court refused.
the supreme court held that a presumption which prevented the claimed biological father from offering evidence to prove paternity was unreasonable and a denial of due process under the circumstances.as lisa precedes both dawn and michael by more than a decade,the supreme court opinion does not contain the now familiar concepts of substantive due process and protected liberty interest,dawn,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,its discussion of due process and private interests lisa,supra,cal d at,appears doctrinally consistent with the court later analysis in dawn d.the lisa court concluded there were substantial private interests that arose from more than the mere biological fact that he is lisa natural father.id.at.the court cited the more than casual relationship between the biological father and the mother,the fact the two adults had lived together for four or five months,the former had contributed to support,and the mother had used the biological father name.ibid.in contrast,the court found the state interest in denying standing to be minimal although the state had a legitimate interest in promoting marriage and not impugning the family unit,that interest had been dissolved by the death of both the mother and the marital father.id.at.
lisa is essentially consistent with dawn holding that a protected liberty interest does not arise from biological connection alone but from the existing relationship,if any,between the biological father and child.it was present in lisa but not in dawn,and it is not present here.assuming lisa reference to the countervailing state interest in marriage still has vitality after dawn and is applicable beyond dependency proceedings,it is not dispositive here.it is true that the family here is not fully intact however,the state interest in the stability of the existing relationship among guy,the mother and all three children is far more pronounced than the former family unit in lisa 
phillip also cites in re melissa d.melissa,another dependency proceeding.melissa was born in august,eight days prior to the marital parents separation.four months later the mother and melissa began living with melissa biological father.the mother and biological father were married in august and had another daughter.melissa continued to live with her mother and biological father for the next three years.when the mother was occasionally in jail because of alcohol abuse,the biological father alone cared for melissa.in july,the biological father was arrested for spousal abuse,and a dependency petition was filed against him and the mother.over the objection of the department of social services,melissa,and the biological father,the juvenile court agreed with mother prior husband that he was melissa conclusively presumed father because she was born prior to his separation from the mother.id.at.
the court of appeal reversed.the opinion discusses both the nonexistent original family unit consisting of the presumed father and mother,and the existing family relationship of the biological father and melissa.a fair reading of the decision reveals that the court struggled with how much weight to give to the fact that the original marriage no longer was intact.it noted that in the decided michael,the united states supreme court was faced with a paternity claim by a biological father that would have interfered with a husband and wife who wanted to raise the wife child jointly.michael,supra,at,fn.the michael plurality said that a protected liberty interest might exist when no such union exists.the court of appeal observed,however,that the original family unit was intact when melissa was born even though it was no longer so.ultimately the melissa court found that the biological father,who had an existing relationship with melissa,had a protected liberty interest.melissa,supra,d at.
in the present case,guy and lisa,previously married,wish to raise their daughter jointly.this is not the fully intact family present in michael and dawn where the parents first separated but then reconciled without getting a divorce.on the other hand,it is not the situation in lisa where both parents were dead or in melissa where the divorced mother and presumed father had no relationship at all.dawn does not discuss melissa so we can not discern whether the supreme court would have found more significant the fact that in this case guy and lisa are together and raising three sons,or that they are no longer married and do not have an existing formal marital union to preserve.however,dawn holding is clear that where the biological father has no relationship with the child,there is no protected liberty interest.it was absent in dawn,is absent here,and present in melissa g.in light of dawn,we find the precedential value of melissa doubtful at best.
the third case on which phillip relies,brian,supra,th,d,is likewise unavailing.there,ginger married william in march.she met brian in december.ginger and brian commenced a relationship that month.in late january,the two of them had sex in a las vegas hotel room,and it was about that time that ginger daughter,kennedy,was conceived.during this same period of time,ginger lived,and had a sexual relationship,with her husband.in march,ginger left her husband and moved into an apartment which she rented with brian.kennedy was born in october.brian was present at kennedy birth,his name appeared as kennedy father on her birth certificate and baptismal records,and the three of them lived together.id.at,d.
one year later,ginger and brian broke up.however,brian continued to see kennedy after work each day and had custody on weekends until may,when ginger unilaterally cut off all contact because she and her husband william were reconciling.brian continued to try to see kennedy,calling ginger and leaving messages all to no avail.brian filed a paternity action,and ginger moved for summary judgment.the trial court concluded that because ginger and william were cohabitating at the time kennedy was conceived,the conclusive presumption of section applied.brian,supra,th at,d.that section provides that the child of a wife cohabiting with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.
the appellate court disagreed and concluded that the important factor in overriding statutory presumptions of paternity was the existence of a relationship between the unwed father and the child.the court,relying extensively on dawn,stated,ginger,brian and kennedy were the only family known by kennedy for the first year of her life and the court held brian had a strong private interest in continuing an existing relationship based on a substantial period of time elapsing between the child birth and the mother return to her husband.brian,supra,th at,d,original italics.although phillip here trumpets the result in brian,he fails to acknowledge that,unlike the biological father there,he has had no existing relationship with dane.
as these cases exemplify,an existing relationship between the unwed father and the child is paramount in whether to nullify paternity presumptions.substantive rules of paternity law will not be automatically applied in situations where their effect would be to terminate an existing relationship.however,when there is no existing relationship
