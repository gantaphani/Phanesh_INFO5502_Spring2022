the mother of three minor children appeals from dispositional orders removing the children from her care and custody.she claims the juvenile court committed reversible error by failing to ensure that notice requirements under the indian child welfare act icwa were met,and that the court committed further error by failing to apply icwa standards to the proceedings.she contends she did not waive her right to raise these claims on appeal by failing to assert them at the dispositional hearing.
we find that the department of family and children services the department did not comply with the notice requirements of the icwa.we therefore reverse the dispositional order and remand this matter so that the relevant tribe can be properly noticed of the proceedings.if it is determined that the children are indian children within the meaning of the icwa,the court must hold a further dispositional hearing applying the requirements of the icwa.otherwise,the court dispositional orders are to be reinstated.
statement of the case 
on october,the department filed petitions under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b failure to protect,as to the mother three minor children samuel,noel and angel m.the children were five years old,two years,ten months old,and seven months old respectively.the petitions alleged that the children were placed in protective custody when the mother was arrested for being under the influence of a controlled substance,that drugs were found in the home behind one of the children beds,that the mother had a history of associating with known drug users,that she was a victim of domestic violence,and that the father of two of the three children had a criminal history,including offenses and infliction of corporal injury on a spouse.
all three children were detained on october.the detention report stated that the mothers sic primary ethnicity in prior referral is said to be american indian.however the boxes on the section petitions indicating that the children might be of indian ancestry or eligible for membership in an indian tribe were not checked.
on october,the department sent a request for confirmation of child status as indian to the santa ynez band of mission indians,to other tribes and to the bureau of indian affairs.this request pertained only to the child angel m.it indicated that the child maternal great grandfather,simon,was enrolled in the chumash tribe of santa ynez and that the child great great grandfather,joe,was born on the santa ynez reservation.simon had received legal services from the bureau of indian affairs and medical care from an indian health clinic through.and an aunt of the child,elizabeth,was a tribal council member and had attended an indian school.
the social worker report for the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing dated november,contained a section entitled indian child welfare act status.it stated that the indian child welfare act does or may apply and it identified the children tribe as chumash and their icwa eligibility status as unknown.it noted that the mother had stated her relatives had been enrolled with the chumash tribe of santa ynez.the social worker reported that she had sent a request for confirmation of the children as indian children to the santa ynez band of mission indians.the department recommended that the court find that the allegations of the petitions were true and adjudge the children dependents of the court,but that the mother retain custody,subject to supervision by the department.
in subsequent amendments prior to the hearing in this matter,the social worker reported that the mother was cooperative,was actively participating in services and was very bonded to the children.visits with the children went well.the mother had the support of her mother,who lived next door.neither the mother nor the grandmother had any criminal record and the mother was consistently producing negative drug tests.the social worker again recommended that the children be returned to the mother with family maintenance services.
the hearing was held on january,at which time the court found the allegations of the petitions to be true and took jurisdiction over the children.the district attorney representing the children opposed the department recommendation for family maintenance.disposition was continued pending receipt of further reports and evaluations of the two older children.the court orders made no mention of the children possible indian status or of the notice requirements under the icwa.
a contested disposition hearing was held over five days in may and june of.there was testimony regarding the older two children developmental problems and there was conflicting testimony regarding the mother efforts to cope with a syndrome of domestic violence in her relationships,and her ability to protect the children.the department continued to recommend return of the children to their mother,with family maintenance services.the district attorney office took the position that although the mother had made progress in dealing with issues of domestic violence,she was not yet able to provide a safe environment for her children.at the conclusion of the hearing on june,the court stated it wanted the children to eventually be returned permanently to the mother when it was clear that they would be safe.in the meantime,the court ordered placement of all three children with the grandmother,donna,and liberal visitation with the mother.again,there was no mention made of the children possible tribal affiliation or the application of the requirements of the icwa.a transition plan was developed and approved by the court on june,whereby the children would be gradually moved from foster care to placement with the maternal grandmother,with regular home supervision.an interim review on june,indicated that the transition to placement with the grandmother was successful and that visits with the mother had been increased.
on july,the mother appealed from the disposition orders.
the mother argues that notice was improper under the icwa and that the court erred in not applying the requirements of the icwa at the disposition hearing.she contends that even though she did not raise this issue at the disposition hearing,or in her notice of appeal,it is not waived.
