defendant william neidinger appeals after a jury convicted him of two counts of being a lawful custodian of his children who maliciously deprived another lawful custodian of the children,olga neidinger olga or mother,of her right to custody,subd.a a child abduction.defendant argues the trial court erred by instructing the jury that he had the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,the defense that he had a good faith and reasonable belief that the children,if left with the mother,would suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm,subd.a a hereafter referred to as the good faith defense.he argues that the facts supporting the defense negated an element of the that he was thereby required to raise only a reasonable doubt as to the existence of those facts.we shall conclude,for the reasons stated below,that the court erred by failing to give an instruction that clarified the relationship between the good faith defense and malice.since the error can not be deemed harmless under the facts presented,the judgment must be reversed.
facts and procedural history 
defendant,an architectural consultant,met his wife,olga,by corresponding with her through a singles club.she emigrated to the united states in february on a bride visa.their marriage produced two children,a son,born in october,and a daughter,born in november.the family moved from virginia to reno,nevada,in and from reno to the sacramento area in april or may.
the relationship between defendant and olga was tumultuous they had many arguments that escalated to physical altercations.olga and defendant each claimed the other was the aggressor.olga testified defendant was physically abusive defendant testified that olga became quite angry after the birth of,and would take out her aggressions by hitting him or damaging his personal property.
one of the couple significant altercations occurred in reno in august.olga testified she was forced to call because defendant was trying to break her arm.defendant,on the other hand,testified the fight started for no apparent reason after he returned home from running some errands.olga was angry and started yelling at him,and within moments she began punching,scratching and biting him,leaving over visible marks on his body.olga also hit him on the head with a telephone receiver,drawing blood and leaving a gash.as defendant tried to hold olga down to stop the assault,she reached for the telephone and dialed,to which defendant offered no resistance.four police officers arrived at their residence,interviewed the combatants,and arrested olga.according to olga,the police arrested her because defendant had one scratch on his face,even though she believed defendant did it by himself.defendant testified that the children were a bout two feet away during the assault.defendant bailed olga out of jail the following day,and the charges were subsequently dismissed.
another significant altercation occurred on august,after the family had relocated to sacramento,which resulted in the filing of criminal charges against defendant.olga testified that defendant received a letter from a doctor addressed to defendant only which caused her some concern,because defendant had been telling her she was crazy and h e start calling to police and he tried to me in like a doctor place and i had been afraid of it because he tried do know,like throw me on the street or something.olga did not open the letter she put it back in the mailbox so defendant could retrieve it after work.when defendant picked up the mail later that day and handed it to olga,she noticed the letter from the doctor was missing.olga asked defendant several times if that was all of the mail,and defendant replied that it was.olga asked defendant about the unopened letter that defendant was holding.defendant said it had arrived several days earlier and he had not had a chance to read it.olga replied,give me please,and tried to take it from defendant,but he resisted,kicking her in the leg,breaking his wristwatch over her head,and tearing the letter to shreds.
defendant testified he did not assault olga.he testified he was concerned with olga emotional due to her frequent mood swings,and that he had arranged an appointment with a psychiatrist located near their residence,but that olga had refused to go.on the day of the altercation,he returned home early from work and retrieved the mail,which included a confidential letter that he did not want to discuss with olga due to the tension between us.olga,though,grabbed the letter from his briefcase and held it as though it belonged to her.defendant grabbed the letter from olga,who hit me as hard as she possibly could.olga ripped defendant wristwatch off and twisted the whole thing up like it was made out of foil.olga scratched defendant,and the assault left bruises.
olga testified that after the fight,she took the children and went to a friend apartment,but returned home later that night and slept with the children in their room.the following morning,olga called women escaping a violent environment weave.less than a week later,olga and the children moved into a weave shelter.olga and the children stayed in the weave shelter for less than one month.they moved into a motel for two weeks,and then found an apartment in west sacramento.
prior to being taken to the shelter,an attorney working with weave took olga to a hospital,where a police officer questioned her about the august,incident.as a result,criminal charges were filed against defendant,but were dismissed in october.the attorney helped olga complete a request for a domestic violence restraining order,which olga filed in sacramento county superior court in august.on september,the court issued an order restraining defendant from contacting olga or the children.
the september order also granted legal and physical custody to olga with no visitation to defendant pending private mediation.a month later,following dismissal of the criminal charges against defendant,the court adopted a mediator recommendations and granted olga and defendant joint legal and physical custody of the children with defendant having supervised visitation for two hours a week.
in december,olga filed a petition for legal separation,which was later consolidated with the domestic violence proceeding.
in january,the court granted defendant unsupervised weekend visitation,which would include overnight visits on fridays for the first two weeks and weekend visits thereafter.
pursuant to stipulation,this order was modified on february.the order granted olga and defendant joint legal custody with primary physical custody to olga defendant was granted visitation with the children on each saturday and sunday from to 
following dismissal of the criminal charges in october,defendant began to see the children more frequently.he became concerned with their,as they had regressed into a state of near autism.they were lethargic,detached,and almost catatonic.defendant noticed that was experiencing dramatic shifts in weight.defendant also was concerned with the physical safety of,whose temper tantrums olga would encourage,even though they sometimes took place right in the middle of a street where cars are driving.defendant testified he made over complaints without a satisfactory response to child protective service agencies in sacramento and yolo counties about the children.
as part of the mediation process in family court,olga underwent a psychological evaluation in january.defendant testified he received a copy of the report that same month,and that it recommended that olga take medication for her mood swings and other disorders,but that olga had refused.on,defendant admitted the report concluded that olga was a capable parent and there were no psychiatric problems requiring immediate intervention with respect to the children.
defendant decision to take the children from olga care was precipitated by an incident on march,the march incident.defendant received a telephone call from brian dutra,who told defendant he was one of olga lovers.dutra informed defendant that olga had invited him to visit her for a date,but that when he arrived at her residence,he found her in bed with jeff nelson,who had been defendant and olga neighbor in reno.olga told nelson to make dutra go away,but when nelson began verbally and physically assaulting dutra,olga changed her mind and told dutra to make nelson go away.the incident ended with no physical injury,although there was a lot of yelling.during the incident,the children stood at the bedroom door which separated their bedroom from olga,and witnessed the confrontation.
the following day,defendant drove to reno and spoke with nelson at length about the incident.nelson confirmed dutra story,but insisted that he had not had sexual relations with olga.
the march incident happened in conjunction with defendant efforts to conclude all court proceedings in california and to initiate a new proceeding in nevada,since n obody was living in sacramento whatsoever,and he had maintained his residency in nevada during the period he had moved to sacramento to complete a job.
on march,defendant requested and obtained dismissal of olga domestic violence complaint on march,defendant filed an application in a nevada court for an order for protection against domestic violence.in the accompanying declaration,defendant related that the children had been living with him in nevada since february,and that there were no other actions pending regarding child custody in any other state.
defendant testified that he decided to remove the children to his residence in nevada for their own safety.defendant did not call child protective services because they had been unresponsive in the past.he filed for a restraining order and a temporary custody order in nevada because he had maintained residency there and had moved there.
defendant picked up the children for his regular visitation on saturday,march.defendant testified he drove to the police station in west sacramento to inform them of his plans to remove the children,but discovered that the station was closed.a woman in civilian clothes came to the door and told him we do get into that and w e do care.
defendant communicated to olga through third parties that he would not be returning the children because he had moved to nevada,which would be a better place for them.olga called the police.
while olga was being interviewed by a police officer,defendant telephoned.defendant stated that he had an order granting custody issued by a nevada court on march,but he declined to fax a copy of the order to the officer.
ricky gore,the officer in charge of the investigation,left a message on defendant cell phone the evening of march,to which defendant promptly replied with a lengthy message of his own.according to gore,defendant stated he was fed up with the california court system he had gotten rid of all actions in california he had tried unsuccessfully to serve olga with court papers and the children were safe.
gore returned defendant call the following morning,sunday,march,and defendant reiterated the concerns he had stated in his earlier message to gore.gore testified that he did not get any type of impression that defendant was removing the kids because they were in danger.defendant seemed more upset about the march incident from a moral standpoint than from a safety standpoint.
on monday,march,gore telephoned defendant,who reiterated his frustration with the california courts,and added that he was concerned about the children welfare because of injuries and illnesses they had suffered due to olga inattentiveness,olga use of a belt to discipline the children,the domestic violence charge that had been filed against olga in nevada,and the march incident.even though defendant raised issues regarding the children,gore did not question defendant further about them because he did not believe they were serious.defendant stated he would not return the children to california,but he agreed to fax the nevada order to gore.gore obtained an arrest warrant for defendant that same day and had it served by nevada officers a few hours later while defendant was faxing the nevada order to gore.
defendant was charged with two counts of maliciously depriving a lawful custodian of the right to custody of a child.a.at trial,the people relied on the facts set forth above the defense was based on defendant reasonable and good faith belief that removal of the children from olga care was necessary for their physical and emotional defendant requested that the court instruct the jury that he need raise only a reasonable doubt as to the applicability of the defense,but the court declined to give defendant proposed instruction 
the jury found defendant guilty of both counts.the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for four years on the condition he serve days in jail and have no contact with olga and the children.
discussion 
defendant contends that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that he had the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,the defense that he acted under a good faith reasonable belief that the children,if left with olga,would suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm.a.
in order to resolve this issue,we must determine whether the good faith defense negates an element of the crime,or is collateral to the issue of guilt.if the former,defendant burden was merely to raise a reasonable doubt with respect to it if the latter,defendant was properly required to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.the supreme court reiterated this distinction several years ago in people mower cal th,d,mower,where the court wrote evidence code section provides that,when a statute allocates the burden of proof to a defendant on any fact relating to his or her guilt,the defendant is required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to that fact.with respect to many defenses,as ha s been and is extremely common in the penal law citation,a defendant has been required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to the underlying facts.fn.omitted.such defenses relate to the defendant guilt or innocence because they relate to an element of the crime in question.mower,supra,cal th at,d.
defendant was convicted of two counts of violating section a,which provides every person who takes,entices away,keeps,withholds,or conceals a child and maliciously deprives a lawful custodian of a right to custody,or a person of a right to visitation,shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year,a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars,or both that fine and imprisonment,or by imprisonment in the state prison for months,or two or three years,a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars,or both that fine and imprisonment.italics added.
the good faith defense as embodied in section a provides section does not apply to a person with a right to custody of a child who,with a good faith and reasonable belief that the child,if left with the other person,will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm,takes,entices away,keeps,withholds,or conceals that child.
at first glance,the good faith defense seems collateral to defendant guilt,if only because it is set forth in a statute separate from that defining the crime.further reflection,though,reveals a much closer question,since the good faith defense appears necessarily related to the element of malice required to establish the crime.
the interplay of these two provisions was addressed,in a related context,in people mcgirr d.mcgirr,which considered former section,a provision that governed child abduction in the absence of a court order determining the rights to custody and visitation.at the time of the offenses in mcgirr,former section required that the defendant not only maliciously take,detain,conceal,or entice away the child within or without the state,but that the defendant do so without good cause.id.at.
the issue in mcgirr was whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide any definition of what constituted good cause for the abduction the court rejected this contention,reasoning that good cause has in fact acquired reasonable certainty by established usage,interpretation and a settled commonsense meaning.moreover,the term good cause as used in both the preamended and postamended section is further narrowed or circumscribed by the requirement that the taking,detaining,concealment or enticing of the child be done maliciously,with malice.malice is defined in section,subdivision the words malice and maliciously import a wish to vex,annoy,or injure another person,or an intent to do a wrongful act,established either by proof or presumption of law.and as professor witkin states,but such hatred or intent to injure is rarely required the element of malice in most criminal statutes is satisfied by the intentional doing of the act without justification or excuse or mitigating circumstances an intent to do a wrongful act.citation.thus,if one acts maliciously in the taking,concealing,of the child,as established by the record,it seems logical he or she did not have good cause,acted without good cause.mcgirr,supra,d at,italics added.
four years after the mcgirr decision,former section received further appellate analysis in people dewberry th,d dewberry,where the defendant raised the defense of necessity because he believed the abductee physical safety was in peril.the trial court instructed the jury that the absence of good cause was an element of the offense,and it also instructed the jury that necessity was an affirmative defense which the defendant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence 
dewberry held the instruction regarding the defense of necessity was erroneous.the court noted that former section converted what would normally be an affirmative claim of belief in the necessity to protect the child from an element of the offense,by a device which is very unusual in the penal code,the specification of lack of good cause for the proscribed conduct within the statutory description of the crime.dewberry,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that the absence of good cause is an element of the offense prescribed by former section.accordingly,in attempting to show good cause for taking the child to texas,the defendant need only have raised a reasonable doubt on this point.citation.the court therefore erred in instructing the jury that the defendant had to prove the affirmative defense of necessity by a preponderance of the evidence.the instruction was correct on its face,but it was inappropriate in this context because of the statutory conversion of the necessity issue into an element of the offense.the result was error because the instruction increased the defendant burden from raising a reasonable doubt as to good cause to proof of good cause by a preponderance of the evidence.citation.dewberry,supra,th at,d.
after dewberry,the legislature revised the provisions regarding child abduction.prior to the amendment,former section governed child abduction by a person with a right to custody but without a court order,while former section governed child abduction by a person having a right to custody pursuant to court order.stats,ch,former stats,ch,former.the amendment combined these two provisions into one,while making changes to the elements required to establish a violation stats,ch.prior to the amendment of former section,the people were only required to prove that the person with a right to custody pursuant to a court order acted with the intent to deprive the other person of that right to custody see fn,ante.the statute did not include a malice element,nor did it require the people to prove that the defendant acted without good cause.former,stats,ch.
after the amendment,though,the people were required to prove that a defendant with a right to custody whether by court order or operation of law maliciously deprive d a lawful custodian of the right to custody or visitation.a,as amended by stats,ch.in other words,during the consolidation of former sections and,the malice element of former section was retained in the case of child abduction by a person having a right to custody but without a court order,and added in the case of a person having a right to custody pursuant to court order.the absence of the good cause element was deleted with respect to a person with a right to custody without a court order.with respect to a person having a right to custody pursuant to court order,the deletion of the absence of good cause element of former section made no change in the law.stats,ch.as part of the statutory revision,the good faith defense in section was added.ibid.
caljic specifies that the defendant has the burden of proving the good faith defense by a preponderance of the evidence.in their comment to caljic,the authors noted that section is silent on the issue of burden of proof,and that the preponderance of the evidence burden was selected because the defense appears substantially similar to the defense of necessity,which has been held to be collateral to the issue of guilt and thereby properly subject to a defendant proof by a preponderance of the evidence dewberry supports this conclusion,as do other cases involving the necessity defense 
although it is ordinarily prudent for a trial court to instruct in accordance with caljic,the court nonetheless remains obligated to give a correct instruction.a trial court must instruct the jury on the allocation and weight of the burden of proof citations,and,of course,must do so correctly.it must give such an instruction even in the absence of a request citation,inasmuch as the allocation and weight of the burden of proof are issues that are closely and openly connected with the facts before the court,and are necessary for the jury understanding of the case citation.mower,supra,cal th at,d.included within this duty is the obligation to instruct on defenses,and on the relationship of these defenses to the elements of the charged offense where it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense,or if there is substantial evidence supportive of such a defense citation.people stewart cal d,stewart.
from this judicial and legislative background,we draw the following conclusions in order to prove a violation of section a,the people are required to prove that a defendant with a right of custody pursuant to a court order or otherwise maliciously deprived a lawful custodian of the right to custody or visitation.the deletion of the phrase without good cause manifests an intent to eliminate this as an element of the offense of child abduction by a person having a right to custody.the addition of section manifests an intent to establish an affirmative defense of good faith for the abduction.people george th,d where a statute first defines an offense in unconditional terms and then specifies an exception to its operation,the exception is an affirmative defense to be raised and proved by the defendant.the defense that the abductor had a reasonable and good faith belief that the abduction was necessary to protect the abductee from immediate bodily injury or emotional harm is akin to the defense of necessity.dewberry,supra,th,d.the defendant may properly be required to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the defense of necessity and,by parity of reasoning,the good faith defense of section a.id.at,d.
where a defense also negates an element of the crime,the defendant need raise only a reasonable doubt as to the defense.mower,supra,cal th at,d.a good faith and reasonable belief that the child will suffer immediate bodily injury or emotional harm tends to negate the element of the offense that the defendant acted maliciously.mcgirr,supra,d at.the trial court was required to give an instruction which clarified the relationship between the good faith defense and the element of malice,so that it was clear to the jury that,to the extent the evidence regarding the good faith defense also showed that defendant acted without malice,he need raise only a reasonable doubt as to that element of the offense.mower,supra,cal th at,d,stewart,supra,cal d at.
the people do not respond directly to defendant argument that the facts he relied on to support his good faith defense also tended to negate the malice element of section a.instead,the people state that c ertainly,if any of the evidence used to prove the affirmative defense of necessity was also r
