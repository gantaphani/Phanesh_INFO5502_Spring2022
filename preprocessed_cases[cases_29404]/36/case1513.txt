following their mother arrest in late,four young girls were placed in foster homes.by july,the los angeles county department of children and family services knew that the girls father vincent edward scroghan was living in indiana,and should have known that since vincent had been and still is sending child support payments for the girls to the los angeles county district attorney bureau of family support operations now the los angeles county child support services department.but the left hand did know what the right hand was doing or how to spell.for about two years,the department searched lackadaisically for vincent scriggab,and sometimes vincent scriggag,in california and only california.in,when the dependency court noticed the spelling error,no light bulbs flashed over the department head,no one thought to check the file for other errors,and no one looked for vincent scroghan in indiana.no one contacted child support services.
it was not until march that the department finally did the obvious it sent a request for information to the parent locator clerk at child support services,who responded promptly with vincent address the same one at which he had been receiving mail since.finally,the department wrote to vincent,asking in a form letter that he call to discuss plans for his child.he called immediately,explaining that he had tried unsuccessfully to find his children and believed they were living with their mother.it was too late.the children,of course,had not been standing still following multiple placements in too many foster homes,the oldest daughter was placed in a group home,the other three with prospective adoptive families.in vincent absence,his parental rights were terminated with regard to two of his daughters and a hearing was set for january to terminate his rights as to the third daughter.in december,a lawyer was appointed to represent vincent.
at the january hearing,vincent lawyer asked for a continuance,explaining that he had not had an opportunity to consult with his client.the request was denied and vincent rights were terminated.he appeals,and he has also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,claiming he had no notice of the dependency court proceedings.without a blush or even a wince,the department contends here,as it did in the dependency court,that its search for the wrong man in the wrong state was legally sufficient.it was not.we find the department conduct inexcusable and so very,very sad under these circumstances.had the department sent a request for information to the district attorney bureau of family support operations back in,vincent might have been able to offer a home to some or all of these children.at a minimum,he would have had a timely opportunity to be heard,and the girls and the three adoptive families would have been allowed to get on with their lives.as it stands,all vincent wants is an opportunity to be heard with regard to his rights the two girls who have not yet been adopted.he is entitled to that much.
joyce met and began living with vincent scroghan in indianapolis,indiana in,in indiana,joyce gave birth to her oldest daughter,ashley although it is not clear whether vincent is ashley biological father,he has always treated her as his own child and until he recently learned otherwise has believed he was identified as her father on her birth certificate.in september,in indianapolis,joyce gave birth to megan,who is vincent biological daughter.once again and until he recently learned otherwise,vincent thought he was identified as megan father on her birth certificate and he has always treated her as his child.from until,joyce,vincent,and their daughters lived at philips drive,indianapolis,indiana,in a house owned by vincent mother.
in,joyce,vincent,ashley,and megan moved to los angeles,california,where ashley and megan sisters miranda and mary were born in and.miranda and mary california birth certificates identify the girls father as vincent scroghan.from to,joyce,vincent,and their daughters lived together part of the time in california,and part of the time in indiana at the philips drive house.in,while in california,vincent relationship with joyce ended and he returned to indianapolis in the fall of that year.he wrote several letters to joyce at the address where they had last lived but his letters were all returned.he tried to call joyce aunt mary but was unable to reach her.
on november,joyce and her boyfriend felipe were arrested when they attempted to cash a forged check.on november,ashley,megan,miranda,and mary were detained by the department of children and family services.on november,a petition was filed in which the department alleged that joyce was unable to care for her children because she was in jail and because she had a history of drug and alcohol abuse,and that joyce boyfriend had other problems.the petition alleged that the whereabouts of the girls father,vincent scriggag,were unknown,and that he was not providing them with regular care.
meanwhile,vincent continued his attempts to contact joyce directly and through her aunt but he was unable to find her.the last time he tried to call joyce aunt,he learned that the aunt telephone had been disconnected.at the same time,the child support services division of the los angeles county district attorney bureau of family support operations was able to find vincent at his mother house on philips drive in indianapolis,where child support services wrote to him to demand that he pay child support for his daughters he readily admitted he was their father and began to make monthly support payments.when he was unemployed and was unable to make payments,his subsequent wages were garnished from time to time,and child support services has over the intervening years regularly contacted vincent by mail at the philips drive address 
a social worker declaration of due diligence executed in february told the dependency court that a california records search for vincent scriggab had been unsuccessful,and that the whereabouts of the girls father,vincent scriggag,remained unknown.although a report submitted to the court with the social worker declaration shows that joyce aunt had told the social worker that the girls father was living somewhere in indiana,there is nothing in the record to suggest that any effort of any kind was made to locate vincent scroghan or even vincent scriggab or scriggag in indiana.no one asked child support services whether it had any information about vincent.in april,the dependency court treated vincent failure to appear as a default and,in his absence,sustained the petition.
in july,the department reported that the whereabouts of vincent scriggag remained unknown.in the same report,the department noted that it had obtained miranda and mary birth certificates and provided the court with copies but offered no explanation for why it took almost a year to obtain two california birth certificates.and although the birth certificates clearly identify miranda and mary father as vincent edward scroghan miranda and vincent scroghan mary,there is nothing in the record to suggest that the department made any effort of any kind to locate vincent under his true name in california or in indiana.in november,reunification services were ordered for vincent scriggag.
in may,the department reported that the whereabouts of the father,vincent scriggab,remained unknown.the same report states that a relative veronica had told a social worker that vincent lived in indiana but that record searches in both california and indiana for vincent scriggab had been unsuccessful.no one asked child support services whether it had any information about vincent,and no effort at all was made to find vincent scroghan.at a november hearing,there was the following exchange
