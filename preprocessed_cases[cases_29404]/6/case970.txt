a jury convicted defendant gary flanders,former ceo and supermajority shareholder of metrobank,of two counts of willful misapplication of bank funds,in violation of,two counts of scheming to defraud a bank,in violation of,one count of making a false entry in a bank record,in violation of,and one count of conspiring to make a false statement to a bank,in violation of.
defendant was sentenced to months eighteen months above the sentencing guideline ordered to pay restitution,among other penalties.defendant appeals his conviction alleging insufficiency of the evidence on five of the six counts violation of his sixth amendment right to chosen counsel,and commission of numerous sentencing errors.
background 
in providing the pertinent facts,we view the record in the light most favorable to the government.united states weidner,cir.
defendant acquired metrobank,a federally chartered,bank operating in oklahoma city,oklahoma,from the fdic in by purchasing a bank stock loan on which the original investors defaulted.in september,defendant took out two loans totaling from bridgeview bank group bridgeview primarily to satisfy the bank stock loan that he used to acquire metrobank.as collateral for this loan,bridgeview took defendant certificate for shares of metrobank stock and placed liens on defendant colorado springs,colorado home,a separate tract in colorado springs,and miscellaneous assets.
defendant first payment obligation to bridgeview was due january.it went unpaid,and payment negotiations between defendant and bridgeview ensued.these negotiations dragged on for months without defendant ever tendering valid payment on october,not long after bridgeview informed defendant of its intention to accelerate the loan and ultimately foreclose,defendant filed for chapter bankruptcy.defendant attempts to reorganize under chapter protection proved unsuccessful.as a result,the bankruptcy court converted defendant chapter bankruptcy to chapter on december.
in accordance with chapter procedure,the bankruptcy court appointed a trustee to liquidate defendant assets,including his metrobank stock.due to fdic rules that require bank officers and directors to own stock in the banks they serve,defendant faced removal.at a special shareholders meeting on january,defendant resigned his position,and the metrobank board of directors ratified his resignation.
defendant conviction arose out of four automobile loan,two independent real estate loans,and the attempted sale of the metrobank during defendant bankruptcy.defendant initiated these transactions in an apparent attempt to generate funds with which to satisfy his substantial outstanding debts.as the supermajority shareholder,defendant received dividends from metrobank profits.defendant typically took upward of ninety percent of the profits in dividends.these dividends were defendant sole source of income.
a.the fischer automobile loan 
automobile ownership 
in january,the office of the comptroller of the currency occ,a division of the united states treasury department tasked with supervising the operations of federally chartered banks,learned that defendant had been driving a mitsubishi eclipse owned by metrobank.metrobank acquired the mitsubishi following its repossession due to an unrelated,unpaid loan.the occ criticized defendant personal use of the vehicle without reimbursing metrobank for expenses associated with its use.it demanded that defendant either reimburse the bank or purchase the vehicle outright.
defendant selected the latter option.in late january,he purchased the vehicle from metrobank on credit by executing a note in favor of metrobank with metrobank taking a lien against the vehicle.defendant thereafter timely made the monthly loan installment payments.in early january,however,defendant approached nancy bainbridge,metrobank chief financial officer,about reversing the loan and returning the vehicle to metrobank possession.bainbridge informed defendant that the loan reversal was not possible.
at that point,defendant informed bainbridge that he had failed to title the vehicle in his name.the existing title certificate listed metrobank as the owner on the front side,but the back side bore a notarized acknowledgment of the transfer of ownership to defendant.defendant requested that bainbridge obtain a duplicate title,which would not bear notarized evidence of the previous transfer.defendant claimed that with the duplicate title he could properly title the vehicle without having to pay a penalty for not having titled the vehicle within the time allotted by the oklahoma department of motor vehicles.bainbridge refused defendant request.
nevertheless,a title was issued on january,listing metrobank as the owner of the vehicle.despite the title confusion,an occ examiner testified that the car in fact belonged to defendant.
automobile loan 
in march,defendant sold the mitsubishi for to michelle fischer,an acquaintance of david solomon defendant required that fischer make a down payment.fischer obtained the remaining from a metrobank loan issued on march.metrobank took a lien against the vehicle,which had a kelley blue book value of between and.solomon acted as a guarantor.
according to cody machala,a junior loan officer at metrobank,defendant asked him to examine fischer loan application.machala examination revealed that both fischer and solomon had poor credit.as a result,machala did not feel comfortable making this loan.app.at.machala,however,did not explain his concerns to defendant because he felt a little intimidated by defendant and because he believed defendant wanted him to make the loan.app.at.instead,machala sought the advice of two more senior metrobank loan officers.those loan officers both stated that because the amount of the loan was within defendant lending authority,machala should make the loan.at least one of the loan officers cautioned machala,however,to put defendant initials on the paperwork to signify that defendant was in fact the loan officer of record.
defendant informed machala to distribute the loan proceeds to two of defendant outstanding loans with metrobank.machala applied to defendant car loan,completely paying off that debt.he applied the remaining proceeds plus the down payment to another of defendant loans.this distribution was recorded on several official bank forms as well as a nonstandard memorandum created by machala for the express purpose of detailing the loan proceed distribution due to where the proceeds were going.app.at.
fischer timely tendered the first three monthly loan installment payments before defaulting.solomon then paid approximately four months worth of delinquent payments before also defaulting.ultimately,metrobank repossessed the mitsubishi and sold it at auction for.
b.the nelco real estate loan 
the transaction 
in early,defendant approached bainbridge seeking advice regarding the possible purchase by metrobank of a tract in newcastle,oklahoma.defendant explained to bainbridge that the property represented a lucrative development opportunity given the state intended installation of a nearby turnpike.bainbridge informed defendant that banks were prohibited from buying and holding land for purposes of speculation.
around this time,solomon introduced defendant to unindicted nels bentson,an entrepreneur who owned a chain of and service stores for which solomon occasionally performed work.defendant,solomon,and bentson agreed to purchase the parcel and turn it into a housing development known as eden estates.bentson was in charge of developing eden estates,solomon of marketing and selling the developed lots,and defendant of financing the project.
at defendant suggestion,bentson formed nelco,nelco.nelco would obtain a loan from metrobank in order to purchase and develop the property.of the loan proceeds,was earmarked to purchase the land with the remaining funds available to draw upon as nelco incurred development costs.at some point,solomon was injected as an intermediate buyer.the transaction then was arranged as a closing such that solomon would purchase the land for and immediately transfer it to nelco at a cost of million,a figure apparently representing a portion of the property value.in return,nelco would issue a promissory note to solomon,who in turn would sell it to metrobank for a mere.
the proposed loan transaction was presented to the metrobank board of directors for approval on april,despite concerns over the valuation attached to the land as well as to the promissory note,the board approved the loan subject to removing solomon from the transaction.this conditional approval was prompted due to solomon poor credit and the presence of tax liens against solomon that could effect the chain of title.according to notes taken by bainbridge at that meeting,the board refused to deal with david solomon due to his credit report and required g ood and clear title.app.at.
following this meeting,on april,solomon incorporated transtech properties,transtech at defendant suggestion.transtech was then substituted as the intermediary purchaser.although a metrobank employee prepared a credit memorandum detailing solomon ownership of transtech,it is not clear that this memorandum was made available to the board until april,the day after the nelco transaction closed.it is clear that board members expressed dissatisfaction over solomon continued involvement in the transaction when the issue came up at the may,board meeting.
the bank records 
yet,one month later,at a june,board meeting,the board approved a version of the april,meeting minutes that omitted any mention of the conditions imposed.chris rauchs,an outside contractor,had produced written draft minutes of the april meeting based on a tape recording made of that meeting.rauch initial draft listed the conditions imposed on the nelco loan approval.defendant then called rauchs to request that she delete that portion of the minutes and she complied with that request.
metrobank loan officer virginia evans alerted the occ of the discrepancy in the various draft minutes during a standard occ review conducted on or around june.she did not report the discrepancy to the board of directors prior to or during the june,board meeting at which the altered minutes were approved.
c.the reisig real estate loan 
nelco eden estate development was located in close proximity to other housing developments,including meadowview estates and oak forest,which were both developed by land,a property development company by mike campbell and ross morris.campbell was acquainted with defendant because metrobank had provided the financing for meadowview development.campbell also was acquainted with solomon,whom he described as defendant envoy.app.at.
in fall,solomon approached campbell regarding land desire to sell seven,undeveloped,lots in the oak forest development.solomon stated that he had located a potential buyer who was interested in starting a property development business.campbell indicated that he would sell all seven lots for per lot,or.
around the same time,solomon approached an acquaintance,jon reisig,about purchasing these lots.solomon introduced reisig to defendant,who told reisig about the potentially lucrative opportunity presented by the oak forest lots.defendant also told reisig that metrobank would provide any necessary financing.without seeking an appraisal or conducting a survey or even seeing each lot,reisig agreed to purchase all seven lots for per lot,or.
campbell and reisig never negotiated with one another,so neither was aware of the price disparity.indeed,reisig was under the impression that per lot amounted to,the final sale price as set by solomon and defendant.the entire transaction was based on oral promises the parties never entered into a written contract.
defendant asked john defrees,metrobank senior lending officer,to prepare and present the loan to the loan committee for approval.defendant was unable to do so himself because the occ had suspended defendant lending authority following his issuance of a number of questionable loans.defrees passed the loan off to bob osborne,a lending officer with more real estate loan experience.under the terms of loan,metrobank would loan to reisig enterprises,a corporation wholly owned by jon reisig.the total loan amount was based on for the purchase of the seven lots,for the purchase of a modular show home,and for a revolving line of credit for costs associated with building homes on any sold lots.the loan committee initially rejected the loan.defendant,defrees,and osborne then reworked the proposal to address the committee concerns.on december,the loan was again presented to the loan committee,and approval was granted.
just before the closing,defendant informed defrees that of the purchase price was to be distributed to transtech as a finder fee.defrees informed osborne,who had the closing documents changed to reflect this disbursement.in order to effectuate this disbursement,defendant had transtech inserted as an intermediary of the lots.despite these changes,the loan was not presented to the loan committee for reapproval.
campbell also was notified of a last minute change.the day before the closing,campbell received a telephone call from defendant informing him that reisig wife had thrown a fit over the sale price.app.at.according to defendant,reisig was now willing to pay only per lot,or.campbell reluctantly agreed to the new price.reisig and his wife testified that defendant representations were false.
on december,the parties met at metrobank for the closing.at that time campbell became aware of transtech involvement.having received his payment,however,he signed the appropriate documents and left.reisig apparently remained unaware of transtech involvement and its receipt of.reisig never read the closing documents or retained counsel to assist in reviewing the deal.
immediately after the closing,solomon gave roughly to metrobank to purchase six,nonperforming,uncollectible loans,otherwise known as loans in addition,approximately went to make delinquent payments on the fischer car loan.solomon also attempted to give to reisig as repayment for a failed investment reisig had made at solomon urging.
d.the attempted building sale 
as noted above,defendant chapter bankruptcy was converted to chapter on december.pursuant to the bankruptcy code,the chapter trustee at that point became the statutory owner of all defendant assets,including his metrobank stock.the trustee informed defendant on january,that a special board meeting would be held on january.that meeting was scheduled in order to discuss defendant inability to continue to serve on the metrobank board due to his lack of stock ownership.
on january,defendant contacted real estate attorney kiran phansalkar to assist in the sale of metrobank building.defendant represented that he had authority to sell the bank building and that the sale was aimed at achieving tax breaks.although the board had granted defendant authority to explore the sale of bank assets nearly one month earlier,that authority was conditioned on obtaining regulatory approval from the occ prior to effectuating any sale.at a meeting at phansalkar office on january,defendant informed phansalkar that oklahoma central railroad ocrr,a company wholly owned by defendant wife,would be the purchaser.phansalkar expressed concerns about the inside nature of the transaction,but was reassured by defendant about his authority to conduct the sale.phansalkar later learned that ocrr corporate status had been suspended,meaning it was not legally able to conduct business operations.
according to the terms of the transaction,ocrr would buy the building on credit for million,but would only make a down payment.ocrr would then lease the building back to metrobank at a monthly rent of for a period of years.according to defendant wife,ocrr did not have the funds to effectuate the sale.defendant attempted to arrange the financing through old standard life insurance old standard.defendant had his wife sign a check to old standard for in exchange for a commitment letter regarding a million loan.that commitment never came.nevertheless,defendant and his wife signed all the necessary sale documents on january,the night before the special shareholder meeting.at defendant urging,phansalkar placed the documents in escrow subject to closing.
unbeknownst to phansalkar,the next day the metrobank board of directors removed defendant from the board and relieved him of his role at the bank.at no point in that meeting did defendant advise the board of the impending sale.two days later,the incoming metrobank president learned of the attempted sale.he immediately contacted phansalkar and stopped the transaction.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review sufficiency of the evidence challenges de novo to determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states yehling,cir.we consider both direct and circumstantial evidence,together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.id.we do not,however,weigh conflicting evidence or consider witness credibility.id.
we also generally review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal.united states apperson,cir.this circuit,however,follows the waiver rule.under that rule,a defendant who moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government case must move again for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the entire case if he thereafter introduces evidence in his defense.united states bowie,cir quoting united states lopez,cir.because defendant failed to reaffirm his motion for judgment of acquittal after testifying in his own defense,we review for plain error under.b.id.the analysis,however,is essentially the same as under sufficiency of the evidence.id.
a conviction for willful misapplication of bank funds under requires the government to prove that the defendant was a bank officer or director of a national or federally insured bank from which the defendant willfully misapplied funds and that the defendant acted with intent to injure or defraud the bank.united states rackley,cir.although intent to injure or defraud is not an explicit statutory element of,the courts of appeals all agree that intent to injure or defraud must be established.see bates united states,d collecting cases.this court has stated that evidence of an intent to deceive may be sufficient,in certain circumstances,to supply the necessary proof of criminal intent required under.united states harenberg,cir relying upon implicit holding of united states twiford,cir.
defendant asserts that his conviction extends the misapplication statute in an unprecedented fashion appellant br.at because there was insufficient evidence of his intent to conceal the use of the funds at issue.
the fischer automobile loan 
according to defendant,the fact that he truthfully and openly disclosed the fischer loan proceeds in the loan documents renders misapplication impossible as a matter of law.the use of the fischer loan proceeds to pay off defendant own car loan as well as other metrobank debts was stated on the face of the loan documents.in addition,machala created a separate,nonstandard memorandum detailing the disbursements.this made defendant personal benefit readily apparent to anyone reviewing the loan file.
the government points out that to be convicted under,a defendant need not have made a false statement or representation.united states haddock,cir.rather,under the government theory,defendant intended to defraud metrobank simply by granting a loan to an uncreditworthy borrower.the indictment charged defendant with caus ing a car loan to be made to a borrower,who could not otherwise qualify for the loan,and then us ing the proceeds for his own personal benefit.app.at,count.the prosecutor synopsis of misapplication in her closing argument bears striking similarity misapplication occurs when a loan officer provides a loan to an individual who is not creditworthy for his own personal benefit.app.at.thus,the question before the court is whether a defendant who grants a loan to an uncreditworthy borrower possesses the necessary criminal intent to be guilty of willful misapplication where the bank is fully aware of the borrower poor credit history and where the defendant personal benefit is fully disclosed.
the term willful misapplication has no settled technical meaning,but was intended to include acts not covered by the words embezzle or abstract as such are used in the statute.united states king,cir.however,misapplication has been distinguished from maladministration.see also united states,cir noting that uncertain definition of willful misapplication has posed a challenge to courts attempting to distinguish bad judgment from bad conduct that is illegal.in united states davis,this court illustrated two examples of misapplication in relation to,a parallel statute governing misapplication at federal savings and loan institutions 
misapplication may occur when an officer,director,employee or other person subject to the statute knowingly lends money to a sham borrower or causes all or part of the loan to be made for his own benefit while concealing his interest from the bank.misapplication of funds occurs when funds are distributed under a record which misrepresents the true state of the record with the intent that bank officials,bank examiners,or the fdic will be deceived.thus,when a person within the ambit of receives material benefits of loans without disclosing this fact,misapplication has occurred.
cir quotations and citations omitted.under both examples,concealment of a personal stake is crucial.similarly,in rackley,at,we held that a bank could be defrauded under even when some bank employees knew about the nature of the transactions if the defendant failed to disclos e his interest on the loan documents,thereby flouting banking rules and regulations designed to protect the financial integrity of the bank.
defendant argues that while does not require a false statement or representation,it does require at least some attempt at concealment.absent that,defendant argues that his fully disclosed involvement in a loan to an uncreditworthy individual can not satisfy the intent to injure or defraud element.indeed,the jury was instructed that intent to defraud requires the specific intent to deceive or cheat app.at,and the government does not argue that this instruction was erroneous.even the case on which the government relies,united states unruh,cir,indicates that more is required than just showing that the defendant made a loan to an uncreditworthy individual the creditworthiness of the borrowers is relevant because a bank officer who,with intent to defraud or injure,makes loans to financially incapable individuals is guilty of misapplication of bank funds.id.emphasis added see also id.at noting that difference between upheld and overturned convictions was lack of bank record falsification in overturned conviction.
we agree with our sister circuits that the intent to injure and the intent to defraud are distinct options under violations see united states lung fong chen,cir section intent requirement is properly read in the disjunctive and thus proof of intent to injure or defraud is sufficient to support a conviction.valansi ashcroft,cir stating that intent may be shown either by intent to injure or intent to defraud united states castro,cir intent to injure need not be shown if there is intent to deceive or defraud.united states angelos,cir i t is important to distinguish between intent to injure and intent to defraud either will do,and they are not the same.proving that a defendant acted with the intent to defraud requires evidence of an intent to deceive,such as misrepresent ing the purpose of the loan,at,or concealing vital information,united states watts,cir.see,united states giraldi,cir approving jury instruction stating that intent to defraud means to act with an intent to deceive or cheat someone,ordinarily for the purpose of causing some finance sic loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself alteration in original.to prove an intent to injure,the prosecutor must show that the defendant knowingly committed a voluntary act,the natural tendency of which would be to injure the bank,regardless of whether the defendant had a subjective intent to harm the bank.united states bruun,cir collecting cases evans,at using phrases natural tendency could not have been to injure and tended to injure without clearly distinguishing intent to injure from intent to defraud.
the government has failed to establish that defendant acted with an intent to defraud metrobank.the loan file contained all the appropriate documentation,as well as additional information specifically detailing defendant benefit.defendant made no attempt to conceal the loan,the borrower poor credit,or the disbursement of loan proceeds.although defendant exercised control over the bank employees and encouraged them to issue a questionable loan,the government presented no evidence that defendant tampered in any way with the loan or misled the bank or its employees.haddock,at finding misapplication where bank president defendant substantial control over bank employees and over much of what occurred at the bank prevented his massively overdrawn check from bouncing for nearly two weeks.rather,defendant handed the loan to machala for review despite himself possessing the authority to issue the loan without loan committee or board approval,thus making the transaction that much more transparent.
the government cites to defendant inappropriate personal use of the vehicle,his request to reverse his own car loan,his application for duplicate title,and his early lien release as evidence of misapplication.some or all of these actions may constitute misapplication in and of themselves,but these actions did not form the basis of the misapplication charge for which defendant was convicted.and while these facts certainly indicate defendant desire to be free from his loan obligation,they do not show that he had any intent to defraud metrobank by issuing the fischer loan.see united states,cir w e may not uphold a conviction obtained by piling inference upon inference.
nor did the government produce any evidence of defendant intent to injure metrobank.whatever defendant motivation,we can not say that the fischer loan posed an indefensible risk to metrobank.king,at quotation omitted.fischer was cognizant of her loan obligation,and the testimony establishes that the loan was adequately collateralized.we recognize that certain cases within this circuit have hinted that a borrower adverse credit history may influence a misapplication determination.see,evans,at.however,the parties have not alerted us to any case holding that the borrower inadequate credit is sufficient in and of itself to sustain a conviction,nor have we located any such case.accordingly,we will not extend the reach of by reading it so broadly that we criminalize the making of a loan to an uncreditworthy individual even where a personal benefit is derived absent further circumstances.
the reisig real estate loan 
whether defendant possessed the intent to injure or defraud metrobank is also central to defendant conviction for misapplication on the reisig loan.as before,the nature of the loan makes analysis of the misapplication statute difficult.the government argues that defendant used his position to push through a loan appellee br.at and that the entire transaction was rife with deception id.at.we agree that deception played a major role in this transaction.the evidence at trial,however,predominately focused on defendant alleged fraud against campbell and reisig in relation to the sale and purchase price disparity.the government attempt to establish misapplication by bootstrapping from that fraud leaves a limited record of proof supporting defendant intent to injure or defraud metrobank.
yet,that record is sufficient to uphold defendant conviction on this count.from the inception of this deal,defendant caused metrobank to issue a loan in excess of the sale value by inflating the sale price.that disparity was heightened by defendant surreptitious,rejiggering of the sale price.campbell,reisig,and,most importantly,metrobank,were unwitting dupes.
true,the benefit to transtech was fully disclosed in the loan documents.however,the testimony established that the metrobank board previously had refused to deal with solomon and,by implication,transtech.as a result,defendant insertion of transtech could have led the jury to infer that defendant was generating income for himself and solomon at the bank expense in a manner designed to keep the loan committee and the board in the dark.
indeed,defendant inserted transtech as an intermediary in order to have a vehicle through which to withdraw those funds.defendant skimmed the money off the loan transaction in order to funnel it to solomon and himself.defendant had solomon use to purchase loans and pay off overdue loan balances in an effort to make it appear as if metrobank had generated income from which defendant could take dividends.the remainder of the money flowed directly out of the bank went back to reisig to cover a debt solomon incurred,roughly went to unindicted bentson,and some went into solomon pocket.
defendant actions in pushing through a fraudulent loan posed an indefensible risk of default to metrobank.king,at quotation omitted.collateralization and creditworthiness aside,by lying about the sale price to all parties involved in order to carve out funds for his personal use,defendant caused metrobank to pay out that,upon discovery of the ruse,would likely never be paid back.we are convinced,therefore,that the scheme was not only done with the intent to defraud metrobank,but also that it was likely to cause injury to the bank.
under,the government must prove that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution the defendant had the intent to defraud a financial institution and the bank involved was federally insured.united states waldroop,cir.consistent with the common law definition of fraud,requires a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact.neder united states,d.
section was intended to reach a wide range of fraudulent activity that undermines the integrity of the federal banking system.rackley,at.accordingly,courts have liberally construed the statute.united states bernards,cir table the broad range of schemes covered by the statute is limited only by a criminal creativity.quoting united states norton,cir.
the nelco real estate loan 
defendant argues that the nelco loan was an economically sound loan that benefitted the bank and brought defendant no personal gain.appellant br.at.consistent with the courts broad reading of the statute,as outlined above,as well as the statute express purpose of punishing the scheme to defraud and not the completed fraud,the government need not prove damages.neder,at.
defendant further argues that the final terms of the nelco loan were fully disclosed and that the metrobank board indisputably approved the loan.appellant br.at.defendant also argues that the board only reason for removing solomon was due to the presence of tax liens against him that could have clouded the chain of title.according to defendant,by replacing solomon with transtech he adequately addressed that concern.
there is substantial evidence,however,that the board conditioned its approval of the nelco loan not only on the receipt of good and clear title,but also on the removal of solomon from the transaction.the latter concern was spurred by solomon poor credit history and pattern of bad business practices.the jury heard testimony regarding this concern from several metrobank board members and employees.it also saw documentary evidence expressly stating this condition.
as the evidence sufficiently establishes,defendant schemed to defraud metrobank by concealing solomon continued involvement in the transaction.see united states hill,cir t he phrase scheme or artifice to defraud simply requires a design,plan,or ingenious contrivance or device to defraud.following the april,board meeting at which these conditions were imposed,defendant caused an attorney to prepare papers incorporating transtech with solomon as its sole shareholder.solomon signed the incorporation papers on april.defendant then had a metrobank employee prepare a credit memorandum clearly listing transtech involvement in the nelco loan and identifying solomon as transtech sole owner.that credit memorandum was signed by defendant on april,and placed into the credit file.the nelco loan closed on april.there was evidence that defendant did not present the revised transaction to the board and that no metrobank board member became aware of solomon continued involvement until after the loan closed.see united states cronic,cir noting that a defendant need not make an affirmative misrepresentation to violate.the jury heard testimony from board members that solomon replacement with transtech violated the conditions.united states ventura,d,banks are in the business of assuming risks.section of the bank fraud statute,however,prohibits individuals from exposing a bank to a risk of loss that the bank did not knowingly assume.
in addition,the government presented testimony that,following the loan closing,defendant sought to book the note that the bank had purchased for only as in income.the jury heard testimony that defendant sole source of income was derived from bank stock dividends and that metrobank had to turn a profit in order to generate dividends.it was reasonable for the jury to infer,therefore,that defendant concocted the nelco loan in order to generate fictitious income for metrobank.see id.a false representation by an individual as to the purpose of a loan may be sufficient to support a conviction of bank fraud under section.citing collected appellate cases.it was further reasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant incorporated transtech in order to mislead metrobank about solomon continued involvement because defendant required solomon continued participation in and acquiescence to the scheme in order to obtain the note with the intention of overbooking its value.
the attempted building sale 
the government presented testimony that a june occ examination of metrobank revealed that metrobank had issued a number of questionable loans,had strained its operating capital,and had violated a number of lending laws,including statutes capping the bank lending limit and restricting insider transactions.as a result,metrobank and the occ entered into a memorandum of understanding mou on october.that mou was designed specifically to control or limit defendant actions,including his lending authority and his ability to withdraw dividends.app.at.the mou also prevented defendant from affecting t he acquisition or sale of any fixed asset owned by the bank involving more than.app.at see also app.at.the metrobank building was a fixed asset.
as noted above,the bankruptcy court converted defendant chapter proceedings to chapter liquidation on december.four days later,metrobank held a board meeting at which defendant requested permission to sell unspecified bank assets.the board granted defendant the authority to sell bank assets subject to regulatory authority.app.at see also app.at.the testimony reflected that this condition referred to occ approval.at no point did defendant inform the board that his assets,including his bank stock,were now in the possession of the chapter trustee.
the jury heard testimony that defendant contacted phansalkar and,as detailed above,set in motion the proposed sale of the bank building.according to the testimony of board members present at the january,special board meeting,defendant made no mention of the impending sale.yet phansalkar testified that defendant called him after that meeting and told him that everything went smoothly and that the board had approved the transaction.app.at.
defendant appears to argue that the regulatory approval was not necessary because the building sale was coupled with a leaseback such that metrobank would not have to cease operating at its present location.this argument defies logic.the exact structure of that sale is irrelevant.there is abundant evidence that defendant attempted to effect a sale of the building and schemed to defraud metrobank by circumventing both the occ and the metrobank board restrictions.defendant contention that he committed no crime because the sale never closed is equally perplexing.the law clearly punishes the scheme rather than the completed fraud,and for that reason requires no proof that the bank actually suffered damages.neder,at.
defendant also asserts that a letter he submitted after his removal urging the metrobank board to approve the sale establishes that he never attempted to defy the sales restriction.the jury,however,heard the testimony of the incoming bank president that,in early january,defendant attempted to have the phrase subject to regulatory approval stricken from the december,meeting minutes.thus,the jury could have reasonably inferred that his efforts to alter the meeting minutes was done in order to close the sale in secret.
to prove a violation,the government must establish that an entry made in bank records is false the defendant made the entry or caused it to be made the defendant knew the entry was false at the time he made it and the defendant intended that the entry injure or defraud the bank or public officers.united states weidner,cir alteration in original quoting united states chaney,cir.the purpose of the statute is to ensure that upon an inspection of a bank,public officers and others would discover in its books of account a picture of its true condition.united states darby.
defendant argues that he could not commit a violation until the metrobank board meeting minutes in question became official minutes.the minutes at issue did not become official until approved by the board at the june,meeting.the minutes were not approved until after virginia evans,a metrobank employee,alerted the occ examiners that the proposed minutes omitted the board statement that its approval of the nelco loan was conditioned on removing solomon from the transaction.regardless of when the minutes became official,there was ample evidence from bank employees and occ examiners that neither set of minutes would have provided inspectors with a complete account of the loan.defendant counters that the may,meeting minutes fully disclosed solomon continued involvement and the internal dispute regarding whether his continued participation complied with the board conditions.appellant reply br.at.however,the falsification of the original minutes is rendered no less false simply because,through considerable effort and a piecing together of minute details,the bank might have been able to discover the truth.weidner,at quoting united states luke,cir.
in addition,the testimony made clear that defendant instructed chris rauchs,a contract typist,to delete the reference restricting solomon participation in the loan.the testimony reveals that defendant ordered rauchs to remove mention of that condition and that rauchs complied with that order.under,an omission of material information qualifies as a false entry.weidner,at quoting united states cordell,cir.it is beyond cavil that defendant omitted material information by deleting the condition of loan approval.moreover,it is inconsequential that defendant did not personally make the false entry it suffices that he set in motion management actions that necessarily caused bank personnel to make false entries.id.alteration in original quoting united states wolf,cir.
ii.sixth amendment right to chosen counsel 
due to defendant bankruptcy,he received appointed counsel on december.because trial was set to begin january,defendant counsel moved for a pro forma continuance in order to allow additional time for preparation.this continuance was granted,and trial was rescheduled for april.
on april,defendant met in camera with the district court.at this meeting,defendant explained that he wished to terminate his attorney because he believed counsel strained schedule prevented counsel from adequately preparing for trial.defendant also informed the district court that he was attempting to retain private counsel,but that his bankruptcy proceedings and divorce proceedings complicated his ability to do so.he stated that he had petitioned the colorado divorce court to release marital estate funds for that purpose and that he had an attorney lined up to begin working on the defense as soon as those funds were approved.the district court interpreted defendant request as a second motion for a continuance and denied that motion.
at an april,hearing,however,the district court disqualified solomon counsel.that required rescheduling trial for june.then,on april,solomon was deemed incompetent to stand trial.this led to a lengthy trial delay,which the district court admonished both parties counsel to use in preparing for trial.the prosecution did not file a superseding indictment eliminating the conspiracy charges until february,apparently the prosecution was waiting to see if the forced administration of psychotropic drugs would return solomon to competency.defendant trial was set for april.
on march,the colorado divorce court finally approved defendant request for marital estate funds,but did not release those funds until march.earlier on march,defendant filed what the court interpreted to be defendant third motion for a continuance.this request was predicated on the need for further discovery,as the prosecution previously had failed to turn over certain discovery materials.on march,defendant advised the court of the change in his financial status.
the district court conducted a hearing on april,to examine the continuance issue.it then denied the continuance,citing the age of the case and the substantial likelihood that defendant would make an plea for another continuance.app.at.the district court ordered defendant counsel to remain as defense counsel alongside defendant newly hired counsel.defendant sought reconsideration of the district court ruling on april,and this motion was promptly denied.
defendant argues that the district court refusal to grant the third continuance constituted an abuse of discretion that violated his sixth amendment right to be represented by counsel of his choice.
following the supreme court decision in united states,d,the only question facing this court is whether the district court wrongly denied the continuance that would have permitted sole representation by defendant hired counsel.id.at accord united states zangwill,cir unpublished in order for the automatic rule of to apply,in other words,it must first be shown that the trial court wrongly or erroneously denied the defendant his choice of counsel.united states hickey,wl,at.july,a s a threshold matter for the rule to apply,a court must have wrongly denied defendant choice of counsel.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion,united states dowlin,cir,balancing the defendant constitutional right to retain counsel of choice against the need to maintain the highest standards of professional responsibility,the public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process and the orderly administration of justice,united states,cir alteration in original quoting united states collins,cir.in striking that balance,we consider whether the continuance would inconvenience witnesses,the court,counsel,or the parties other continuances have been granted legitimate reasons warrant a delay the defendant actions contributed to the delay other competent counsel is prepared to try the case rejecting the request would materially prejudice or substantially harm the defendant case the case is complex and any other factors necessitate or weigh against further delay.id.at.
there is no evidence that the district court denial was due to unreasonable or arbitrary concerns.although we question whether the district court could entirely fault defendant for the numerous delays in bringing this case to trial,that was not the only reason provided.the age of the case was a serious concern.while not a particularly complex case,it involved multiple instances of fraud.thus,it required testimony of numerous witnesses.due to the scheduling burdens of the district courts,assembling the witnesses,lawyers,and jurors at the same place at the same time necessitates that broad discretion be granted trial courts on matters of continuances only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to the assistance of counsel.morris slappy,d quotation omitted see also.at recognizing a trial court wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and against the demands of its calendar citation omitted.
while the supreme court has stated that those without the means to hire counsel have no cognizable complaint in the face of adequate representation,caplin drysdale,chartered united states,d,the right to hire preferred counsel derives from a defendant right to determine the type of defense he wishes to present,at.defendant,however,fails to argue on appeal how the denial of the continuance affected trial preparation or defense strategy,or how the hybrid representation foisted upon him by the district court negatively impacted his defense.even if defendant had made such an argument,the record would not support it.defendant received notice that funds would be released more than one week before trial.defendant had contacted his hired attorney nearly one year before,and it was understood that the attorney would begin working on the case as soon as it became clear that funds would be available.moreover,the record contains no evidence that hired and appointed counsel differed in their approach to the case.the district court noted its respect for appointed counsel ability on several occasions,and appointed counsel in turn observed that hired counsel was a highly experienced criminal defense attorney.although defendant expressed dissatisfaction with what he perceived to be a lack of preparedness on the part of appointed counsel at the april,in camera meeting,there is no evidence that defendant opinion persisted,especially after the lengthy continuance caused by solomon incompetency and the prosecution subsequent delay in filing a superseding indictment.
for the foregoing reasons,we are unable to say that the district court denial of defendant third motion for a continuance on the eve of trial constituted an abuse of discretion.
iii.sentencing 
defendant month term of imprisonment resulted from a enhancement under b for intending to cause a million loss four separate enhancements for violation of a memorandum of understanding under b b,more than minimal planning under b,obstruction of justice under,and abuse of a position of private trust under and an increase above the sentencing guidelines range pursuant to.defendant also was ordered to pay restitution.defendant appeals each of these sentencing determinations.
in reviewing sentencing decisions,we review a district court factual findings for clear error but its legal determinations de novo.united states kristl,cir.similarly,we review the legality of restitution orders de novo,the underlying factual findings for clear error,and the amount for abuse of discretion.united states osborne,cir.we also review the district court interpretation of the mandatory victim restitution act mvra de novo.united states barton,cir.
because we have reversed defendant conviction for willful misapplication in association with the fischer automobile loan,resentencing will be necessary.nevertheless,we address defendant sentencing arguments since the same issues are certain to arise at resentencing.
intended loss 
under b m of the sentencing guidelines,a sentence should increase levels for a loss of more than million but less than million.where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss,the amount of intended loss should be used for sentence calculation purposes.see b cmt.the district court granted the enhancement based on defendant attempted sale of the metrobank building for million no actual loss occurred.the district court did,however,reject the government suggestion that the intended loss totaled million because insufficient evidence supported the government asserted valuation.rather,the district court determined that defendant intended to defraud metrobank of million by selling the metrobank building to a financially incapable entity owned by defendant for that amount.
defendant argues that the intended loss was zero bec
