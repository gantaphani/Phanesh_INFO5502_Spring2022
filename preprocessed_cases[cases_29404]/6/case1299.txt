while the legal issues in this case are all about the money,the heart of the matter is a romantic relationship and engagement turned sour upon the prospective bride discovery of her betrothed prior undisclosed homosexual liaisons.with that the parties mutual trust and expectations for a life together came to an end.promises had been made,funds had been commingled,a residence had been purchased and the had left her lucrative hong kong job and relocated to san francisco.both parties sued after the wedding was cancelled.many issues were decided on summary judgment.cutting through the evasive,testimony that followed in the court trial,the court concentrated on documentary evidence.in the end,neither party prevailed on their claims for damages,although plaintiff and appellant holden lee was awarded the diamond engagement ring.we affirm the judgment in its entirety.
factual background 
a.the relationship 
with a master degree in business administration from the wharton school,university of pennsylvania,holden has worked in hong kong and the united states in the fields of development and private investment.defendant and appellant janet yang,holding a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from stanford university,worked for merrill lynch in new york and hong kong and then for salomon smith barney in hong kong from to as a research analyst,eventually earning a year.
the two met in hong kong in and started dating in the winter of.holden moved to san francisco in the summer of to start a new job.the courtship continued and in march holden formally proposed to janet,presenting her with an engagement ring the diamond was from his grandmother ring.she accepted.the wedding was set for september.the couple agreed that janet would move to san francisco.
meanwhile,in spring the parties each added the other as a signatory on their respective hong kong accounts.before moving to san francisco,janet wired to one of holden bank of america b of a accounts.
janet arrived in san francisco on june,and began living with holden.holden added her to three of his b of a accounts.by july,they had purchased a condominium located at broadway.holden took out a loan in his name for,but the parties took title to the property as holden lee,an unmarried man and janet yang,an unmarried woman,as joint tenants.
janet started working at draper international earning annually.she had her payroll checks deposited directly into one of the b of a accounts.
the couple moved into their new home the first week of august.several weeks before the scheduled wedding,janet discovered love letters written to holden by different men from various parts of the world.she was utterly shocked,felt betrayed and made several suicide attempts.
janet made three withdrawals from the b of a accounts,transferring funds initially to a new local account and then to a maryland account that she held jointly with her parents.the first,on august,was for.the second,on september,was for.and finally on september,janet closed out the certificate of deposit.
holden and janet went to see her parents in maryland over the labor day weekend.the four of them talked,then janet left and her parents interviewed holden alone.her father videotaped the interview and also gave holden a handwritten questionnaire to fill out.according to holden,janet father indicated that if holden were to transfer a sum to their bank account in one week time,they would put aside their hesitations and support their daughter decision.they wanted reassurances that everything would be okay for their daughter.holden wrote in the figure.
the next day janet and holden cancelled the wedding.upon returning to san francisco they sold the condominium.per the closing statement holden received,janet difference representing holden recovery of,or of the staging cost that janet agreed to pay in connection with the sale.
litigation 
holden sued janet for conversion,imposition of constructive trust and money had and received.janet,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,fraud,interference with prospective business interests,negligence,battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
the court granted summary judgment in holden favor on the conversion and constructive trust counts with respect to the diamond engagement ring,and on all causes in the.holden remaining claims proceeded to court trial.
the trial court held that civil code section,subdivision a,defining a joint interest as one owned in equal shares,applied to the funds janet withdrew from the b of a accounts,not the california accounts law campal the b of a account was held in joint tenancy,with each party having a right to withdraw funds holden failed to establish that there was a different,enforceable agreement restricting janet right to withdraw funds from the accounts or rebutting the presumption of equal ownership no gift of funds was made in contemplation of marriage and the condominium was held in joint tenancy,and holden failed to prove any agreement whereby janet promised to reimburse him a based on the amount each contributed to the purchase of the property,or b for half of the taxes and operating expenses incurred after they called off the wedding.
the trial court entered judgment accordingly and ordered that neither party was the prevailing party for purposes of costs.these appeals followed.
ii.holden appeal 
a.the trial court correctly ruled that holden was not entitled to recover any funds that janet withdrew from the b of a.statutory framework 
holden primary contention is that he owned the funds that janet withdrew from the b of a accounts and therefore she must reimburse him.the trial court determined that he was not entitled to recover the funds.we agree.
we start with civil code section,which defines a joint interest as one owned by two or more persons in equal shares,by a title created by a single will or transfer,when expressly declared in the will or transfer to be a joint tenancy,subd.a.prior to july,this was the sole statutory authority governing the character and ownership of funds on deposit in joint tenancy bank accounts.
in the california law revision commission commission first recommended that the legislature enact the substance of article vi of the uniform probate code upc relating to accounts in banks and other financial institutions,with some substantive and technical revisions.recommendation relating to transfers cal.law revision com.recommendation.the commission explained that the proposed legislation would make it for those who have small transfer property upon death to designated beneficiaries without the need for probate.ibid.
legislation was introduced to effect the recommendation,but only a narrow statute was enacted.with further study and some revisions,the commission again recommended enactment of legislation similar to article vi of the upc.recommendation relating to nonprobate transfers cal.law revision com,recommendation.
enactment the legislature responded,enacting campal in stats,ch,and amending civil code section stats,ch,unlike civil code section,subdivision a,campal provides that a n account belongs,during the lifetime of all parties,to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit,unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent,subd.a.however,the provisions of section et concerning beneficial ownership as between parties are relevant only to controversies between these persons and their creditors and other successors,and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of these persons as determined by the terms of account contracts,italics added.
under campal,a financial institution may pay a account to any one or more of the parties on request and according to the terms of the account,subd.a.payment pursuant to section releases the financial institution from claims for amounts so paid,whether or not the payment mirrors the parties beneficial ownership of the account,subd.a.in turn this protective provision has no bearing on the rights of parties embroiled in a dispute over ownership of funds in,or withdrawn from,a multiparty account,subd.d.in addition,the withdrawal of funds by a party having the present right of withdrawal extinguishes survivorship rights as to those funds upon the party death,subd.c.
revision initially,campal pertained only to accounts with credit unions and industrial loan companies.com,west ann.ed.foll.former,repealed by stats,ch,operative july,see also com,west ann,supra,foll.in the commission proposed extending campal to include accounts in banks and savings and loan associations,explaining present law applicable to banks and savings and loan associations presumes that funds in a joint account belong equally to the parties during their lifetimes,without regard to how much each contributed to the account.but a person who deposits funds in a account normally does not intend to make an irrevocable present gift of any part of the funds deposited,and many people believe that depositing funds in a joint account in a bank or savings and loan association has no effect on ownership of the funds until death.campal conforms to the common understanding of depositors by presuming that funds in a joint account belong to the parties during lifetime in proportion to their net contributions.this rule is consistent with the federal gift tax rule that no completed gift occurs when the account is opened instead the gift occurs when the nondepositing party withdraws funds from the account.recommendation relating to accounts in financial institutions cal.law revision com,fns.omitted recommendation.
the legislature again responded and since july,campal has also covered accounts in banks,savings and loan associations and like organizations indeed,campal applies broadly to accounts in existence on july,and accounts thereafter established.
in light of the above statutory scheme we conclude that campal,not section,subdivision a,governs the accounts in question,contrary to the trial court call,subd.b.however,the result in this case is the same.
janet had a right to withdraw the funds the section rule of proportional ownership is not relevant to the power of a party to withdraw funds from an account rather,that issue is determined by the terms of the account in question,subd.a.here,prior to the engagement,holden maintained a prima account with b of a consisting of a prima interest checking account a regular savings account and an investment certificate of deposit.on june,the parties executed a master agreement which added janet as a signatory on all three accounts.the agreement provided if more than one person signs below,all accounts are held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship unless you specify another type of ownership under account names below we may pay out funds on any one of the signatures below unless you specify another number here.
both parties signed the master agreement.there was no insertion of another type of ownership or modification to the number of signatures.statements for the prima account for june through september were addressed to both holden and janet.
by definition the prima account was a multiparty account governed by campal.and under the terms of the account,janet had a right to withdraw the funds that she did,no questions asked.
further,the trial court found that holden failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties had a legally enforceable oral agreement that restricted janet or her right to withdraw the funds.the evidence on this point was conflicting.holden testified that janet was added to his accounts for convenience purposes and that they had an agreement that she would not make withdrawals except for household items,wedding preparations and the like.further they discussed that any large withdrawals from the accounts would be done by mutual consultation.on the other hand,janet testified that they had merged their bank accounts in hong kong and california.holden told her she had full access to all the money and could use it for any purpose.janet never asked holden for permission to withdraw any of the funds because she did not believe it was necessary.the trial court finding is supported by substantial evidence.this being the case,holden had no basis to challenge janet withdrawals.
holden has no right to reimbursement notwithstanding janet right to withdraw the funds,can holden nevertheless pursue reimbursement on an ownership theory premised on his proportionate net contribution to the sums on deposit in the b of a prima account no,he can not.
section,subdivision a delineates a rule of ownership of an account based on a party net contribution to the sums on deposit.an account is nothing more than a contract of deposit of funds between a depositor and a financial institution,subd.a.the term sums on deposit refers to the balance payable on the account plus any life insurance proceeds added because of the death of a party,subds.a,b.thus,at any point in time the sums on deposit in an account belong to a party in proportion to his or her net contribution.
this proportionate ownership rule,however,does not articulate a rule of ownership as to funds withdrawn by a party,irrespective of that party net contribution.campal is not clear on this point.thus we look to the legislative history,in particular the commission reports which led to the enactment and revision of campal.such reports are part of a statute legislative history.people cruz cal th,fn,d.reports of commissions which have proposed statutes that are subsequently adopted are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statutes.van arsdale hollinger cal d,overruled on another point in privette superior court cal th,fn,d.
as pointed out in the commission,and recommendations,the proposed proportional ownership rule tracked the federal gift tax regulation specifying that the creation of a joint account does not result in a completed gift to the cotenant rather,the gift occurs when the nondepositing party makes a withdrawal from the account.recommendation,supra,at recommendation,supra,at recommendation,supra,at.
the pertinent regulation set forth the following example of a transfer resulting in a taxable gift if a creates a joint bank account for himself and b,there is a gift to b when b draws upon the account for his own benefit,to the extent of the amount drawn without any obligation to account for a part of the proceeds to h.the regulation additionally explained donative intent on the part of the transferor is not an essential element in the application of the gift tax to the transfer.the application of the tax is based on the objective facts of the transfer and the circumstances under which it is made,rather than on the subjective motives of the donor.g.the same identical provisions are operative today 
we note that the transmittal letter and introduction to the most recent commission report suggest that withdrawal of funds does not affect the parties ownership rights to the funds withdrawn and that the source of funds bears on determination of the interests in funds deposited in or withdrawn from an account.recommendation,supra,at.in light of the commission repeated reference to the federal gift tax regulation designating the gift consequence which attaches to withdrawn funds when the regulatory conditions are met,we conclude that these generalizations are only partially correct.rather,ownership of withdrawn funds which exceed the withdrawing party net contribution passes to that party by way of gift to the extent,but only to the extent,there is no independent legal obligation requiring the party to account for the proceeds.whether such an obligation exists depends on the objective facts and circumstances of the transaction rather than on the transferor subjective intent.g and h.
a duty to account could arise under various scenarios.for example,the parties could enter into an agreement restricting the lesser contributing party right to withdraw use and apply funds.as well,campal authorizes a special power of attorney applicable to campal account.see.the acting under this power is required to maintain records that would permit an accounting of his or her acts if requested by the grantor legal representative and liable for disbursements other than those to or for the grantor benefit,unless made pursuant to the grantor written authorization.id.at subds.i,j.so,too,a withdrawing party may have fiduciary responsibilities with respect to trust funds deposited in the joint account.see evangelho presoto th,d,discussed post.
under the dissent analysis,campal rule of proportionate ownership of an account would automatically activate the obligation of a party to account for any withdrawal of funds beyond his or her net contribution.if this were the case,why would the commission consistently invoke the federal gift tax rule without this concept,and notwithstanding that parties to an account never agreed to a restricted use or application of withdrawn funds,and the lesser contributing party had an unrestricted present right to withdraw funds,he or she would be put to an accounting unless the parties intended that ownership of the account were other than in proportion to net contributions.as the commission has explained,campal marked a change in existing law such that the mere opening of a joint account no longer triggers a change in ownership of the funds deposited thereto.recommendation,supra,at recommendation,supra,at recommendation,supra,at.however,the withdrawal of funds will transfer ownership by way of gift under the circumstances described above.
the gift tax rule eschews the painstaking tracing and accounting of funds that parties would be advised to undertake in the absence of an agreement,special power of attorney or other legal obligation requiring the lesser contributing party to account for the funds.further,the rule is consistent with the present right to withdraw funds,but it does not defeat a party expectation of proportionate ownership in the account.amounts withdrawn by a party that are not paid or applied to the use of another party are deducted from that party deposits for purposes of determining his or her net contribution,subd.a.thus,the net contribution of a lesser contributing party who at any given time withdraws more than his or her share from the account for personal purposes will be adjusted accordingly.assuming continued contributions to the account,the adjustment would make up for the withdrawal.
evangelho presoto,cited by holden,does not compel a different result.there,beneficiaries of their mother revocable trust demanded an accounting from their sister,who served as trustee prior to the mother death.the sister improperly transferred trust funds to a joint account she shared with her mother,and used those funds for herself.the reviewing court concluded the beneficiaries made the necessary showing for an accounting of the trust and the joint account over the entire period of the trust.the court viewed the issue as relating to the use and disposition of the funds during the lifetime of the parties evangelho presoto,supra,th at,d and concluded the section presumption of proportionate ownership applied to the joint account at,d.all sums in the account came from and belonged to the mother trust and had the sums remained in the account,they would have become part of the trust.evangelho is distinguishable.the defendant had no right to withdraw or use the joint account funds for personal use because their source was the mother trust.as a fiduciary she was properly charged with accounting for the trust proceeds which funded the joint account.there were no similar restrictions on janet.
we are mindful that the trial court concluded that holden did not make a gift to janet of funds in the b of a account.however,the court was operating under ordinary notions of gifting and gifting in contemplation of marriage,which require subjective donative intent.see pt,post.in contrast,under the gift tax concept,the party making the greater net contribution to an account need not subjectively intend to make a gift of funds whenever the other account holder withdraws funds.rather,it is the nature of the transaction that is,the withdrawal of funds under the terms of a joint account by one possessing a present right of withdrawal,coupled with the absence of an agreement between the parties or other legal obligation restricting a party right to withdraw or use the funds or otherwise account for the proceeds.
we reiterate that substantial evidence sustains the trial court finding that there was no agreement between the parties restricting janet or the amount she could withdraw from the account.the inescapable inference is that likewise there was no restriction on the use of the withdrawn funds and hence no legal obligation to account for or return them.by virtue of janet unrestricted right to withdraw and apply funds to her own benefit,ownership of the funds passed to her by way of gift,within the meaning described above.
options exist,short of the unrestricted multiparty account,that would avert the danger that a lesser contributor would clean out the account for personal use.for example,other types of accounts are available such as a pay on death account,subd.b.as well,a special power of attorney is available under campal,and the parties can always tailor their own legally enforceable agreement restricting the lesser contributing party right to withdraw use and apply funds from the account.finally,it bears noting that many types of accounts escape the purview of campal altogether accounts established for deposit of funds of a partnership,joint venture,or other association for business purposes,subd.b accounts controlled by the authorized agents s or trustee s for a corporation,unincorporated association or charitable or civic organization id.at subd.b fiduciary or trust accounts where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement id.at subd.b and accounts established for funds of a ward,conservatee or decedent id.at subd.b.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed in its entirety.
i agree with the majority that the california accounts law campal et and not civil code section applies to the bank of america accounts.however,i must disagree with the majority interpretation of the campal and its conclusion that janet had a property right to take and keep holden funds based upon her contractual right to withdraw funds from the account.these two rights are not coextensive.
under the statutory scheme,property rights in funds deposited into a joint tenancy account are governed by section.this statute creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership in favor of the depositor of the funds,according to his or her net contribution,during the account holders lifetimes.this presumption of ownership can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.in contrast,the contractual right to withdraw funds from the is,the power or present right of governed by sections,and et.these provisions address only the relationship between the bank and the signatories to the account.essentially,they protect the bank from liability if one of the account holders withdraws funds belonging to the other.this core distinction between ownership of the funds and the power of withdrawal was clearly articulated in the law revision commission introduction to its report on the campal amendments withdrawal of funds does not affect the ownership rights of the parties to the funds withdrawn.recommendation relating to accounts in financial institutions cal.law revision com,recommendation.
in short,i would conclude that janet can not rely upon her bare power of withdrawal to assert an ownership interest in holden funds accordingly,i would reverse the trial court judgment insofar as it applied civil code section to the joint tenancy accounts and insofar as it placed upon holden,and not janet,the burden of proving ownership of the funds he deposited.
a.an unrestricted power of withdrawal does not include the right to acquire funds deposited by a cotenant 
the majority opines that an unrestricted right of withdrawal from a joint bank account creates the inescapable inference that there is no legal obligation for either party to account for the cotenant funds once they are withdrawn from the account.opn.ante,at.in my view,neither the legislative history nor the statutory scheme of the campal supports this inference.further,the majority conclusion creates inconsistencies among the campal provisions.
legislative intent 
according to the majority,if depositor a places funds into a joint account with b and does not restrict b power to withdraw those funds,b is entitled to withdraw and keep percent of the funds in the account unless a can prove some other,independent obligation requiring b to account to a for the funds.in practical effect,according to the majority,merely by setting up the account,a has made a de facto gift of the funds on deposit to b since b can,without warning or permission,withdraw and keep percent of the funds.this is contrary to the purpose of the campal,which was adopted to avoid the imputation of a gift of sums deposited into a joint tenancy account.
under the prior law,any funds deposited into a account automatically became the property of the cotenants in equal shares.the law revision commission commission comments to the campal noted,however,that the depositors of funds into such accounts often had no intention of making a gift of the funds to the other joint tenant,but only intended to allow the cotenant to withdraw funds on the depositor behalf and to acquire the funds upon the depositor death.therefore,the commission recommended changing the law so that depositors,according to their common understanding,would retain their ownership interests in their deposited funds,according to their net contribution.recommendation relating to nonprobate transfers cal.law revision com,recommendation.
following the commission recommendations,the campal was adopted.this new law governing joint accounts contained two central principles joint tenants no longer own the funds in a joint account but only according to their net contributions and a cotenant has no property right to funds beyond his or her net contribution unless such right can be proven by clear and convincing evidence.thus,while the intent of the campal was to expand the depositor right to retain ownership of his or her funds,the majority decision instead operates to shrink those rights,standing the legislative purpose on its head under prior law holden would have been presumptively entitled to recoup half of the deposited funds from janet.the adoption of the campal was intended to give holden the presumptive right to recoup his full net contribution here,far more than half of the deposited funds.but under the majority analysis,holden is not presumptively entitled to recoup any of his funds instead,janet is presumptively entitled to keep as a gift all funds she withdraws unless holden can prove otherwise.this result thwarts the basic purpose of the campal and is particularly incongruous here,where the trial court made an express finding that no gift of the funds had been made to janet.
i would conclude that the legislature intended to safeguard the depositor holden rights by requiring the withdrawing party janet to prove that she is entitled to keep the depositor vice versa.
statutory language 
as noted,the provisions of the campal distinguish between the power of withdrawal on the one hand and ownership interests on the other.the latter is governed by section,which provides that the parties to a bank account shall own the account during the lifetime of the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit,unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.in contrast,the power of withdrawal or present right of withdrawal is a concept designed to protect the financial institutions in which the accounts are held.it exonerates those institutions from the responsibility of tracking the parties respective ownership interests in an account funds and holds the bank harmless if one cotenant takes more than his or her share of the funds,subd.c.
this purposeful distinction between the power of withdrawal and ownership interests is echoed more than once in the statutory scheme.section,subdivision c provides it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this section defining net contribution to provide a definition for the purpose of determining ownership interests in an account as between the parties to the account,and not as between the parties and the financial institution.italics added.section,subdivision d states the same principle in its mirror image the protection provided by this section to the financial institution has no bearing on the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in,or withdrawn from,accounts italics added.thus,under the campal,the power of withdrawal does not include the power to acquire ownership rights in the funds withdrawn.
this interpretation of the campal is in keeping with the previously cited commission by the majority as only partially correct that ownership rights of the parties are not affected when sums are withdrawn.it is also in harmony with the comments prepared by the drafters of the uniform probate code upc,the source of the campal the comment to upc section containing language identical to states th is section does not undertake to describe the situation between parties if one withdraws more than he is then entitled to as against the other party.other sections protect a financial institution in such circumstances without reference to whether a withdrawing party may be entitled to less than he withdraws as against another party.presumably,overwithdrawal leaves the party making the excessive withdrawal liable to the beneficial owner as a debtor or trustee.of course,evidence of intention by one to make a gift to the other of any sums withdrawn by the other in excess of his ownership should be effective.recommendation relating to transfers,supra,cal.law revision com.at,italics added.
thus,both the statutory language and the explanatory comments tell us that the present right of withdrawal as between the account holders and the bank does not effectuate a present right to transfer of ownership of the funds as between the account holders.
consistency among the campal provisions 
according to the majority,the withdrawal of funds under the terms of a joint account by one possessing a present right of withdrawal,coupled with the absence of an agreement between the parties or other legal obligation restricting a party right to withdraw or use the funds or otherwise account for the proceeds causes ownership of the funds to pass to the withdrawing party by way of gift,ante.this is contrary to the plain language of the statute,which provides that a n account belongs,during the lifetime of all parties,to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit,unless there is a clear and convincing evidence of a different intent,subd.a.the majority sidesteps this result by concluding that the ownership clause of section is limited to sums on deposit,and therefore,once the funds are withdrawn,the ownership provisions of section no longer apply,ante.but this interpretation of section can not be reconciled with other provisions of the campal.
section,subdivision c,for example,provides that a unilateral withdrawal of funds by a joint tenant with a present right of withdrawal eliminates the rights of survivorship with respect to the funds withdrawn.the plain meaning of this provision is that a withdrawal of funds eliminates only the parties respective rights of survivorship in those funds present ownership rights would not be affected.but under the majority construction,a withdrawal not only severs the right of survivorship but also effectuates a complete transfer of ownership of the funds.this interpretation negates the separate entitlement of a right of survivorship and reduces section,subdivision c to irrelevance.
similarly,under section,financial institutions are protected from liability for allowing the withdrawal of funds not owned by a cotenant.subdivision d then expressly provides that these protections ha ve no bearing on the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in,or withdrawn from,accounts italics added.under the majority interpretation,the campal precludes any ownership disputes between
