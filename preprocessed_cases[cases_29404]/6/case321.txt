opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we are called upon to determine whether the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code prohibit a lender from seeking to recoup unpaid escrow payments from a bankrupt debtor outside the confines of the bankruptcy proceeding.the bankruptcy court and the district court found that countrywide home loans,countrywide did not have a claim against francisco and anna rodriguez and thus did not violate the automatic stay when it recalculated the rodriguezes escrow payments on their mortgage account to include certain escrow arrears.for the following reasons,we will vacate the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the rodriguezes financed the purchase of their home in monmouth county,new jersey,with a mortgage from first mutual,with countrywide acquiring the mortgage thereafter.under the terms of the mortgage,the rodriguezes monthly payments consisted of an amount to cover principal,interest,and any late fees,and an amount to cover taxes,insurance,and other charges.app.at.the second part of the monthly taxes,insurance,and other to be paid into an escrow account and used,as needed,by countrywide to pay for those expenses as they became due.
as permitted by the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,et,countrywide required the rodriguezes to pay an amount into the escrow account that was higher than required to cover the actual cost of taxes,insurance,and other charges.respa permits a mortgagee to determine the amount of a debtor monthly payment by estimating the property taxes and insurance that will be due over the ensuing twelve months and to add a reserve requirement equal to of that total estimate.see a.
the rodriguezes fell behind on their mortgage payments and filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on october.at the time of filing,they were in arrears on eight months of mortgage payments,plus foreclosure fees and costs.while the bulk of the arrearage was for principal and interest payments,was an escrow arrearage for taxes,insurance,and other charges.of the amount,was attributable to payments which countrywide had already made for taxes,insurance,and other charges.the remaining was the amount for which countrywide had not made corresponding payments for taxes,insurance,and other charges.in other words,the amount was countrywide cushion.despite this arrearage,at the time of the bankruptcy filing,the rodriguezes escrow account showed a projected surplus of,although the actual balance was a negative amount due to the missing escrow payments.
after the bankruptcy filing,countrywide issued to the rodriguezes a revised escrow analysis and demand for payment which indicated that countrywide had boosted the monthly escrow payment amount to from.the new figure was comprised of for the base escrow payment,for the s hortage payment,and for the r eserve requirement.app.at.the basis for the increased escrow amount was a escrow shortage.
countrywide calculated the revised escrow payments by presuming that the escrow balance at the time of the bankruptcy filing was because the rodriguezes had not contributed any funds to the account.in other words,countrywide did not treat the cushion as funds that existed at the time of the bankruptcy filing.instead,by starting with a balance of in the escrow account,countrywide calculated the escrow shortage as including the cushion that the rodriguezes had never,in fact,paid.
on december,the rodriguezes filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to enforce the automatic stay pursuant to a,compel countrywide to cease post petition collection of escrow claims,and award the rodriguezes attorneys fees and costs.id.at id.at.the denial of that motion,affirmed by the district court,is the subject of this appeal.
on january,countrywide filed its proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.countrywide sought a total of in arrears,including for the escrow deficiency,which was the amount that countrywide actually had paid out for taxes,insurance,and other charges.in other words,countrywide did not seek to recoup the cushion via the bankruptcy process,but rather by assessing the rodriguezes higher monthly escrow payments to make up for the shortfall.
the rodriguezes argued to the bankruptcy court and then to the district court that countrywide was required to submit the entire escrow shortage as part of its proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding,and that the bankruptcy code automatic stay forbids collecting any of the shortfall by increasing the amount of the escrow payments.the bankruptcy court and district court disagreed,holding that the amount by which a bankrupt homeowner is delinquent in monthly payments that would be maintained in escrow by the lender until the amount was due is not subject to the automatic stay.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under a.we have jurisdiction under d and and exercise the same standard of review as the district court when it reviewed the original appeal from the bankruptcy court.in re handel,cir.thus,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and exercise plenary review over that court legal determinations.id.
iii.discussion 
countrywide escrow recalculation 
the issue before us is whether the automatic stay prevents countrywide from accounting for the escrow shortage in its calculation of the rodriguezes future monthly escrow payments.the automatic stay,under section a of the bankruptcy code,is triggered upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.that section provides that any act to collect,assess,or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case,outside the course of the bankruptcy proceeding,is stayed during the bankruptcy case.a.the automatic stay is applicable only to claims that arise,and not to claims that arise.see in re grossman,cir en banc.
crucial to our determination of whether countrywide violated the automatic stay is whether it had a claim against the rodriguezes for the unpaid prior to the rodriguezes bankruptcy filing.if countrywide had no claim for the unpaid escrow amount until that amount was,in fact,needed to cover taxes,insurance,and other charges that were due,then countrywide had no right to collect those monies and it could not have violated the automatic stay.
the bankruptcy code defines claim very broadly to mean 
a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured or 
b right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment,whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,secured,or unsecured.
in reviewing,the supreme court observed that the language right to payment in the definition of claim meant nothing more nor less than an enforceable obligation.johnson home state bank.it reiterated that congress intended by this language to adopt the broadest available definition of claim.id see also fcc nextwave pers.commc ns.
in grossman,this court,sitting en banc,endorsed this broad interpretation of the term claim,overruling the narrow accrual test established in avellino bienes frenville,which focused on the phrase right to payment in and when the right arose.grossman,at,overruling frenville,cir.we explained that this focus on the right to payment failed to give sufficient weight to the other words in the statutory definition that modified the term claim,contingent,unmatured,and unliquidated.at.these modifiers,we concluded,mean that a claim can exist under the bankruptcy code by virtue of the terms contingent,unmatured,and disputed,before a right to payment exists under state law.id.
with this definition in mind,we turn to the terms of the mortgage.the mortgage held by countrywide specified the rodriguezes required payments and countrywide right to accelerate the payment date and seek foreclosure in case of default 
monthly payment of taxes,insurance,and other charges.borrower shall include in each monthly payment,together with the principal and interest as set forth in the note and any late charges,a sum for a taxes and special assessments levied or to be levied against the property t hese items are called escrow items and the sums paid to lender are called escrow funds.
the escrow funds are pledged as additional security for all sums secured by this security instrument.
charges to borrower and protection of lender rights in the property.borrower shall pay all governmental or municipal charges,fines and impositions that are not included in paragraph.
if borrower fails to make these payments or the payments or the payments required by paragraph,or fails to perform any other covenants and agreements contained in this security instrument then lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of the property and lender rights in the property,including payment of taxes,hazard insurance and other items mentioned in paragraph.
grounds for acceleration of debt.
a default.lender may,except as limited by regulations issued by the secretary in the case of payment defaults,require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this security instrument if 
i borrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment required by this security instrument prior to or on the due date of the next monthly payment,or 
ii borrower defaults by failing,for a period of thirty days,to perform any other obligations contained in this security instrument.
foreclosure procedure.if lender requires immediate payment in full under paragraph,lender may foreclose this security instrument by judicial proceeding,and any other remedies permitted by applicable law.
the bankruptcy court concluded that countrywide recalculation of the rodriguezes monthly escrow payments did not violate any provision of the bankruptcy code.the court explained that the claim was limited to amounts that countrywide had a right to retain and not merely a right to collect.under that reasoning,no debt to countrywide arose until countrywide had,in fact,made a corresponding payment for taxes or insurance.the court was concerned that requiring countrywide to recover the full escrow amount through the bankruptcy process would have the effect of requiring countrywide to give the rodriguezes an loan for the entire course of the chapter plan.it explained that respa permitted countrywide to recalculate escrow payments to avoid a shortage and that the rodriguezes had failed to explain satisfactorily why such rights afforded lenders under respa should be abrogated in the context of a chapter bankruptcy proceeding.app.at.it further explained that countrywide serves merely as a conduit for tax and insurance payments and should only recover in bankruptcy for such items actually disbursed on behalf of mortgagors.id.at.the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court conclusion that countrywide was free to include the escrow shortage in its calculation of the rodriguezes future monthly escrow payments.
on appeal,the rodriguezes argue that under the broad definition of claim,when they fell behind on their mortgage payments countrywide had a claim for the escrow deficiency,including the cushion.accordingly,the argument goes,countrywide violated the automatic stay by taking into account part of the escrow deficiency in calculating their escrow payments.countrywide responds that the word claim,as used in section,is limited to debt,and that a n escrow account is not a debt but rather is an asset held by the servicer for the borrower that is used to pay the borrower tax and insurance obligations and to protect the lender collateral.appellee br.at.in support of this narrow definition of claim,countrywide cites johnson,in which the supreme court stated,in a footnote addressing a different issue determining which liabilities are extinguished in a bankruptcy case,that debt has a meaning coextensive with that of claim.at.under countrywide view,if it foreclosed and sold the property,the rodriguezes would certainly not be liable for the escrow shortfall related to the cushion because at that point there would be no future payments and thus no need for a cushion.instead,according to countrywide,the rodriguezes would be liable for the escrow shortfall corresponding to payments countrywide actually made for taxes and insurance.thus,countrywide contends,the shortage with respect to the escrow cushion is not a debt,and instead is merely a security interest 
the court of appeals for the fifth circuit addressed a substantially similar question in campbell countrywide home loans,cir.in campbell,the security instrument to which the lender and the debtors were parties had terms similar to those here,including a term authorizing the lender coincidentally,countrywide the right to collect regular payments to cover insurance and tax expenses and to retain those funds in an escrow account for payment as the expenses became due.at.after the debtors filed for bankruptcy,countrywide filed a proof of claim that did not include unpaid escrow amounts,but indicated in its proof of claim that it intended to increase the debtors monthly mortgage payments to recoup the unpaid escrow amounts.id.at.the debtors filed suit,alleging that countrywide violated the automatic stay,and the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the debtors,holding that countrywide had impermissibly attempted to collect a debt and that its actions violated the automatic stay.id.
countrywide argued to the fifth circuit that it had no claim to the unpaid escrow amounts because a claim only accrued when countrywide paid an escrow expense.id.at.the fifth circuit rejected countrywide imaginative argument,and,relying on the terms of the loan documents,found that countrywide had a claim against the debtors each time the debtors failed to make an escrow payment.id.at.the fifth circuit stated that t he touchstone of any claim is an enforceable right to payment from the debtor.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.because the loan documents provided countrywide with recourse,countrywide had a claim against the debtors prior to the bankruptcy filing when the debtors failed to pay required escrow amounts.id.
the fifth circuit rejected countrywide arguments that a respa allowed it to recalculate the mortgage payments in the manner it used and b under b the bankruptcy court did not have the power to modify countrywide right to recalculate the mortgage payments.the fifth circuit stated that its holding did not limit countrywide rights under respa or the bankruptcy code,and that t he automatic stay operates to halt collection of claims,even those claims held by a creditor protected by the provision of section b.id.at citing collier on bankruptcy a ed.it reached this conclusion because t he stay does not determine a creditor claim but merely suspends an action to collect the claim outside the procedural mechanisms of the bankruptcy code.therefore,staying countrywide attempt to collect escrow amounts does not bar countrywide from asserting its contractual rights in the bankruptcy court.id.
finally,although the fifth circuit held that countrywide had a claim to the unpaid escrow amounts,it reversed the bankruptcy court determination that countrywide had violated the automatic stay because countrywide did not collect the increased escrow amount or take any action outside the bankruptcy proceeding to collect it.id.at.simply asserting in a proof of claim that the debtors owed a higher escrow payment did not violate the automatic stay.id.
the bankruptcy court ruled on the rodriguezes motion approximately three months before the fifth circuit decided campbell.the district court noted that decision,but discussed,albeit briefly,only the fifth circuit conclusion that countrywide had not violated the automatic stay,and concluded that the fifth circuit did not actually reach the issue at hand in the instant appeal.app.at.that,of course,was incorrect.
we find campbell persuasive.it instructs that the loan documentation is relevant in determining whether there is an obligation to mak
