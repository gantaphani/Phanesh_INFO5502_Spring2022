arden intengan intengan appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the court sustained the demurrer to her third amended complaint without leave to amend.essentially,intengan sought to preclude respondents from foreclosing on her property,contending they lack authority to do so under the relevant deed of trust and notice of default.in this appeal,intengan argues that the demurrer should not have been sustained because she alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action,including a claim based on respondents alleged failure to contact her or attempt with due diligence to contact her before recording the notice of default.she also contends the court should have ruled on her motion to strike the demurrer.
we will reverse the judgment.in the published portion of our opinion,we conclude that judicial notice could not be taken of respondents compliance with civil code section,and intengan allegations that respondents did not comply with the statute were sufficient to state a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we conclude that intengan failed to state any other cause of action and the court did not err in denying leave to amend.
facts and procedural history 
on june,intengan borrowed from countrywide bank,countrywide.the loan was secured by a deed of trust on intengan real property in daly city.under the deed of trust,the beneficiary was mortgage electronic registration systems,mers,the trustee was respondent recontrust company,recontrust,and bac home loans servicing lp bac serviced the note.bac successor is respondent bank of america,
on or about december,mers assigned its beneficial interest in intengan deed of trust to the bank of new york mellon fka the bank of new york,as successor trustee to jpmorgan chase bank,as trustee for the holders of sami ii trust,mortgage pass through certificates,series bank of new york.
on december,recontrust,as agent for the beneficiary under the deed of trust,recorded a notice of intengan default on intengan loan the notice of default and election to sell under deed of trust indicated that she was more than in arrears.
purportedly accompanying the notice of default was a declaration by samantha jones,mlo loan servicing specialist of bac home loans servicing,lp,in which she states under penalty of perjury that bank of america tried with due diligence to contact the borrower in accordance with california civil code section.the declaration does not provide any facts to support this conclusion,such as the specifics of any attempt to contact intengan.
a notice of trustee sale was recorded by recontrust on april,setting a sales date of april.intengan does not allege that the sale occurred,and the respondents brief represents that no sale took place and that intengan has been in possession of the property for nearly two years without making payments on her loan.
original,first amended,and second amended complaints 
on april,the day before the scheduled foreclosure sale intengan filed a complaint against defendants including bac and recontrust,asserting causes of action for declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and an accounting.before any defendant responded,intengan filed a first amended complaint and then a second amended complaint.
bac and rincontrust filed a demurrer to intengan second amended complaint.the court sustained their special demurrer to the first and second causes of action,with leave to amend in order to state a violation of civil code section.the court also sustained their general demurrer to the third cause of action for an accounting,without leave to amend.
third amended complaint 
intengan filed her third amended complaint in january against bac,recontrust,and others.this time,she purported to assert causes of action for wrongful foreclosure,fraud,intentional misrepresentation,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,slander of title,quiet title,declaratory relief,violation of business and professions code section,unjust enrichment,and injunctive relief seeking to enjoin the pending foreclosure sale.
in february,respondents filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint.although the demurrer is central to the issues on appeal,neither intengan nor respondents include the demurrer in the record.the record does contain,however,respondents request for judicial notice in support of their demurrer,by which they sought judicial notice of the deed of trust on intengan property,the notice of default,the assignment of the deed of trust to bank of new york,and the notice of trustee sale.
in june,intengan filed an opposition and motion to strike the demurrer,on the grounds that defendants bank of america demurrer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a demurrer,is uncertain,is ambiguous,is unintelligible,is irrelevant,is false,contains improper matters is not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of california.she urged that the demurrer misstated facts and ignored the law,and therefore it should be stricken or denied.the purported motion was not accompanied by a notice of hearing.
the court granted respondents request for judicial notice and sustained their demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal was entered on june.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
as mentioned,intengan argues that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer and further erred in failing to rule on her motion to strike the demurrer.

wrongful foreclosure first cause of action 
the first purported cause of action in intengan third amended complaint is for wrongful foreclosure.intengan alleges there was an unauthorized trustee,document irregularities,improper signatories,and a defective notice of default she further alleges that due to the chain of assignments,it is now unknown and doubtful who is the current with legal authority and standing regarding the mortgage on the subject property.intengan also claims that bac and recontrust failed to comply with a number of civil code sections regulating nonjudicial foreclosures,including the requirement of contacting the borrower,or attempting to do so with due diligence,under civil code section.
failure to tender 
as a general rule,a plaintiff may not challenge the propriety of a foreclosure on his or her property without offering to repay what he or she borrowed against the property.karlsen american sav.loan ass d,judgment on the pleadings properly granted where plaintiff attempted to set aside trustee sale for lack of adequate notice,because a valid and viable tender of payment of the indebtedness owing is essential to an action to cancel a voidable sale under a deed of trust see united states cold storage great western savings loan d,the law is that a trustor or his successor must tender the obligation in full as a prerequisite to a challenge of the foreclosure sale fpci re hab e g investments,d,tender rule is based on the equitable maxim that a court of equity will not order a useless act performed if plaintiffs could not have redeemed the property had the sale procedures been proper,any irregularities in the sale did not result in damages to the plaintiffs.
intengan third amended complaint alleges her willingness to tender the appropriate and reasonable mortgage payments.that allegation,however,is plainly insufficient.a valid tender of performance must be of the full debt,in good faith,unconditional,and with the ability to perform.
intengan third amended complaint also asserts that tender is not required inasmuch as there is a void foreclosure,not a voidable one.citing dimock emerald properties th.however,intengan does not allege that she was fraudulently induced into the loan nor does she otherwise attack the validity of the debt.nor do her allegations indicate a defect in the foreclosure procedure that would render a resulting sale void on its face,particularly when considered in light of the documents that were judicially noticed.on the other hand,as we shall discuss post,intengan has alleged a defect in the foreclosure procedure the failure to comply with civil code section which,if true,would render the foreclosure either void or voidable.whether or not this would remove the need to allege tender is an issue we need not address,since an allegation of tender is unnecessary for another reason.
according to the allegations of the third amended complaint as well as representations in the respondents brief no foreclosure sale had occurred as of the time of the ruling on the demurrer.while the tender requirement may apply to causes of action to set aside a foreclosure sale,a number of california and federal courts have held or suggested that it does not apply to actions seeking to enjoin a foreclosure sale at least where the lenders had allegedly not complied with a condition precedent to foreclosure.see,pfeifer countrywide home loans,th,failure to allege tender of full amount owed did not bar declaratory relief or injunctive relief based on wrongful foreclosure,where lenders had not yet foreclosed and borrowers alleged that lenders had not complied with servicing regulations that were a condition precedent to foreclosure mabry superior court th,borrower not required to tender full amount of indebtedness in seeking to enjoin foreclosure sale based on alleged failure to comply with,mabry barrionuevo chase bank,d,dist.lexis,at pp.fn.no tender requirement where foreclosure sale had not yet occurred,in case where noncompliance with,was alleged barrionuevo.
wrongful foreclosure theories 
intengan contends that the foreclosing beneficiary under the deed of trust,bank of new york,has not been shown to have standing to foreclose.she alleges defendants made transfers,assignments of the subject loan and that due to the chain of assignments,it is now unknown and doubtful who is the current with legal authority and standing regarding the mortgage on the subject property.
intengan fails to allege wrongful foreclosure on this ground.the records of which the court took judicial notice,without intengan objection,identify the foreclosing beneficiary to be the bank of new york.specifically,the recorded deed of trust names mers as the original beneficiary,the recorded assignment of the deed of trust assigns all beneficial interest under the deed of trust from mers to bank of new york as the new beneficiary,and the notice of trustee sale was dated and recorded after bank of new york became the beneficiary.see fontenot,supra,th at court may take judicial notice of the fact of the existence and legal effect of legally operative documents,such as the identity of the beneficiary designated in the deed of trust,where not subject to reasonable dispute scott jp morgan chase bank.lexis.while intengan pleading includes the unsupported conclusion that there was no assignment of the deed of trust in favor of the bank of new york mellon fka the bank of new york as trustee,the recorded assignment of which the court took judicial notice shows there was,and intengan neither alleges nor argues facts from which the assignment might be inferred to be invalid.see fontenot,supra,at.under these circumstances,the judicially noticed facts contradict the conclusory allegations of the third amended complaint,and those allegations may be disregarded.id.at hoffman,supra,th at.
similarly,intengan alleges that respondents could not provide a valid chain of assignments from previous lenders including countrywide.from the outset,however,mers not countrywide was the beneficiary under the deed of trust,and the assignment of the deed of trust shows that mers assigned its interest to bank of new york.see fontenot,supra,th at.
intengan also alleges the conclusion that the notice of trustee sale arose from an unauthorized trustee,document irregularities,and improper signatories.although she alleges that the substitution of recontrust as trustee was not recorded until february,the records of which the court took judicial notice including the original deed of trust show that recontrust was the trustee from the beginning and throughout the date of the notice of default and notice of trustee sale.see fontenot,supra,th at.furthermore,both beneficiaries and trustees and their agents may record notices of default,subd.a.thus,recontrust was authorized to record the notice of default as the trustee,and it was also authorized to record the notice of default as the agent of the beneficiary.intengan allegations fail to state facts from which it may be inferred that the notice of default or the notice of trustee sale was invalid on this ground.
intengan further alleges that respondents did not comply with the requirements of civil code sections,or,before proceeding with the foreclosure.there is no civil code section.her allegations as to civil code section are unavailing,but her allegation as to civil code section suffice to state a cause of action.
in january,when intengan third amended complaint was filed,and june,when it was dismissed,civil code section provided it is the intent of the legislature that the mortgagee,beneficiary,or authorized agent offer the borrower a loan modification or workout plan if such a modification or plan is consistent with its contractual or other authority,subd.b.intengan alleged that,pursuant to civil code section which we take to mean defendants are now contractually bound to implement the loan modification as provided therein.but civil code section does not grant a right to a loan modification.to the contrary,it merely expresses the hope that lenders will offer loan modifications on certain terms and conspicuously does not require lenders to take any action.mabry,supra,th at fn.in other words,t here is no duty under civil code section to agree to a loan modification.hamilton greenwich investors xxvi,llc th.
civil code section precludes a trustee like respondent recontrust or mortgage servicer such as bac respondent bank of america from recording a notice of default until days after the loan servicer has made initial contact with the borrower to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options for avoiding foreclosure,or has satisfied the due diligence requirements of the statute,subd.a.due diligence requires sending a letter by first class mail,making three attempts to contact the borrower by telephone,and sending a certified letter if no response is received within two weeks of the telephone attempts,subd.e.
intengan expressly alleged in her third amended complaint that respondents did not comply with such contact and due diligence requirements pursuant to civil code section.italics added.in support of their demurrer,respondents sought judicial notice of the notice of default,including the attached declaration of samantha jones,which averred that bank of america tried with due diligence to contact intengan in accordance with california civil code section.but in her opposition to the demurrer,intengan argued that she had never spoken with jones in person or over the telephone,heard any recording from jones over the telephone or any other method recorded by jones,defendants bank of america or julian,or communicated with jones by any method of communication whatsoever nor received any communication whatsoever from jones other than by the jones declaration defendants bank of america and julian have provided.
construing the allegations of the third amended complaint broadly as we must on demurrer,we conclude that intengan stated a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure based on respondents alleged noncompliance with civil code section.intengan alleged that defendants did not contact her or attempt to contact her with due diligence as required by the statute.although respondents sought judicial notice of jones declaration regarding compliance with the statute,intengan disputed the truthfulness of jones declaration by denying that she was ever contacted or received any telephone message.she also argued at the demurrer hearing that it was inappropriate to turn the hearing into an evidentiary hearing in other words,that a demurrer may not be sustained by resolving a conflict in the evidence.and in this appeal intengan argues that,while judicial notice may be taken of the existence of a document such as a declaration,accepting the truth of its contents presents an entirely different matter.
intengan is correct.civil code section requires not only that a declaration of compliance be attached to the notice of default,but that the bank actually perform the underlying acts,contacting the borrower or attempting such contact with due diligence that would constitute compliance.while judicial notice could be properly taken of the existence of jones declaration,it could not be taken of the facts of compliance asserted in the declaration,at least where,as here,intengan has alleged and argued that the declaration is false and the facts asserted in the declaration are reasonably subject to dispute.see,joslin ins.brokerage d,facts disclosed in a deposition and not disputed could be considered in ruling on a demurrer,but facts disclosed in the deposition that were disputed could not be,since judicial notice of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those instances where there is not or can not be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to be judicially noticed.joslin.indeed,respondents only sought judicial notice of the documents attached to its request,not the underlying fact of its attempt to contact intengan.
taking judicial notice that the bank actually performed certain acts that might constitute compliance with its statutory obligations,based solely on a declaration that avers compliance in a conclusory manner,would of course be vastly different than merely taking judicial notice that the declaration was signed and attached to the notice of default or,as discussed ante,from taking judicial notice of the legal effect of a legally operative deed of trust that names its beneficiary.at least in this case,what the bank actually did to comply with the statute is reasonably subject to dispute and can not be judicially noticed,even though the existence of the declaration and the legal effect of a deed of trust is not reasonably subject to dispute and can be judicially noticed.see skov bank th,where bank sought judicial notice of a notice of default declaration stating compliance with,whether the bank complied with section is the type of fact that is reasonably subject to dispute,and thus,not a proper subject of judicial notice skov.
furthermore,even if the facts stated in jones declaration could be the subject of judicial notice,the declaration contains only a conclusory assertion that bank of america complied with the statute nowhere does it state when,how,or by whom the elements of due diligence were accomplished,or how the declarant knew if they were more importantly,the most these averments could do is create a factual dispute as to whether respondents complied with the statute.see mabry,supra,th at competing accounts as to possibility of compliance with,created conflict in the evidence.a demurrer is simply not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.joslin,supra,d at see skov,supra,th at assuming the truth of the plaintiff allegations,a disputed issue of compliance with,can not be resolved at the demurrer stage see also barrionuevo,supra,d,dist.lexis at borrowers allegation that bank did not contact them before filing the notice of default was sufficient to state a violation of,despite judicial notice taken of declaration in notice of default that asserted statutory compliance argueta morgan chase d,despite judicial notice of notice of default including declaration of compliance with,plaintiff allegations were sufficient to preclude dismissal where plaintiffs alleged that they did not receive phone calls,phone messages,or letters before the notice of default was recorded argueta.
on this basis,intengan stated a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure based on the purported failure to comply with civil code section before recordation of the notice of default.for this reason,it was error to sustain the demurrer 
fraud and intentional misrepresentation second and third causes of action 
intengan second and third causes of action are for fraud and intentional misrepresentation.the trial court sustained the demurrer as to both of these causes of action on the ground they were not alleged with specificity.
to state a cause of action for fraud or intentional misrepresentation,a plaintiff must allege a misrepresentation of fact false statement,concealment or nondisclosure the defendant knowledge of the representation falsity the defendant intent to induce reliance the plaintiff justifiable reliance and resulting damage.anderson deloitte touche th.moreover,fraud must be alleged with specificity the requirement of specificity in a fraud action against a corporation requires the plaintiff to allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,their authority to speak,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote,and when it was said or written.tarmann state farm mut.auto ins.th.
the second cause of action for fraud alleges that respondents committed fraud and are continually doing so when they know that they do not have the legal authority to act on the subject loan and to prematurely foreclose,and yet proceeded to represent themselves with such authority.intengan also alleges that respondents represented themselves as lender s assignee s trustee s of the subject loan and property with no legal authority to act and foreclose.to the extent these allegations assert that respondents misrepresented their standing to foreclose in the sense of being the beneficiary and trustee,the allegations of the third amended complaint do not state facts from which it can be inferred that bac or recontrust did not have standing to foreclose see ante.accordingly,no fraud claim can be stated on this ground.
intengan argues that respondents committed fraud by denying intengan efforts to modify the loan.as a matter of law,however,respondents had no duty to modify the loan see ante,and intengan does not specifically allege that she was promised a modification,let alone when and by whom such a promise was made.the allegations of the third amended complaint do not assert facts from which intengan conclusions of fraud can be inferred on this basis.
intengan alleges that respondents changed the terms of the loan by assessing exorbitant fees and charges and falsely indicating they were part of the loan,and she further points to respondents obfuscating or misrepresenting the later steep monthly payments and interest rate increases on the loan after deceptively marketing risky loans with their primary purpose to sell the loans to the secondary market.but intengan does not allege the specific bac or recontrust employee who made these purportedly false representations,describe the employee authority to do so,or identify when the statement was made.nor does she allege the purported misrepresentations with the specificity necessary to state a fraud claim.
lastly,intengan alleges that respondents committed fraud by misrepresenting that the assignment,disclosures,and foreclosure documents,such as the notice of default,were proper,when they were not.as discussed ante,the allegations of her pleading for the most part do not state facts from which it can be inferred that the documents were improper,particularly in light of the judicially noticed documents.the one exception to this arises as to the notice of default and compliance with civil code section,but even on that basis intengan fails to allege a fraud claim.
intengan argues that recontrust committed fraud by falsely representing that bac and recontrust complied with their civil code requirements.although intengan does not clearly allege when,where,and by whom this representation of compliance with civil code section occurred,she does allege that the fraud arose upon the signing of the notice of default moreover,those factual details are provided by the declaration attached to the notice of default,which respondents themselves brought to the attention of the trial court on december,jones represented,on behalf of bac,that bank of america tried with due diligence to contact the borrower in accordance with california civil code section.intengan alleges that this representation is untrue.
the problem,however,is that intengan does not sufficiently allege the elements of fraud as to this representation,particularly with respect to justifiable reliance.although she does allege in general terms that she relied justifiably on t hese misrepresentations by defendants,she fails to allege facts or offer any argument as to how she could justifiably rely on a representation that she knows to be false.if,as she now insists,she did not receive a communication from respondents before the notice of default as required by civil code section,she could not have justifiably relied on the representation accompanying the notice of default that she did.the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer as to intengan second cause of action for fraud.
intengan third cause of action for intentional misrepresentation was based on respondents alleged refusal to modify the loan and their assessment of purportedly exorbitant fees and charges.for the reasons stated ante with respect to the fraud claim,intengan fails to allege an intentional misrepresentation claim based on these allegations.accordingly,the demurrer was properly sustained as to intengan third cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.
breach of contract fourth cause of action 
the fourth cause of action alleges breach of the deed of trust by transferring intengan loan,securitizing her loan,and imposing charges and fees without disclosure.
as to transfer and securitization,intengan does not point to any provision in the deed of trust that precludes assignment or transfer of either the loan or the beneficiary interest in the deed of trust.to the contrary,the deed of trust provides in paragraph the note or a partial interest in the note together with this security instrument can be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower.furthermore,intengan provides no legal authority for the proposition that a lender transfer of a note or associated deed of trust including a transfer for the purpose of securitization breaches a contract between the lender and the borrower.see badger mortgage electronic registration systems.july,no.cv pct nvw,dist.lexis rejecting breach of contract claim based on theory that loan documents do not authorize anyone to assign the note,securitize the debt,and so forth see also robinson countrywide home loans,th,no cause of action for wrongful initiation of foreclosure or declaratory relief based on lack of standing to foreclose due to securitization robinson gomes countrywide home loans,th,gomes.
as to the charges and fees purportedly assessed without disclosure,there is no allegation as to the contractual provision precluding or limiting charges or fees or requiring disclosures,or any allegations detailing the charges or fees purportedly assessed.intengan alleges nothing more than a legal conclusion,which is insufficient to state a cause of action.
breach of implied covenant of good faith fifth cause of action 
the fifth cause of action alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.intengan asserts that bac and recontrust breached the covenant by failing to modify her loan.
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing prevents one contracting party from depriving the other contracting party of the benefits of the agreement actually made.guz bechtel national,cal th.however,i it can not impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.id.at.
no express or implied term of the promissory note or deed of trust entitled intengan to a loan modification on her default.accordingly,intengan fails to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see wienke indymac bank fsb,no.cv njv,dist.lexis dismissing clam for breach of the implied covenant based on the lender refusal to provide a feasible loan modification.
slander of title sixth cause of action 
intengan alleges that defendants have not shown clearly and convincingly any proper chain of assignments originally from countrywide home loans,as they could not establish legal standing as specified and set forth herein this complaint and fails to render effective the california civil code sec foreclosure laws.essentially,she argues that respondents had no standing to foreclose.
for reasons explained ante,the documents judicially noticed by the court indicate the standing necessary both for recordation of the notice of default and for the notice of trustee sale.intengan does not allege facts that give rise to a contrary conclusion.moreover,a borrower can not file a preemptive suit seeking damages or declaratory relief based on the allegation that the foreclosing party lacks standing.robinson,supra,th at fn.preemption suit not allowed,although action to enjoin the foreclosure may be pursued see gomes,supra,th at.
furthermore,intengan allegations do not state a slander of title claim.slander of title is a tortious injury to property resulting from unprivileged,false,malicious publication of disparaging statements regarding the title to property owned by plaintiff,to plaintiff damage.southcott pioneer title d,see manhattan loft,llc mercury liquors,th.a disparaging statement is one intended to cast doubt on the existence or extent of another property interest.glass gulf oil d.to be actionable,the disparaging statement must be relied upon by a third party and cause the property owner pecuniary loss.appel burman d.intengan allegations in her claim for slander of title do not identify an unprivileged,false,malicious publication of a statement intended to cast doubt on her property interest,on which a third party relied,causing intengan pecuniary loss.
quiet title seventh cause of action 
intengan alleges that defendants have no estate,right,title or interest on the subject property when they acted as foreclosing entities.but she has no quiet title cause of action as a matter of law,for two reasons.
first,the purpose of a quiet title action is to establish one title against adverse claims to real property.intengan does not allege any facts demonstrating that respondent recontrust or bac claims any interest adverse to her title recontrust is the trustee,and bac is the loan servicer.on this basis,intengan fails to state a quiet title cause of action.
second,to state a cause of action to quiet title,intengan had to allege facts demonstrating that she is the rightful owner of the property that is,that she has satisfied her obligations under the deed of trust.lane vitek real estate indus.group d.thus,a borrower can not quiet title to secured property without alleging that he or she paid the debt secured by the property,miller provost th,a mortgagor of real property can not,without payi
