background 
mitec owns patented technology for irradiating beef.in june,bank made four loans to mitec,a equipment purchase loan,a loan to prefund sba financing,and two revolving working capital lines of credit totaling.all four loans were secured by a properly recorded lien on nearly all of mitec assets,including its patents.one year later,sba guaranteed debentures whose proceeds were used to repay bank term loan,and made a loan to mitec under its loan program as part of these transactions,bank and sba entered into a lienholder agreement.the agreement subordinated bank revolving lines of credit,but not its equipment loan,to sba loan.the agreement required bank to notify sba of a mitec default and gave sba the right to purchase bank security interests prior to any foreclosure sale.sba filed a ucc financing statement on its loan to mitec.neither sba nor bank recorded the lienholder agreement.
in,mitec defaulted.duane strempke,a vice president in bank special assets division,and brian dalziel,president of mitec,failed to rehabilitate the defaulted loans.mitec then sent shareholder and loan guarantor tim white to negotiate with strempke.white was a lawyer who had a fair amount of experience from a bank point of view dealing with unfortunate loans.white testified that strempke acted like a pit bull and described the unsuccessful negotiations as not friendly.at this point,a group of mitec shareholders,including tim white,formed mitec partners to purchase bank secured loans and acquire mitec assets at a foreclosure sale.all but one of mitec partners members were investors in mitec.mitec partners proceeded secretly,concerned that dalziel would discover the plan and raise money to make the defaulted loans current,or locate a rival that could outbid mitec partners for mitec assets.james peterson,president of mitec partners,testified that if its plan were successful,the other mitec shareholders would be wiped out and would lose their money.
attorney robert downer represented mitec partners in negotiating the loan purchase with bank strempke.after hard bargaining in negotiations downer described as cordial,mitec partners sent bank a letter of intent loi agreeing to purchase the loans for their full unpaid balance,approximately,with the exact price to be determined at closing.the loi stated it is our understanding that bank has forwarded all relevant documentation to bob downer for his review and that these documents will be received in his office today.strempke signed the loi for bank after adding an exhibit a which provided this loi is intended to set forth the general terms of the loan purchase,with final definitive terms and conditions to be set forth in an agreement and related assignments to be prepared by mitec partners,llc legal counsel and subject to bank approval.mitec partners signed exhibit 
before closing,strempke provided mitec partners with several documents related to the mitec loans but not bank lienholder agreement with sba.peterson testified that,prior to closing,when he asked strempke how the sba loan plays into this,strempke responded,we scrape them off if you want us to,which peterson understood to mean that bank was the senior lender.strempke acknowledged that the lienholder agreement was material to the deal and testified that he would have provided it to mitec partners had he been aware of the agreement before the closing.
it is undisputed that no one from mitec partners ever asked bank about the relative priority of the sba loan.nor did mitec partners contact sba or mitec for information about the sba loan,no doubt because mitec partners was concealing its plans.prior to closing,downer searched public records,learning that sba recorded a security interest in mitec assets after bank security interest,which reinforced downer belief that all bank security interests were prior to sba interest.downer never asked strempke whether all bank loans were senior to any other security interest in mitec assets.nor did he collect and review mitec documents in the possession of mitec partners members.stephen carfrae,a founding member,had an sba document in his files stating that a t or prior to loan closing,bank must execute a third party lender agreement,and requiring that the sba loan be secured by a lien on mitec equipment s ubject only to the prior lien of bank in the amount of.downer admitted that,had he seen this document before closing,he would have ascertained exactly what the sba position would have been.
