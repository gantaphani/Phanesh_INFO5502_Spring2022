introduction 
defendants invest america mortgage corporation invest america and lynda sens appeal from a summary judgment entered in favor of plaintiff trust one mortgagee corporation trust one on claims of breach of contract,indemnity,breach of guaranty,and declaratory relief.we affirm.
invest america and trust one were parties to a broker agreement by which trust one funded real estate secured loans brokered by invest america.this lawsuit arose out of two loans made,pursuant to that broker agreement,to a georgia resident and secured by real property in georgia.after the borrower early default,the real property security was foreclosed nonjudicially,leaving a substantial deficiency.trust one sued invest america to recover its losses under the broker agreement indemnification provision,which required invest america to indemnify losses or repurchase loans in the event of a borrower early default or fraud in the loan application.
invest america argues trust one is barred from recovery because it did not comply with georgia law requiring a nonjudicial foreclosure to be submitted to and approved by a court before seeking to recover a deficiency.trust one contends georgia law is inapplicable because trust one sued for indemnification under the broker agreement,not for a deficiency,and the broker agreement contained a provision stating the agreement was governed by california law.
the choice of law provision is enforceable and the broker agreement is governed by california law.this conclusion leads to the primary issue is the indemnification provision in the broker agreement enforceable under california antideficiency legislation we hold the indemnification provision is an indemnity,not a guaranty,and does not violate california antideficiency laws because invest america,the indemnitor,was not the same as or substantially identified with the principal loan obligor.the indemnification provision is enforceable notwithstanding the nonjudicial foreclosure.

trust one assigned the mathews loan and the beechwood loan to impac funding corporation impac.those assignments were made pursuant to an agreement between trust one and impac called the impac seller agreement.the impac seller agreement requires trust one either to repurchase assigned loans or to indemnify impac for losses caused by a borrower early default or in the event of a misstated appraisal.
the borrower defaulted on the mathews loan after making only three payments.the borrower defaulted on the beechwood loan after only one payment.neither default was ever cured.
the two security deeds were foreclosed nonjudicially.both the mathews property and the beechwood property were sold by public auction on may.the mathews property sold for.the beechwood property sold for.
as part of the process of foreclosing the security deed for the mathews loan,impac obtained two broker price options from realtors in the atlanta area and commissioned two residential appraisal field review reports on the mathews property.those options and reports assigned values to the mathews property as of the date of sale that were substantially lower than the value assigned by the appraisal in the loan package presented by invest america.the record does not show whether similar options and reports were prepared on the beechwood property.

california law governs the broker agreement.
the focus of invest america argument is that georgia code section,entitled confirmation of foreclosure sales,applies to enforcement of the indemnification provision and bars recovery.that georgia code section provides that following nonjudicial foreclosure of a real property,no action may be taken to obtain a deficiency judgment unless the person instituting the foreclosure proceedings shall,within days after the sale,report the sale to the judge of the superior court of the county in which the land is located for confirmation and approval and shall obtain an order of confirmation and approval thereon,subd.a.
the broker agreement contains a choice of law provision requiring the agreement to be governed by,construed,and enforced in accordance with california law.a freely and voluntarily choice of law provision in a contract is enforceable if the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction or any other reasonable basis exists for the parties choice of law.nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d.the choice of law is reasonable if one of the parties lives in the chosen state.hughes electronics citibank delaware th,d.
trust one is a california corporation and has its principal place of business in irvine.those facts are sufficient to establish a reasonable basis for enforcing the broker agreement choice of law provision.hughes electronics citibank delaware,supra,th at,d.
ii.the indemnification provision of the broker agreement is an indemnity,not a guaranty.
the determination california law governs the broker agreement is just the first step in the analysis.even though the real property security was located in georgia,the indemnification provision of the broker agreement is subject to california antideficiency legislation.see consolidated capital income trust khaloghli d.california antideficiency legislation is comprised of sections,and of the code of civil procedure.these provisions code of civil procedure sections and indicate a considered course on the part of the legislature to limit strictly the right to recover deficiency judgments,that is,to recover on the debt more than the value of the security.brown jensen cal d.california law bars a deficiency judgment following nonjudicial foreclosure of real property code civ,or following foreclosure of a purchase money deed of trust on a residence.
invest america contends the indemnification provision of the broker agreement really is a loan guaranty,the enforcement of which constitutes an action for a deficiency prohibited by california law under union bank gradsky d.gradsky.california law recognizes a distinction between an agreement to indemnify and a guaranty.indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties,or of some other person.a surety or guarantor is one who promises to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another,or hypothecates property as security therefor.a guarantor makes a direct promise to perform the principal obligation in the event the principal fails to perform.an indemnitor does not make a direct promise to perform the principal obligation,but promises to reimburse the indemnitee for losses suffered or to hold the indemnitee harmless.gill johnson d.
the indemnification provision of the broker agreement is not a direct promise by invest america to perform the borrowers obligations.the indemnification provision states invest america shall indemnify and hold trust one harmless from any losses resulting from the identified conditions.the indemnification provision does not obligate invest america to indemnify trust one for all borrowers defaults,but only from losses resulting from the conditions listed.as trust one points out,invest america obligations under the indemnification provision might be triggered without a borrower default,for example,when the loan package contains misrepresentations about the value of the property securing the loan.thus,the indemnification provision in the broker agreement is just indemnification.
iii.the indemnification is valid under california antideficiency legislation.
our conclusion the indemnification provision of the broker agreement is an indemnity governed by california law does not end the analysis.we next must determine whether the indemnification is unenforceable under california antideficiency legislation.
whether an indemnity violates california antideficiency legislation the commonwealth mortgage and gradsky cases.
in commonwealth mortgage assurance superior court d.commonwealth mortgage,the court held an indemnity agreement was unenforceable because it was an artifice designed to avoid the proscriptions of the antideficiency laws.in commonwealth mortgage,the borrowers entered into agreements to indemnify a mortgage guaranty insurer that insured the borrowers performance on promissory notes secured by deeds of trust.id.at.the borrowers defaulted,and the insurer sought to enforce the indemnifications after paying the lender claim.id.at.the court framed the primary issue as whether the indemnity agreements were unenforceable as a wrongful attempt to circumvent antideficiency legislation.id.at.i n addressing the issue of whether the indemnity contracts herein are unenforceable we look to their purpose and effect in order to determine whether they are attempts to recover deficiencies in violation of code of civil procedure section.commonwealth mortgage,supra,d at.
the commonwealth mortgage court found analogous gradsky,supra,d.in gradsky,the plaintiff bank made a construction loan to a property owner and secured the loan with a first trust deed on the property.id.at.as additional security for the loan,the defendant,a general contractor,guaranteed the property owner note.ibid.when the property owner defaulted,the bank first foreclosed the trust deed nonjudicially and then sued the to recover the unpaid balance on the loan after application of sale proceeds.id.at.the gradsky court held the bank was estopped from recovering the unpaid loan balance from the guarantor because the election to foreclose nonjudicially destroyed the guarantor right of reimbursement from the principal debtor.id.at.the gradsky court determined,as between the bank and the guarantor,the loss ultimately should fall on the bank because it made the election to pursue a nonjudicial foreclosure and owed the guarantor a duty not to impair the guarantor remedies against the principal debtor.ibid.
discussing gradsky,the commonwealth mortgage court stated we find the discussion in gradsky pertaining to the relationship between the debtor and the guarantor to be of particular significance to
