factual and procedural history 
in or around september,force framing and magnolia,llc magnolia entered into a written contract.magnolia owned a property in riverside where it was constructing condominiums the project.the contract reflected that force framing would provide framing labor,material,equipment and services for the project and magnolia would pay force framing 
at or about the time force framing began working on the project,magnolia gave force framing a preliminary information sheet.the preliminary information sheet listed magnolia contact information,the general contractor contact information,the jobsite address,and the lender contact information.the lender was identified as east west bank,in diamond bar however,chinatrust was actually the construction lender.
force framing served east west bank,in diamond bar,with the statutorily required preliminary notice.force framing account manager declared that she sent the preliminary notice to east west bank b ased on the information contained in magnolia preliminary information sheet.
in its complaint,force framing alleged that it completed its obligations under the contract however,magnolia still owed.force framing alleged that to the extent chinatrust improperly disbursed funds subsequent to the service of force framing stop notice,and that funds were now inadequate to pay force framing,then chinatrust should be required to pay force framing.force framing filed its complaint on december.
chinatrust moved for summary judgment.chinatrust argued that force framing sent the required preliminary notice of intent to file a stop notice to east west bank,not chinatrust therefore,chinatrust was entitled to summary judgment because force framing did not comply with the statutory stop notice requirements.chinatrust explained that it recorded a deed of trust against the property,which gave force framing constructive notice that chinatrust was the actual construction lender.
force framing opposed chinatrust for summary judgment.force framing argued that it did comply with the statutory stop notice requirements because it served the reputed lender,east west bank,subd.a.force framing asserted that it was reasonable to rely on magnolia representation that east west bank was the construction lender,and therefore,force framing was not obligated to search the county records for chinatrust deed of trust.
the trial court found that a subcontractor who seeks a stop notice has a duty to investigate who owns the construction loan.the trial court concluded that the statute and the case law require that it be incumbent upon the contractor or subcontractor to do that minimal research.in other words,the trial court held that a subcontractor has to be able to show that he searched the county records,or somehow researched who owns the construction loan,in order to prove that he reasonably,in good faith,accidentally served the wrong lender.since force framing did not inspect the county records,or otherwise verify the owner of the construction loan,the trial court concluded that force framing could not be excused from serving the wrong bank.therefore,force framing chinatrust improperly disbursed funds following force framing attempt to serve the not stand,because chinatrust can not be held responsible for improperly distributing funds when the preliminary notice was not properly served.consequently,the trial court granted chinatrust for summary judgment.

the cases diverge when discussing how a claimant may prove that he held a good faith belief that the reputed lender was the actual lender.in romak,the appellate court held that a good faith belief that the reputed lender was the actual lender should be proven by evidence that the claimant examined county records to ascertain the identity of the construction lender,the building permit or construction deed of trust.romak,supra,d at.in brown,this court held that a claimant did not need to check county records in order to demonstrate that he held a good faith belief that the reputed lender was the actual lender.brown,supra,d at.rather,this court concluded that a good faith belief could be proven by evidence that the claimant relied upon information supplied by the general contractor.id.at.in kodiak,the appellate court held that the information on which a reasonable claimant should rely must be cloaked with sufficient indicia of as statements from the owner,general contractor,or lender itself or their as to distinguish this information from a mere guess or some conjecture.kodiak,supra,d at.
