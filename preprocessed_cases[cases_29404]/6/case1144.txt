introduction 
between and,albert wilcox made a series of loans to james hardwick.in,hardwick filed this action to recover usurious interest and prevent wilcox from foreclosing on property securing his loans.wilcox countersued for breach of contract and judicial foreclosure.the trial court entered judgment in favor of hardwick,finding,among other things,that usurious interest payments made over the course of the relationship offset the principal debt,and that hardwick could recover in interest payments he made during the two years prior to the filing of this lawsuit.
on appeal,wilcox contends the judgment must be reversed because hardwick waived his usury claim with respect to any loan payment he made prior to april and the statute of limitations bars hardwick claim with respect to any loan that was paid off more than two years before this lawsuit was filed.we affirm the judgment.

b.the forbearance agreement 
in april,wilcox initiated nonjudicial foreclosure by filing a notice of default on note.hardwick requested additional time to bring the loan current.wilcox consulted with counsel who advised him to require hardwick to sign a forbearance agreement.
on august,wilcox and hardwick executed a forbearance agreement and agreement to extend final payment due on note the forbearance agreement.the forbearance agreement was divided in two parts,recitals and terms and conditions.the recitals referenced only the last two loans that wilcox made to hardwick,referring to note as the first loan or the first note and note as the second loan or the second note.according to the recitals,wilcox initiated a nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding after the first note matured on february,hardwick responded by requesting an extension of time to pay off the first loan until december,and wilcox agreed to grant the extension pursuant to specified terms and conditions.
the essential term of the forbearance agreement was that the time for hardwick to pay off the first loan note would be extended to december,provided that hardwick made timely monthly interest payments on both the first and second notes.the parties further agreed that if hardwick failed to make a timely interest payment under either loan,wilcox could proceed with foreclosure pursuant to notices that had already been filed that he could schedule and continue a sale of either property securing the loans and that acceptance of a late payment did not constitute a waiver of these rights.
the forbearance agreement also contained a release of hardwick past and future claims against wilcox.this broad release was divided into three somewhat redundant paragraphs,suggesting the language may have been cobbled together from other contracts.the first paragraph stated borrower acknowledges and agrees that as of the date of this agreement,none of the obligations under the notes or the payment of the amounts owing thereunder,are subject to any right of offset,defense or counterclaim of any kind or nature whatsoever.borrower hereby fully and forever waives,releases,acquits,and discharges lender from any and all liabilities,claims,demands,defenses,actions,causes of action,rights whatsoever of any kind and nature collectively claims,known or unknown,which borrower may now or hereafter have against lender,existing or occurring prior to or as of the execution and delivery of this agreement by lender and borrowers,and which in any way,directly or indirectly relate to,result from or arise out of the note,or this agreement.borrowers hereby waive the provisions of ccp.
the second paragraph of the release contained a waiver of hardwick rights under civil code section.section states a general release does not extend to claims the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of execution of the release,which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.this statutory language was quoted in the agreement in all capital letters.
the final paragraph of the release stated borrower acknowledges that he is aware that he may hereafter discover claims presently unknown or unsuspected,or facts in addition to or different from those that are known or believed to be true,as to the matters released herein.nevertheless,it is the intention of borrower,through this agreement,to fully,finally and forever release all such matters and all claims related thereto that do now exist,may exist,or hereafter are found to exist subject to the limitations set forth herein.in furtherance of such intention,the release herein given shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete release of such matters,notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claims or facts.in entering into this agreement,the parties herein do not rely on any statement,representation or promise of any other party,except as expressly stated in this agreement.this release applies to both of the loans.
c.the present action 
the pleadings 
on april,hardwick filed this lawsuit to recover usurious interest and protect his collateral.on april,wilcox filed a notice of trustee sale in connection with his prior notice of default on note.the following month,hardwick filed a first amended complaint fac,alleging causes of action for recovery of usurious interest payments pursuant to a common count for money had and received for cancellation of instrument,the release in the forbearance agreement for failure to reconvey title and for declaratory and injunctive relief to quiet title and prevent the nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding.
on may,the court issued a preliminary injunction,staying enjoining nonjudicial foreclosure of the properties securing note and note.
in june,wilcox filed a,which he amended a year later.in his first amended facc,wilcox alleged causes of action for breach of note and note judicial foreclosure as to both notes specific performance as to both notes elder abuse and declaratory relief.the declaratory relief claim pertained to the validity of the release in the forbearance agreement wilcox sought a judicial declaration that hardwick waived his right to recover any usurious interest that was paid prior to august,the date the forbearance agreement was executed.
the court trial 
the parties agreed that the issue whether hardwick waived his usury claim by signing the forbearance agreement should be decided first.accordingly,they stipulated to a bifurcated court trial on hardwick cause of action for cancelation of instrument and wilcox cause of action for declaratory relief.
the court trial was held on september.the court admitted evidence documenting the parties lending relationship pertaining to note through note.both parties acknowledged that every loan bore an interest rate of percent except for one that bore an interest rate of percent.for purposes of this phase of the trial only,the court assumed without deciding that all of the notes violated california usury law and focused exclusively on the question whether claims of usury have been waived.
hardwick and wilcox,the only trial witnesses,testified about the loans and the forbearance agreement they signed in august.both men testified that they were unaware of the usury law when they signed the forbearance agreement.wilcox also testified that the sole purpose of the agreement was to extend the due date of the loans.
on november,the trial court filed a final statement of decision and order on bifurcated issues the sod.in that order,the court summarized the pertinent facts and procedural history,and reiterated that the sole issue was whether the forbearance agreement contained a valid waiver of usury violations.employing a analysis,the court ultimately concluded that hardwick did not waive his usury claim.
first,the court found that construing the release as a waiver of usury would violate public policy.citing civ.code,tiedje aluminum taper milling cal d.this conclusion was supported by findings of fact,including that the forbearance agreement was a descendant obligation growing out of the original usurious loans an extension of that original usurious transaction and usurious in and of itself.under these circumstances,the court found,interpreting the release as a waiver of a usury claim would exempt wilcox from the consequences of his violation of the usury law.
second,the court found that even if hardwick usury claim could be waived in the forbearance agreement,the release was not a knowing waiver of a usury claim,but rather a perpetuation of a violation of the usury law.this fact distinguished dated case law relied on by wilcox which involved settlements of a known usury claim.see,credit finance mox.mox.in this case,the forbearance agreement did not settle or otherwise substantively dispose of a usury claim.rather,by all accounts,it was an agreement to extend the due date of the loan.
at the conclusion of the sod,the court stated as the court finds that usury was not waived,the court grants relief on hardwick second cause of action for cancellation of instrument in the fac and declares that the waiver and release language in the forbearance agreement is invalid and unenforceable.relief on wilcox eighth cause of action in his facc is denied.
the summary judgment rulings 
at a may pretrial hearing on the jury phase of this case,the court postponed trial indefinitely so the parties could file for summary judgment or summary adjudication.both parties filed their motions on june,the same day they filed a stipulation outlining the undisputed facts pertaining to their lending history 
hardwick sought summary judgment or summary adjudication of his claims that hardwick paid off note and note because the usurious interest he paid on notes through were not actually interest payments but reductions of the principal debts and wilcox must refund interest payments hardwick made on notes and within two years prior to the filing of his original complaint in this case.wilcox sought summary judgment or summary adjudication of his claims that hardwick defaulted on note and note and hardwick usury claims as to note through note are barred by the statute of limitations.
on august,the trial court denied wilcox motion in its entirety and granted part of hardwick motion.because most of the material facts were covered by the stipulation,the summary judgment rulings were primarily legal in nature.according to the court,the key issue was whether each numbered note,especially note and note,was a new agreement that purged the prior usury,or whether they were renewals of the prior usurious loan agreements.
the court concluded that note and note are part of a series of notes that simply renewed the debt evidenced by the predecessor usurious notes,relying primarily on the following undisputed facts first,every note in the series of promissory notes modifications of promissory notes that hardwick executed in favor of wilcox contained a usurious,and therefore legally unenforceable,interest rate.second,the principal amounts owed on note and note include unpaid usurious interest accrued from the prior notes.third,hardwick paid a total of on the notes at issue in this case,none of which had reduced the principal balance of any note.
the court then concluded that hardwick paid off note and note because the undisputed evidence showed that hardwick payments on the usurious loans totaled and the combined principal amount of the two remaining loans was.as legal support for this conclusion,the court applied the rule that an attempt to extract usurious interest renders the interest provisions of a note void,such that all payments made on the note go toward reducing its principal.citing,epstein frank,supra,d at.
in reaching these conclusions,the court found that wilcox statute of limitations theory was misplaced because hardwick did not seek an affirmative recovery of the interest paid on note through note.instead,those payments could properly be used as a set off against the principal debt because notes and are successors to notes through in a series of usurious notes that constitute renewals of the same debt.as support for this conclusion,the court applied the rule that in an action to collect a usurious debt,the usurious payments are not barred by the statute of limitations so long as the usurious loan remains unpaid.citing shirley,supra,d.
the trial court also found that in addition to the offset,hardwick could recover any usurious interest paid to wilcox on note and note in the two years before this case was filed.citing stock meek cal d,stock.in his summary judgment papers,hardwick argued that the undisputed loan history established that he was entitled to recover plus interest.in its summary judgment order,however,the trial court deferred ruling on the amount of the award because it did not understand how hardwick calculations worked.
because the summary judgment rulings did not resolve all the issues or causes of action,the court order concluded as follows as part of any final judgment in this case following trial or otherwise,the judgment will provide that hardwick owes wilcox nothing on any of the notes that are the subject of this action,and hardwick owns the real property that secured those notes free and clear of any deed of trust in favor of wilcox.the judgment shall further provide that wilcox shall recover nothing on his first,second,fourth,and fifth causes of action in his first amended.
on january,hardwick filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings an order ascertaining the amount of recovery under the summarily adjudicated common count for recovery of usurious interest dismissal of pending claims and causes of action and entry of final judgment.on february,the court granted hardwick motion as unopposed and entered a final judgment.
the judgment dismissed all causes of action in wilcox facc with prejudice,with the exception of his cause of action for elder abuse,which had already been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in december.the judgment further ordered that wilcox was to take nothing from hardwick in this action,stating note,which is the last note in the wilcox individually series,and note,which is the last note in the pensco fbo wilcox series,have each been paid in full by hardwick by offset pro tanto of usurious interest paid by hardwick in each series,and the principal debt of these promissory notes has been extinguished therefore,hardwick owes wilcox nothing on any of the notes that are the subject of this action.
the judgment awarded hardwick the following relief on his first cause of action,to recover usurious interest,hardwick was awarded,plus prejudgment interest.on his second cause of action for cancellation of instrument,judgment was entered in favor of hardwick pursuant to the sod,which established that the waiver and release language in the forbearance agreement was invalid and unenforceable because of the taint of usury.on his remaining causes of action for declaratory and equitable relief,the court entered judgment in favor of hardwick,ordering wilcox to take all proper and necessary steps to accomplish a reconveyance of the deeds of trust and to quiet hardwick title to the properties he used to secure note and note.hardwick was awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit.
iv.discussion 
hardwick did not waive his usury claim 
wilcox contends that the trial court committed a reversible error of law by concluding that a usury claim can never be released.this argument mischaracterizes the trial court ruling.as discussed above,the court found that the release provision in the forbearance agreement did not constitute a waiver of hardwick usury claim against wilcox because exempting wilcox from the consequences of usury would violate public policy,and the parties did not know or intend that the release would waive a usury claim.as we explain below,these findings,made following a court trial,were legally and factually sound.
wilcox cites no authority addressing the specific question whether a party can ever waive the protections of the usury law.it is settled,however,that such protections can not be waived by the voluntary payment of excessive interest by the borrower.stock,supra,cal d at.as the stock court explained the theory of usury law is that society benefits by the prohibition of loans at excessive interest rates,even though both parties are willing to negotiate them.accordingly,voluntary payments of interest do not waive the rights of the payors.payments of usury are not considered voluntary but are deemed to be made under restraint.citation.if no loophole is provided for lenders,and all borrowers save fraudulent ones are protected,usurious transactions will be discouraged.ibid.for similar reasons,the stock court found,the related doctrine of in pari delicto does not apply to pre
