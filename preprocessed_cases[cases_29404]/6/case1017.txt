this is an appeal from a district court order denying the bondholder plaintiffs motion to certify a class action and dismissing their complaint without prejudice on the grounds that they,as trust beneficiaries,lack standing to bring suit against the three trust fiduciary defendants,or,in the alternative,that as to one trust fiduciary defendant,their case is not yet ripe.based on the following,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural 
in,the hospital authority the hospital authority issued in bonds and sold them to over one thousand bondholders.the bond issue was governed by a trust indenture the bondholders were the intended third party beneficiaries of the trust indenture.
the hospital authority loaned in bond proceeds to the south fulton medical center,the medical center to purchase a separate hospital and its revenues,owned by the hospital authority,and to make necessary capital improvements.in return,as collateral,the medical center gave the hospital authority a security interest in the hospital personal property,most significantly,its patient account receivables and inventory.under the terms of the trust indenture,a master trustee was appointed to oversee the transaction and collect payments as they became due.the hospital authority pledged its security interest to the master trustee.
in,individual bondholders filed a page amended complaint against three corporate defendants bank trust national association bank,the master trustee of the bonds from november,to the present southtrust bank southtrust,the former master trustee of the bonds from october,through november,and reliance trust company reliance,the former servicing agent for the bonds from november,until march.the bondholders sought class certification under.b or b and declaratory relief against the defendants,on behalf of themselves,and a proposed class of over one thousand bondholders,for violations of the federal trust indenture act ftia,breach of contract,fraud and misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence.
at the core of their amended complaint,the bondholders allege that,as to their secured interest in the hospital personal property,the defendants failed to file a continuation statement on december,it is alleged that,on that date,the perfected security interest that the bondholders held in their bonds lapsed and they became unsecured creditors,expecting to receive only of the face value of their bonds.
when bank assumed its fiduciary duties,it claims that it was unaware that the bondholders perfected security interest had lapsed.in fact,bank further claims that,prior to taking control,while performing its final audit,both southtrust and reliance had expressly warranted and represented to it that they had done everything necessary to maintain the perfection.
from november,to april,the medical center had continued to make payments against the promissory note.in april,however,it filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.this was considered an event of default under section of the bond trust indenture,hence voiding the bondholders security interest in the collateral.
in october,bank,as successor trustee,had filed suit on behalf of the bondholders in the superior court of fulton county,georgia,alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against southtrust and reliance,for failing to file the continuation statements.it sought damages for the difference between the value of the secured collateral and the amount actually received by the bondholders upon a distribution by the bankruptcy estate.that case is now pending in federal district court 
in july,the present class action was filed.here the bondholders,as trust beneficiaries,seek class certification in an effort to replace bank as the proper plaintiff against southtrust and reliance in pursuing their lapsed security interest claims.they also seek to add bank as a negligent and conflicted defendant,claiming that it had a duty during the thirteen months prior to the bankruptcy filing to discover that the continuation statements had not been filed,and to either cure or mitigate the situation.the bondholders claim that bank lacks the incentive to prosecute southtrust and reliance as rigorously as they would 
in rebuttal,bank contends that,as the security interest did not lapse on its watch,it has no conflict of interest.further,bank argues that,as southtrust and reliance certified that all necessary filings had been done,it relied on those certifications and was under no duty to do more.bank claims to have no liability as a joint tortfeasor 
the district court denied class certification and dismissed the action by the bondholders against southtrust and reliance.it found that general principles of trust law and the terms of the trust indenture itself expressly provide that bank is the proper party with standing to assert claims against third parties on behalf of the trust beneficiaries.
as to the suit by the bondholders against bank,the district court denied class certification and dismissed on the grounds that they lacked standing to sue bank.in the alternative,in a footnote,the district court held that their claims were unripe until such time as it is determined whether or not the action filed by bank against southtrust and reliance would make the bondholders whole.
the bondholders appeal the judgment of the district court.
ii.standard of review 
we review orders denying class certification for abuse of discretion.see wooden bd.of regents of the,cir,citing bush,cir nonetheless,w hether the district court applied the correct legal standard in reaching its decision on class certification is a legal question that we review de novo.see london stores,cir,citing james city of dallas,cir for the proposition that a district court decision to deny certification of a class shall only be reversed upon a showing that the court abused its discretion or that it applied incorrect legal standards in reaching its decision.
iii.discussion 
a.the trust.section 
the controlling section of the trust indenture is section,entitled right of bondholders to institute suit.section prohibits bondholders from suing third parties unless they have provided written notice to the trustee of the bondholders have made such a request the bondholders have offered to indemnify the trustee and the trustee nonetheless refuses the request.the three fiduciary defendants argue that the bondholders lack standing to bring suit against them because these four conditions have not been met,and therefore,that they must await the outcome of the action filed on their behalf.if a full recovery is made,the bondholders alleged claims would be moot 
in rebuttal,the bondholders claim that section of the trust indenture,in essence,trumps section,when the current trustee is also negligent.although section is over three pages long,the bondholders cite only the following language no provision of this indenture shall be construed to relieve the trustee from liability for its own negligent action,its own negligent failure to act,or its own willful misconduct 
b.the bankruptcy court order 
the bondholders argue that the trust indenture was terminated by the december,order of the bankruptcy court.they claim,therefore,that any limitation in section in the trust indenture,such as the rule,on their right to sue third parties has been removed.the order provides in pertinent part 
the master indenture,the certificate indenture and the bonds issued thereunder shall terminate as of the effective date except as necessary to administer the rights,claims,liens,and interests of the master trustee,the certificate trustee and the bondholders,except they shall continue in effect to the extent necessary to allow the master trustee and the certificate trustees to receive distributions pursuant to the plan and to the extent necessary to facilitate the master trustee prosecution for settlement of that certain action venued in the superior court of fulton county,georgia and captioned bank trust,national association southtrust bank et al 
emphasis added.
the district court found that the trust indenture was only partially ter
