grant thornton,llp,an accounting firm,appeals a final decision and order of the comptroller of the currency that requires the firm to pay in civil penalties for recklessly failing to meet generally accepted auditing standards gaas in its audit of the first national bank of keystone.grant thornton also appeals the comptroller cease and desist order mandating that the firm comply with a host of conditions whenever it audits depository institutions.we vacate the final decision and both orders,finding that when an accounting firm merely performs an external audit aimed solely at verifying the accuracy of a bank books,it is not participat ing or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business or the affairs of the bank,as those terms are used in u c,b,and i b i ii.
in the first national bank of keystone,then a small rural bank in west virginia,sought to increase its revenues,launching an ambitious loan securitization program.the bank bought subprime or high loans from large originators throughout the country.it then pooled these loans with loans it had originated itself.the bank bundled the loans into securities and sold them to institutional investors.keystone hired asset servicers to collect the principal,interest,and penalties on the loans and to issue monthly checks of interest income to keystone.by the bank assets of approximately million had apparently skyrocketed to about billion.
examiners from the office of the comptroller of currency occ scrutinized the bank records periodically from through.in a report,the examiners criticized the accuracy of the bank statements and the effectiveness of the securitization program management.using a standard rating system,the occ gave the bank very low marks for its overall condition and management quality.
because of keystone failure to address these concerns,the occ initiated an enforcement action against the bank in may.as a result,keystone and the occ formally agreed that the bank would retain a nationally recognized independent accounting firm to audit the bank mortgage operations,assess the accuracy of its financial statements,and determine the validity of the bank accounting for loans it purchased and bundled into securities.in july the bank hired grant thornton to conduct the external audit.in april grant thornton issued its audit opinion.the opinion acknowledged the firm duty to obtain reasonable assurance about whether keystone financial statements for and are free of material misstatement,and in effect stated that it had found such assurance.
in august occ examiners uncovered keystone fraud.the bank had inflated its interest income by nearly million and its assets by about million.these million in assets supposedly belonging to keystone were in reality those of another bank.the scheme masked the fact that keystone had been insolvent since.several members of keystone management were convicted of felonies for falsifying bank financial records,loan servicer reports,and remittances,as well as lying to auditors and regulators.after the occ determined that keystone was insolvent,it closed the bank.
on march,the occ invoked the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea of,stat,and initiated an administrative proceeding claiming that grant thornton,in auditing keystone financial statements,had recklessly engag ed in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting keystone affairs.b see also u,i b.the government evidence showed,among other things,that grant thornton had relied on oral representations as to keystone ownership of approximately million of the million at issue,even in the face of written communications suggesting the opposite.at the end of the hearing,however,the administrative law judge recommended that all charges be dismissed because she found that grant thornton had not acted recklessly.
on december,the comptroller rejected the alj recommendation and fined grant thornton.relying or purporting to rely on the evidence introduced by harry potter,the occ audit wizard,the comptroller found that grant thornton participated in an unsafe or unsound practice by recklessly failing to comply with gaas in planning and conducting the keystone audit.in a cease and desist order,the comptroller limited grant thornton freedom to accept and conduct audits independently,hire accountants,and handle working papers.
grant thornton attacks the comptroller decision and orders on multiple grounds.we need address only one.we find that the comptroller exceeded his statutory authority in characterizing grant thornton external auditing activity as participat ing in an unsafe or unsound banking practice,see u,and as engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting keystone business,see b,and in conducting keystone affairs,see i b i ii.those conclusions end the case.
we review the occ interpretation of firrea and related statutory provisions de novo because multiple agencies besides the comptroller administer the act,including the board of governors of the federal reserve board,the federal deposit insurance corporation,and the office of thrift supervision in the treasury department.see proffitt fdic,rapaport department of treasury,wachtel office of thrift supervision,b is also administered by the federal reserve board,the comptroller of the currency,and the fdic,and thus deference under chevron is inappropriate.see also collins ntsb,noting congress observation that more than one agency may be an appropriate federal banking agency with respect to any given type of banking institution,citing q.
the relevant statutory structure is unusual to say the least.it is a bit as if provisions penalizing theft started by defining a thief as a person who commits theft,to wit,one who intentionally takes away the property of another,and then imposed penalties on any thief who intentionally takes away the property of another.the upshot obviously involves a good deal of linguistic duplication and imposition of a penalty requires that the accused be shown both to fit the statutory definition and to have committed the acts actually triggering punishment.
here the crucial definition is that of an party iap,which includes 
any independent contractor including any attorney,appraiser,or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in 
c any unsafe or unsound practice,which caused or is likely to cause more than a minimal financial loss to or a significant adverse effect on,the insured depository institution.
u.we assume without deciding that an accounting firm like grant thornton can qualify as an independent contractor.
the relevant substantive provisions of firrea echo the definition.under b,the comptroller of the currency may issue a order if a bank or iap is engaging or has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of an insured depository institution and under i b i ii the comptroller may impose civil monetary penalties when a depository institution or iap recklessly engages in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the affairs of an insured depository institution which causes a more than minimal loss to the bank or meets other aggravating circumstances.
while the definitional section does specify that the accused must have engaged in the unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of the bank,b,or in conducting the affairs of the bank,i b i ii,the occ does dispute that,to prevail under the substantive provisions,it must show that grant thornton audit activity amounted to such conducting.see occ br.at.
nor does the comptroller contest that the phrase unsafe or unsound practices,in all its appearances here,means unsafe or unsound banking practices.the latter is,indeed,the formulation that the comptroller uses in his notice of assessment of a civil monetary penalty,at and his final decision and order,at.that reading besides being undisputed and according with conventional banking terminology harmonizes the definitional section,u,with the two substantive sections penalizing one who recklessly participates or engages in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business or the affairs of a depository institution.b,i b i ii.
although the occ notice of charges for issuance of an order to cease and desist might be read as claiming that the unsafe or unsound practice in which grant thornton allegedly engaged was keystone own fraud,see id.at,its final decision identified the practice as grant thornton conduct of the audit clearly,grant thornton itself participated in an unsafe or unsound practice when it violated gaas in carrying out its audit.final decision and order,at see also id.at.thus,the comptroller orders rest on the idea that recklessly conducting a audit of a bank constitutes participation in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business or affairs of the bank.but however incompetently or recklessly the audit may have been performed,conduct of the audit can not be shoehorned into the controlling statutory language.
first,grant thornton did participate in an unsafe or unsound banking practice because an audit of the sort conducted here is not a banking practice.grant thornton was fulfilling the classic reporting function of external the company books from the outside and verifying the accuracy of its records and the adequacy of its internal controls.this sort of outside look into a bank activity is not a practice of a depository institution or bank.firrea defines a depository institution as any bank or savings association.c.it defines a bank as any national bank and state bank,and any federal branch and insured branch.a a.as this definition is in part circular,itself depending on the meaning of the word bank,congress evidently relied on common understanding to fill the gap.the language of webster third new international dictionary,identifying a bank as an establishment for the custody,loan,exchange,or issue of money,for the extension of credit,and for facilitating the transmission of funds by drafts or bills of exchange,id.at,seems apt.a review of a bank books is quite distinct from the custody,loan,exchange,or issue of money or facilitating the transmission of funds.id.we do not attempt to define the full universe of activities that encompass banking practices.yet we are certain that an external auditor whose sole role is to verify a bank books can not be said to be engaging in a banking practice.we do not answer the question of whether an internal auditor with an equally limited role if there be any such is conducting the bank business.
in oral argument,comptroller counsel advanced the idea that because f requires that banks,in order to stay in business,undergo audits on an annual basis,it follows that such audits are necessarily part of a bank business.see oral argument,see also a f.this seems to us a complete.that a bank must engage outsiders to perform services does not necessarily turn such providers into bankers.in the case of auditors,of course,the need to enlist their services comes in part from the law,in part from the practicalities of raising the bank own capital,but it is hard to see why the element of legal compulsion should change the matter.it makes as much sense to say that grant thornton was conducting keystone business as it is to say that an underwriters laboratories representative who inspects a toaster is engaged in conducting the manufacture of toasters,or that a department of agriculture representative checking a smokehouse for compliance with meat safety laws is engaged in conducting the operation of a smokehouse.
second,we have some assistance from the supreme court on the meaning of a phrase closely parallel to those in question here.in reves ernst young,d,the court construed the following language from rico to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs.id.at.discussing c.reasoning that congress meant something broader than conduct the enterprise affairs,but narrower than merely participate in its affairs,the court concluded that a covered party must have some part in directing the enterprise affairs.id.at.grant thornton played no such directive role in keystone affairs.
a directing role can,of course,be a minor one.in cavallari office of comptroller of the currency,cir,the court affirmed the comptroller classification of an attorney as an iap because he provided oral and written advice to a bank that exchanging loan guaranties,resulting in the bank gaining an interest in a financially unsound company,was in the bank best interest.the court holding also rested on the fact that the lawyer drafted the paperwork needed to complete the transaction.thus he advised the bank,in a capacity,on how to conduct the bank own.by actively encouraging a dubious transaction,he played a part in conducting the bank business in a way that was contrary to accepted standards for banking operations.id.at.in contrast,while grant thornton audit may have been strikingly incompetent,as described at length by the concurring opinion,it neither proffered advice on nor assumed any directive role in keystone conduct of its affairs.the comptroller nowhere suggests that grant thornton was in cahoots with keystone fraudulent managers.
judge henderson concurrence describes our opinion as a rejection of accountant liability as an iap under b and i b i ii.op.of henderson,at.insofar as she may suggest a categorical rejection,the description is wide of the mark.our discussion above makes clear that an accountant who plays an active role in directing a bank unsafe or unsound practices,or its wrongful transactions,as the lawyer in cavallari did,can be sanctioned as an iap he would then have actually participated in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business or affairs of a bank.
the concurring opinion also invokes legislative history to cast doubt either on our interpretation of the relevant provisions,or possibly on our opinion categorical rejection of accountant liability.in any event,the proposed use of legislative history does work.first,the text of the statute is clear enough that resort to legislative history is unnecessary.see claybrook slater,if statutory language is clear it is both unnecessary and inappropriate to track legislative history.second,even if mining legislative history were necessary to interpret the provisions,the section of the house report commenting directly on iap definition unsurprisingly tracks the statute actual language.it notes that a ppraisers,accountants,and attorneys have participated in some of the serious misconduct in banks and thrift institutions.i,at,reprinted in,emphasis added see also id.stating that independent contractors are liable under the provisions only if they participate in the conduct of the affairs of insured financial institutions.then it distinguishes between an attorney who provides a bank advice or services in good faith and an attorney who also knowingly participates in other activities which result in serious misconduct,saying that the former is not a target for enforcement action,whereas the latter is.id.at,at.
third,the legislative history cited in the concurring opinion,highlighting the role of poor quality audit work in the banking scandals of the late,appears in the preliminary,narrative sections of the house report it does specifically comment on particular provisions of firrea,let alone any part of or.id.at,at.nothing links congress apparent concern that poor auditing delayed regulatory action and thus raised the cost of resolving thrift failures to the sections at issue here.id.at,at.certainly other provisions of firrea seem responsive to this general concern.some,for example,imposed stricter auditing requirements on banks and required banks to give the comptroller access to books,records,accounts,reports,files,and property used by an independent certified public accountant retained to audit banks or their funds.d see also k b a firrea provision that contained language identical to that of d,though the language was removed in a amendment firrea.and congress commissioning of a feasibility report on means of enhancing transparency between audits and the bank regulatory agencies,id,note,also appears aimed in part at reducing the risk of defective audits.in short,assigning the provisions in dispute their meanings creates no inconsistency with the house report.
finally,we note that congress has given the comptroller wide latitude to punish accountants who transgress gaas in their audits of depository institutions 
in addition to any authority contained in,the corporation or an appropriate federal banking agency may remove,suspend,or bar an independent public accountant,upon showing of good cause,from performing audit services required by this section.
g a.while congress added this provision after adoption of firrea as part of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act,stat,its presence makes clear that giving the words of firrea their ordinary meaning leaves the banking authorities ample power to sanction delinquent auditors.here,of course,we need not address the application of g a to grant thornton,as the comptroller has not tried to rest its case on that section.
we vacate the comptroller final decision and orders for the reasons stated.
so ordered.
i agree with my colleagues that we should vacate the civil monetary penalty and cease and desist order the office of the comptroller of the currency occ imposed on grant thornton however,i am not persuaded by their reasoning and therefore concur in the judgment only.the congress enacted the financial institution reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea,stat,as a direct response to the savings and loan crisis of the late.see no,at,as reprinted in.the house banking,finance and urban affairs committee report house report accompanying the legislation discusses the causes of that crisis.among them,the report highlights poor quality audit work as one of the primary ones.the house report explains 
the public accounting industry and certified public accountants cpas played a major role in masking the insolvency of many failed thrifts,and often did not report fraud and insider abuse by thrift managements to thrift regulators.in a study of failed s l sic under the supervision of the federal home loan bank of dallas,the gao reported,
for six of the eleven failed s l sic we reviewed,cpa sic did not adequately audit or report the s l financial condition or internal control problems in accordance with professional standards.
independent audits are an integral part of the system of controls designed to identify and report problems in thrift sic when they arise.a lack of professionalism and poor quality audit work by cpa sic helped mask the presence of fraud at a number of failed thrifts.in many instances auditors did not notify regulators about poor management practices at failing thrifts,which ultimately delayed regulatory action against many unscrupulous thrift managements.this delay has significantly raised the cost of resolving thrift failures.
id.at,at.in light of the congress express conclusion that poor quality audit work played a large role in causing the savings and loan crisis,which crisis produced firrea,i can not join in the majority holding that when an accounting firm merely performs an external audit aimed solely at verifying the accuracy of a bank books,it is not participat ing or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business or the affairs of the bank as those terms are used in u c,b,and i b i ii.op.at.as the majority itself notes,the statutory interplay among these subsections is unusual to say the least and obviously involves a good deal of linguistic duplication.op.at.but b and i b i ii expressly include an institution affiliated party iap within their respective sanctions so that there must be some way in which an iap accountant participates or engage s in an unsafe or unsound practice in the conduct of the business affairs of a bank.the second circuit has decided as much with regard to an iap attorney.cavallari occ,cir.because an iap accountant can be sanctioned under section b and section i b i ii,i believe that the majority rejection of such a result here is wrong.
the occ sanctions levied against grant thornton should nonetheless be vacated.the same house report makes clear that the congress did not intend firrea to be used to levy a penalty against an iap unless most or many of the managing partners or senior officers of the entity have participated in some way in the egregious misconduct,at,at.during the hearings before the house banking,finance and urban affairs committee committee,several organizations,including the american institute of certified public accountants and the american bar association business law section,expressed 
c oncern that the occ could obtain enforcement orders against a corporation,firm,or partnership,such as a large accounting,appraisal,or law firm,since the term person includes entities as well as individuals,and that therefore enforcement orders would not be limited to those individuals who may have been responsible for the wrongful action.
id.at,at.in response,the committee explained 
t he committee expects the occ to limit enforcement actions in the usual case to individuals who have participated in the wrongful action,to prevent unintended consequences or economic harm to innocent third parties.
however the committee strongly believes that occ should have the power to proceed against such entities if most or many of the managing partners or senior officers of the entity have participated in some way in the egregious misconduct.for example,a removal and prohibition order might be justified against the local office of a national accounting firm if it could be shown that a majority of the managing partners or senior supervisory staff participated directly or indirectly in the serious misconduct to an extent sufficient to give rise to an order.such an order might well be inappropriate if it was taken against the entire national firm or other geographic units of the firm,unless the headquarters or these units were shown to have also participated,even if only in a reviewing capacity.
id.at,at emphases added at the time of the keystone audit,grant thornton had approximately partners and other employees in offices throughout the united states.hr g tr.the failure of grant thornton keystone audit,however,was caused by the actions of only two individuals.the occ made no finding that the flaws in the keystone audit resulted from any systemic problem within grant thornton.nor is there any evidence in the record that most or many of the managing partners or senior officers of grant thornton participated in the egregious misconduct which produced the deficient audit.see,at,at.therefore,i agree that the sanctions against grant thornton should be vacated.
i also firmly disagree with the majority vacillating assessment of the audit grant thornton conducted.see op.at while grant thornton audit may have been strikingly incompetent,emphasis added.a fuller exposition of the facts will prove my point the first national bank of keystone keystone had operated for years as a small,community bank in keystone,west virginia.in the early,however,keystone changed its business focus and became heavily involved in the business of purchasing and securitizing mortgages.its new business,so it appeared,increased the value of its loan portfolio from million in to over billion by.reality was much was losing money as it was being looted by its management.to preserve the illusion of profitability,keystone management fraudulently misrepresented its financial condition.at the center of the fraud was a business arrangement keystone entered into with united national bank united of wheeling,west virginia.under the arrangement keystone was to act as a mortgage purchasing agent for united.keystone canvassed the market for available mortgages and notified united on a daily basis of its findings.when suitable mortgages were available,united provided keystone with the funds to purchase the mortgages on united behalf.keystone then arranged for two outside firms,and advanta,to service the mortgages for united while the mortgages were prepared for securitization after purchasing the mortgages with funds provided by united and arranging for servicing and securitization,keystone included the mortgages on its books as assets despite the fact that united owned them.see occ at.
during the,the occ repeated
