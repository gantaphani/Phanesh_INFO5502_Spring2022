on summary judgment,the united states court of federal claims held that the government contracted with richard lavan,carmen lullo,and james skozek during the conversion of century savings loan association csla into a federally chartered stock thrift called century federal savings bank century,that the government breached that contract,that the government had to pay restitution but not expectancy or reliance damages,and that the government was not liable under a takings theory.lavan united states,fed.cl.lavan united states,fed.cl.because the trial court erred in holding that lavan,lullo,and skozek were not entitled to prove expectancy damages,this court,and remands.
this case relates to another dispute following the seminal decision of united states winstar,d.in the early,csla was a mutual savings and loan association that began experiencing substantial financial difficulties.to prevent insolvency,csla decided to convert from a state mutual form of association to a federally chartered stock association.thus,csla submitted an application for conversion to a federal stock charter to the federal home loan bank board fhlbb on july.as part of its application,csla submitted a plan of rehabilitation that proposed conversion under the method of accounting,accompanied by the sale of of stock as new capital for the institution.the fhlbb,however,required an additional capital infusion of approximately that is,a total of approximately to meet net worth requirements.in response,csla specifically named lavan,lullo,and skozek in addition to john lence as the sources of the new capital for century.
before approving the conversion,the supervisory agent requested that the illinois savings and loan commissioner review the transaction.concerned about the apparent that would preclude the use of accounting under the fhlbb memorandum,the illinois commissioner wrote that this was not an arm length transaction.he summed up his concerns 
the transaction on which comment is sought would convert century from a mutual form of ownership to a stock form of ownership.after the conversion from mutual to stock,the association will still be under the same management and direction.the proposed investors john lence,stanley skozek,richard lavan and carmen lullo are all current officers and directors of century.they are the same parties who are proposing the conversion.the conversion will allow these individuals to receive dividend income in addition to salaries and directors fees.clearly,the benefits to these insiders from this supervisory conversion are potentially substantial.
these facts alone do not conform to the criteria of memorandum for the use of accounting 
the circumstances surrounding the acquisition assure that it was in nature 
three of the proposed investors are current and proposed officers.all of the proposed investors are now directors of century and are also proposed investors.the perpetuation of current officers and directors as the only stockholders,appears to be exactly what prohibits.
it is this same group of key personnel lence,lavan,lullo,and skozek who have managed the association during the last several years,during which it has experienced steady losses.
i recommend against approval of changes in control whereby,as here,insiders,management and directors propose,structure and survive the conversion as owners.
despite these concerns,the fhlbb approved the conversion.the principal supervisory agent stated his reasons for approval in a letter to the fhlbb regional director 
t here is no evidence that management has purposefully taken steps which contributed to the deterioration of the institution in order to qualify as a supervisory conversion,or that century deterioration was caused by or negligence on the part of management.it is therefore recommended that the transaction not be interpreted as length in the sense prohibited by memorandum r.
moreover,the fhlbb understood the transaction would occur at arm length,as stated in an internal memo dated july,
in our opinion the arm length condition is met as the supervisory group of the fhlbb and the purchasing group are dealing with each other in the negotiation of the transaction with their own best interests in mind.while the commissioner may have a legitimate question about the decision to sell the converted stock to the prior management group,this does not,in our mind,preclude the use of accounting by the purchasers.
as a practical matter,the accounting that will be used for the transaction is designed to facilitate the acquisition of century by the purchasers.the purchasers are requesting a year period for the goodwill that arises in the transaction.this does not conform to gaap generally accepted accounting principles but will conform to rap regulatory accounting practices should the board decide to approve the transaction as structured.
in conclusion,it is our opinion that accounting would be permissible for this transaction and that the board and fslic may approve accounting for the transaction which,although not gaap,may be necessary to resolve the supervisory case.
on august,the fhlbb approved the conversion with two board resolutions.two clauses in board resolution state 
whereas,century savings and loan association,chicago,illinois century as authorized by its board of directors by at least a majority vote,filed on july,with the federal savings and loan insurance corporation corporation,an application,as last amended on june,application,pursuant to subpart c of part of the rules and regulations for insurance of accounts insurance regulations,for permission to convert from a mutual association to a federally chartered stock association,century federal savings bank,to be controlled by john lence,stanley skozek,carmen lullo and richard lavan acquirors and 
whereas,the acquirors have filed with the corporation for review pursuant to section q of the nha and section c of the insurance regulations prior written notice of the proposed change in control of century.
that resolution also specifies the accounting and the change in control for the conversion

resovlved sic further,that for purposes of reporting to the board the use of accounting is approved,and century may amortize the value of any intangible asset resulting from the accounting for the purchase over a period not to exceed years by the method and 
change in control 
resolved further,that the proposed acquisition of control of century resulting from the acquisition of its conversion stock by the acquirors is hereby not disapproved pursuant to the provisions of section q of the nha and section g of the insurance regulations,provided that the proposed acquisition of the conversion stock is consummated before august,unless written approval of an extension of time has been obtained from the general counsel,deputy general counsel for policy and corporate structure,or the director of the corporate and securities division of the office of general counsel,and provided that there is no material change in circumstances.
moreover,the last clause of the second resolution,board resolution,states 
resolved,that the supervisory conversion of century savings and loan association,chicago,illinois century,from a state mutual savings and loan association to a federal stock savings bank pursuant to subpart c of the rules and regulations for the insurance of accounts,and the acquisition of all of century conversion stock by john lence,stanley skozek,carmen lullo,and richard lavan is hereby approved,subject to any conditions that may be imposed by the federal home loan bank board in any concurrent resolution or action issued as of the date of this resolution.
on the same day of the resolutions,century sold shares of stock at per share to lavan,lence,lullo,and skozek,which the two board resolutions collectively designated as the acquirors.lavan acquired shares in exchange for lence acquired shares in exchange for lullo acquired shares for and skozek acquired shares for.after the conversion but before the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.firrea,lence sold all his shares in century 
also before the enactment of firrea,all shareholders of century,including the acquirors,entered into an agreement to sell their stock for per share to a holding company,century savings bankcorp.before the deal was consummated,however,the holding company invoked the change in circumstance provision of the contract and terminated the transaction.following the passage of firrea,century fell out of capital compliance and was placed into receivership on may.
the trial court held on summary judgment that the government contracted with the acquirors for the use of accounting and the amortization of the goodwill resulting from the transaction over years.lavan.at.the court of federal claims also found that firrea breached that contract.id.in a second opinion,the trial court held that the acquirors were entitled to recover restitution but not expectancy or reliance damages.lavan,fed.cl.at.the trial court further held that the acquirors could not recover under a takings theory.id.at.the government appeals the trial court conclusions that the government contracted with the acquirors,challenging whether a contract was formed and,if so,whether the acquirors have standing to sue for breach of that contract.the acquirors challenges the disallowance of expectancy damages.the acquirors also the denial of liability under a takings theory.

the exchanges between the government and the acquirors constitute a contract only if three elements are met mutual intent to contract including an offer and acceptance,consideration,and a government representative who had actual authority to bind the government.cal.fed.bank united states,quoting massie united states.here,the trial court determined that the parties formed an contract governing the treatment of goodwill.lavan,fed.cl.at.while an contract shares the same elements as a direct contract,a n contract is founded upon a meeting of minds,which,although not embodied in an express contract,is inferred,as a fact,from conduct of the parties showing,in the light of the surrounding circumstances,their tacit understanding.maher united states,quoting hercules,united states,d.
the government argues that this transaction lacked a mutual intent to contract.in particular,the government argues that it was merely performing the regulatory function of approving a conversion from a mutual association to a federally chartered stock association,citing d n bank united states,and anderson united states.in d n bank,this court explained that a lthough a contract may arise as a result of the confluence of multiple documents,there must still be a clear indication of intent to contract and the other requirements for concluding that a contract was formed.at.this court in d n bank looked at four separate documents but determined that none expressed the government intent to contract.in particular,the court remarked that any suggestion that the government impliedly had the intent to contract as to the treatment of goodwill because of its approval of the merger is implausible because none of the documents proffered by d n mentions goodwill or the accounting treatment thereof.id.in examining the bank board resolution,which was the only document indicating a promise by someone with authority,the court explained its deficiencies 
this document,however,only shows the bank board approval of the merger.mere approval of the merger does not amount to intent to contract.the bank board,in its regulatory capacity,must approve all mergers.an agency performance of its regulatory or sovereign functions does not create contractual obligations.something more is necessary.the bank board resolution says nothing about goodwill and there was no negotiation between d n and the bank board that resulted in approval of the merger.d n and first federal simply submitted an application for approval of the merger,and the bank board accepted it.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.the government correctly notes in the present case that the application for conversion was required by and submitted in accordance with regulations then in force.while those allegations are true,this transaction evinces something more.
specifically,board resolution clearly approves the use of accounting and the amortization of goodwill resulting from the conversion over a period of years.as evidenced by an internal memorandum,the treatment of goodwill was at the epicenter of the conversion process.in discussing whether the transaction would occur at arm length,the memo reflects that the supervisory group of the fhlbb and the purchasing group are dealing with each other in the negotiation of the transaction with their own best interests in mind and that t he purchasers are requesting a year period for the goodwill that arises in the transaction.that memorandum clearly reflects the something more,that is,the recognition that the government was engaged in negotiations about the terms of the conversion as well as the subsequent manifest assent to abide by the resolution required under d n bank.indeed,anderson,which carefully evaluated this court precedent on contract formation in the context of winstar litigation,recognized that the something more requires,in succinct terms,that the offeree must give in return for the offeror promise exactly the consideration which the offeror requests and the acceptance must be made absolutely and unqualifiedly.at quoting estate of bogley united states.
rather than being similar to the regulatory transactions in d n bank and anderson,the trial court rightly analogized the present case to california federal cal fed.in cal fed,this court examined all the contemporaneous documents and determined that the government bargained with cal fed to assume the net liabilities of the acquired thrifts in exchange for favorable regulatory consideration allowing goodwill to be counted as an asset for regulatory capital purposes and to be amortized over to years.at.even though the government asserts that the acquirors did not negotiate with the government regarding the treatment of goodwill,this court agrees with the trial court that the facts and circumstances surrounding the august,resolution approving the conversion establish a agreement in which the acquirors agreed to infuse capital into the institution,and thus save the bank from immediate liquidation,based on the express understanding that they would in exchange receive the goodwill.lavan,fed.cl.at.this court therefore affirms the trial court finding of a contract.
anticipating the possibility that this court would uphold the contract found by the trial court,the government argues that the acquirors,as shareholders of century,have no standing to sue for breach of contract.see erickson air crane united states,stating that t he government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of contract.in support of its argument,the government cites federal deposit insurance united states,karnes,and cain united states.in karnes,this court examined various communications between the thrift,karnes,and the fhlbb and determined that none showed that the shareholders,the lees,negotiated with the government.in fact,this court determined that only the president of the thrift participated in the negotiations.going beyond the absence of direct negotiations between the lees and the government,this court explained 
to be sure,the regulators undoubtedly were aware that the lees were supplying the money that would be used to rehabilitate karnes.neither that knowledge,the supplying of the new capital,or the lees position as stockholders in karnes,made them parties to those arrangements.a shareholder generally does not have standing to assert a breach of contract claim on behalf of the corporation.
karnes,at.this case,however,presents a transaction factually distinct from the karnes case.in karnes,the lees acquired karnes by first creating a new thrift,then merging that thrift into karnes.here,on the other hand,the acquirors were an integral part of the conversion of csla to century at every step during the process,the government clearly understood and acknowledged the identities of the acquirors.during the initial application phase when the government requested additional capital for century,the documents specified the acquirors and their respective ownership of shares.during the internal deliberation phase when the government was determining whether the transaction would be eligible for accounting,the acquirors role as both officers of the mutual association and investors in the stock association raised the specter of a length transaction.this concern was alleviated in part because the government understood that it and the acquirors were each negotiating in their own best interest.perhaps most importantly,both bank board resolutions named the acquirors and expressly approved the transaction conditioned on their ownership of century.thus,the government did not merely know that the acquirors would be supplying the money to convert csla into century rather,the government recognized and required their participation.simply put,the documents demonstrate that the acquirors were essential to the transaction.
in cain,a mutual association,security federal,applied for conversion to a stock association.under the conversion plan,the directors of the mutual association provided the extra capital necessary to form the new association by purchasing the new institution stock.cain,at.the fhlbb approved the conversion in a letter addressed to the four directors who had acquired the largest number of shares and to security federal board of directors.the fhlbb also did not disapprove the change in control provided that the new stockholders complied with certain conditions,such as an upper bound on the amount of dividends that the new thrift would pay.the letter in cain stated,in part 
we have also completed our review of the notices of change in control of the association filed by hardee,harrison,haney and dantzler collectively,the acquirors for authority to acquire control of the association pursuant to q and part upon consummation of its conversion to stock form.
id.at.this court,however,noted that that letter does not contain or provide any contractual commitment by the bank board to the seven shareholders.id.at.in particular,this court found the letter was sent to only four of the seven shareholders a dead giveaway that the government was merely performing its regulatory functions 
the bank board addressing of the notice of approval to the thrift four largest shareholders can not be viewed as manifesting intent to enter into a contract with them.the obvious reason for the board doing so was because the board approval letter also authorized them to acquire control of the new association.since those four had filed the applications to acquire control,the bank board naturally sent them its letter approving such acquisition.indeed,if the bank board intended to enter into a contract with the shareholders,why would it have sent the letter only to four of the seven of them 
id.after dismissing the import of the approval letter,this court further examined affidavits of the shareholders explaining the criticality of the thrift treatment to their investment and other documentary evidence purporting to evince a direct contract with the government.while acknowledging that whether the government entered into a contract with a thrift shareholders necessarily turns on the facts of the particular case,id.at,this court held that the thrift shareholders were not direct parties to the contract.as explained above in distinguishing karnes,however,the facts of this particular case compel a different conclusion.
in this case,the government directly contracted with the acquirors.the government approved the transaction only on condition that the acquirors would provide the capital necessary to convert csla into century.at every step along the process,the government knew of the sources of the capital even to the point of soliciting additional capital from them.indeed,the acquirors identities caused internal deliberations about accounting and the arm length nature of the conversion.furthermore,the first board resolution states that the proposed acquisition of control of century resulting from the acquisition of its conversion stock by the acquirors is hereby not disapproved and the second board resolution reiterates that the acquisition of all of century conversion stock by john lence,stanley skozek,carmen lullo,and richard lavan is hereby approved.thus,this court concurs with the trial court,which summarized t he undisputed facts plainly establish that lavan,lullo,and skozek were,as individuals,the acquirors who negotiated with the fhlbb to purchase the converted institution.these individuals were the direct purchasers who then became shareholders in the new institution.lavan,fed.cl.at.thus,the facts,although seemingly analogous to cain,are markedly different,because the evidence shows that these specific acquirors were critical to the conversion in this case,whereas the particular shareholders were unimportant to the conversion in cain.because this court affirms the government direct contract with the acquirors,it does not reach the issue of whether the acquirors were beneficiaries under the contract.glass united states,holding that the shareholders were not beneficiaries because they were not directly benefited by the contract between the government and the thrifts first hartford.pension plan trust united states,explaining the exceptions to the general rule that the government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of contract quoting erickson air crane,at.
because the acquirors contracted with the government and firrea breached that contract,the trial court awarded restitution totaling the amount of the acquirors initial investment.lavan,fed.cl.at.while the government did not appeal that award,the acquirors argue that they are entitled to expectancy damages instead.these expectancy damages,according to the acquirors,equate to the increased market value of their shares evidenced by the aborted sale of their stock in century to a holding company,century savings bankcorp.because century savings bankcorp would have paid per share,the acquirors seek an additional per share tacked onto the restitutionary award of per share.the acquirors particularly assert that the trial court mistakenly incorporated the government argument on standing into the damages opinion.
this court agrees that the trial court erroneously conflated the issues of damages and standing in holding that the increased value of the acquirors stock belongs to the thrift,not the acquirors.undoubtedly,a suit for damages arising from an injury to the corporation can only be brought by the corporation itself or by a shareholder derivatively if the corporation fails to act,since only the corporation has an action for wrongs committed against it.gaff fed.deposit ins,cir citation omitted.that rule,however,does not limit damages,but instead arises from the general precept of corporate law that a shareholder of a corporation does not have a personal or individual right of action for damages based solely on an injury to the corporation.id.the government may well have breached a contract with century by the enactment of firrea,thus giving century as well a claim against the government nonetheless,in this case,the government breached a direct contract with the acquirors personally and apart from the acquirors status as shareholders.therefore,the direct harm caused to the acquirors by this breach is separate and distinct from any harm flowing through century to the acquirors as shareholders.this court sees no reason to limit the acquirors damages based on
