in this putative class action,appellant deborah barnes alleges that fleet bank did not properly disclose the effective date of changes to fees and minimum balance requirements on her bank accounts,and engaged in other inaccurate or misleading announcements of such changes.she argues that these failures constitute violations of the truth in savings act,its implementing regulations,and the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.the district court granted summary judgment for fleet.for the reasons given below,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
we set forth the undisputed facts from the summary judgment record or,where appropriate,note the contentions of the parties about those facts.in october,fleet national bank acquired another commercial bank,bankboston.as a result of the merger,fleet had to convert the accounts of bankboston customers into fleet accounts.according to fleet,it tried to match each bankboston account with the fleet account that provided the most similar terms,minimum balances and fees.because the two banks had offered different types of accounts with different terms,these matches were not exact.thus,at least some bankboston customers experienced changes in account terms as a result of the merger with fleet.
prior to the merger,deborah barnes was a customer of bankboston,where she maintained premium value checking,reserve credit,and money market savings accounts.on march,fleet sent a change in terms package to barnes describing upcoming changes to her accounts barnes received the package on april.it contained a welcome letter,a personalized summary of accounts letter,and a variety of other information about fleet banking products and services.the welcome letter,dated march,stated 
i writing to tell you about the transition of your bankboston deposit accounts to fleet accounts on may on may,your accounts will transfer to the fleet accounts that are most similar to your existing bankboston accounts.everything will happen automatically,so you wo have to do a thing.
bullet points on the side of the letter listed a phone number that customers could call with questions about the transition,and restated the points in the letter that y our deposit accounts will become fleet accounts on may,and that t here is nothing you need to do.we will take care of everything to assure a smooth transition.
the summary of accounts letter provided more specific information about barnes accounts.it stated 
changes in monthly fees and balance requirements,if any,will take effect on april,and will be reflected on your first statement following may.all other account changes and enhancements will take effect on may.
the letter went on to state that barnes premium value accounts would be converted into fleetone gold accounts.despite fleet statement that it would convert barnes bankboston accounts into the fleet accounts it deemed to be most similar,the terms of the new fleetone gold accounts differed significantly from those of barnes existing bankboston accounts.while bankboston had required barnes to maintain only a combined minimum balance to avoid a fee,the new fleet accounts required a combined minimum average monthly balance of to avoid an monthly fee.
based on the statement in the summary of accounts letter that c hanges in monthly fees and balance requirements,if any,will take effect on april,barnes believed that she had only until april days after she received the change in terms package from fleet would begin to calculate the average balance on her new checking account.thus,she believed that if she wanted to avoid the monthly fee,she would have to raise her average balance to more than starting on april.rather than increase her balance,barnes acted quickly to change her existing bankboston accounts before what she believed was an april deadline.within a week of receiving the change in terms package,barnes converted her premium value checking account to a classic value account,which required only a minimum balance to avoid monthly fees.according to fleet,this classic value account was most similar to the fleet classic account,which required only a minimum average monthly balance to avoid fees.when the conversion from bankboston to fleet finally took place,barnes classic value account became a fleet classic account.
fleet contends that barnes misinterpreted the summary of accounts letter and that she did not have to change her bankboston accounts before april to avoid paying fees on her new fleet accounts.according to fleet,it had planned to charge new monthly service fees on each customer first statement after the may conversion.barnes first statement after may was scheduled to be mailed on may.that statement would have reflected for the first time charges for any new fees based on her monthly balance.because fleet calculates average balances retrospectively for one month periods,the may statement would have reflected monthly service charges based on the average balance in barnes accounts during the period from april to may.thus,according to fleet,barnes had until april,not april,to make any changes necessary to avoid paying monthly fees on her fleet checking account.
barnes,however,was not the only customer confused by fleet communication to bankboston customers,and fleet attempted to remedy customer concerns by delaying the imposition of new fees.in a postcard dated may,fleet notified bankboston customers that it would not impose monthly service charges for the first billing period following the may conversion it stated 
recently,we sent you information about the transition of your bankboston accounts to fleet,which will take effect on may.we recognize that any changes in your banking services may feel unsettling.that is why we are pleased to announce that regular monthly service fees will not be charged on your first fleet statement following the transition of your accounts.
because of this postponement of new fees,barnes would not have been charged any fees even if she had failed to comply with fleet minimum balance requirements during the period of april to may.thus,after the additional delay,barnes did not have to maintain a minimum balance until the period of may to june 
barnes brought a class action complaint against fleet,alleging that fleet had violated the truth in savings act tisa,and.laws ch.specifically,barnes argued that fleet change in terms package did not satisfy c and a because it did not properly disclose the effective date of changes to barnes accounts.she further argued that the change in terms package was misleading in violation of e finally,she argued that these violations of tisa constituted a per se violation of chapter,a 
barnes filed a motion for class certification,and fleet responded with a motion to stay certification.after an initial scheduling conference,the district court entered an order staying barnes motion for class certification in anticipation of summary judgment filings both parties then moved for summary judgment on the tisa and claims.
the district court held that the second,more detailed letter of march,the personalized summary of accounts letter satisfied fleet tisa disclosure obligations.the court recognized that t he letter seems initially to announce an effective date of april.nevertheless,it reasoned that 
closer attention to the letter reveals that the effective date conveyed in the letters,was the beginning of each recipient monthly statement period that ended after may.in barnes case,for example,the effective date was april barnes first statement after the may cutoff would issue on may.as fleet explains in its papers,the changes would first apply in the statement period preceding that date,to be reflected in that statement.april was the first date on which the changes to account terms would apply to barnes.
the district court then concluded that fleet correspondence to barnes sufficiently announced that april was the effective date of changes to barnes accounts.
it is my view that,while less than ideal,the language of the march letter adequately conveys a date of changes to barnes accounts.it is indeed problematic that the letter states that c hanges in monthly fees and balance requirements,if any,will take effect on april.standing alone,that clause announces an inaccurate effective date.but the context is curative the second clause in the sentence explains that the pertinent changes will be reflected on the first statement the client receives after may the letter instructs that fleet will review account balances and assess fees on a monthly basis,and that the first statement received after may will reflect the implementation of these changes.it logically follows that the effective date of the changes predates that statement by one month.its approach could have been more straightforward,but fleet provided the information from which its bankboston customers could ascertain the effective dates it intended for them.
the district court thus held that fleet notice of the effective date of changes to barnes accounts complied with the requirements of tisa and regulation dd.
the court then addressed barnes contention that fleet correspondence was misleading in violation of e.in the court view,fleet announcement was not misleading when it stated that on may,your accounts will transfer to the fleet accounts that are most similar to your existing bankboston accounts.everything will happen automatically,so you wo have to do a thing.in response to barnes argument that the fleet announcement was misleading because she would have been subject to higher fees and higher monthly balance requirements after the transfer if she had taken no action,the court reasoned that fleet letter served only to notify barnes that the transfer of her accounts would happen automatically,without any assertion that her monthly fees would remain the same.
the district court also rejected barnes argument that the statement c hanges in monthly fees and balance requirements,if any,will take effect on april,and will be reflected on your first statement following may,was misleading.it stated that barnes offers no evidence to suggest that,at the time it made the statement,fleet intended some effective date other than what it described emphasis in original.the court focused on fleet subsequent decision to extend the time period in which it would not charge new fees,stating that this extension of time conferred a benefit on barnes and could not render misleading the preceding statement outlining an earlier effective date.presumably because it had already determined that the summary of accounts letter gave adequate notice of the intended effective date of april,the court did not address whether the summary of accounts letter misled barnes about the effective date that fleet had originally intended to identify.
having found no violation of tisa,the court addressed barnes claim under.laws ch.the court stated that because tisa is a consumer protection statute,violation of tisa would be a per se violation of chapter pursuant to nevertheless,the court stated that barnes chapter claim can not ride on the coattails of her tisa claim because barnes did not prevail on her tisa claim.thus,because the court had found no violation of tisa,it held that barnes had not established a per se violation of chapter.
the district court denied barnes motion for summary judgment and granted fleet motion for summary judgment.barnes now appeals,arguing that the court erred in finding no violation of tisa and no liability under chapter.
we review the district court ruling on for summary judgment de novo.bienkowski northeastern,cir.cross motions simply require us to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.wightman springfield terminal,cir.
congress enacted tisa to require the clear and uniform disclosure of the fees that are assessed against deposit accounts,so that consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the competing claims of depository institutions.b.pursuant to,the federal reserve board issued regulation dd,to implement tisa.tisa private action provision,imposes liability on a ny depository institution which fails to comply with any requirement imposed under tisa or any regulation prescribed under tisa.a repealed.thus a banking institution may be liable either for a violation of tisa itself or for a violation of regulation dd.
we construe consumer protection statutes liberally in favor of consumers.see bizier globe fin,cir construing the truth in lending act broadly to protect bank customers.when construing a similar civil suit provision of the truth in lending act tila,we held that recovery was available even to a plaintiff who did not show actual damages.see bizier,at t he act provides two distinct remedies for violation of any requirement it imposes any actual damages caused,and,whether or not any actual damages were suffered,a recovery of up to plus attorney fees for any individual transaction.see also smith cash store,cir subject to narrow exceptions,hypertechnicality reigns in the application of tila.purtle eldridge auto sales,cir holding that tila imposes strict liability grant imperial motors,cir o nce the court finds a violation of tila,no matter how technical,it has no discretion with respect to the imposition of liability.section closely tracks the language of tila civil action provision neither tisa nor regulation dd requires a plaintiff to show financial injury or reliance to procure damages.see schnall amboy bank,cir noting the similarity in language between the civil action provision in tila and,and concluding that congress intended to have the same meaning that courts had given tila.thus,fleet is liable for statutory damages for any violation of tisa or regulation dd,regardless of whether barnes suffered any harm as a result of that violation see schnall,at imposing liability for violation of disclosure requirements under tisa or regulation dd regardless of harm to plaintiff hale citibank,same.
tisa requires banks to notify customers by mail at least days prior to any changes in fees,service charges,or minimum balances.c.regulation dd requires that notice shall include the effective date of the change and that notice shall be mailed or delivered at least calendar days before the effective date of the change.a.the disclosure of the exact effective date of changes is important it allows consumers to make informed choices about when and whether to shift funds to take advantage of the best possible terms offered by the banking market.the failure to disclose an effective date leaves consumers without any firm time line for making their financial decisions.to ensure that this disclosure actually informs consumer decisions,it must be made 
clearly and conspicuously,in writing,and in a form the consumer may keep.disclosures for each account offered by an institution may be presented separately or combined with disclosures for the institution other accounts,as long as it is clear which disclosures are applicable to the consumer account.
a thus,to comply with tisa and regulation dd,fleet had to clearly and conspicuously disclose to barnes the changes to her account,and the effective date of those changes,at least days prior to the effective date.
neither tisa nor regulation dd defines the term effective date or requires that it be presented in a specific and uniform manner.the commentary to regulation dd states that a n example of language for disclosing the effective date of a change is as of november.cmt.a.case law,however,suggests that banks do not have to state the effective date as a specific calendar date,but rather may disclose the effective date by reference to other events.see,eovaldi first bank of chicago,cir holding that an explanatory letter and a chart directing the customer to his new billing date was clear and conspicuous in compliance with regulation z,issued pursuant to tila.regardless of whether a bank chooses to disclose the effective date directly or by reference,that disclosure must be made clearly and conspicuously to comply with a 
the summary of accounts letter that fleet mailed to barnes clearly stated that c hanges in monthly fees and balance requirements,if any,will take effect on april,and will be reflected on your first statement following may,emphasis added.nevertheless,fleet contends that it intended to identify april,as the effective date of changes to barnes accounts because that was the first day on which barnes would have had to begin meeting fleet average minimum balance requirements to avoid incurring fees on her first statement following may.because fleet mailed its welcome package announcing the effective date of changes on march,fleet asserts that it complied with tisa requirement that it mail notification of account changes at least days prior to the april effective date.
barnes claims,however,that the substance of the notice did not comply with tisa disclosure requirements because it failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose that april was the effective date of changes to her account.in response,fleet argues that barnes should have made the following extrapolation from the statement in the summary of accounts letter that changes would be reflected on your first statement following may,her first statement following may would be on may the may statement would cover account activity during the period from april until may therefore,the effective date of any changes would be april.fleet apparently expected barnes to undertake this three part calculation and ignore the statement in the summary of accounts letter that changes will take effect on april.
this convoluted method of disclosure does not even come close to satisfying the clearly and conspicuously standard.first,nowhere does the summary of accounts letter identify april as the intended effective date of changes to barnes accounts.rather,the letter provided that changes will take effect on april,a clear statement that fleet apparently expected its customers to ignore.a disclosure can not satisfy the requirements of regulation dd when that disclosure clearly and conspicuously states an incorrect effective date.
second,fleet attempt to disclose the true effective date by reference fails because it made unwarranted assumptions about bankboston customers familiarity with fleet billing practices.the summary of accounts letter did not explain fleet billing system,whereby fees are charged only for the days preceding the statement date.rather,it stated only that new fees would be reflected on the first statement following may.this partial information could easily have led a consumer to believe,as barnes apparently did,that fleet would begin calculating minimum average balances starting on april,but that it would not bill any related fees until the first statement following may.nothing in the letter indicated that the first statement following may would necessarily only include fees based on the average minimum balance of the previous days.because fleet did not explain this billing system,its statement that fees would be charged on the first statement following may was not adequate to notify barnes that the effective date of changes to her accounts was april rather than april.
finally,fleet general disclosure language did not clearly differentiate between the effective date of changes to barnes account and the effective date of changes to other accounts.see a stating that disclosures may be presented separately or combined with disclosures for the institutions other accounts,as long as it is clear which disclosures are applicable to the consumer account.while april could have been the effective date for some that had a statement cycle ending may letter did not clearly indicate that the effective date depended on the statement cycle.rather,as stated above,fleet attempted disclosure unreasonably assumed that consumers would infer the different effective dates based on knowledge of fleet billing cycle.
the may postcard does not remedy fleet failure to comply with regulation dd in its initial disclosure.even if we interpret the may postcard as notice of a new effective barnes case,may does not fulfill tisa disclosure requirements.fleet did not send the may postcard days prior to the new effective date of may,and the postcard did not meet the requirement that t he notice shall include the effective date of the change.a.while it stated that regular monthly service fees will not be charged on your first fleet statement following the transition of your accounts,it did not identify the date on which new fees and balance requirements would go into effect.without this information,the may postcard can not serve as proper disclosure in compliance with tisa and regulation dd.
in short,because neither the march letter nor the may postcard clearly and conspicuously stated either the original effective date april or the new effective date may,fleet did not comply with the disclosure requirements of a and is therefore liable to barnes pursuant to.
appellant has argued that fleet also violated e,which states 
no depository institution or deposit broker shall make any advertisement,announcement,or solicitation relating to a deposit account that is inaccurate or misleading or that misrepresents its deposit contracts.
there is no case law interpreting this provision of tisa,and there is no similar provision in tila that explicitly recognizes a violation for misleading statements.however,even without an explicit statutory provision,courts have interpreted tila to prohibit misleading statements,holding that a misleading disclosure is as much a violation of tila as a failure to disclose at all.smith chapman,cir finding a violation of tila in part because the failure to list the sales tax figure in the space allotted for that figure on the contract form was misleading.see also roberts fleet bank,cir holding that,where an annual percentage rate was adjustable at any time but was advertised as a fixed rate that wo go up in a few short months,a question of fact existed as to whether the statements were misleading in violation of tila rossman fleet bank ass n,cir holding that the statement no annual fee is misleading in violation of tila if the contract terms allow for imposition of an annual fee within one year smith galesburg crown fin,cir finding a violation of tila where a provision disclosing a creditor security interest in property was so poorly drafted that it was misleading.
barnes contends that fleet correspondence was an announcement and thus is covered by e.barnes also contends that several statements in fleet announcement were both inaccurate and misleading.first,she argues that the statement that changes will take effect on april,was inaccurate and misleading because,in fact,no changes to barnes accounts occurred on april.second,she argues that the statements telling customers to do nothing and that their accounts would be converted into the fleet accounts that are most similar to your bankboston accounts were inaccurate and misleading because,if barnes had done nothing,the conversion would have left barnes with accounts that required higher minimum balances and that charged much higher fees.
we agree with barnes,and with the district court,that fleet mailing was an announcement within the meaning of e.although tisa does not define announcement,fleet change in terms package giving formal notice of changes to account terms must fall within any reasonable definition of the term.
contrary to the district court,we also agree with barnes that fleet change in terms package did contain misleading and inaccurate statements.the statement in the summary of accounts letter that changes will take effect on april,was flatly incorrect.no changes to barnes accounts occurred on april,nor did fleet intend for any changes to occur on that date.rather,the intended effective date of changes to barnes accounts was april.indeed,barnes was actually misled by the false identification of april as the effective date and she acted quickly to change the terms of her bankboston accounts prior to that incorrect deadline.her protective actions only confirm that fleet notice of the effective date was inaccurate and misleading.
the context of fleet statement did not properly qualify the statement that changes will take effect on april.as stated above,customers who wanted to determine the correct effective date were required to calculate backwards from their first billing statement af
