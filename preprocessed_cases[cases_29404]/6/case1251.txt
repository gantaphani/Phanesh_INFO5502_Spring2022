factual and procedural background 
chfa is a component unit of the state of california,created under the housing and home finance act,codified as health and safety code section et.chfa mission is to provide affordable housing in the state.see health.to accomplish this,chfa acts as direct lender,loan purchaser,and mortgage insurer of both its own loans and those of other lenders.see health.chfa mortgage insurance programs are conducted with funds held in the california housing loan insurance fund insurance fund under health and safety code section.
schienle served as chfa director of insurance from through,reporting directly to chfa highest officer,the executive director.mcwhirk served as chfa general counsel from until.from though,mcwhirk became chfa outside counsel under a series of written agreements.
during the first half of schienle tenure,the insurance fund collected mortgage insurance premiums exclusively on an annual basis.in or,schienle took steps to have the insurance fund offer mortgage insurance programs in which the lenders and loan servicers could pay premiums monthly.in late and early,schienle and mcwhirk created hc to provide chfa insurance premium processing services.mcwhirk incorporated hc,acted as its legal counsel,and served as president and chief executive officer during the time he also served as chfa outside counsel.mcwhirk operated hc from his residence,and arranged for his domestic partner,michael had no mortgage insurance or accounting manage its activities.to hide their interest in hc,schienle and mcwhirk brought in roger formisano to pose as hc sole owner,promising formisano if he would participate in the scheme.formisano never owned any interest in hc,but held the company stock for mcwhirk and misita with directions to relinquish the stock to them when mcwhirk no longer represented chfa.
in early,schienle and mcwhirk influenced chfa to enter into a contract with hc hc contract,whereby hc would collect monthly premiums from lenders and loan servicers and forward the premiums to chfa,after deducting hc operating costs.schienle drafted the hc contract,which was the only agreement he drafted during his chfa tenure.the agreement failed to describe hc services,continued in perpetuity with no termination date,included no audit provisions,and failed to define the amount of hc compensation.neither schienle nor mcwhirk ever disclosed their interest in hc to anyone at chfa.
under the hc contract,the amount deducted from the premiums for operating costs increased dramatically after four years into the policy period,and after year five,hc could keep all of the premiums it collected.in other words,after five years into any particular policy hc would cease remitting to chfa any part of the premiums it collected,even though chfa would continue to provide mortgage insurance.in,the first year of operation,hc collected approximately in premiums,kept,and forwarded to chfa.during the last two and years of operation,from through the first six months of,hc skimmed approximately million from the premiums it received.
as the volume of hc business grew,defendants hired misita nephew and mcwhirk sister to assist in processing the insurance premiums.in,hc paid formisano the initially promised.at the end of,mcwhirk ceased acting as chfa outside counsel.in early,formisano surrendered his stock to hc without receiving further consideration,and hc reissued stock to mcwhirk and misita,making them the sole owners of the company.during the scheme,hc paid mcwhirk substantial legal fees,leased space in his residence,and paid numerous personal expenses,including the lease on a new mercedes automobile.hc funds were also used to fund two other companies,stars and stripes california and stars and stripes nevada,also owned by mcwhirk and misita.schienle served as an officer and director in both stars and stripes companies,and received substantial financial benefits from them and through hc.
schienle retired from chfa in december.shortly thereafter,schienle replacement discovered the hc contract in a stack of papers schienle had left behind.concerned about the agreement,chfa launched an investigation into the contract and hc.after hiring the accounting firm of pricewaterhousecoopers,chfa discovered schienle and mcwhirk involvement in the matter,and terminated the hc contract.on june,chfa filed suit against schienle,mcwhirk,and hc.chfa third amended complaint sought damages for fraud negligent misrepresentation breach of fiduciary duty violation of section legal malpractice negligence and breach of contract.the complaint also sought a declaration that the hc contract was void restitution and injunctive relief based on business and professions code section et and an accounting.hc filed a against chfa for breach of the hc contract.
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that chfa action was barred under the applicable statutes of limitations.the court denied the motion,finding a triable issue of fact on whether defendants fraudulently concealed the facts upon which the causes of action were based,and on whether chfa should have known about defendants wrongdoing more than three years before it filed the action.mcwhirk also filed a separate summary adjudication motion asserting he owed no duty to chfa because he acted as an independent contractor for the insurance fund.the court denied the motion,finding a triable issue of fact on whether mcwhirk was chfa fiduciary.
following a trial,the jury returned its verdict finding a each defendant liable for fraud and negligent misrepresentation b schienle and mcwhirk liable for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of section and c mcwhirk liable for legal malpractice and breach of contract.the jury awarded chfa compensatory damages of and in punitive damages against each defendant,and awarded prejudgment interest from the date the action was filed.the jury found in chfa favor on hc.following the jury verdict,the trial court determined that defendants violated business and professions code section et,and ordered restitution in the amount of.following the verdict,the trial court awarded prejudgment interest of on chfa tort claims against all defendants,and an additional against mcwhirk based on chfa contract claims.
discussiona.defendants may not challenge the denial of their summary judgment motion because the parties litigated the same issues at trial 
defendants contend the trial court erred when it denied their summary judgment motion,which sought dismissal of chfa claims based on statutes of limitations.chfa contends that orders denying summary judgment based on triable issues of fact are not reviewable as a matter of law after a full trial covering the same issues.we agree with chfa.
in waller tjd,th,d waller,the trial court denied the defendants summary judgment motion.a jury later decided the same issues at trial in the plaintiff favor.the court of appeal declined to review the summary judgment denial,reasoning that the defendants suffered no prejudice because they received a jury trial on the merits.id.at,d.waller explained when the trial court commits error in ruling on matters relating to pleadings,procedures,or other preliminary matters,reversal can generally be predicated thereon only if the appellant can show resulting prejudice,and the probability of a more favorable outcome,at trial.california constitution article vi,section,admonishes us that error may lead to reversal only if we are persuaded upon an examination of the entire cause that there has been a miscarriage of justice.in other words,we are not to look to the particular ruling complained of in isolation,but rather must consider the full record in deciding whether a judgment should be set aside.since we are enjoined to presume that the trial itself was fair and that the verdict in plaintiffs favor was supported by the evidence,we can not find that an erroneous pretrial ruling based on declarations and exhibits renders the ultimate result unjust.id.at,d.
defendants rely on the recent case of gackstetter frawley th,d gackstetter,which distinguished waller.in gackstetter,the defendants unsuccessfully raised a defense of good faith settlement under code of civil procedure section in their summary judgment motion.on appeal,defendants argued the trial court erred in denying its summary judgment motion.gackstetter accepted waller conclusion that a reviewing court will not consider whether a trial court erred in denying a summary judgment motion based on triable issues of fact following a full trial of those same issues.gackstetter,at,d.the court explained a decision based on less evidence,the evidence presented on the summary judgment motion should not prevail over a decision based on more evidence,the evidence presented at trial.id.at,d,quoting eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs.gackstetter nonetheless reviewed the trial court denial of summary judgment because the good faith issue was not based on disputed facts which were resolved at a subsequent trial.the court recognized the good faith settlement issue could have been raised in a number of different ways,and defendants had not forfeited review merely because they chose summary judgment as the procedural device to assert their good faith settlement defense.gackstetter,at,d.
defendants also cite sturm,ruger superior court d.and coy county of los angeles d,d coy to support the notion that a reviewing court could consider whether the trial court erred in denying summary judgment despite a full trial on the same issues.sturm does not support defendants argument.there,the trial court simply recognized that a party failure to timely seek writ review of an order denying summary judgment did not prevent that party from raising the same issues at trial,or from appealing the resulting judgment.sturm,at.nothing in sturm suggested the moving party could obtain reversal based on the trial court erroneous summary judgment denial where the same issue was adversely decided against the moving party following a fair trial.
coy,supra,d,d reversed a judgment following a jury trial based on the trial court erroneous summary judgment denial.but there,the court expressly noted the plaintiff had not contested the defendant ability to challenge the pretrial summary judgment ruling on appeal after trial.id.at,fn,d.because the issue was never addressed,coy offers no support for defendants argument.see people ault cal th,fn,d,it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.
here,the trial court denied defendants summary judgment motion because it found triable issues of fact whether defendants fraudulently concealed facts upon which the causes of action were based,and whether chfa should have known about defendants wrongdoing more than three years before it filed the action.these factual issues were fully litigated at trial and determined adversely to defendants.for that reason,no miscarriage of justice occurred when the trial court denied defendants summary judgment motion.
d.the trial court properly instructed the jury on section 
the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that section may apply to independent contractors 
section provides,in relevant part members of the legislature,state,county,district,judicial district,and city officers or employees shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity,or by any body or board of which they are members.nor shall state,county,district,judicial district,and city officers or employees be purchasers at any sale or vendors at any purchase made by them in their official capacity.the trial court instructed the jury that t he officer or employee language of section must be interpreted broadly.the fact that someone is designated an independent contractor is not determinative the statute applies to independent contractors who perform a public function.defendants contend the trial court erred in giving this instruction because section applies only to a public agency officers or employees,and therefore could not apply to mcwhirk,an independent contractor.we disagree.
the common law distinction between an employee and independent contractor developed as the courts attempted to establish the parameters for imposing tort liability on the master for the acts of the servant.the supreme court in boswell laird cal cal,explained the responsibility is placed where the power exists.having power to control,the superior or master is bound to exercise it to the prevention of injuries to third parties,or he will be held liable.
the common law,however,does not always govern a reference to employment in a particular statute.borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d.rather,employment must be construed with particular reference to the history and fundamental purposes of the statute.ibid.in contrast to the common law,section is not concerned with holding a public entity liable for harm to third parties based on its agent acts.rather,it places responsibility for acts of on the public servant where he or she exercises sufficient control over the public entity,where the agent is in a position to contract in his or her official capacity.thus,the contractor analysis is not helpful in construing the term employee in section.
section,like all conflict of interest statutes,can not be given a narrow and technical interpretation that would limit its scope and defeat the legislative purpose.people honig th,d honig.thus,in honig,the court construed the financially interested element in section to include not only financial benefits the official personally received,but also those accruing to a nonprofit organization employing the official spouse.similarly,in stigall city of taft cal d,the california supreme court interpreted section imposition of liability for any cont
