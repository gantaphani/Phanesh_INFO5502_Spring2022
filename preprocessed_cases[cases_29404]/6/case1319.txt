this lawsuit arises out of a failed real estate development project.the disappointed investors sued the lender,who had refused to continue financing the project,alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and fraud in the inducement of the loan agreement.the jury awarded plaintiffs on the contract claim and million for fraud.we conclude that the judgment must be reversed.
three limited partnerships formed and controlled by glenn and richard storek the storeks and collectively referred to as old oakland undertook a redevelopment project in downtown oakland to restore and convert several century victorian buildings into office and retail space.storek storek,also owned by the storeks,was the project architect,developer,and building manager.
to fund the project,old oakland borrowed million in from the city of oakland.the city,in turn,raised that money by issuing industrial development bonds backed by letters of credit from citibank as security for old oakland agreement to reimburse citibank for any draws on the letters of credit,citibank obtained a deed of trust on old oakland property and junior deeds of trust on two pieces of san francisco property owned by other partnerships controlled by the commercial building at bush street and another at grant avenue.
by it became clear that the bond funds would be insufficient to complete the project,and old oakland approached citicorp real estate,citicorp,a subsidiary of citibank,to request a loan.in august the parties entered into a construction loan agreement loan agreement by which citicorp agreed to lend old oakland up to million 
the renovation project at this point was in the leasing stage,and the loan agreement provided detailed monthly budgets for the use of funds for the anticipated costs to complete the leasehold improvements.the total costs were projected to be million for construction and financing,with the funding to come from a combination of the citicorp loan,equity contributions,and old oakland operating income.the equity contributions included million to be obtained from refinancing the storeks property at bush street plus an additional million to be raised by old oakland through a tax credit syndication.in the period prior to signing of the loan agreement,citicorp made two bridge loans to old oakland,totaling million,to enable construction to continue.when the property at bush street was eventually refinanced by an unrelated lender,the bridge loans were repaid and million in capital was put into old oakland.
citibank the parent corporation already held deeds of trust on the old oakland project property and the san francisco properties as security for the bonds.as security for the loan agreement,citicorp received a second deed of trust on the old oakland property and junior liens on the properties at bush street and grant avenue.moreover,the loan agreement gave citicorp tight control over disbursements of the loan proceeds to ensure adherence to the project budget.each month,old oakland was required to submit a request for disbursement of loan funds together with progress schedules and a current revised project budget.loan agreement.old oakland represented that the loan funds,together with additional funds provided by old oakland,would at all times be sufficient to complete the project.the loan agreement authorized citicorp to require old oakland to raise additional capital i f at any time the lender determines in the lender sole judgment that such funds to be deposited are not or shall not be sufficient to pay all of such costs and to satisfy such interest obligations b.
under section of the loan agreement,citicorp obligation to make any disbursements was subject to a number of conditions precedent,including the following conditions significant to this appeal first and foremost,the project budget was required to be in balance such that no determination shall have been made by the lender that the undisbursed amount of the loan is less than the amount required to pay all expenses in connection with completion of the construction improvements,including,but not limited to,any extra work,unless the borrower shall have deposited in the construction account an amount at least equal to the amount of such deficiency a ii.
second,citicorp obligation to disburse loan funds arose only if the contractually defined leasing criteria were met.that is,with its monthly request for disbursements,old oakland was required to deliver an executed lease of the space to be improved plus the proposed specifications and cost breakdowns for the tenant improvements,and the costs were not to exceed per square foot of retail space or per square foot of office space.c ii f,a xii.
a third condition to citicorp obligation to disburse the loan funds was that no event of default or potential default shall have occurred and be continuing.a i.a default,in turn,was defined by the loan agreement to include any proceeding for bankruptcy or receivership for the properties secured by citibank deeds of trust if an order for relief remained in effect beyond days.d.such default would automatically terminate citicorp obligation to disburse loan funds.s.a default also included the occurrence of any default under the agreements for reimbursement of the bond funds or any default on the san francisco properties.o,p,q,s.such a default terminated citicorp obligation to make further loan disbursements upon citicorp written notice.s.
for the first three months after the loan agreement was executed,from august to november,citicorp disbursed funds totaling million to reimburse old oakland for expenditures incurred back to january.in november,however,citicorp received a report from its construction monitor that the tenant improvement costs were running very much over the original budget and that the available funds would be insufficient to complete the project.for one thing,a shortfall existed because old oakland had never raised the million in equity capital called for by the project budget.moreover,old oakland had been unable to obtain significant contributions from tenants toward the leasehold improvements.and further,the construction monitor reported that the tenant improvements exceeded the contractual limits on the cost per square foot and projected that the costs to build out future spaces would have the same cost overruns.extrapolating from the current cost overruns,the construction monitor calculated future cost overruns to be several million dollars.
on november,citicorp notified old oakland that its september requisition would not be funded because the expenses were over budget.on november,citicorp outlined the actual and projected cost overruns and further noted old oakland lack of operating income.citicorp was aware that the costs for the early tenants were frequently higher than for later tenants.citicorp asked old oakland to submit a plan for bringing the budget into balance,either by showing that it had raised additional funds or had identified sufficient cost savings.old oakland written responses acknowledged that the budget was out of balance.however,the old oakland representatives complained to citicorp that some of the cited excess tenant improvements had been completed before the loan agreement was executed and that citicorp had full knowledge of those costs beforehand and had paid the requisitions.
old oakland never submitted a written plan for bringing the project budget into balance.however,in january,the storeks submitted a written proposal for funding above the million budget of the loan agreement in order to complete the project.this proposal had two alternative plans.one would expand the project to include restaurants and entertainment sites in addition to the office and retail space and would entail new financing of million the secondary plan would increase the funding for tenant improvements to meet costs as a means to attract stronger tenants.even this smaller plan called for million in additional funding.the storeks had various ideas for obtaining the new funding,none of which involved a new loan from citicorp.
according to plaintiffs evidence at trial,during the negotiations leading to the loan agreement,the storeks on behalf of old oakland had represented to citicorp that million would be sufficient to complete the project in a plain vanilla form.however,the storeks informed citicorp that more money would be necessary to expand the project or to upgrade the tenant improvements,and citicorp assured the storeks that the bank would cooperate to make old oakland a success.the storeks testified that citicorp showed some interest in the january expansion proposal but made no commitments.at the same time,the storeks gave verbal assurances to citicorp that the project could be completed in its plain vanilla form with the funds available.
on january,citicorp informed old oakland that it was not in compliance with the loan agreement and that citicorp would not fund the project until old oakland timely infusion of sufficient equity to complete tenant improvements in progress.in particular,citicorp letter advised old oakland that citicorp would not waive the contractual conditions precedent for funding.nevertheless,citicorp did subsequently disburse some additional funds for past requisitions,totaling million,despite its determination that the project budget was out of balance 
in april old oakland informed citicorp that it had been unable to obtain any new funding.in may,an unrelated lender california federal savings and loan association filed a complaint for appointment of a receiver and for foreclosure against grant that had been pledged to citibank as security for the bonds.under the terms of the loan agreement,a receivership lasting more than days constituted a default.d.hence,by july a default in the loan agreement had occurred.in august the partnership owning the grant avenue building filed for bankruptcy.this event again placed old oakland in default under the loan agreement,as did the subsequent bankruptcy of bush street.c.the two san francisco properties were eventually foreclosed by their respective senior lenders.
on august,citicorp notified old oakland that it was in default under the loan agreement for lack of financial reporting,material adverse change in the condition of the borrower,bankruptcy of related collateral,and the borrower failure to maintain the collateral free of liens and that no further loan funds would be disbursed.at that point,citicorp had disbursed all but of the million.
earlier,citicorp had automatically without a requisition from old oakland disbursed loan funds each quarter to citibank to pay the interest on the million bonds that had been issued by the city.in september,however,citicorp refused to make the disbursement from the loan proceeds.the bond trustee then made a demand on citibank pursuant to its letters of credit,and citibank paid the interest of.citibank then demanded reimbursement from old oakland,but old oakland was unable to meet the demand inasmuch as citicorp had cut off the funds.this event,too,constituted a default under the loan agreement.o,p,q.
to avoid an actual default on the bonds,citicorp arranged to pay the interest from its own assets and then charged it as a soft cost allocation to the construction loan account.an affiliate of citibank eventually purchased all the bonds.
on september,citibank sent old oakland a notice of default under its reimbursement agreement based on old oakland failure to reimburse the interest on the bonds,and citicorp sent old oakland a notice of default under the loan agreement based on old oakland default under the reimbursement agreement with citibank.on september citicorp recorded a notice of default and subsequently filed a complaint for judicial foreclosure of its deed of trust on the old oakland property.citicorp internal action plan reflects that citicorp waited to proceed to foreclosure until after the leased space had been outfitted for the tenants and occupied.on december,the court found old oakland in default and appointed a receiver.on december,old oakland filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court allowed citibank to foreclose its deed of trust,and at the foreclosure sale an affiliate of citibank oakland victorians realty,purchased the property with a full credit bid of million.at that point,citibank did put money into the project to complete the construction.
ii.procedural history 
in the present lawsuit was filed against citicorp and citibank by the bankruptcy trustees for old oakland,for bush street,and for grant avenue,and by storek storek.subsequently,a group of old oakland investors glenn storek and limited partners purchased the claims from the bankruptcy trustees and were substituted in as plaintiffs.the complaint alleged causes of action for,among other things,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,promissory fraud,and fraud by concealment.
the first trial resulted in a hung jury.in the course of that first trial,citicorp moved for nonsuit,and the trial court expressed doubt whether plaintiffs had established a breach of contract arising from citicorp failure to disburse the loan funds.thereafter,plaintiffs dismissed their cause of action for breach of the loan agreement.they also dismissed other causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the matter went to the jury only on plaintiffs causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,promissory fraud,and fraud by concealment.storek storek,and the partnerships owning bush street and grant avenue,who were not parties to the loan agreement,proceeded only on fraud.
it was plaintiffs theory that citibank and citicorp deliberately engineered the collapse of old oakland.plaintiffs contended that citicorp entered into the loan agreement without any intent to finance the project fully but merely to keep the renovation project going until old oakland suffered a monetary default on the bonds so that citibank could foreclose.plaintiffs asserted that citicorp intended to use the budget balance provisions of the loan agreement unjustifiably to benefit citibank so as to cut off the funding,thereby precipitating foreclosure and enabling an affiliate to acquire the old oakland property for a fraction of its value.in support of that theory,plaintiffs argued that citicorp deliberately set the cost limitations for tenant improvements at such a low level that citicorp could make an determination at any time.plaintiffs also emphasized evidence that citicorp determination in november was based on cost overruns on tenant improvements that had already been completed before the loan agreement was signed.further,plaintiffs pointed to evidence that after making the determination citicorp continued to fund items that would benefit its own interests,hard costs for physical improvements plus interest payments to citibank on the bonds while cutting off soft costs such as the salaries for the leasing staff that were needed to keep the project operational.
at the conclusion of the second trial,by special verdict the jury found citicorp liable and awarded old oakland for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and awarded old oakland,the partnership owning bush street,and storek storek,million for fraud the trial court ruled that because only citicorp was a party to the loan agreement,only the assets of citicorp would be considered for calculating punitive damages,not the assets of citibank.this ruling was deemed a directed verdict for citibank.the trial court also granted a directed verdict for citicorp on punitive damages,ruling that plaintiffs were ineligible for punitive damages because they were assignees of the original plaintiffs.the trial court denied citicorp motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial,and judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs aggregating million.citicorp appeals.plaintiffs and also filed a separate appeal from the order on attorney fees.we consolidated the two appeals.
iii.discussion 
breach of covenant of good faith 
the first issue before us pertains to the jury verdict on the cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.at the outset,it bears emphasizing that plaintiffs only contract claim was that citicorp breached the implied covenant plaintiffs dismissed their cause of action for breach of the express terms of the loan agreement.
plaintiffs claim was that citicorp determinations beginning in november that the project budget was out of balance were made in bad faith and that citicorp breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it withheld the loan funds based on those bad faith determinations.the jury obviously agreed and awarded plaintiffs for breach of the implied covenant of good the amount of funds left undisbursed from the million loan citicorp now maintains that the judgment must be reversed because as a matter of law there could be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when its offending loan authorized by the express terms of the contract 
plaintiffs respond by mischaracterizing citicorp argument as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury finding of a breach of the covenant of good faith.plaintiffs mistakenly presume that the question whether the covenant of good faith contradicted the express terms of the loan agreement was a question of fact for the jury.indeed,the issue was presented to the jury under the instructions set out in footnote nine,post.however,we conclude that the issue posed by citicorp is a question of law that requires us to examine whether citicorp owed a duty to act in good faith when deciding whether to disburse the loan funds.the essential historical facts were undisputed.moreover,there was no dispute as to the meaning of the decisive terms of the loan agreement.under these circumstances,when there was no extrinsic evidence to indicate conflicting interpretations of the contract,we make an independent determination as to the obligations of each party under the contract.parsons bristol development cal d.as we will explain,we conclude that citicorp was required to make only an objectively reasonable determination that the project budget was not in balance citicorp had no duty to act in subjective good faith when making that determination.
it has long been recognized,of course,that every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in the performance of the contract such that neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the supreme court has clarified,however,that an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can not contradict the express terms of a contract.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,carma.
in carma,a commercial lease expressly gave the lessor the right to terminate the lease and recapture the leasehold upon notice of the tenant intent to sublet.after the tenant relocated its headquarters out of the area,it submitted a notice of intent to sublet approximately percent of the premises.the lessor responded with a notice of termination and then unsuccessfully pursued negotiations of a new lease with the proposed subtenant,seeking to secure for itself the higher rents.the tenant obtained a judgment for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but the supreme court directed that judgment be entered in favor of the lessor.the court held as a matter of law that because the lessor termination of the lease was expressly permitted by the lease and clearly within the parties expectations,such conduct could never violate an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.carma,supra,cal th at,d.
the carma court reasoned as follows it is universally recognized that the scope of conduct prohibited by the covenant of good faith is circumscribed by the purposes and express terms of the contract.citations.we are aware of no reported case in which a court has held the covenant of good faith may be read to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement.on the contrary,as a general matter,implied terms should never be read to vary express terms.citations.the general rule regarding the covenant of good faith is plainly subject to the exception that the parties may,by express provisions of the contract,grant the right to engage in the very acts and conduct which would otherwise have been forbidden by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing this is in accord with the general principle that,in interpreting a contract an implication should not be made when the contrary is indicated in clear and express words.citation.as to acts and conduct authorized by the express provisions of the contract,no covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be implied which forbids such acts and conduct.and if defendants were given the right to do what they did by the express provisions of the contract there can be no breach.citation.carma,supra,cal th at,d,see also new hampshire ins.ridout roofing th,d.
in the present case,citicorp was expressly authorized by section a ii of the loan agreement to withhold loan funds if the project budget was out of balance such that the anticipated expenses exceeded available funds.clearly it was within the parties expectations that citicorp would regularly determine whether the project budget was in balance.under section of the loan agreement,old oakland was required to submit along with its monthly requests for disbursements a current project budget and evidence satisfactory to the lender that the leasing criteria had been met.the obvious purpose for this documentation was to enable citicorp to make its determination whether the conditions precedent had been met for disbursement of the loan funds.
the offending conduct of the defendant was likewise expressly allowed under the contract in third story music,waits th,d third story music.there the parties had an agreement whereby warner communications agreed to manufacture,sell,distribute,and advertise the works of tom waits,but the agreement further provided that warner may at our election refrain from any or all of the foregoing.id.at,d.the plaintiff sued for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,claiming that warner had impeded the plaintiff from receiving the benefits of the contract,but the court affirmed the trial court sustaining of warner demurrer.the court concluded as a matter of law that because the agreement gave warner discretionary power and expressly allowed warner to refrain from marketing the waits recordings,warner had no duty of good faith in exercising its discretion.id.at,d.
the court analysis in third story music is instructive and compelling.after a thorough review of the case law,the court explained that when a party is given absolute discretion by express contract language,the courts will imply a covenant of good faith and fair dealing to limit that discretion in order to create a binding contract and avoid a finding that the promise is illusory.however,when the contract is adequately supported by adequate consideration regardless of the discretionary power,there is no need to impose a covenant of good faith in order to create mutuality.the conclusion to be drawn is that the courts are not at liberty to imply a covenant directly at odds with a contract express grant of discretionary power except in those relatively rare instances when reading the provision literally would,contrary to the parties clear intention,result in an unenforceable,illusory agreement.third story music,supra,th at,d.
in third story music,the court noted that warner promise to market the waits recordings at its election would have been an illusory promise had it been the only consideration given,and a promise to use good faith would have necessarily been implied in order to make it enforceable.however,because warner gave other promise to pay a guaranteed minimum amount no matter what efforts were covenant of good faith was not necessary to render the agreement binding.accordingly,the court held that warner owed no duty to act in good faith when exercising the discretion expressly granted to it by the contract.see also pmc,porthole yachts,th,d.
in the present case,citicorp contends carma and third story music are controlling because citicorp,too,had absolute discretion under the loan agreement to refrain from making loan disbursements.we disagree with citicorp in this respect under the plain language of the loan agreement,citicorp obligation to make the loan disbursements was not discretionary citicorp obligation was conditional upon the fulfillment of a condition precedent,namely,citicorp satisfaction that the project budget was in balance 
when,as here,a contract provides that the satisfaction of one of the parties is a condition precedent to that party performance,two different tests are recognized the party may make a purely subjective decision but it must be made in good faith or the party must make the decision in accordance with an objective standard of reasonableness.mattei hopper cal d,mattei tiffany pacific sewer pipe cal,guntert city of stockton d.guntert kadner shields d.kadner.in this context,reasonableness and good faith are distinct concepts.a decision is unreasonable when it is arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.a lack of good faith,on the other hand,suggests a moral quality,such as dishonesty,deceit,or unfaithfulness to duty.guntert,supra,at.when the promisor has the power to make a purely subjective decision,that decision must be made in good faith,but the courts will not examine its reasonableness.hall webb,as long as riparian owners honestly determined their water supply was lessened,it was immaterial whether that determination was illogical or incorrect see also locke warner,th,d locke schuyler pantages,schuyler.conversely,when the promisor satisfaction is evaluated under the objective test,the validity of the promisor decision of satisfaction or dissatisfaction rests only on the reasonableness of the decision the courts will not examine good faith.guntert,supra,at.
guntert illustrates the latter point.in that case,the city leased certain waterfront property to a tenant,but the lease allowed the city to terminate the lease when the city council was satisfied with a development proposal for the property from a third party.in a lawsuit by the tenant,the trial court found that the city terminated the lease unreasonably and in bad faith when it failed to inquire into the feasibility of the third party development proposal or its ability to finance it.guntert,supra,d at.the appellate court upheld the trial court decision on the ground that the city acted unreasonably,but the court declined to examine whether the city acted in good faith,finding reasonableness to be the only standard by which to evaluate the city council satisfaction with the development proposal.id.at.
the choice of objective or subjective test to evaluate a promisor satisfaction depends upon the intent of the parties,as expressed in the language of the contract.in the absence of a specific expression in the contract or one implied from the subject matter,the preference of the law is for the less arbitrary reasonable person standard.guntert,supra,d at.kadner,supra,d at.the reasonableness test is especially preferable when factors of commercial value or financial concern are involved,as distinct from matters of personal taste.kadner,supra,at.see also mattei,supra,cal d at.here,of course,the contract was a commercial transaction involving the lending of money.the decision to be made by citicorp as to whether the project budget was in balance was a matter entirely of financial concern and had no implications for aesthetics or other aspects of personal taste.
the present case is distinguishable from locke,supra,th,d,which involved matters of artistic judgment.in that case,a movie studio had an agreement with actress sondra locke that gave the studio the right of first refusal over locke movie project proposals and the right to use her services as a director.when the studio declined to develop any of her proposals,locke sued for breach of contract,claiming the agreement was a sham.the appellate court reversed the trial court grant of summary judgment and held that a question of fact existed on whether the studio violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the development agreement allowed the movie studio to make its own subjective creative decisions about locke movie proposals,and the court applied the general principle that when a condition of a promisor duty is subjective satisfaction with the promisee performance,the promisor is nonetheless required to exercise his subjective judgment honestly and in good faith pursuant to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d.the court found the rule of carma and third story music inapplicable because the development agreement did not give the movie studio the express right to refrain from working with locke.rather,the agreement gave the studio discretion with respect to developing locke projects.the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing obligated warner to exercise that discretion honestly and in good faith.locke,supra,at,d,italics omitted.
because the decision of the movie studio involved matters of artistic judgment,locke applied the subjective test for determining the satisfaction of the movie studio as a condition precedent to its performance.that test allows the promisor to make a purely subjective decision,as long as the promisor exercises its subjective judgment in good faith.see also schuyler,supra.at,contract to produce vaudeville act.here,however,in contrast to locke,the determination of citicorp involved matters of financial calculations.the proper method for evaluating citicorp satisfaction with the budget balance was the objective a reasonable person would be satisfied.
the rationale behind the two tests for evaluating a promisor satisfaction relates to the familiar issue of whether a promise is illusory.when a condition precedent to a promisor performance calls for satisfaction as to commercial value,the contract is not illusory because the promisor ability to claim dissatisfaction is limited by the standard of reasonableness.on the other hand,when the promisor satisfaction deals with matters of fancy,taste,or judgment,the promisor judgment is purely subjective.the covenant of good faith is implied in order to set a limit on the promisor ability to express dissatisfaction and thereby supply adequate consideration to support the contract.mattei,supra,cal d at.
parallel reasoning applies when the promisor is expressly given absolute discretion to perform and when the promisor performance is expressly conditional upon the promisor satisfaction.in both instances,courts will imply a covenant of good faith to limit the promisor express contractual authority only when necessary to create mutuality.mattei,supra,cal d at,third story music,supra,th at,d.when,as in third story music,the promisor has discretion to perform but has given other consideration or,when,as here,the promisor performance is conditional on his objectively reasonable satisfaction,then the promisor ability to avoid performance is sufficiently curtailed,the promise is not illusory,and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing need not be implied to create a binding promise.
this analysis leads us to conclude that citicorp owed no duty of good faith in determining whether the conditions precedent to its performance had been fulfilled.the loan agreement was a freely negotiated contract entered into by sophisticated business entities.under the terms of that contract,expressly agreed to by old oakland,citicorp obligation to disburse the loan funds was conditional on its objectively reasonable determination that the project budget was in balance.no obligation to act in good faith can be implied to contradict or limit that express condition precedent.no inquiry into good faith can be made.
in our view,the jury was incorrectly instructed to evaluate citicorp determination regarding the loan balance for both reasonableness and good faith a contract may give one of the parties discretionary power to take certain actions to protect its interests or to make sure that it will receive the benefits of the contract.when the contract does
