on august,ephc filed the merger agreement as part of an application for approval of the merger with the federal home loan bank board fhlbb.id.at.the application,which was signed by hughes as president of ephc,detailed that hughes would cause the fourteen real estate parcels to be contributed to the capitalization of the merged company.id.during the review and negotiation process,the fhlbb agents focused on the value of the proposed contribution of these real estate parcels.id.at.hughes was heavily involved with the agents investigation,providing them with necessary information relating to ownership and valuation.id.at.the fhlbb was particularly concerned that twelve of the fourteen parcels were housing apartments.id.at.to ease this concern,the head fhlbb agent made hughes agree to personally guarantee that a yearly rental income of million for these properties would flow to the thrift that hughes would continue to manage the properties and that the properties would not be sold for less than book value without regulatory consent.id.at.with these guarantees in place,the parties agreed on a million valuation of the real estate contribution.these guarantees were subsequently reduced to writing in an agreement of obligation.
on may,the fhlbb issued an approval letter to the boards of directors for ephc and old el paso.the approval letter notified the companies of fhlbb approval of old el paso conversion from a mutual savings and loan to a thrift as well as ephc application to acquire control of the thrift.on the same day,fhlbb also issued a forbearance letter,addressed to the president of old el paso,granting the merged entity certain supervisory forbearances.id.at.most notably,the forbearance letter included a goodwill accounting forbearance permitting the value of any unidentifiable intangible assets resulting from accounting for the merger in accordance with the purchase method to be amortized by new el paso over a period not to exceed twenty five years.
on the closing date for the merger,may,hughes personally signed the agreement of obligation as obligor,and he signed on behalf of new el paso as obligee.the fhlbb also signed the agreement of obligation,but its role was specifically limited to the right to enforce the obligations on behalf of new el paso.
on the same day,ephc and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic executed a regulatory capital maintenance dividend agreement dividend agreement.the dividend agreement provided that in consideration of the fslic approving the acquisition of control of el paso federal ephc will cause the regulatory capital of new el paso to be maintained at a level at or above the regulatory capital requirement and as necessary,will infuse sufficient additional capital to effect compliance with such requirement.according to the dividend agreement definitions,regulatory capital requirement means the resulting institution regulatory capital requirement at a given time computed in accordance with b,or any successor regulation thereto.the dividend agreement also included a miscellaneous provision that stated a ll references to regulations of the board or the fslic used in this agreement shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquiror obligation under this agreement.
after the closing,old el paso converted from a mutual to of ownership and ephc acquired old el paso and merged the thrift into new el paso.in addition,hughes caused the real estate parcels and cash capitalization to occur,although not precisely as contemplated in the application regulators reviewing the transaction agreed that it was complete and acceptable in accordance with the requirements in fhlbb approval letter.
just over a year after the el paso conversion and merger transaction,congress enacted firrea,which limited the ability of thrift institutions to count supervisory goodwill towards their regulatory capital requirements.see winstar,at.under these new capital standards,new el paso regulatory capital fell below the required levels.hughes ii.at.regulators informed new el paso that it would be out of capital compliance on december,the effective date of the regulations.id.new el paso was directed to immediately discontinue including supervisory goodwill in its capital calculation.id.at.on september,new el paso remained far below the capital requirements,and the office of thrift supervision placed new el paso in a receivership with significant operating restrictions.new el paso was subsequently liquidated.id.at.
hughes and ephc filed a complaint in the court of federal claims on september,alleging that the government enactment of firrea constituted a breach of contract between the plaintiffs and the government,which allowed new el paso to count goodwill toward its regulatory capital requirements.after the supreme court decision in winstar,the court of federal claims originally granted both plaintiffs motions for summary judgment as to liability.hughes i.at.the court thereafter conducted a trial on damages and reconsidered its earlier decision as to liability based upon two intervening decisions from this court admiral financial united states,and franklin federal savings bank united states.in hughes ii,the court determined based on our precedent that the government was not liable to ephc because ephc assumed the risk of regulatory change in the dividend agreement.at.the court held,however,that hughes was not bound by the dividend agreement,and therefore,did not assume the risk of r
