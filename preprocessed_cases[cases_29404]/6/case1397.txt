in this appeal we consider,among other issues,the appropriate measure of damages in a claim arising from the theft of certain business records and the related termination of a collection agency contract with a bank.a jury found that,in conspiracy with the bank,the president of the collection agency stole business records from the agency,and used those records to service collections for the bank at a new collection agency.because the contract between the bank and the original collection agency was terminable at will,however,the bank argued that the original collection agency suffered no damages.the trial court agreed,and entered a judgment of zero damages.we conclude that the trial court erred in limiting the collection agency to a contract measure of damages.the tort measure of damages,which should have been applied,allows recovery for lost profits resulting from the bank wrongful conduct.accordingly,we reverse and remand for a trial on damages.
factual and procedural background 
from until,empire financial services,empire was one of several secondary collection agencies retained by the bank of new york delaware bank to service its unpaid credit card debt under the terms of the operative secondary collection agreement agreement,the bank referred accounts to empire for collection either by legal action or other collection procedures.empire was given months to work the account.if empire succeeded in establishing a repayment schedule with the debtor a paying account,or executing on a judgment against the debtor a legal account,empire received of all amounts recovered.
empire compiled a database for the accounts it serviced,which included information such as debtors addresses and job histories,contact numbers and notes of contacts,attorney lists,matters referred to attorneys,and other information developed by empire in an effort to secure repayment from the debtors.under the agreement,empire was required to provide the bank with reports,but those reports only included the account number,referral date,status,and balance.in addition,the bank was entitled to audit any and all accounts the bank could recall one or more of its accounts at any time,for any reason thereafter,empire was entitled to receive its commission only on payments made within days after the recall.by january,empire paying and legal accounts were yielding about per month in profits.
during the months before his departure,elviro ocasio,president and general manager of empire,attempted to acquire the company.he owned of the stock and tried to purchase the remaining stock from the three other stockholders joseph maccari,the founder,who owned,and frances and daniel brousseau,who both owned jointly.maccari rejected several proposals,however,so ocasio decided it was time to move on.at the end of january,ocasio contacted james armistead,the bank employee responsible for empire accounts.ocasio told armistead that he was going to leave empire and join another collection agency.they met for lunch on january,and agreed informally that the bank would transfer its accounts from empire to ocasio new agency.on this subject,ocasio testified as follows 
q.so when you had lunch,had you basically reached an agreement with him that you were relatively confident that the bank would give you the empire accounts 
although there was a verbal or written agreement,i felt fairly confident that,when i moved to the new agency,that i was going to get the empire account.
to your thinking,did armistead believe or know that you had sufficient information on the accounts to basically be able to step into empire shoes and service those accounts 
a.he had knowledge that i had some information that would help me service the accounts.to what detail,i do think he knew the detail of what we had.
ocasio clarified this testimony by affidavit,stating that,when he left the luncheon with armistead,he felt he had a verbal agreement that the bank would transfer its accounts to the new agency,and that armistead knew ocasio had information that would help him service the empire accounts without a reduction in cash flow 
on friday,january,ocasio resigned from empire.over the next two days,ocasio vandalized empire offices and stole various client contracts,personnel files,and other business records.the following monday,gwen wood,one of empire employees,opened the office in the morning and found it in shambles.there was a letter from armistead on ocasio desk,dated january,that did not appear to have been mailed.the letter advised ocasio,as president of empire,that the bank was withdrawing all of its accounts because the bank was pursuing a different strategy.
ocasio and most of empire other employees joined dba collection and administrative services,dba in early february,and the bank transferred all of its empire accounts to dba within a few days after ocasio started at dba.raul torres,one of the empire employees who moved to dba,testified that,during the last week of january,he helped ocasio carry sealed boxes out of empire offices.torres later learned that those boxes contained all the relevant collection data for the bank accounts.the documents were printed on january,and dba employees spent several weeks,working,inputting the data from those documents into dba system.according to torres,ocasio instructed torres to take the documents home with him every night,and to destroy them after the data had been transferred 
in early february,empire sought injunctive relief against ocasio in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.empire obtained a temporary restraining order,and eventually reached a settlement with ocasio.in,empire filed suit in delaware against the bank,armistead,ocasio,and other former empire employees.the operative complaint,which now names only the bank and armistead as defendants,includes claims of conversion tortious interference with business relationships breach of contract civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment 
in,the superior court granted the bank motion for summary judgment as to all claims except civil conspiracy the conspiracy claim was tried in,but the trial court severed liability and damages.the jury returned a verdict in favor of empire on liability and the damages trial was scheduled to begin in april.before the second trial,however,the bank again moved for summary judgment.the court ruled that t he measure of damages in this case does not include ongoing lost profits.the tortious conduct which gives rise to the civil conspiracy claim here was this theft of the paper,of the documents,and the information contained therein.the trial court entered a judgment of zero dollars based on its conclusion that empire was limited to contract damages.
both parties appealed.empire seeks review of the trial court refusal to review the arbitrator decision about what constituted the operative agreement grant of summary judgment to the bank on empire breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and tortious interference claims and award of zero dollars in damages.the bank from the trial court denial of its motion for summary judgment on the civil conspiracy claim.
discussion 
arbitration award.
empire arbitration argument requires little comment.the parties stipulated to binding arbitration on the question of which version of the agreement governs.empire,dissatisfied with the arbitrator factual determination,filed a complaint to modify or vacate the award.at the hearing on the bank motion for judgment on the pleadings,empire argued that the superior court should review the arbitrator findings of fact,including his decision to accept the authenticity of certain documents.the superior court responded 
well,counsel,unless you can make a record that says you did agree to binding arbitration i see the decision of the arbitrator.i see an explanation for his findings and i think it it appears to be perfectly rational,and that going to be the basis on which we proceed.
the trial court properly refused to undertake any additional review of the arbitrator factual determination 
empire argues that the trial court should have reviewed the arbitrator decision to determine whether he follow ed the law,as require
