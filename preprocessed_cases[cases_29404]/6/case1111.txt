in this case,the issue is whether the government is liable for breach of contract resulting in alleged losses sustained by plaintiff fifth third bank of western ohio fifth third.the transactions at issue are familiar,arising out of the thrift industry problems in the.the united states court of federal claims held a trial on the issue.after plaintiff presented its,the government moved for judgment on the theory that the evidence did not establish the existence of the alleged contractual obligations.the trial court granted the government motion fifth third appeals the trial court judgment that the united states was not liable for breach of contract.
earlier in the proceedings the government had moved for partial summary judgment with respect to plaintiff damages claims.the court granted the motion in part,thereby precluding plaintiff from presenting certain damages theories at trial.fifth third appeals one aspect of this trial court rejection of fifth third expectation damages model based on a hypothetical cost of replacing,or covering,goodwill lost as a result of breach.
with regard to liability,the trial court erred in concluding that contracts did not exist between the united states and fifth third,citizens federal bank fsb citizens regarding citizens acquisition of four failing thrifts the contractual terms included permission for citizens to use the purchase method of accounting to amortize supervisory goodwill over an extended period of time and to count supervisory goodwill toward capital reserve requirements.as has been explained in other cases,subsequent government activity caused these contracts to be breached.
with regard to damages,the trial court correctly ruled that plaintiff hypothetical cost of cover is not a proper measure of damages.accordingly,the judgment of the court of federal claims is and.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
regulatory setting 
it has been more than twenty years since the critical events in the thrift industry crisis of the occurred,and almost a decade since the law that governs these cases was first established.during that time the history and circumstances surrounding the thrift crisis and the ensuing events,including enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.firrea,have been extensively discussed in opinions of the supreme court,see united states winstar,d,and this court,see,winstar united states,en banc glendale fed.bank,fsb united states.we need provide only a brief overview here to serve as backdrop for our decision in this case.
rising interest rates and inflation during the late and early precipitated a crisis in the savings and loan industry.more than thrifts failed between and,and many additional thrifts were on the verge of insolvency.this situation threatened to exhaust the insurance fund of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic.
to deal with this crisis,the federal home loan bank board fhlbb,the agency responsible for regulating federally chartered savings and loan associations,sought out healthy financial institutions and outside investors for the purpose of having them purchase troubled thrifts through the use of supervisory mergers.the fhlbb offered financial incentives to induce such mergers and to prevent an acquiring thrift from becoming insolvent upon completion of the transaction.the incentive most pertinent to this case was the accounting treatment of what was called supervisory goodwill,basically the difference between the fair market value of the failing thrift liabilities assumed by an acquiring thrift and the fair market value of the failing thrift assets.
in a merger utilizing supervisory goodwill,the fhlbb would permit the acquiring institution to count supervisory goodwill toward its reserve capital requirements and to use the purchase method of accounting to amortize this supervisory goodwill over an extended period of time,up to forty years.additional incentives provided by the fhlbb in some supervisory mergers included cash contributions in the form of permanent credits to regulatory capital and forbearance agreements by the fhlbb not to enforce regulatory capital requirements for a specified period of time.
however these various measures were,the problems in the savings and loan industry persisted.in congress stepped in with the enactment of firrea.firrea abolished the fhlbb and fslic,transferred thrift insurance activities to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,established the office of thrift supervision ots as the new thrift regulatory agency,created the resolution trust company rtc to liquidate failed thrifts,and made substantial changes in the regulation of the savings and loan industry.
directly to the point for purposes of this case,firrea also created a minimum capital requirement for thrifts,phased out the thrifts ability to count supervisory goodwill toward capital requirements,and limited the amortization period of supervisory goodwill.the impact of firrea,in particular the supervisory goodwill provisions,was swift and severe,and many thrifts quickly fell out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements,making them subject to seizure by thrift regulators.
this course of events gave rise to hundreds of lawsuits filed by formerly healthy thrifts that had been acquirers of failing thrifts.the plaintiffs sought damages from the government under several theories,including breach of contract.the thrifts alleged that congress enactment of firrea breached the government obligation to allow special accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill.in due course the matter reached the supreme court in united states winstar,d.the appeal involved the cases of three acquiring thrifts taken as test cases the cases had been consolidated for appeal.the supreme court affirmed this court en banc determination that the thrifts had indeed entered into enforceable contracts with the government,and that the government was liable for breach of contract as a result of the enactment and enforcement of firrea.
in the years since the supreme court winstar decision,appeals in numerous cases have come before this court.because the background and the fact pattern of the government involvement with the thrifts are,in many cases the existence between the government and the acquiring thrift of an agreement to allow supervisory goodwill is clear.the government concedes liability,and the issue of contention between the parties has been the amount of damages in a relatively few cases,because of particular circumstances in the transactions at issue,the government has contested whether the fhlbb and the thrift understood that supervisory goodwill would be part of the transaction.
in assessing the issue of contractual obligation and breach,there is a difference between the issue of contract formation and the issue,once it is determined that the relationship is one of contract,of interpreting the dimension of particular contractual obligations.in this case,the parties do not dispute basic issues of offer,acceptance,and consideration,the essentials of contract formation.what is in dispute is whether a particular term is part of whatever contract existed between the parties,did the parties intend to bind themselves to amortization of the regulatory goodwill created by the transactions in which they engaged.often in cases such as this,with the facts of record and generally agreed,the matter is decided on summary judgment this case is unusual in having the facts and the trial court conclusions determined only after a full trial.
factual history 
citizens,a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association headquartered in dayton,ohio,acquired or merged with four failing thrifts between and.as found by the trial court,each transaction at issue in this case followed the same general pattern.the federal home loan bank of cincinnati had identified citizens as a healthy thrift and therefore a candidate for acquiring or merging with failed thrifts.in each of the four transactions,contacted citizens to propose a supervisory merger with the failing thrift.in each case citizens and the failing thrift entered into a purchase agreement or a merger agreement expressly conditioned upon obtaining approval of the agreement by fhlbb.citizens and the failing thrift then submitted an application for merger to.
conditionally approved each transaction by issuing a bank board resolution specifying the additional steps necessary for obtaining final approval.each resolution required citizens to furnish an opinion from its independent accountant justifying the use of the purchase method of accounting,describing any goodwill arising from the purchase,and substantiating the reasonableness and amounts of the goodwill and the related amortization period.citizens complied with the requirements set forth in each resolution,including submission of an opinion letter from its accountant.then submitted each proposed acquisition or merger to fhlbb headquarters for final approval.fhlbb approved each transaction,and citizens accounted for each,including the use of the purchase method,the amortizing of goodwill over an extended period,and the counting of goodwill toward its regulatory capital requirements.
at trial,plaintiff presented extensive testimony by jerry kirby,president and chief executive officer of citizens,and lawrence muldoon,chief supervisory agent,describing the negotiations between citizens and with respect to the four transactions.the first transaction was citizens acquisition of thirteen branches of cardinal federal savings and loan association cardinal in.kirby testified that the cardinal transaction was initiated when mcelheney,at the time a supervisory agent at and muldoon subordinate,contacted citizens to propose that citizens acquire the cardinal branches.he explained that the fhlbb would permit citizens to book cardinal negative net worth as goodwill,which would count as an asset for regulatory capital purposes and could be amortized over an extended period of time.
kirby testified that he followed up with muldoon to more fully understand how such an arrangement would work.kirby asked muldoon if citizens could receive cash assistance.muldoon replied that there was no cash assistance available,but citizens could book supervisory goodwill as an asset and amortize it over an extended period of time.muldoon testimony confirmed that he offered goodwill as a substitute for cash assistance.according to kirby,he viewed the goodwill accounting treatment as the sine qua non of the cardinal acquisition because without it citizens would have immediately fallen out of capital compliance.kirby testified that he discussed the proposed arrangement with his board of directors,although no written records of any meetings exist.
citizens and cardinal entered into a formal purchase agreement expressly conditioned upon receiving fhlbb approval.citizens submitted a merger application to.the application included a pro forma financial statement based on the assumption of a amortization period for goodwill.conditionally approved the transaction in board resolution.as a condition for final approval,the resolution required citizens to submit an opinion from its independent accountant that 
a indicates the justification under generally accepted accounting principles gaap for use of the purchase method of accounting,b specifically describes any goodwill arising from the purchase to be recorded on citizens books,and c substantiates the reasonableness and amounts of such goodwill and related year amortization period and method.
sent a letter to the fhlbb recommending approval of the cardinal acquisition.the letter stated that approximately million of goodwill would result from the transaction and would be amortized over thirty years.citizens submitted the required accountant letter,which indicated that goodwill would be amortized over forty years,not thirty years.the fhlbb thereafter approved the transaction,and citizens booked million of goodwill using a amortization period.
citizens entered into three subsequent supervisory gateway federal savings and loan association gateway in,with homestead federal savings and loan association homestead in,and with first federal savings and loan association first federal in.in each case,identified the failing thrift,and muldoon of contacted kirby to propose that citizens acquire or merge with the failing thrift.according to trial testimony,the discussions between kirby and muldoon leading up to each transaction followed a similar pattern.when considering whether to acquire each thrift,kirby requested fslic cash assistance.muldoon responded each time that no cash assistance was available,but that instead he could offer the same regulatory and accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill that had been used in the cardinal transaction,use of the purchase method of accounting to book supervisory goodwill as an asset that would count toward regulatory capital requirements and be amortized over an extended period of time.
following the negotiations between kirby and muldoon regarding each potential transaction,citizens and the fhlbb exchanged documents similar to those in the cardinal transaction,as noted above.the documents,however,lacked some of the detail provided in the cardinal documents.for example,the board resolutions for the gateway,homestead,and first federal transactions required citizens to provide an opinion from its independent accountant justifying the use of the purchase method of accounting,describing any goodwill arising from the transaction to be recorded on citizens books,and substantiating the reasonableness and amounts of such goodwill and related amortization period and method.these resolutions,however,did not specify the length of the amortization period.nevertheless,it is undisputed that for each transaction citizens booked supervisory goodwill as an asset and amortized it over a period of twenty years for homestead and first federal or ten years for gateway.
c.the trial 
after discovery in this case,both parties filed motions for summary judgment on liability.the trial court denied both motions.fifth third bank of ohio united states,fed.cl.fifth third i.the court granted the government motion for reconsideration in order to address whether had actual authority to bind the government to a contract,an issue the trial court had erroneously deemed abandoned in its prior ruling.the court concluded that possessed implied actual authority to bind the fhlbb to promises regarding the accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill.fifth third bank of ohio united states,fed.cl.fifth third ii.
meanwhile,the government moved for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff damages claims.the trial court granted this motion in part,concluding that plaintiff was not entitled to pursue various damages theories at trial,including its calculation of expectancy damages based on the doctrine of cover.fifth third bank of ohio united states,fed.cl,fifth third iii.
the case proceeded to trial on the issues of liability and the remaining damages theories.at the close of plaintiff,the government moved for judgment on partial findings pursuant to court of federal claims rule c.the trial judge orally granted the motion with respect to liability and denied it with respect to damages,and thereafter issued a written opinion.fifth third bank of ohio united states,fed cl.fifth third iv.
as discussed,plaintiff case included substantial oral and deposition testimony describing the communications between citizens and.the trial judge specifically found that kirby citizens president thought that citizens had contracts with the government.muldoon,mcelheney,and thiemann the government officials all thought that fhlbb had entered into contracts and that fhlbb had made a commitment to recognize goodwill for regulatory purposes that could not be withdrawn.id.at.regarding the credibility of this testimony,the trial court noted that some of the testimony seemed to be rote,perhaps because of the long time since the events,but that the court credits fully the integrity of these gentlemen.id.despite these findings,the trial court concluded that the agreements between the parties were not contractual relationships,at least in part because the only written evidence corroborating the witness testimony was contained in what the court described as routine agency documents.id.at.
the court of federal claims entered final judgment in favor of the united states.in this appeal,fifth third challenges the trial court rule c judgment on liability and the trial court partial summary judgment precluding fifth third from presenting its cover damages theory at trial.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the trial court cast the issue of liability in terms of contract and acceptance,consideration,actual authority,and mutuality of intent.she posed the question as what evidence should be required to establish a commitment to provide something of value within the regulatory framework,along with the concomitant commitment not to regulate in contravention of that agreement fifth third iv,fed.cl.at.on appeal plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by failing to accord proper weight to trial testimony regarding negotiations between citizens and officials.plaintiff further argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed the documentary evidence relating to citizens supervisory mergers as merely reflecting regulatory approval of the transactions rather than contractual commitments between the parties.the government responds that the documents in evidence were indeed regulatory in nature and that the testimony was too general and vague to show that the written documents actually demonstrated the existence of contractual obligations.
it is helpful to consider this case within the larger context of the earlier winstar cases.in this court winstar en banc decision,this court concluded that the government formed contractual agreements regarding the treatment of supervisory goodwill with winstar and two other institutions,statesman savings holdings statesman and glendale federal bank glendale.winstar,at.analyzing not only the contemporaneous documents but also the circumstances surrounding the transactions,this court determined that the government was contractually obligated to recognize supervisory goodwill resulting from the transactions as a capital asset and to permit such goodwill to be amortized over an extended period of time.id.the supreme court considered the evidence and found no reason to question this court conclusion in that regard.winstar,at.the court also confirmed there were no constitutional or statutory obstacles to enforcing the agreements under ordinary contract principles.id.at.
in each of the three transactions in winstar,the relevant documents included either an assistance agreement or a supervisory action agreement,each containing an integration clause incorporating contemporaneous documents such as the bank board resolutions issued prior to each transaction.but such documents are not legal prerequisites to a contractual obligation.in california federal bank,fsb united states,this court determined that contractual obligations existed even though there was no single document incorporating all the contract terms.id.at.we noted that our winstar decision did not rely exclusively on the assistance agreements to find a contract.id.at.instead,we agreed with the court of federal claims that i f the factual records of individual cases show intent to contract with the government for specified treatment of goodwill,and documents such as correspondence,memoranda and fhlbb resolutions confirm that intent,the absence of an assistance agreement or supervisory action agreement should be irrelevant to the finding that a contract existed.id.at citation omitted alteration in original.
this court has determined government liability in other cases in which the government has contested the issue.in barron bancshares,united states,goodwill and capital credit provisions in the documents were virtually identical to those in the winstar transactions.id.at.nevertheless,the court of federal claims had determined those provisions were not contractual obligations because there was no evidence they were the subject of any negotiations between the parties,whereas other terms had been negotiated.id.at.we reversed,holding that the clear and unambiguous language of the integrated contract document was binding and precluded resort to parol evidence to alter its terms.id.at.
in lasalle talman bank,united states,we affirmed the trial court conclusion that agreements between talman and the government for specialized treatment of goodwill were contractual,although the terms were recorded in agency documents,such as bank board resolutions,rather than executed contracts.the bank board resolutions in that case indicated that talman could use the purchase method of accounting for goodwill so long as it submitted a stipulation that goodwill would be determined and amortized in accordance with bank board memorandum,which provided for amortization of supervisory goodwill over a period up to forty years id.at.
more recently,this court decided lavan united states.in that case,fhlbb approval of a amortization period was reflected in both a bank board resolution and an internal memorandum.id.at.we rejected the government argument that the fhlbb was merely performing a regulatory function when it approved the transaction and agreed with the trial court that the parties had contracted for special goodwill treatment.id.
these cases reflect the relationships formed between the fhlbb and the thrifts as the fhlbb sought help from these institutions to solve the national savings and loan crisis.the cases are not identical,yet all arose in the same regulatory and economic environment,a backdrop against which these cases can be viewed.despite different circumstances and variations in the documents containing the contract terms,in each of these cases we recognized there was a contractual agreement regarding the treatment of goodwill and its amortization period.
not surprisingly,considering the number of transactions nationally,there have been cases in which this court concluded based on the evidence presented that a contractual agreement with respect to goodwill did not exist.in d n bank united states,this court found that d n provided no evidence demonstrating that the parties intended to contract to permit special accounting treatment of goodwill.notably,none of the documents proffered by d n mentioned goodwill or the accounting treatment thereof.id.at.furthermore,the fhlbb supervisory agent testified in his deposition that he could not recall any discussions with d n about goodwill.id.at.the complete absence of evidence that the parties even contemplated an agreement regarding goodwill led us to find for the government on the issue of liability.
in another case,first commerce united states,the plaintiff institution began the process of acquiring a troubled thrift by submitting a bid letter to in which it requested permission to use the purchase method of accounting and amortize supervisory goodwill over a period.but in its formal merger application,first commerce requested conventional gaap treatment of goodwill rather than an extended amortization period.id.at.this evidence that first commerce intended to go forward with the transaction without any agreement as to goodwill treatment caused this court to look closely at the documents in search of mirror image terms.id.at.
the record showed that the fhlbb had approved the merger and issued a forbearance letter providing that first commerce could amortize goodwill over a period.we determined that this qualified as a counteroffer and remanded for the trial court to consider whether first commerce had accepted the counteroffer.id.at.on remand,the trial court readily found that first commerce later actual use of a amortization an unambiguous acceptance of the government counteroffer,and the court granted summary judgment of liability in favor of first commerce.first commerce united states,fed.cl.
anderson united states,is another case in which evidence that parties had not contracted for special goodwill treatment prompted us to examine carefully the specific documents involved in the transaction.westport,the acquiring institution,submitted an application in which it requested a amortization period for goodwill.id.at.in an internal fhlbb memorandum,the fhlbb staff recommended against granting the request for extended amortization of goodwill but recommended approval of other forbearance requests.id.according to the memorandum,westport ceo indicated that a goodwill forbearance was not necessary for completion of the transaction.id.consistent with the staff recommendation,the fhlbb issued a forbearance letter with no mention of goodwill amortization.id.at.the fhlbb also issued a resolution,which mentioned goodwill only in the standard clause requiring an accountant letter it made no reference to the use of the purchase method of accounting or to an extended period of amortization for goodwill.id.at.we found that the forbearance letter and the resolution confirmed what the internal memorandum indicated,that the fhlbb had not agreed to extended amortization of goodwill as part of the transaction.id.at.
although in any given case it would be improper to presume the existence or of a contract,or the terms of a contract,it is true that,viewing the cases as a whole,the pattern of arrangements between the fhlbb and the acquiring financial institutions often had contractual dimensions the supreme court and this court recognized that in the original winstar cases.the fhlbb was dealing with the worsening crisis in the savings and loan industry by seeking healthy institutions to merge with or acquire failing thrifts and by offering incentives such as the use of supervisory goodwill.the healthy thrifts sought permission from and agreement with the fhlbb in order to safely undertake the salvage efforts the government so eagerly desired.
since one of the main incentives offered by the fhlbb was the recognition of supervisory goodwill with an extended amortization thread that runs through many of these question becomes what to believe regarding the parties understanding of special treatment of goodwill as a term of the contract.as shown by the cases just discussed,this court has ultimately found the government liable for breach of contract in these cases when the evidence demonstrates that,in light of the discussions between the government and the acquiring thrift with regard to protections affecting capital requirements,including supervisory goodwill,the parties agreed that the acquiring thrift was to be given the favorable accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill and its amortization.
turning to the case before us,citizens completed four transactions over the course of four years.with respect to the initial transaction,the acquisition of the cardinal branches in,the record supports plaintiff contention that there was a contractual agreement between citizens and the fhlbb regarding special treatment of supervisory goodwill.according to testimony presented at trial,the parties negotiated the terms of the.kirby asked for cash assistance,and muldoon offered instead that citizens could book supervisory goodwill as an asset,which would count toward regulatory capital requirements,and citizens could amortize the goodwill over an extended period of time.the documents of merger application,the bank board resolution,and the conditional approval letter from to the this agreement.although the record is less than clear as to whether the parties agreed to a specific amortization period,it is clear enough that they agreed to an extended amortization period.the need to specify the exact length of the amortization period never became a relevant consideration it got resolved by default in the later paperwork.
using the cardinal transaction as a model,and at the suggestion of,citizens proceeded to complete three more transactions with failing thrifts.although the written documents are not as detailed as those in the cardinal transaction,it is evident from the pattern and circumstances of these transactions that the special treatment of supervisory goodwill was a central part of the agreements,just as it was for the cardinal transaction.trial testimony shows that before each transaction kirby requested cash assistance,as he had done during the cardinal negotiation,and muldoon instead offered the same goodwill treatment used in the cardinal of the purchase method of accounting to book supervisory goodwill as an asset that would count toward capital reserve requirements and an extended amortization for goodwill.both kirby and muldoon understood that the parties were agreeing to the same terms as those in the cardinal acquisition,and there is no evidence that they intended to alter the arrangement.
the clincher is the consequences,as the trial court explained,attendant on the execution of these transactions had supervisory goodwill not been a part at the time of the cardinal acquisition,the regulatory capital requirement was four percent.before the acquisition,citizens regulatory capital was at percent of its total capital reserve.after the transaction,with about million in goodwill counting toward citizens capital requirement,the ratio was percent.without the special goodwill treatment,however,citizens ratio would have been percent,well below the required minimum.
the other transactions were the same.before the gateway acquisition,citizens was at percent.after the acquisition the ratio was,still above the minimum three percent required at the time.without the supervisory goodwill adjustment,the ratio would have been percent.before the homestead transaction,citizens regulatory ratio was after it was,again above the minimum three percent required.without the additional million in supervisory goodwill on the books,however,the ratio would have been a negative percent,which would not only have rendered citizens out of capital compliance,but also insolvent.finally,with the supervisory goodwill allowance provided by the first federal transaction,citizens was left with a comfortable percent ratio without it,the ratio was another negative percent,out of compliance and insolvent.
kirby and muldoon testified that the transactions would have not occurred without an agreement for special treatment of goodwill because citizens would have fallen out of capital compliance immediately after each transaction.citizens would not have decided to complete transactions with such dire consequences would not have approved a transaction if the resulting thrift would not have been in capital compliance.as justice souter in winstar observed,i t would,indeed,have been madness for respondents to have engaged in these transactions with no more protection than the government reading would have given them,for the very existence of their institutions would then have been in jeopardy from the moment their agreements were signed.winstar,at.see also barron bancshares,at finding additional support for existence of a contract in evidence that recapitalized thrift would have been out of compliance from its inception without special goodwill treatment lasalle talman,at t here would be little reason for any thrift to assume added liabilities if that assumption would place it in immediate danger of receivership and dissolution.
based on trial testimony regarding the parties negotiations,contemporaneous documents,and the circumstances surrounding the transactions at issue,it is apparent that citizens and the government intended to enter into a binding agreement governing the transactions at issue.it is further apparent that the agreement was understood to include citizens use of the purchase method of accounting,amortizing of supervisory goodwill over an extended period of time,and counting of supervisory goodwill as an asset for purposes of meeting capital reserve requirements.those issues were clearly on the table and available as far as the fhlbb was concerned,and were clearly key considerations in the decisions of the citizens bank management.
the government asserts that fifth third allegation that it would have been irrational,even suicidal,for it to enter into these transactions without a contract is questionable in any event,economic irrationality can not create contracts.appellee br.at.the latter is of course true,but not the point.more to the point is the fact that there
