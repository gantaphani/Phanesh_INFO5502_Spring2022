these petitions ask us to decide whether two groups of defendants should be permitted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,to file an interlocutory appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge certifying a plaintiff class.one group of,its affiliate salomon smith barney ssb,and ssb research analyst jack grubman collectively,citigroup defendants argue that an interlocutory appeal should be permitted because the district court,for the first time in the class certification context,extended the doctrine of basic levinson,d,to opinions expressed by a research analyst.a second group of worldcom,worldcom bonds collectively,the underwriters argue that an interlocutory appeal should be permitted because,inter alia,the district court certified a class of stockholders and bondholders even though the only class representatives who have standing to bring an action on behalf of the bondholders have not been subjected to the lead plaintiff scrutiny of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.
on december,we entered an order granting the citigroup defendants petition and denying the underwriters petition.this opinion explains that ruling.
background 
the following basic facts are drawn principally from the district court opinion and order of october.see in re worldcom.sec,class opinion.further detail is provided in that opinion and in other opinions of the district court.
on june,worldcom issued the first of several announcements that its certified financial results had to be restated.by late july,worldcom had filed the largest bankruptcy in united states history.id.at.
on april,even before the restatement announcements,the first securities class action against worldcom and numerous other defendants had been filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.subsequent securities actions related to worldcom collapse were assigned to the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on litigation,and transferred to that district for proceedings by order dated august,the securities class actions in the southern district were consolidated under the caption in re worldcom.securities litigation securities litigation.see albert fadem trust worldcom,civ,wl,at aug.in the same order,the district court appointed the new york state common retirement fund nyscrf as lead plaintiff in the securities litigation.id.at.nyscrf had purchased worldcom stock,worldcom mci tracking stock,and worldcom debt securities,and lost over million from those investments.
on october,nyscrf filed a consolidated amended complaint the complaint.the complaint added hgk asset management,hgk,the county of fresno,california fresno,and the fresno county employees retirement association fcera as named plaintiffs in the putative class action.each of these additional named plaintiffs,unlike nyscrf,purchased bonds in massive worldcom bond offerings on may,and may,the and offerings.
in the complaint,the plaintiffs asserted claims under sections,a and of the securities act of act,et,on behalf of purchasers of worldcom bonds who relied on registration statements for the and offerings.the plaintiffs also asserted claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of act,et,on behalf of purchasers of publicly traded securities of worldcom from april,to june,the class period.the complaint named numerous defendants,including former worldcom executive officers,worldcom former directors,the underwriters,worldcom former accountants,and the citigroup defendants.
the complaint alleges that the underwriters failed to conduct proper due diligence in connection with the and offerings.the complaint alleges further that the citigroup defendants had a close and relationship with worldcom and its executives from which both sides derived substantial benefit.specifically,plaintiffs allege that worldcom benefitted from jack grubman relentlessly positive,but materially false,research reports about the company while ssb and grubman were well remunerated for their support of worldcom with investment banking business.by opinion and order dated may,the defendants motions to dismiss the claims in the complaint were largely denied.see in re worldcom.sec,d.
on june,nyscrf and the three additional named plaintiffs moved for certification of a plaintiff class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded debt or equity securities of worldcom during the class period and who were injured thereby.on october,the district court granted the class motion,and certified nyscrf,hgk,fresno,and fcera as class representatives.
on november,the citigroup defendants and the underwriters petitioned this court for permission to appeal the district court order granting class certification.the citigroup defendants argued that the district court erred in applying the doctrine of basic levinson,d,under which the element of reliance on alleged misrepresentations is presumed,to expressions of opinion by a research analyst.according to the citigroup defendants,because reliance must be proved individually if the doctrine is not applied,class issues do not predominate,and a class may not be certified under federal rule of civil procedure b 
the underwriters offered three separate arguments in support of their petition first,they contended that the district court erred when it certified a class that includes bondholders even though nyscrf,the sole lead plaintiff under the pslra,did not purchase any bonds in the or offerings.second,they asserted that the three additional named plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives because their fee arrangements with counsel do not require them to pay their pro rata share of the total litigation costs.third,they argued that because some of the bondholders asserting claims against the underwriters with respect to the offering purchased their securities more than one year after that offering,these bondholders will bear the burden of proving reliance on the registration statement that accompanied the offering and class issues do not predominate.
on december,we entered the following order granting the citigroup defendants petition and denying the underwriters petition 
the petition of citigroup,citgroup global markets.salomon smith barney,and jack grubman for permission to appeal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f is hereby granted.the petition of the defendants for permission to appeal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f is hereby denied.an opinion explaining this court ruling will follow.the clerk is directed to schedule this appeal on an expedited basis and assign it to a merits panel in the normal course.
this is the opinion to follow.
discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure f provides that 
a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.an appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.
f.in applying rule f,courts of appeals enjoy unfettered discretion to grant or deny permission to appeal based on any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.f,advisory committee notes.
in in re sumitomo copper litigation,cir,we articulated the following standard for determining when leave to appeal under rule f should be granted 
p etitioners seeking leave to appeal pursuant to rule f must demonstrate either that the certification order will effectively terminate the litigation and there has been a substantial showing that the district court decision is questionable,or that the certification order implicates a legal question about which there is a compelling need for immediate resolution 
id.at emphases added.
sumitomo involved a class action alleging that various defendants conspired to manipulate the prices of copper futures contracts in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,the commodity exchange act cea,a,and new york law.id.at.en route to certifying a class consisting of copper futures contract traders injured by the defendants alleged conspiracy,the district court concluded that the doctrine could be used to satisfy the reliance requirement of a fraud claim under new york law.id.at.we denied the defendants petition to appeal that ruling under rule f.we determined first that,for reasons not relevant here,the petitioners had not made a substantial showing that the district court decision to grant certification is questionable.id.at.we then determined that the petitioners had not raised a significant legal question that required immediate resolution.id.at.although we recognized that the uncertainty of the issue tips in favor of a grant of interlocutory review,id.at,we nevertheless denied the petition on the grounds that the defendants had not shown that the district court ruling could not be fully reviewed after final judgment,id.at,and the issue was insufficiently connected to the district court certification order,id.at.the connection between the issue and the certification order was lacking because e ven if the defendants were to prevail on the issue,it would not alter the district court grant of certification with respect to the plaintiffs rico and cea claims,and arguably would not even alter the district court grant of certification with respect to the fraud claim.id.emphasis added and citation omitted.
there are just two published decisions of this court applying the standard set forth in sumitomo,see in re visa antitrust,cir nat.asbestos workers med.fund phillip morris,cir,and no decisions that have applied the standard in anything other than summary fashion.accordingly,we take this opportunity to explain why,under the framework laid out in sumitomo,we have exercised our broad discretion to grant the citigroup defendants rule f petition and to deny the underwriters petition.
b.the citigroup petition 
in our view,the citigroup defendants petition falls within the second category of appealable decisions identified in sumitomo,because the certification order implicates a legal question about which there is a compelling need for immediate resolution.sumitomo,at.that question is whether a district court may certify a class in a suit against a research analyst and his employer,based on the doctrine,without a finding that the analyst opinions affected the market prices of the relevant securities.the doctrine,as described by the supreme court in basic levinson,creates a rebuttable presumption that misrepresentations by an issuer affect the price of securities traded in the open market,and investors rely on the market price of securities as an accurate measure of their intrinsic value.see basic,at.accord,in re ames dep t stores.stock,cir.this presumption,if unrebutted,thus allows plaintiffs to satisfy the element of reliance in securities fraud claims under the act.as the district court explained,the doctrine arose as a practical response to the difficulties of proving direct reliance in the context of modern securities markets,where impersonal trading rather than a transaction is the norm.class opinion,at.although the doctrine clearly applies to statements made by issuers,as in basic,we have never addressed whether it also applies to reports by analysts.
a novel legal question will not compel immediate review unless it is of fundamental importance to the development of the law of class actions and it is likely to escape effective review after entry of final judgment.sumitomo,at.although we did not grant the defendants rule f petition in sumitomo,we suggested in that decision that a district court extension of the doctrine should,in some circumstances,be reviewed on an interlocutory basis.see id.at noting that the uncertainty surrounding whether the doctrine could be applied to fraud claims tips in favor of a grant of interlocutory review.similarly,in west prudential securities,cir,the seventh circuit concluded that a district court application of the doctrine to a stockbroker statements to his customers present ed a novel and potentially important question of law.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir granting rule f petition where certification decision raised fundamental questions about what type of private securities claims merit class certification.
the application of the doctrine in a novel context can have a significant effect on the law of class actions because the presumption of reliance created by the doctrine is often essential to class certification in securities suits.reliance is an element of securities fraud claims under the act.see,harsco segui,cir.to the extent that members of a plaintiff class of securities purchasers can invoke the basic presumption by alleging fraud on the market,they need not prove individual reliance on alleged misrepresentations by an issuer.by contrast,if plaintiffs are not entitled to the basic presumption because they can not plead fraud on the market,reliance must be proved separately as to each class member,and common issues may not predominate over individual issues.see basic,at.requiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would have prevented respondents from proceeding with a class action under.b,since individual issues then would have overwhelmed the common ones.
based on the close connection between the basic presumption and the requirement that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b,the seventh circuit in west reversed a district court order certifying a class consisting of all purchasers of jefferson savings bancorp stock during the period when a stockbroker was falsely telling his clients that jefferson would be acquired.west,at.the court determined first that the basic presumption could not be applied to a stockbroker statements to his customers because t he district court did not identify any causal link between information and securities prices,let alone show that the link is as strong as the one deemed sufficient by a bare majority in basic id.at.having determined that the basic presumption could not be applied in the absence of such a causal link,the court then concluded that common issues did not predominate and the certification decision could not stand.see id.explaining that a district judge may not duck hard questions at the certification stage by observing that each side has some support.
here,in certifying a class over the citigroup defendants objections,judge cote applied the doctrine to an analyst expression of opinion as opposed to an issuer statement of fact.in so doing,judge cote declined to wade into th e battle of the experts as to the existence of a causal link between grubman analyst reports and movements in the price of worldcom securities instead,judge cote credited the plaintiffs allegation that grubman statements of opinion changed the prices of worldcom securities during the class period class opinion,at.thus,like the district court in west,the district court in the instant case has applied the doctrine in a novel context without identifying a causal link between the statements at issue and the price of securities.
the citigroup defendants contend that the basic presumption may not be extended to analyst research reports without a specific finding by the district court that the analysts misrepresentations actually affected the price of securities traded in the open market.in support of this contention,the citigroup defendants point out that federal rules of civil procedure b requires findings by the district court.see.b allowing an action to be maintained as a class action only if the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members emphasis added.they argue that by extending the basic presumption to opinions expressed by an analyst without any finding that the analyst statements affected market prices,the district court ignored a crucial distinction between,on the one hand,the uniquely authoritative statements of issuers and,on the other hand,expressions of opinion by analysts.according to the citigroup defendants,in light of the direct connection between the basic presumption and the certification criteria in rule b,the mere allegation that an analyst statement affected the price of securities traded in the market must be thoroughly tested at the certification stage.
we need not decide what evidentiary showing,if any,the plaintiffs must make at the class certification stage in order to benefit from the basic presumption in an action against research analysts and their employers.for the purposes of this petition,we simply observe that the citigroup defendants have offered a substantial legal argument in support of their position we also note that,like in west but unlike in sumitomo,the district court extension of the doctrine in the instant case is closely connected to its certification decision,because,in order to recover from the citigroup defendants,each class member will have to prove reliance on one or more of grubman statements of individually or with the benefit of the basic presumption finally,it is our view that the issue presented in this case is not only novel but also significant,because the application of the doctrine to opinions expressed by research analysts would extend the potentially coercive effect of securities class actions to a new group of corporate and individual,to research analysts and their employers based on these considerations,we conclude that the citigroup defendants have presented an issue that is of fundamental importance to the development of the law of class actions,sumitomo,at.
we also conclude that,in the circumstances presented,the district court decision to apply the basic presumption at the certification stage is likely to escape effective review after entry of final judgment.id.as the seventh circuit noted in west,very few securities class actions are litigated to conclusion,so review of a novel and important legal issue concerning the scope of the basic presumption may be possible only through the rule f device.west,at.moreover,numerous courts and scholars have warned that settlements in large class actions can be divorced from the parties underlying legal positions.see id.the effect of a class certification in inducing settlement to curtail the risk of large awards provides a powerful reason to take an interlocutory appeal.in re visa antitrust,cir jacobs,dissenting one sound basis for granting jurisdiction under rule f is the circumstance that the class certification places inordinate or hydraulic pressure on defendants to settle,avoiding the risk,however small,of potentially ruinous liability.quoting newton merrill lynch,cir see also janet cooper alexander,do the merits matter a study of settlements in securities class actions,stan.
these concerns about the effect of class certification weigh heavily in the instant case,which arises from the largest corporate fraud and accounting scandal in united states history.compl.this is not the class action,or even the securities class action.as the district court noted,worldcom issued billions of shares and billions of dollars of debt securities during the class period,and it is uncontested that tens of thousands of investors are putative class members.class opinion,at.reflecting on the large number of parties to this litigation,as well as the staggering amount of money to which the class members could be entitled after final judgment,the district court observed that however deep the pockets of the defendants,the losses suffered through the worldcom debacle are greater.id.at.based on this extraordinary observation,coming from a seasoned district judge who is intimately familiar with the pleadings and the record,it is hard to conceive of many cases that are less likely than the instant case to yield an appealable final judgment.with that in mind,we conclude that the novel question presented in this case is not only legally significant but also likely to escape effective review after entry of final judgment.sumitomo,at.
c.the underwriters petition 
in contrast to the citigroup defendants petition,the underwriters petition does not present legal questions that meet the criteria for interlocutory review laid out in sumitomo.accordingly,the underwriters will have to wait until there is an appealable final judgment before they can challenge the certification order.
the underwriters first argument is that the class can not be certified because the additional named plaintiffs have not been subjected to lead plaintiff scrutiny under the pslra.that statute requires a district court to appoint a person or persons to serve as lead plaintiff before proceeding with the adjudication of a private suit under the federal securities laws.two objective factors inform the district court appointment decision the plaintiffs respective financial stakes in the relief sought by the class,and their ability to satisfy the requirements of rule.see a b iii i according to the underwriters,nyscrf does not meet the typicality requirement of rule a because it did not purchase bonds in either the or the offering and therefore lacks standing to sue the petitioners under sections and of the act on behalf of worldcom bondholders.moreover,in the underwriters view,nyscrf deficiencies as a lead plaintiff can not be cured through the appointment of three named plaintiffs who have not satisfied the rigors of the pslra lead plaintiff scrutiny.
in rejecting these arguments,the district court determined that the participation of fcera,fresno,and hgk as named plaintiffs and proposed class representatives ensures that the litigation will continue to focus on the claims raised by bondholders,and that there are representatives of the class with claims typical of purchasers of both types of securities,and that nyscrf is a suitable lead plaintiff because its claims are based on misrepresentations in the registration statements and on the same core course of conduct at issue in the sections and claims.class opinion,at.these determinations,which are part and parcel of the district court management of the consolidated class action,are not proper subjects for rule f review.f,advisory committee notes explaining that p ermission to appeal under rule f is most likely to be granted when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law emphasis added.
in an attempt to fit their arguments into one of the categories identified in sumitomo,the underwriters propose that we adopt a per se rule that a class may not be certified where a lead plaintiff does not have standing to bring every available claim and none of the named plaintiffs who have standing to bring the additional claims has been vetted under the pslra.this per se rule has little to recommend it.nothing in the pslra indicates that district courts must choose a lead plaintiff with standing to sue on every available cause of action.rather,because the pslra mandates that courts must choose a party who has,among other things,the largest financial stake in the outcome of the case,it is inevitable that,in some cases,the lead plaintiff will not have standing to sue on every claim.see in re initial pub.offering sec,t he fact that the lead plaintiff is to be selected in accordance with objective criteria that have nothing to do with the nature of the claims strongly suggests the need for named plaintiffs in addition to any lead plaintiff.in those cases,just as a class representative can establish the requisite typicality under rule if the defendants committed the same wrongful acts in the same manner against all members of the class,in re prudential sec,internal quotation marks omitted,so too can lead plaintiffs.
moreover,the pslra does not in any way prohibit the addition of named plaintiffs to aid the lead plaintiff in representing a class.see class opinion,at although the lead plaintiff must otherwise satisfy the requirements of rule,nothing in the text of the pslra indicates that every named plaintiff who satisfies the requirements of rule must also satisfy the criteria established under the pslra for appointment as lead plaintiff and actually be appointed as a lead plaintiff
