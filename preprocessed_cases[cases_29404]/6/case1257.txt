introduction 
this case presents a single issue whether the investment offered by fidelity insured deposits,fidelity,constitutes a security under california law,subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the california department of corporations doc.we conclude the investment was not a security and affirm.
fidelity offered prospective investors yields on certificates of deposit cd greater than was available at any bank.prospective customers were required to make an appointment and personally meet with a fidelity sales agent.the sales agent would inform the prospective customer the higher yield was available only on the first invested if the customer wished to invest more,the sales agent would offer a fixed annuity as an alternative to a cd.if the customer wanted the cd,the sales agent would provide the customer a list of banking institutions offering the highest rates on federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured cd.upon proof the customer opened a cd from an institution on the list,fidelity would cut and send the customer a bonus check equal to the difference between the yield paid by the banking institution and the yield advertised by fidelity.the check would be issued within seven days of the date on which the customer submitted proof to fidelity of opening the cd.
the superior court concluded the investment offered by fidelity was not a security and issued a writ of administrative mandamus ordering the california corporations commissioner the commissioner to set aside a desist and refrain order against fidelity and the other respondents 
we agree with the superior court and hold the package offered by fidelity is not a security within the meaning of the california securities laws.in so holding,we are not addressing the propriety of fidelity promotional scheme.it appears to us fidelity possibly engaged in a classic bait and switch,using cd as bait to lure customers in to hear a sales pitch for annuities,which are subject to regulation by the california department of insurance.however,the only issue before us is whether the investment offered by fidelity is a security and,hence,subject to the doc regulatory powers.
the facts are substantially undisputed.they are taken from the administrative law judge proposed decision,which was adopted by the commissioner.
ronald edward reiswig is the owner and chief executive officer of fep,fep,which is licensed by the department of insurance and operates under the name family estate insurance services.fep only business is selling annuities,a form of insurance.fep only source of income is commissions earned from the sale of those annuities.
janet sue reiswig is the owner and president of fidelity and is ronald reiswig wife.fidelity sole purpose is to generate business for fep.fidelity is not licensed by the department of insurance,or any other regulatory body,and is not fdic insured.fidelity has no income but does incur advertising and payroll expenses.
rick andrew leon and donald anthony fracchia each were licensed by the department of insurance as life agents and were authorized to transact insurance business on fep behalf in fidelity offices.
to attract prospective customers,fidelity advertised the availability of cd with a higher yield than was available at any bank.a person responding to the advertisement was required to make an appointment and meet in person with a fidelity sales agent.the sales agent would inform the prospective customer the advertised cd yield was limited to a investment.if the prospective customer had more than to invest which was usually the case,then the fidelity agent would ask if the customer were interested in realizing greater rates of return than offered by the cd.if the prospective customer answered yes,then the fidelity agent would give a rehearsed sales presentation promoting annuities offered by fep.
if the prospective customer decided to buy the cd,the sales agent would provide the customer a list of banking institutions offering the highest rates on cd.janet reiswig prepared this list daily after conducting internet research to determine the banks paying the highest cd rates.the customer applied for the cd directly to the institution,sometimes with the fidelity sales agent help.the sales agent calculated the difference between the yield on the cd offered by the institution,and the yield based on the rate advertised by fidelity.for example,if the fidelity advertisement offered a percent return on a cd,and the banking institution paid percent return,the difference would be percent,or.fidelity paid the customer that amount in a bonus check within seven days of the customer returning proof to fidelity that the cd had been opened.fep provided the funds for those bonus checks.
the fidelity sales agents earned a commission equal to percent of the commission received by fep for the sale of the annuity.they earned nothing from selling a cd.
during the period between february and august,fep sold nearly million in annuities,on which it received commissions of between percent and percent.during the same period,fidelity received over telephone inquiries in response to its advertisements.those inquiries produced about personal appointments.as a result of the appointments,fidelity arranged for the sale of cd and completed the sale of annuities.about per month in bonus checks were paid on those cd.
procedural history 
the doc undertook an investigation in response to complaints by elderly investors that they had been misled by fidelity advertising.as a result of the investigation,the commissioner issued a desist and refrain order against fidelity.the commissioner found that the advertised investments were securities and that fidelity had violated corporations code sections,and.
an administrative law judge too found the investment offered by fidelity to be a security and upheld the desist and refrain order.the commissioner adopted the administrative law judge proposed decision with only minor changes.
fidelity petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.the superior court described fidelity program as deserv ing the epithet bait and switch but identified the issue presented as whether fidelity was selling a security.the court stated,i f the entire plan is outrageously fraudulent,but does not involve the sale of a security,this petition must be granted.the court concluded the investment offered by fidelity was not a security,granted the petition,and issued a peremptory writ of administrative mandamus ordering the commissioner to set aside his decision.
the doc filed a return to the peremptory writ and filed a notice of appeal from it on the same date.
standard of review 
because the relevant facts are undisputed,we independently review the superior court decision to grant an administrative writ of mandamus.evans unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.
discussion 
california securities laws and definition of a security 
the offer or sale of securities in california must be qualified with the commissioner or otherwise be exempt or not subject to qualification.persons who offer to sell or purchase securities in california must obtain a certificate as a from the commissioner unless they are otherwise exempt,subd.a.it is unlawful to offer or sell a security in california by means of any written or oral communication that includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.the doc lacks jurisdiction to act with respect to a transaction or instrument that is not a security.see brooks state personnel bd.d.
corporations code section defines security by listing transactions and instruments deemed to be securities.the list is expansive,but is not applied literally.people figueroa cal d.rather,the california supreme court has stated the critical question in resolving whether a transaction comes within the statutory definition of security is whether the transaction falls within the regulatory purpose of the law regardless of whether it involves an instrument which comes within the literal language of the definition.id.at.the purpose of the securities laws is to protect the public against the imposition of unsubstantial,unlawful and fraudulent stock and investment schemes and the securities based thereon.id.at.
ii.whether the package is an investment contract 
the parties here agree if the package is a security,then it is a security in the form of an investment contract,security includes investment contract.in determining whether a transaction is an investment contract,california courts have applied,either separately or together,two distinct tests the risk capital test described in silver hills country club sobieski cal d,and the federal test described in sec howey.howey.people ex rel.bender wind river mining project d.moreland department of corporations d.moreland.a transaction is a security if it satisfies either test.moreland,supra,d at,fn.
a.the risk capital test 
the package is not a security under the risk capital test the risk capital test requires a consideration of the following factors whether funds are being raised for a business venture or enterprise whether the transaction is offered indiscriminately to the public at large whether the investors are substantially powerless to effect the success of the enterprise and whether the investors money is substantially at risk because it is inadequately secured.moreland,supra,d at.
fidelity did not promote the package to raise funds for a business venture or enterprise.all of the investors funds were used to purchase cd from institutions unrelated to fidelity or fep.the investors funds were not substantially at risk because the cd were fdic investors return was virtually guaranteed.
b.the federal test 
elements of the federal test 
under the federal test,an investment contract consists of an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others.howey,supra.see sec edwards,d.this test is a flexible rather than a static principle,one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.howey,supra,at.
the touchstone of the federal test is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.united housing foundation,forman,d forman.by profits,the court has meant either capital appreciation resulting from the development of the initial investment,or a participation in earnings resulting from the use of investors funds.ibid.
the constituent parts of the transaction must be considered as a whole in deciding whether it is an investment contract.hocking dubois cir,fn.en banc.f orm should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.tcherepnin knight,d.
an investment scheme offering a fixed rate of return can be an investment contract subject to federal securities regulation.sec edwards,supra,d.our analysis therefore gives no weight to the fact fidelity package paid a fixed rate of return.
whether the cd offered by fidelity is an investment contract 
the federal test requires that the investor commit his assets to the enterprise in such a manner as to subject himself to financial loss.sec rubera cir.a cd insured by the fdic is not a security under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws because the investor is not subject to such financial loss.marine bank weaver,d marine bank.in marine bank,the supreme court distinguished an cd from a debt in that the purchaser of a certificate of deposit is virtually guaranteed payment in full.id.at.subjecting issuers of bank cd to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws was unnecessary to protect investors because cd holders are abundantly protected under the federal banking laws.id.at.
fidelity advertising offered cd paying a higher rate of interest than that offered by banks.an investor purchased a cd from a bank that was unrelated to fidelity since the cd was fdic insured,the investor did not risk losing the money invested.fidelity paid the difference between the advertised interest rate and the rate of return paid by the bank with a bonus check earned upon presentation of proof the investor had opened a cd.neither fidelity nor fep used the investors funds generated from purchasing the cd.interest on the cd was paid by the banking institutions issuing them.the bonus checks were not paid from earnings resulting from the use of the investors funds because those who invested in the package paid no money to fidelity or fep.
whether fidelity package,considered as a single transaction,is an investment contract 
in resolving whether the investment package here was an investment contract,we must consider the cd and the bonus as constituent parts of the same transaction rather than consider each separately.hocking dubois,supra,at,fn.en banc.what did fidelity do that would transform an cd into an investment contract two things,the doc argues.first,fidelity paid each investor a bonus,and t he ability of fidelity to pay the bonuses is entirely dependent upon the continued success of fep in selling annuities.thus,the doc argues,the offers of the cd s plus bonuses by fidelity and the sale of annuities by fep are completely intertwined and there is a common enterprise.second,the doc argues,fidelity engaged in significant prepurchase entrepreneurial and managerial activities,such as selecting fidelity advertised cd rate and identifying banking institutions offering the highest rates on cd.
was payment of the bonus dependent on the success of enterprise 
as to its first point,the doc urges us to follow safeway portland employees federal credit union wagner,cir safeway,in which the ninth circuit court of appeals concluded an investment package consisting of a cd plus bonus constituted an investment contract under the federal securities laws.as we shall explain,the investment package examined in safeway was in fact substantially different from fidelity package.
in safeway,a securities engaged in brokerage of cd in concert with one of its subsidiaries.safeway,supra,at.the subsidiary,through independent money brokers,obtained borrowers willing to pay a premium to induce third parties to purchase cd issued by specified banks.ibid.the borrowers then would seek loans from those banks issuing the cd.ibid.the securities broker located investors to purchase the cd by offering a bonus in the form of an additional rate of interest,to be paid from the premiums paid by the borrower.ibid.the broker sold about million in cd,bearing interest at the rate of percent,issued by a texas bank insured by the fdic.ibid.a credit union purchased two cd totaling.ibid.the broker paid additional interest of percent payable when the cd matured safeway at.
examining the cd and bonus interest as a whole,the ninth circuit held the package was an investment of money in a common enterprise,even assuming the cd itself was not a security.safeway,supra.two characteristics of the package were significant to the court holding.first,the cd were brokered.thus,safeway was led to expect profit as the result of the broker efforts in obtaining the issuance of the cd s and in completing the transaction whereby safeway would receive the bonus.ibid.second,the court observed,the future payment of the bonus was dependent on the continued success and solvency of the broker.ibid.
the safeway court also noted the package was not issued or guaranteed by a bank.safeway,supra,at.based on the amount the credit union invested,the cd it purchased would not have been fdic insured.thus,the soundness of the investment was related to the broker efforts in locating banks willing to issue and able to repay the cd.the banks ability to repay the cd in turn depended on the ability of the obtained by the repay the loans made possible by the issuance of the cd.
judge sneed,in a concurring opinion,identified the reason why investments arising from such brokered funds should be regulated the primary abuse that flows from brokered funds is the encouragement it provides to banks to make unsa
