in this interlocutory appeal,appellant deutsche bank national trust deutsche bank challenges the district court dismissal of its claims against the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.
the dispositive issue is whether deutsche bank claims are general unsecured claims under d and thereby prudentially moot because of the lack of sufficient funds in the estate to pay unsecured claims.deutsche bank maintains that it possesses superpriority claims and that d is inapplicable because the fdic exceeded its statutory authority by splitting the agreements and transferring the servicing rights without deutsche bank consent.assuming that the fdic breached the agreements,we nevertheless affirm the district court dismissal of deutsche bank claims because the purported breach did not transform deutsche bank general unsecured claims into superpriority claims.
background 
deutsche bank lawsuit against the fdic 
according to its complaint,deutsche bank served in the capacity as trustee for more than mortgage securitization trusts created by indymac.prior to its failure in july,indymac functioned as a mortgage securitizer,acquiring mortgage loans that it sold to the trusts.according to deutsche bank,the trusts subsequently sold residential securities supported by the cash flows on the underlying mortgage loans.
indymac success in attracting investors to purchase the securities sold by indymac depended on indymac representations and promises that a single entity indymac would perform the interrelated services necessary to protect,preserve and service the trust assets.the securities transactions were governed by agreements that established and regulated the trusts and the related relationships among the parties with interests in the trusts.among the governing agreements were pooling and servicing agreements psas,sale and servicing agreements,indentures,and trust agreements.pursuant to the governing agreements,indymac was required,inter alia,to enforce the loan obligations collect payments from the borrowers administer the documents related to the mortgage loans provide notification concerning missing or defective loan documentation provide notification of mortgages that did not comply with indymac representations cure breaches of representations or warranties adversely affecting the trust beneficiaries and modify seriously delinquent loans.in return,indymac received the loans purchase prices and monthly fees and income from the trusts based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans in each trust 
on july,the office of thrift supervision otc closed indymac and appointed the fdic as its receiver fdic r.the otc created a new savings bank,indymac federal,and appointed the fdic as conservator fdic c.another federal savings bank,onewest bank,was formed as a thrift holding company to purchase indymac federal assets and liabilities.as receiver and conservator,the fdic succeeded to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of indymac federal,including those arising under the governing agreements or otherwise related to the trusts.as indymac federal conservator,the fdic administered the trusts and serviced the mortgages based on servicing rights established by the governing agreements.in that capacity,the fdic sold certain assets and rights of indymac federal to onewest for approximately billion.
deutsche bank alleged that 
t he sale to onewest included many valuable rights that indymac held under the governing agreements or that were otherwise related to the trusts,but improperly excluded certain of indymac obligations to the trusts and the trustee under those same governing agreements without making alternate arrangements to assure the performance of those excluded obligations.specifically,the sale to onewest included what the fdi characterized as the servicing rights under the governing agreements,including indymac right to service the mortgage loans in the trusts and the corresponding right to receive the servicing fees and income provided in the governing agreements.the sale,however,excluded certain obligations imposed on indymac under the same governing agreements,including any repurchase obligations for breaches of loan level representations,any indemnities relating to origination activities or securities laws or any seller indemnity.
according to deutsche bank,the fdic exceeded its statutory authority i n attempting to sell,and thereby reap the benefits of,the governing agreements without assuming and assigning or otherwise performing the related obligations deutsche bank averred that i n the sale to onewest,the fdic purported to split unitary contracts and divide rights and obligations that were not severable.
deutsche bank also alleged that the fdic,as receiver,breached several representations and warranties and failed to comply with the governing agreements,particularly in servicing the mortgage loans.deutsche bank averred that the fdic conduct resulted in approximately billion to billion in damages to the trusts and trustee.
deutsche bank asserted causes of action against the fdic for breach of contract as indymac federal receiver and conservator,count one breach of contract as conservator,count two breach of contract for sale to onewest as conservator,receiver,and in its corporate capacity,count three repudiation of certain trusts as receiver,count four breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing as receiver and conservator,count five breach of fiduciary duty as receiver and conservator,count six unconstitutional taking via the sale to onewest and the splitting of obligations,count seven unconstitutional taking of right to appoint a successor servicer,count eight due process violations premised on the sale to onewest,the splitting of obligations and the right to appoint a successor servicer,counts nine and ten and constructive trust count eleven.
legal and statutory framework 
because deutsche bank claims depend on whether it is a general unsecured creditor under the distribution priorities set forth in d,discussion of the applicable statutory framework,as interpreted in our precedent,sets the stage for our resolution of this case 
congress passed firrea in in response to the crisis in the nation banking and savings and loan industries.the statute allows the fdic to act as receiver or conservator of a failed institution for the protection of depositors and creditors.sharpe fdic,cir citation omitted.congress granted the fdic broad powers in conserving and disposing of the assets of the failed institution.to enable the fdic to move quickly and without undue interruption to preserve and consolidate the assets of the failed institution,congress enacted a broad limit on the power of courts to interfere with the fdic efforts id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
pursuant to d h,t he fdic,as conservator or receiver,shall pay all valid obligations of the insured depository institution in accordance with the prescriptions and limitations of this chapter.the fdic has the additional task under d e of maximiz ing the net present value return from the sale or disposition of such assets and minimiz ing the amount of any loss realized in the resolution of cases.however,under e,the fdic also has the authority to repudiate any contract or lease the performance of which the conservator or receiver,in the conservator or receiver discretion,determines to be burdensome e b.if the fdic decides to repudiate a contract under this provision,the liability of the conservator or receiver for the disaffirmance or repudiation shall be i limited to actual direct compensatory damages id.e a i.
as a corollary to firrea,in congress adopted the national depositor preference amendment to the federal deposit insurance act.this legislation provided that in the distribution of the assets of a failed institution depositors be paid before general creditors could collect on their claims.mbia ins.fdic,footnote reference omitted.this preference amendment establishing the distribution priority framework for failed institutions was codified in d.see id.the codified distribution priority framework sets forth the following hierarchy of claims 
subject to section e c of this title,amounts realized from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver appointed for such institution shall be distributed to pay claims other than secured claims to the extent of any such security in the following order of priority 
i administrative expenses of the receiver.
ii any deposit liability of the institution.
iii any other general or senior liability of the institution which is not a liability described in clause iv or v.
iv any obligation subordinated to depositors or general creditors which is not an obligation described in clause v.
v any obligation to shareholders or members arising as a result of their status as shareholders or members including any depository institution holding company or any shareholder or creditor of such company.
the dispositive issue in this appeal is whether deutsche bank claims constitute general liabilitities under d a iii rather than a claim payable outside the strictures of d.deutsche bank maintains that because the fdic exceeded its statutory authority and breached the agreements without properly repudiating them,the distribution scheme delineated in d does not apply,and thus its claims are payable without regard to these provisions.deutsche bank argument is primarily premised on its interpretation of three cases sharpe battista fdic,cir and mccarthy fdic,cir.
sharpe fdic 
in sharpe,whitney and mona sharpe entered into a settlement agreement with pioneer bank to resolve a real estate foreclosure action.see sharpe,at.the sharpes and pioneer agreed that pioneer would remit by wire transfer to the sharpes when the sharpes provided the requisite note,deed of trust,and reconveyance documents.see id.at.in direct contravention of the settlement agreement wire transfer requirement,pioneer sent the sharpes two cashier checks.see id.at.before the sharpes could deposit the checks,state regulators seized pioneer,and the fdic was appointed as pioneer receiver.see id.as receiver,the fdic step ped into the shoes of pioneer.id.at.the fdic took possession of the reconveyance documents provided by the sharpes and recorded them,but informed the sharpes that it would not honor the cashier checks.see id.at.
the sharpes sued the fdic for enforcement of the settlement agreement.see id.however,the district court held that firrea precluded judicial review of the sharpes claims because they were effectively depositors,and therefore creditors of pioneer subject to firrea exhaustion requirements.id.on appeal,the sharpes asserted that the district court failed to accept the breach of contract nature of their cause of action and improperly applied firrea requirements as if the sharpes were creditors of pioneer id.at.the fdic maintained that dismissal was warranted on jurisdictional grounds because the sharpes were creditors as holders of pioneer cashier checks and that j deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the sharpes claims for equitable relief.see id 
in analyzing whether the sharpes claims were covered by firrea administrative claims process,we opined that the settlement agreement governed the sharpes relationship with pioneer,and that the sharpes were neither creditors nor depositors under the agreement.id.at.instead,t hey were parties to a contract they fully performed.id.at.applying basic contract interpretation principles,we determined that t he fdic failed to perform its obligations under the contract,and that this failure to perform the express terms of the settlement agreement was a breach id.citations omitted.because pioneer issued a cashier check in lieu of the contractually agreed upon wire transfer,it breached the settlement agreement.see id.t he bank tender by cashier check and the fdic subsequent refusal to honor the checks constitute d material breaches of the settlement agreement.id.had the fdic honored the cashier checks,the sharpes would have suffered no damages as a result of the breach the failure to honor the checks gives rise to a cause of action for breach of contract with a remedy.id.
we held that the fdic did not act within its statutorily granted powers in breaching the sharpes settlement agreement because recording of the reconveyance of the debtor deed of trust for which it did not pay full consideration can not be considered a statutorily authorized function of the fdic.id.at.therefore,the sharpes claims for rescission and declaratory relief were not barred by j.see id.
we also rejected the fdic argument that the sharpes cause of action constitute d an administrative claim subject to the exhaustion requirement id.we observed that section d sets forth an administrative claims process,which requires that creditors submit claims to the fdic for administrative resolution.if the sharpes were considered creditors,they would be subject to that claims process.id.at footnote reference and internal quotation marks omitted.however,we concluded that the sharpes were not required to submit to the fdic administrative process because they did not become creditors of the fdic by accepting the cashier check.see id.we reasoned that b ut for the fdic breach,the full cash amount specified in the settlement agreement would have been wired to the sharpes.it is only as a consequence of the fdic breach that the fdic can construe the sharpes as creditors of the fdic id.
notably,we observed that b ecause the fdic did not repudiate the agreement pursuant to e,we need not decide here whether claims against the fdic regarding contract repudiation under e are subject to the exhaustion requirement.id.at citations omitted.
the sharpes were a party to a contract breached by the fdic,and they retain ed the rights accompanying that contract notwithstanding the appointment of the fdic as receiver.the sharpes can not be considered creditors of the fdic,and we hold that their claim is not a claim for the purposes of the firrea exhaustion requirement.
battista fdic 
in battista,former employees of an insolvent bank sued the fdic based on the fdic repudiation of their employment contracts.see battista,at.in the context of resolving the case,we considered whether claims for damages based on repudiated contracts under e were subject to the payment priorities established by d.see id.at.battista argued that in firrea,congress established two types of claims claims approved by the fdic pursuant to d that are satisfied by the remittance of receiver certificates from the assets of the failed financial institution,and claims for damages due to repudiation under e that are payable solely in cash.see id.at.we disagreed,holding that e is better interpreted as being subject to the various provisions of d.id.we observed that little in indicates that congress intended to establish two distinct types of claims,beyond the fact that congress provided for damages for repudiation in subsection e,while discussing the claims payment process in subsection d.id.i f congress had wished to depart from the d regime for claims for damages under e,presumably it would have said so id.t he distribution priority in d a,which was added to in,makes little sense if parties injured by repudiations under e are treated separately from parties with claims under d id.at.we pointed out that in its regulations,the fdic interpreted d priority scheme as including claims for damages arising from contract repudiation under e,but not entitled to the same priority as administrative claims.id.at see also defining administrative expenses,clarifying that administrative expenses generally do not include claims arising from contract repudiation.
we also distinguished sharpe,expressly clarifying that sharpe did not exempt claimants whose contracts had been repudiated from the claims administration process set forth in d.see battista,at.
mccarthy fdic 
in mccarthy,we considered the dismissal of an action challenging the way the fdic handled a loan the plaintiff was negotiating with a bank after the bank failed and the fdic was appointed as receiver.see mccarthy,at.the plaintiff alleged that he was forced to accept a new loan on a and that he would not have executed this loan had he known of the bank closure and the fdic receivership id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to satisfy firrea exhaustion requirements.see id.relying on sharpe,the plaintiff asserted that firrea exhaustion requirements were inapplicable because he was a debtor,not a creditor,of the insolvent bank and because his claims were premised on the fdic conduct.see id.at.
we rejected the plaintiff argument premised on sharpe,explaining that sharpe was not controlling because that case was decided in a different context,where the sharpes were neither creditors nor debtors of the failed institution.see id.at.we noted that t he text of d d plainly states that any claim or action that asserts a right to assets of a failed institution is subject to exhaustion.there is no limitation to creditors,or exclusion of debtors,and that is controlling.id.at emphases in the original.we emphasized that sharpe was an unusual case,and that in sharpe we had no occasion to decide whether a debtor claim or action,like a creditor,must be exhausted,for the sharpes were not debtors and our decision turned on the claimants being aggrieved parties to a contract that the fdic had not repudiated.id.at.
we concluded 
w e see no reason why the plain meaning of the statute should not govern this case and,regardless of whether he is a creditor or a debtor making claim to the bank assets,requiring exhaustion furthers the purpose of firrea to ensure that the assets of a failed institution are distributed fairly and promptly among those with valid claims against the institution and promptly to wind up the affairs of failed banks.
id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
c.the district court application of sharpe to the fdic motion to dismiss deutsche bank claims 
in its initial order,the district court denied in part and granted in part the fdic motion to dismiss deutsche bank claims.the district court held that,because the fdic exceeded its statutory authority in splitting the pooling and servicing agreements without deutsche bank consent,our discussion in sharpe mandated rejection of the fdic arguments that prudential mootness precluded deutsche bank claims and that deutsche bank claims were subject to the priority scheme set forth in d.see deutsche bank trust fdic,d,deutsche bank i.
the district court determined that,because deutsche bank alleged that the fdic breached the contracts,rather than repudiating them,sharpe makes clear that damages resulting from the fdic breach of a contract are not subject to the d distribution priority scheme id.at.applying sharpe,the district court opined that d priority scheme was inapplicable because a claim against the fdic for breach of contract does not constitute a claim under firrea id.at.the district court delineated that,at this stage in the litigation,it was unnecessary to discern whether damages will ultimately be payable from the receivership or from fdic c own funds.even if the damages will come from the receivership,deutsche bank claim will take priority over the categories identified in d,and there is accordingly a possibility of recovery id.at.the district court denied the fdic motion to dismiss deutsche bank claim and held that deutsche bank may proceed with its breach of contract claim arising out of the sale of assets to onewest bank.id 
d.the district court order granting reconsideration 
the district court subsequently granted the fdic motion for reconsideration of the prudential mootness issue.see deutsche bank trust fdic,d,deutsche bank ii.reconsidering its prior ruling,the district court analyzed whether battista and mccarthy undermined its holding based on sharpe,that if a claim for breach of a contract does not qualify as a claim within the meaning of firrea exhaustion requirement,it likewise did not qualify as a claim subject to the d distribution priority.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.although the district court concluded that battista did not impact its prior ruling,see id.at,the district court held that mccarthy compelled dismissal of deutsche bank claims as prudentially moot.see id.at.
the district court observed that t he decision in sharpe did not squarely address the issue presented here whether a claim for breach of a contract qualifies as a general unsecured liability under the d distribution priority,or whether it falls outside of that scheme altogether id.at.according to the district court,mccarthy undercuts sharpe reasoning because b y holding that a debtor can have a claim subject to exhaustion,mccarthy eliminates that key step in sharpe logic.id.internal quotation marks omitted.mccarthy,however,did not and could not overrule sharpe.id.as a result,the district court interpreted mccarthy as distinguish ing sharpe and limit ing its holding that a claimant need not exhaust administrative remedies to claims arising out of a breach of contract in the circumstances present in sharpe id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court determined that deutsche bank claims were not covered by sharpe exception because deutsche bank had not fully performed its obligations,but rather had continuing obligations to pay servicing fees over time.thus,its claims for breach of contracts are subject to the d distribution priority.id.at.the district court held that,because deutsche bank breach of contract claims were general unsecured claims,deutsche bank can not recover anything on those claims given indymac deep insolvency id.at.finding prudential mootness,the district court dismissed deutsche bank claims with prejudice except for the second cause of action for breach of contract to the extent that it is based on the alleged breach of contracts that fdic as receiver executed or approved,which would be entitled to a priority right of payment under d id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also sua sponte certified the prudential mootness issue for interlocutory appeal by deutsche bank.id.at citation omitted.the district court conclude d that the question whether claims for breach of a contract are subject to the d distribution priority constitute d a controlling question of law worthy of certification.id.the district court certified for interlocutory appeal the following controlling question of law whether deutsche bank claims for postfailure breach by fdic as receiver of contracts executed by a failed bank are payable only as general unsecured claims under the d distribution priority id.at.
we granted t he petition for permission to appeal pursuant to b,and limited the appeal to the specific question of law certified by the district court 
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo whether deutsche bank claims are prudentially moot.see hunt imperial merch,cir.we also review de novo a district court interpretation and construction of a federal statute.holmes merck,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
permissible scope of the appeal 
in addition to challenging the district court holding concerning prudential mootness,deutsche bank contends that the district court erred in holding that the psas constituted qualified financial contracts that could be severed pursuant to e,thereby negating deutsche bank related breach of contract and constructive trust claims.the fdic counters that this issue was not included in the question of law certified by the district court.
a n appellate court interlocutory jurisdiction under b permits it to address any issue fairly included within the certified order because it is the order that is appealable,and not the controlling question identified by the district court nevada bank of am,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in the original.
in this appeal,the dispositive issue,and the only issue certified in the district court order,concerns prudential mootness.encapsulated within that issue is whether deutsche bank claims constitute general unsecured claims under d.although we have authority to review issues fairly included within the certified order,review of issues not included in the certified order would obliterate the distinction bet
