background 
casa complaint is based on the following factual allegations.
casa is engaged in the business of international currency exchange,has its principal place of business in mexico city,and is incorporated in mexico.on october,genaro alvarez alvarez presented to casa a check drawn on the united states treasury in the amount of.the check was made out to alvarez as the payee.unbeknownst to casa the check had been stolen.apparently the check listed no payee at the time it was stolen,and alvarez name was later filled in.casa gave value for the check and forwarded it to norwest,casa banker in the united states,for deposit and collection.on november,norwest forwarded the check to the federal reserve bank of minnesota for collection.on november,the federal reserve bank debited the treasury account and gave immediate credit for the check to norwest.there is no allegation that the drawer signature was forged.
on november,the treasury was informed that a number of checks had been stolen from the united states postal data service center in louis,missouri,including a check bearing the same serial number as the check cashed by alvarez.however,it was not until february,that the treasury directed the federal reserve bank to credit the full amount of the check to its account,acting pursuant to c,which provides the treasury shall have the usual right of a drawee to examine checks presented for payment and refuse payment of any checks.the treasury shall have a reasonable time to make such examination.c.the federal reserve bank did so on that same day and debited norwest account with the federal reserve bank for the full amount of the check.norwest then debited the full amount of the check from casa account with norwest.norwest debiting of casa account caused casa account to be overdrawn by on february.
on october,casa filed suit against the united states in the court of federal claims.casa sought to recover on three separate theories.count i alleged that the government did not reject payment on the check within a reasonable time,in violation of c,d.count ii alleged an illegal exaction without due process in violation of the fifth amendment.count iii alleged the government had taken casa property without just compensation as guaranteed by the fifth amendment.casa sought to recover damages for the value of the check,the loss of use of funds,expenses incurred due to the overdraft in casa account with norwest,legal fees and expenses,and the diminished value of its business due to a decline in casa reputation as a result of its overdrawn account with norwest.
in a opinion the court of federal claims dismissed count i for lack of jurisdiction holding that,even if the government had violated part,those regulations were directed only at protecting the treasury rights,rather than those of third parties and nothing in the language of the regulation s unequivocally grants a depositor in casa position a right to recover damages either expressly or by implication.casa,fed.cl.at internal citations omitted.the court dismissed count ii the due process claim for failure to state a claim because the government had not required casa to pay any money either to the government or to a third party.rather,the funds were recouped by a third party,norwest,pursuant to its deposit contract with casa.id.at.the court of federal claims similarly dismissed count iii the takings claim for lack of jurisdiction because i t was norwest and not the united states that took the action that resulted in the diminishment of casa funds and the involvement of the united states in that transaction was not sufficiently direct and substantial to make the united states liable for a taking of those funds.id.at quoting bd.of ymca united states,d ymca.

initially,it is useful to place the appellant claims in context.disputes concerning the legal rules governing the present fact situation or similar situations are not uncommon.indeed,though one would not know it from the briefs,a similar factual situation led to the leading supreme court decision on federal common law clearfield trust united states.typically,where a check has been stolen and the payee endorsement has been added or forged,the dispute is between the treasury and the bank that presented the check for payment.in clearfield trust,a treasury check with a forged payee endorsement was tendered to the penney by someone who was not the payee of the check.at.penney cashed the check and endorsed it over to clearfield trust,which paid penney.id.at.clearfield trust then presented the check to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia,which paid clearfield trust.id.twelve days later the payee told the united states that he had never received the check.id.the united states then informed clearfield trust and penney of the forgery and,sixteen months after the check was cashed,informed clearfield trust that it sought reimbursement for the amount of the check.id.the united states subsequently brought suit against clearfield trust to reclaim the amount of the check.id.clearfield defended on the ground that the united states had unreasonably delayed in seeking to recoup the amount of the check.id.at.the supreme court held that the rights and obligations between clearfield and the united states were to be determined under federal common law because they related to commercial paper issued by the united states.id.
on the merits in clearfield trust,the supreme court held that the government was not liable to clearfield trust because clearfield trust could shift that loss to the drawee the treasury only on a clear showing that the drawee delay in notifying it of the forgery caused it damage.id.at.the supreme court concluded that such damage had not been shown by clearfield trust,who so far as appears can still recover from penney id.the court distinguished price neal,burr,eng.as involving the situation of a forgery of the drawer signature,in which the drawee is charged with immediate knowledge of the forgery,while clearfield trust involved the situation of a forgery of the payee signature,knowledge of which the drawee could not be immediately charged.id.at.thirteen years later,when addressing a related factual situation involving a dispute between private parties,the supreme court clarified that the rights and obligations between the private parties,penney and clearfield trust,or casa and norwest are generally determined under state law because they do not touch the rights and duties of the united states.bank of am.trust sav.ass parnell,d.
although clearfield trust was a case in which the united states brought suit against the presenting bank,it is indeed difficult to believe that,where a debit has occurred,making affirmative legal action by the united states unnecessary,the presenting bank here,norwest is without legal recourse against the united states.whether the claim is properly characterized as based on a contract,an implied contract,the treasury regulations,or some other theory,we assume that a claim for an unreasonable delay in notification may properly be brought against the united states,and the case will be governed by the federal common law established in clearfield trust,as modified by the treasury regulations.see united states texas,d.
this case,however,is unusual in that the depositer in the clearfield trust situation casa here,and penney in clearfield trust rather than the presenting bank norwest here,and clearfield trust in clearfield trust seeks to assert rights against the united states.clearfield trust appears to assume that the united states would have no direct rights against the depositer,and that the depositer would have no direct claim against the treasury.instead,the depositer would have a claim against its own bank,and,presumably,under parnell,that claim would be governed largely by state law.we find nothing in appellant authorities that suggests a different result,or any pertinent constitutional infirmity in the regulatory process.
a claim against the united states may be based on a theory that a statute or regulation is as to the plaintiff.in united states testan,d,the supreme court held that 
w here the united states is the defendant and the plaintiff is not suing for money improperly exacted or retained,the basis of the federal claim whether it be the constitution,a statute,or a regulation does not create a cause of action for money damages,unless that basis in itself can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.
citation omitted.in collins united states,we held that because the tucker act does not mandate the payment of plaintiff alleged damages,to recover he must base his claim on some other statute that creates a substantive right by mandating the payment of his claim.the statute relied upon must grant a right of action with specificity,citing testan,at.in collins,we held that a statute stating that the government may settle,and pay in the amount not more than,a claim against the united states was not,because the payment of the claim was discretionary under the statute.id.
here,casa urges that the treasury regulations,c,d,may be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation by the government.the regulations provide that t he treasury shall have the usual right of a drawee to examine checks presented for payment and refuse payment of any checks.the treasury shall have a reasonable time to make such examination,c,and c hecks shall be deemed to be paid by the united states treasury only after first examination has been fully completed,d.casa urges that the treasury delay before refusing payment of the check exceeded a reasonable time,such that the check should have been deemed paid according to d.casa argues that once the check was deemed paid the treasury could not refuse payment under d,but would only be authorized to seek reclamation of the funds already paid and would have to follow the reclamation procedures under.the reclamation procedures,require that the treasury provide the presenting bank with notice of its intent to reclaim the funds and an opportunity to protest the reclamation.section provides 
a if,after a check has been paid by treasury,it is found to 
bear a forged or unauthorized indorsement or 
contain any other material defect or alteration which was not discovered upon first examination,then,upon demand by the treasury in accordance with the procedures specified in of this part,the presenting bank or other indorser shall refund the amount of the check payment.
section a provides that f or all reclamations an initial demand for refund of the amount of a check payment will be made by sending a request for refund reclamation,to the presenting bank or any other indorser.this request shall advise the presenting bank of the amount demanded and the reason for the demand.section further provides that the bank may,by filing a protest,request treasury to review its decision that the bank is liable for the reclamation the director,who has supervisory authority over the reclamation branch,or his authorized subordinate,shall consider and decide any protest properly submitted under this paragraph.a,c.thus,unlike refusals to pay under section,when operating under sections,the treasury must provide the presenting bank with notice of and an opportunity to protest the intended reclamation.the benefit to casa from the treasury following this alternative is not entirely clear.presumably,had the treasury followed this alternative,an unexpected overdraft in casa account with norwest would not have occurred.
however,even if we were to accept casa theory,the regulations would only apply to claims against the government by norwest.casa theory does not explain how the regulations could be construed as being as to casa,even if they were as to norwest.we hold that the regulations are not as to casa since there is no indication that they were designed to convey rights on depositers of presenting banks.
we next address casa claim that the court of federal claims erred in dismissing the takings clause count of its complaint.casa does not argue that the government appropriated casa property directly or that the government directly imposed regulatory burdens on casa that amounted to a taking.rather,casa argues that the government committed a regulatory taking when it caused norwest a private party to take casa property when the government debited norwest account.casa urges that norwest debiting of casa account as a result of the government action against norwest amounted to a taking of casa property by the government.
under decisions of the supreme court and this court,a compensable taking does not occur unless the government actions on the intermediate third party have a direct and substantial impact on the plaintiff asserting the takings claim.a variety of cases have held that particular government actions did not have such a direct and substantial effect on the plaintiff and thus did not constitute a taking of property from the plaintiff.
in ymca,the ymca brought suit against the government,alleging that a compensable taking of property by the government occurred when rioters damaged or destroyed ymca buildings in panama,some of which were occupied by troops.the supreme court noted that the ymca had made no showing that any damage occurred as a result of the presence of the troops.at.moreover,the ymca would not have a claim for compensation under the fifth amendment even if it could show that damage inflicted by rioters occurred because of the presence of the troops,at.the court held that the constitution does not require compensation every time violence against the government results in damage to private property,and that compensation to the ymca was not required in that case because the government involvement in the causation of the damage did not constitute direct and substantial enough government involvement to warrant compensation under the fifth amendment.id.at.
in each case in which we have applied the ymca standard,we held that the government involvement was not sufficiently direct and substantial to constitute a taking.see shewfelt united states,although county may have improperly taken title to property and united states government was aware of potential taking when it acquired property through purchase from county,acts of the county were not attributable to the united states,and the united states was not obligated to compensate owner erosion victims of lake superior regulation united states,no direct and substantial involvement by the united states where international organization exercised its own discretion to raise water levels of lake causing damage to landowners property langenegger united states,where actual expropriation by foreign sovereign occurred,there was no fifth amendment taking by united states even though the united states engaged in friendly persuasion of the foreign sovereign to engage in the expropriation,cert.denied,d,see also griggs allegheny county,d county government,not federal government,was liable for taking of air easement over claimant p
