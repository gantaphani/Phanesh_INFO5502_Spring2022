this appeal involves the allocation of liability for altered checks outlined in articles and of the uniform commercial code and the operation of the check collection system.the allocates liability for a stolen or altered check among the various parties involved in the check collection process.walter thompson jwt is the drawer of the check.bank of america boa is the payor bank and the drawee of the check.the federal reserve bank of atlanta atlanta fed is a collecting bank and a presenting bank.first bancoamericano fba is the depositary bank,a collecting bank,and a presenting bank.
we are asked to determine whether jwt acted negligently in failing to take certain preventive measures upon learning of prior fraud on its checking account with boa and,if so,whether that negligence substantially contributed to the check fraud,thereby barring jwt from obtaining a recovery pursuant to a,post note whether boa acted in good faith in paying the altered check and,if boa did not,whether the exception to the presentment warranty,see,post note and accompanying text,bars its claims for breach of the presentment warranty against the two presenting and collecting banks and whether a district court may grant summary judgment to a payor bank for losses associated with a presenting bank breach of the presentment warranty before the payor bank has reimbursed the drawer for the amount of the altered check.
background 
a.the check collection process 
in the normal functioning of the check collection process,the drawer of a check issues to the payee a check drawn on an account of the drawer at the drawee bank.the check then flows downstream through the banking system,from the drawer to the payee and ultimately to the drawee bank also described as the payor bank,see id,which is ordered to make payment,see id.a.the payment,in turn,flows upstream through the various intermediary banks,making its way from the bank to the payee account.see james white robert summers,uniform commercial code ed.white summers describing the flow of check and payment through the check processing system defining intermediary bank.the payee bank,which is the first to receive the check,is known as the depositary bank.id.the other intermediary banks serve as collecting banks or presenting banks at various points in the collection process.a collecting bank is a bank,other than the payor bank,that handles a check for collection.id.a presenting bank is a bank,other than the payor bank,that presents an item for payment.id.an intermediary bank can serve as both a collecting bank and a presenting bank.the check collection system in a normal,uncomplicated case is depicted graphically in the appendix to this opinion.
liability for stolen and altered checks 
articles and of the outline a scheme for allocating the loss resulting from an altered check among the parties involved in the check processing system.when a drawer issues an instrument such as a check,the drawer set s it afloat upon a sea of strangers and,in so doing,voluntarily enters into a relation with later holders which justifies imposition of a duty of care.id.cmt.internal quotation marks omitted.when a check is stolen,altered,and later presented for payment,losses result.the allocates liability for these losses through what one court has described as a framework,putnam rolling ladder mfrs.hanover trust,combined with principles of comparative negligence,see cmt.see also white summers,ante,at we describe that framework briefly below.
bank liability 
when a drawer account is charged for an altered check,the drawer may assert a claim for breach of downstream against the bank.section of the states that a bank may charge its customer account only when the bank is presented with an item that is properly payable from the account.a check that is forged or has an altered payee is not properly payable.cmt.in most cases,a bank is strictly liable for charging its customer account for a forged or altered check pursuant to section.see,travelers cas.sur.of am.wells fargo bank,cir o rdinarily a bank is strictly liable for charging a customer account with an amount that the customer had not authorized the bank to pay,constitution bank,noting this principle of strict liability as a matter of new jersey law.after the bank discovers that an altered check has been charged against the drawer account,the drawer is entitled to have its account credited for the amount of the check.see white summers,ante,at.
section a protects a party who paid a check against suit by any party who contributed to the alteration.accordingly,where a drawer own negligence contributed to the alteration,the drawer is precluded from asserting the alteration against a bank that in good faith,pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.a the defines good faith,generally,as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.id.a.when multiple parties are negligent,section b allocates liability for the loss associated with an altered check according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
in order to avoid liability under section for charging its customer account for an altered check,the bank must prove that its customer,the drawer,was negligent the drawer negligence substantially contributed to the alteration and the bank paid the check in good faith.the drawer may,in turn,assert the bank own negligence in taking an altered check.the drawer must establish that the bank was negligent,and that the bank negligence contributed to the loss.liability will then be allocated on the basis of comparative fault.travelers,at.
liability of the depositary bank,presenting banks,and collecting banks 
a bank may also assert claims upstream against the presenting bank,a collecting bank,and the depositary bank for the loss associated with the altered check.in addition,a bank may bring a breach of warranty action against any party who presented the altered check for payment.in most cases,t hese warranty actions will continue up the collection chain to the party who took from the wrongdoer or to the wrongdoer himself.perini first nat.bank,cir analyzing previous version of the.
the banks involved in the check collection process extend two types of warranties presentment and transfer warranties.section sets out the presentment warranty given by depositary and collecting banks when presenting a check to the bank for payment.it provides,in relevant part,that 
if an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft,i the person obtaining payment or acceptance,at the time of presentment,and ii a previous transferor of the draft,at the time of transfer,warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith that the draft has not been altered.
a emphasis added section imposes a nearly identical presentment warranty on any party presenting a check for collection.
section outlines the transfer warranty given by customers and collecting banks 
a a customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that the item has not been altered 
b if an item is dishonored,a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item i according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred,or ii if the transfer was of an incomplete item,according to its terms when completed as stated in sections and.the obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith.a transferor can not disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an indorsement stating that it is made without recourse or otherwise disclaiming liability.
a,b the transfer warranty of section is given only by bank customers and collecting banks,but an identical transfer warranty contained in section applies to any person who transfers an instrument for consideration.id.a.a bank can bring a warranty cause of action pursuant to and against upstream banks that transferred an altered check and presented it for payment.see,wachovia bank,fed.reserve bank of richmond,cir.
factual background 
on october,jwt,an advertising agency,issued a check in the amount of check payable to one of its vendors,outdoor life network.the check was issued from jwt checking account account at boa.at an unknown date,an unknown person altered the payee on the check to diversified business enterpises sic,inc and deposited the check into an account maintained by diversified business enterprises at first bankamericano fba then presented the check to the federal reserve bank of new york,which,in turn,presented it to the federal reserve bank of atlanta.the atlanta fed then presented it to bank of america via boa check processing facility in georgia.boa debited from the account of jwt and transmitted the payment back upstream through the bank collection system to fba,which,presumably,deposited the funds into the account held by diversified business enterprises.later,jwt discovered that the payee of the check had been altered,notified boa the same day of the alteration and the fact that boa had made a payment on the altered check,and sought to have its account credited for the amount of the check.boa did not credit the account but,instead,demanded that fba remit the proceeds of the check to boa.fba refused to do so.
at the time of the events at issue,boa had a program in place to identify potentially fraudulent checks the positive pay program or positive pay,and jwt subscribed to this service during the relevant time period positive pay permitted boa to match check numbers,dates,and amounts on the checks that were presented to boa with a list provided by jwt prior to payment of a check.if the positive pay program identified a discrepancy in any of this information,boa would not make payment on the check.at the time of the instant fraud,positive pay did not have the capability of matching payee names payee matching,a capability that arguably would have detected the fraud here.
prior to the payment of the check,ten other instances of check fraud or attempted check fraud occurred on checks issued from jwt account.at least one of these instances involved the simple alteration of a payee name.boa credited the account for the amount of that altered check,so jwt did not suffer a loss associated with that earlier payee alteration.another of the instances involved both the alteration of a payee name along with the alteration of the amount of the check.boa positive pay system detected this particular fraud and jwt account was not charged.the loss suffered by jwt associated with the remaining prior instances of fraud was less than.
procedural history 
after jwt discovered the fraud at issue here and boa refused to credit its account for the amount of the check,jwt brought this action against boa.jwt alleged that boa was negligent and that boa had violated its duties under and the provision governing when items are properly payable.boa,in turn,filed a complaint against fba and the atlanta fed for violations of transfer warranty,presentment warranty,transfer warranty,and presentment warranty,see ante notes,and accompanying text text of provisions.
after the completion of discovery,jwt moved for summary judgment against boa,and boa moved for summary judgment against fba and the atlanta fed.fba opposed jwt motion on the merits but boa did not the district court granted both motions,concluding that boa was strictly liable to jwt for charging jwt account for an item not properly payable,a.the court also concluded that fba and the atlanta fed had breached the presentment warranties they had extended to boa under.
the court rejected fba argument that summary judgment was inappropriate because questions of fact existed as to whether jwt was negligent within the meaning of a,see ante note and accompanying text,in failing to prevent the check fraud.fba asserted that jwt had negligently failed to respond appropriately after learning of previous check fraud on its account.specifically,fba faulted jwt for not closing the account or instituting a payee matching program to detect future fraud.fba and atlanta fed argue on appeal that a jury could have found that jwt failure to take these preventive measures substantially contributed to the alteration of the check,and,if so,that jwt would be precluded from recovery against boa while boa would be precluded from recovery against fba and the atlanta fed.see a.the court considered the ten prior incidents of check fraud on the account and determined that none of these instances suggest ed that the mere act of keeping the account open substantially contributed to the alteration of the check.the court similarly rejected fba suggestions that jwt failure to take remedial as instituting payee matching,a process unavailable at the contributed to the fraud.finally,the court rejected as pure conjecture fba suggestions that jwt or boa could have been involved,negligently or otherwise,with the criminal check fraud conspiracy that obtained and altered the check.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the parties,see,konits valley stream cent.high sch,cir carney philippone,cir,which in this case are fba and the atlanta fed.
we conclude that jwt alleged failures do not constitute negligence within the meaning of,and that jwt alleged negligence could not have substantially contributed to the check alteration,as required to preclude recovery under.we also hold that the standard of good faith for a bank under the is one that commands a duty of fair dealing and not a duty of care.in light of the applicable standard,we conclude that boa did not violate its duty of fair dealing and therefore did not act in bad faith.finally,we hold that a bank is not required to reimburse the drawer before proceeding against the collecting banks for breach of warranty.
whether allegations of boa and jwt negligence are sufficient to defeat summary judgment 
the presentment scheme outlined in the shifts losses up the collection stream to presenting and depositary banks.fed.reserve bank,at.accordingly,the bank that pays an altered check in good faith may bring an action for damages against the presenting banks for breaching the presentment warranty.see b.in a case such as this,in which a check has been altered,the usual result will be that the presenting banks are strictly liable to the drawer and the bank for breaching the presentment warranty.the exceptions to this result arise when either the bank lacked good faith in paying the draft,see id.a,or when the drawer failed to exercise ordinary care which substantially contribute d to the alteration of the check,id.a.because neither of these exceptions apply in this case,we affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of jwt and boa.
drawer alleged negligence pursuant to a 
the primary issue on this appeal is whether jwt failure to take certain preventive measures after learning of previous fraud on the account constituted negligence which substantially contribute d,id.a,to the alteration of the check.fba and atlanta fed contend that,upon learning of the prior instances of fraud,jwt should have closed the account and instituted a payee matching system to detect future fraud.they argue that jwt failure to take these steps constituted negligence that substantially contributed to the alteration of the check and jwt should,therefore,be estopped from asserting the alteration against boa.
the fourth circuit addressed the issue of drawer negligence in federal reserve bank,a case arising from the theft and alteration of a check drawn on an account from which six checks had been stolen previously.at.the defendant in that action contended that the drawer failure to implement certain precautionary measures to prevent check,sending checks via an electronic funds transfer system or federal express rather than through the a failure to exercise ordinary care that substantially contributed to the alteration.id.at.the fourth circuit rejected this argument.because the prior thefts constituted a very small percentage of the checks issued by the drawer,were relatively remote in time,and were committed by individuals then believed to be in custody,the drawer decision to continue using regular mail to send its checks hardly amounted to a failure to exercise ordinary care,much less a failure to exercise ordinary care that substantially contributed to the alteration.id.at.
here,fba and the atlanta fed contend that,in light of the prior instances of fraud,jwt should have closed the account and instituted a payee matching system to detect future fraud.based on the facts before us,however,we conclude that ordinary care did not compel jwt to adopt either of these measures.as the district court observed,the previous incidents of altered checks resulted in de minimis losses compared to the significant costs which jwt would have incurred by closing the account.in addition,fba came forward with no evidence showing that had jwt closed the account and drawn checks on a different account,the new account would have been less susceptible to check theft,thereby averting the theft giving rise to this litigation.under these circumstances,closing the account would not have been a reasonable,much less a necessary,exercise of ordinary care.with respect to fba suggestion that jwt should have implemented payee matching,the record shows that payee matching was not available to jwt and boa at the time of the presentment of the check.jwt reasonably relied on boa positive pay fraud detection service with the technological limitations that existed at the time.jwt failure to utilize an unavailable technology can hardly be said to constitute a failure to exercise ordinary care pursuant to.
we further hold that a defense based on a drawer alleged negligence is foreclosed by the plain language of.when a drawer own negligence substantially contributes to the alteration of a check,the drawer is precluded from asserting the alteration against a collecting or presenting bank,such as fba,that processes the check in good faith.id.a see ante note and accompanying text.the official comments to section define substantial contribution as an action which is a contributing cause of the alteration and a substantial factor in bringing it about.cmt.the comments also provide certain examples of negligent conduct that would satisfy this test,including a a drawer who writes the amount of the check in a manner that makes it easy to alter the amount and b a drawer who mails the check to the wrong payee.id.cmt.accordingly,while the principal cause of the alteration may be the act of a,things that make the job easier may constitute negligence that substantially contributes to the alteration of a check and therefore preclude a claim based on the alteration white summers,ante,at see also fed.reserve bank,at t he unambiguous terms of section provide a defense to the presenting bank only if the drawer negligence substantially contributed to the alteration.zambia commercial bank fidelity int l bank,u nder the bank must establish not merely that the customer was careless,but that the customer negligence set the stage for,or in some way provided the wrongdoer with the opportunity to make the unauthorized signature.fidelity bank united bank of,noting that a bank mishandling of a check increased the possibility that an unauthorized person would be able to forge the payee name and pose as the intended payee.
the lack of payee matching can not,as a matter of logic,have substantially contributed to the alteration at issue in this litigation.a payee matching mechanism identifies check fraud when an altered check is presented to the bank for payment,in other words,after the alteration has already occurred.because this technology detects alterations after the fact,but does not prevent them in the first instance,jwt alleged failure to adopt payee matching can not have contributed or set the stage for the alteration.we therefore conclude that jwt alleged failures to take certain preventive measures suggested by fba here did not constitute negligence which substantially contributed to the alteration of the check.
bank alleged lack of good faith pursuant to a 
a outlines the presentment warranty owed to a bank that pays an altered check in good faith.see ante note and accompanying text text of provision.good faith,in turn,is defined as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.therefore,if a bank pays an altered check in good faith,it receives the benefit of the presentment warranty and shifts the loss to the presenting banks.
the good faith requirement incorporates standards of honesty and fair dealing but not of negligence.in other words,the good faith requirement does not impose a standard of care but,rather,a standard of fair dealing see fed.reserve bank,at white summers,ante,at.because fba has not alleged that boa acted unfairly or dishonestly,this distinction is fatal to fba argument that boa did not act in good faith.
fba and the atlanta fed point to no action or inaction that would suggest,much less establish,that boa did not act with honesty in fact.instead,they suggest that boa acted negligently because it should have closed the account of its own accord or employed more advanced fraud detection capabilities,such as payee matching.while these alleged failures,if proven,might arguably establish negligence,they do not demonstrate a lack of honesty in fact or a failure to observ e reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.indeed,the fourth circuit has held that a payor bank reliance on a positive pay system,instead of on other methods of fraud detection,precluded a finding of a lack of good faith.see fed.reserve bank,at.we conclude,therefore,that boa acted in good faith within the meaning of section and can properly claim the benefit of the presentment warranty.
in sum,the district court properly granted summary judgment to jwt and boa.fba and the atlanta fed have pointed to no material disputes of fact on the issue of jwt alleged negligence or boa lack of good faith.
whether the district court prematurely granted summary judgment in favor of boa before boa reimbursed jwt for the altered check 
fba and the atlanta fed contend that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment to boa.they question whether boa has,in fact,incurred a loss associated from the check in light of boa decision to delay crediting jwt account for the amount of the loss.
we find no requirement in the text of suggesting that a bank must first credit the drawer account with the amount of the loss before it can bring a presentment warranty action against the presenting banks to recover that loss.section b states that i f the drawee accepts the draft i breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor,and ii if the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft,the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.those amounts include both damages equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment as well as compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.b.
courts have routinely granted summary judgment in favor of a payor bank that had not yet reimbursed the drawer.see,first bank of neednah sec.bank of springfield,wl,dist.lexis,at,granting summary judgment to drawer against payor bank and,at the same time,granting summary judgment to payor bank against collecting bank foster bancshares,at affirming declaratory judgment that depositary bank was required to indemnify bank for breach of presentment warranty.the facts of this litigation do not compel a different result.judgment has been entered against boa in favor of jwt accordingly,there is nothing premature in finding fba and the atlanta fed liable,in due course,to boa.the district court grant of summary judgment was proper.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that jwt alleged failures do not constitute negligence within the meaning of jwt alleged negligence could not have substantially contributed to the check altera
