marvin graham borrowed money to purchase a house in.approximately seven years later,he defaulted on his loan and received a notice of sale.graham filed this action to halt foreclosure proceedings and to cancel the note.he contends the defendants lending personnel made fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions by stating the appraised fair market value of his home in was increasing and that the loan was good for him,while allegedly knowing the appraisal was outrageously speculative.taking issue with mortgage banking practices,graham seeks to hold the defendants responsible for the decline in his property value as well as the collapse of the real estate market.
graham appeals a judgment of dismissal after the court sustained a demurrer to his second amended complaint sac without leave to amend.he contends he sufficiently alleged facts to support his causes of action for fraud and deceit,violations of business and professions code section and declaratory relief.he also contends it was an abuse of discretion to deny further leave to amend.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
we derive the facts from the complaints and the documents of which the court took judicial notice howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th.
graham borrowed in from first franklin financial corporation first franklin to purchase a home in vista,california for.a deed of trust on the property secured the loan in first priority.he obtained a second loan for,secured by the property in second priority.american national lending,american national was the loan broker for the transaction.american national appraiser assessed the fair market value of the property at the time at.
in after graham fell behind in his payments,first franklin substituted recontrust company,recontrust a subsidiary of bank of america,bofa as the trustee and assigned its interests under the deed of trust to deutsche bank national trust company as trustee for the certificate holders of the ffmlt trust,mortgage certificates,series deutsche bank.recontrust recorded a notice of default and election to sell indicating he owed more than for past due payments and costs.several months thereafter,recontrust sent a notice of trustee sale indicating an intention to sell the property at auction.
the pleadingsa 
in graham sued bofa,recontrust,deutsch bank,first franklin and american national collectively defendants the original complaint set out preliminary facts describing changes in mortgage banking practices from to,which allegedly affected home values by driving prices up before they collapsed in.graham alleged the defendants knew the appraisal for his house was speculative and they falsely represented the value of the home would appreciate to permit a sale or refinance at a substantial profit before adjustable rate mortgage payments were required.he asserted causes of action for fraud,negative fraud,and deceit,an order terminating foreclosure proceedings and cancellation of the notes,and violation of section.
graham amended his original complaint after defendants filed a demurrer.he alleged identical preliminary facts and nearly identical allegations for the fraud cause of action,but in the section cause of action he added allegations the defendants failed to disclose the true cost of the loan and negative features of mortgage arm loans and they misrepresented the true value of the home and using the lure of early low monthly payments induced graham to execute a loan package that clearly was not needed nor good for him.he contended the lending personnel were equally complicit in their lending practices in approving the loan package without regard to the actual fair market value of the home.
graham attached to the first amended complaint fac the consent judgment entered against five institutional lenders,including bofa,to settle a suit filed by the federal government and states,including california,regarding mortgage foreclosure and modification practices.graham requested declaratory relief as to the applicability of the settlement to the terms of his home loan and how the present litigation should proceed in the face of the provisions outlined in the national settlement.
defendants demurred arguing the fac did not state a cause of action for fraud,negative fraud or deceit because graham failed to plead the elements of fraud with sufficient specificity.defendants argued the fac did not state a cause of action for violation of section because the fraud claims fail and graham did not plead facts demonstrating a violation of a constitutional,statutory or regulatory provision to render the alleged conduct unfair.defendants additionally argued graham lacks standing because he has not lost money or property.defendants also asserted graham is not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief because he did not allege a present and actual controversy or the necessary elements for injunctive relief.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
graham filed a second amended complaint sac with substantial changes the sac alleges four causes of action negative fraud and deceit and affirmative fraud violation of section legal and equitable relief based on fraud and public policy against defendants and declaratory relief.
the sac includes additional preliminary facts purporting to outline historical procedures of home financing since and asserting legal arguments about how financial institutions have destroyed the home financing methodology by various practices such as fragmentation and repacking of notes and substitutions of trustees on deeds of trust.according to graham,this conduct along with conduct of the federal reserve,congress,fannie mae,freddie mac,and entities caused average national home values to appreciate from percent per year in the late to percent per year before collapsing in.he alleges the financial elite knew the potential for disaster based upon warnings from government officials,calls for legislation and other events from through.while graham cites publically available information,he alleges he could not have suspected the pending collapse of the real estate market because the market was the victim of financial engineering and a wall street ponzi scheme and defendants,as well as others,were players,engineers,and manipulators in this endemic and collusive fraud on california homeowners.
graham alleges the lending personnel made the following representations related to his loans a the home had an increasing and revised upwardsvalue of b such was the fair market value fmv of the home c such rapid increase in the fmv of the home demonstrated the security of the purchase d the fmv of the home was,such that the home could be turned for a profit in the near future,or refinanced to obtain better terms e the loan was good for graham when defendants knew the appraisal was speculative.he alleges the appraisal was false because it was an artificially inflated and engineered rate that was impossible to justify by any historical data and the appraiser justified the valuation by the use of comparable sales,which were all tainted by the activities described and were part of the pervasive fraud.in addition,graham alleges lending personnel knew he planned to keep the home for a long time and did not intend to sell or flip the house for a profit.he also alleges the lending personnel knew he was an unsophisticated borrower,his loan was unsustainable,he would not be able to pay back such loan and they steamroll ed the loan transaction even though they knew the loan was misaligned with graham stated interests.
in the second cause of action for violation of section,graham alleges the same representations regarding the appraised value of the property constitute unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices.he also makes generalized allegations regarding business practices contending the defendants created mass loans for profit colluded with other institutional lenders,appraisers and credit rating agencies to monetize and support the entire lending industry of an and expanding real estate market created and used mers as a entity and to circumvent and unseat the real property recording requirements engineered a system of splitting up deeds from notes to subvert the integrity of the judicial system and real property recording system to rely exclusively on the deed to perpetrate foreclosure foreclosing on homes with no cause,with defective notice,with improper purpose,without proper authority and participated in d ual tracking in which lending institutions undertake loan modification negotiations while,soon thereafter,taking steps toward foreclosure.
the third cause of action alleges the promissory notes are void and the deeds should be rescinded based upon the alleged fraud.the fourth cause of action seeks declaratory relief ordering defendants take nothing by the notes or the deeds due to alleged fraud,unconscionability and s tatutory violations and to refinance the property as required by the national mortgage settlement.
ruling on demurrer 
the court sustained the defendants demurrer to the sac without leave to amend,ruling there is no basis for the first cause of action for fraud or deceit because an appraisal is an opinion rather than a statement of fact and plaintiff failed to show justifiable reliance on a speculative appraisal.the court also ruled the sac fails to allege fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions with sufficient specificity.
as to the second cause of action,the court ruled graham alleged insufficient facts to demonstrate unlawful business practices or to show the defendants engaged in unfair business practices in violation of section.a speculative appraisal does not support plaintiff cause of action for fraud and consequently fails to support plaintiff second cause of action for unfair business practices in violation of section.the court found graham does not allege facts to support a fraud claim under section because he does not plead facts establishing a misrepresentation that would deceive consumer,fails to plead facts showing actual reliance,and fails to plead the defendants actions caused him injury.the court found no unfair business practices based upon allegations of splitting the note from the deed of trust because the mortgage follows the note.the court also noted graham lacks standing because he can not establish the required element of harm since the trustee sale has not yet occurred.
as to the third cause of action,the court found no basis for legal and equitable relief based on fraud or violation of public policy because graham alleges no facts showing the note or home equity line of credit were procured by fraud,accident or mistake.additionally,graham is not entitled to rescission because he does not allege he either has tendered or has the ability to tender the amount due under the loan.the court also ruled there is no basis for injunctive relief because graham did not allege facts that would prohibit enforcement of the terms of the deed of trust 
the court ruled the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief fails because graham does not allege a justiciable controversy.
discussion 
istandard of review 
on appeal from a judgment after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we review the order de novo and exercise our independent judgment on whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.lincoln property,travelers indemnity th.we assume the truth of all properly pleaded material facts,as well as facts inferred from the pleadings and those of which judicial notice may be taken.howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra,supra,cal th at.however,we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law evans city of berkeley cal th,and we disregard allegations contrary to the law or to a fact of which judicial notice may be taken.brenereic associates city of del mar,supra,th at.
graham does not state a cause of action for fraud or deceit 
graham contends the sac sufficiently alleges the elements necessary to state a claim for what he refers to as negative fraud and deceit or affirmative fraud.we disagree.
to establish a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation,the plaintiff must prove the defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact was true that representation was false the defendant knew that the representation was false when the defendant made it,or the defendant made the representation recklessly and without regard for its truth the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation the plaintiff was harmed and the plaintiff reliance on the defendant representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff.perlas gmac mortgage,llc th,perlas,italics omitted.
the required elements for fraudulent concealment are concealment or suppression of a material fact by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact and plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact.bank of america superior court th,bank of america.
here,graham allegations of misrepresentations concealment center on the appraisal.graham alleges defendants represented a the home had an increasing and revised upwardsvalue of b such was the fair market value fmv of the home c such rapid increase in the fmv of the home demonstrated the security of the purchase d the fmv of the home was,such that the home could be turned for a profit in the near future,or refinanced to obtain better terms and e the loan was good for graham.graham alleges the representations about the appraised value of the property were false because the appraisal was an artificially inflated and engineered rate.he admits the appraiser justified the valuation by the use of comparable sales,but alleges the comparable sales were tainted by what graham alleges is part of a pervasive fraud.
statements regarding the appraised value of the property are not actionable fraudulent misrepresentations.representations of opinion,particularly involving matters of value,are ordinarily not actionable representations of fact.neu visions sports th,neu visions accountant opinion of the value of a building not actionable misrepresentation of fact padgett phariss th,opinion of fair market value of property not actionable misrepresentation.a representation is an opinion if it expresses only a the belief of the maker,without certainty,as to the existence of a fact or b his judgment as to quality,value or other matters of judgment.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.
appraisals are an opinion as to the market value of a property prepared by a qualified independent appraiser.a,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property.it is an estimate of the price a buyer would be willing to pay and a seller would be willing to accept at a given time based upon market conditions.
an appraisal is performed in the usual course and scope of the loan process to protect the lender interest to determine if the property provides adequate security for the loan.since the appraisal is a value opinion performed for the benefit of the lender,there is no representation of fact upon which a buyer may reasonably rely.while it is foreseeable the appraisal might be considered by plaintiff in completing the loan transaction,the foreseeabilty of harm is remote.plaintiff is in as good a position as defendant to know the value and condition of the property.one who seeks financing to purchase real property has many means available to assess the property value and condition,including comparable sales,advice from a realtor,independent appraisal,contractors inspections,personal observation and opinion and the like stated another way,the borrower should be expected to know that the appraisal is intended for the lender benefit to assist it in determining whether to make the loan,and not for the purpose of ensuring that the borrower has made a good bargain,not to insure the success of the investment.nymark heart fed.savings loan d.
similarly,graham does not allege actionable misrepresentations based on allegations the defendants told him the loan was good for him or the market would increase and allow him to turn it for a profit.such statements are merely opinions or predictions about future events,they are not factual representations.
predictions about a buyer real estate investment or the fair market value for property in the future are not actionable misrepresentations.it is hornbook law that an actionable misrepresentation must be made about past or existing facts statements regarding future events are merely deemed opinions.neu visions,supra,th at.a bsent special circumstances a loan transaction is at arm length and there is no fiduciary relationship between the borrower and lender.citations.citation.a commercial lender pursues its own economic interests in lending money.perlas,supra,th at.a loan agreement does not require the lender to protect the success of a borrower investment.nymark heart fed.savings loan,supra,d at.a borrower must rely on his or her own judgment and risk assessment to decide whether to accept a loan.perlas,at.
graham actually alleges he did not rely on representations regarding a quick increase in value or that he could turn a profit because he had no intention of selling or flipping the home.instead,he intended to keep the home for a long time.further,graham alleges publically available information existed from and through when he entered into the transaction,which debated the stability of the housing industry.therefore,the court correctly determined graham does not allege either actionable fraud or reasonable reliance on defendants alleged opinions or predictions.
finally,even if we were to find an actionable representation or omission,graham does not allege the necessary element of causation.for active misrepresentation,a plaintiff must plead and prove reliance on the representation was a substantial factor in causing harm to the plaintiff.perlas,supra,th at.for fraudulent concealment,the plaintiff must plead and prove he or she sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of fact.bank of america,supra,th at.graham does not make that showing here.
graham alleges the representations or omissions were made with an intent to defraud him by inducing him to finance his home with an arm loan,which could then be quickly marketed to wall street and its international investors and bring revenue to defendants.he also alleges the current value of his home is less than the appraised value,his damages include his initial contribution to consummate the loan and there is a clear and present prospect of losing the home to foreclosure.
however,graham does not allege a sufficient nexus between the alleged misrepresentations or concealment and his alleged economic harm.bank of america,supra,th at.in bank of america,the court observed,homeowners who did not obtain loans from defendants likewise suffered a decline in property values,a decline in their home equity,and reduced access to their home equity lines of credit.irrespective of whether a homeowner obtained a loan from defendants,or obtained a loan through another lender,or whether a homeowner owned his or her home free and clear,all suffered a loss of home equity due to the generalized decline in home values.ibid.
similarly here,the damages graham alleges he incurred are the result of a decline in the overall market.he alleges the market rate at the time of his loan was artificially inflated.he does not allege he could have or would have obtained a better loan from a different lender absent the alleged representations regarding the appraisal.nor does he allege he would not have entered the market absent the alleged representations or omissions.he received the benefit of his bargain by obtaining a loan to purchase his home.an initial contribution and fees would have been necessary to obtain any loan at the time.the risk of property loss from foreclosure is the result of graham default on the loan,not the alleged conduct by defendants.therefore,graham has not sufficiently pleaded a causal connection between any damages and any actionable conduct by the defendants in entering into the loan agreement.
graham does not state a cause of action for violation of the california unfair competition lawa 
the california unfair competition law defines ucl unfair competition as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.zhang superior court cal th.a ucl action is not an substitute for a tort or contract action.citation.instead,the act provides an equitable means through which both public prosecutors and private individuals can bring suit to prevent unfair business practices and restore money or property to victims of these practices t he overarching legislative concern was to provide a streamlined procedure for prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair competition.korea supply lockheed martin cal th.as a result,the remedies available to private individuals for violation of the ucl are limited to restitution and injunctive relief damages can not be recovered.id.at.
because the statute is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair competition acts or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.cel tech communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,cel tech.graham does not state a cause of action under any of the three varieties.
by proscribing any unlawful business act or practice citation,the ucl borrows rules set out in other laws and makes violations of those rules independently actionable.zhang superior court,supra,cal th at.a violation of another law is a predicate for stating a cause of action under the ucl unlawful prong.berryman merit property management,th.
in this case,the sac does not allege a violation of law to support a ucl claim.the trial court correctly determined the defendants can not be held liable for unlawful business practices where there is no violation of another law.scripps clinic superior court th.
instead,graham asserts in his opening brief the sac alleges sufficient facts that are capable of supporting a claim for unlawful business practices.for the first time on appeal,graham contends a mong the potential violations of law that could reasonably be found when the sac is interpreted in the light most favorable to appellant are violations of code of federal regulations part et.
when a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend the plaintiff may advance on appeal a new legal theory why the allegations of the complaint state a cause of action.dudley department of transportation th.however,the allegations here do not support a cause of action based on this new theory.neither the sac nor graham contentions on appeal demonstrate unlawful conduct.graham contends the application of highly speculative appraisal methods to justify the highest possible fmv for the property,rather than the most probable fmv did not conform with code of federal regulations parts g and.this argument acknowledges the appraisal was within the market value range,even if it fell on the high end of the range.further,the sac admits the appraisal used comparable sales,which is permitted by the regulations at best,the sac alleges the market itself was inflated,not that the appraisal violated the law.therefore,there is no basis for a ucl claim based on unlawful conduct.
graham opening brief contends the sac supports a claim for unfair business practices by claiming generally defendants engaged in the type of business practices that contributed to an artificial inflation of real estate values,defrauding homeowners,investors,and government officials,and ultimately leading to the collapse of the housing market.he also contends defendants used highly speculative appraisal methods to support unnecessarily large variable rate loan packages,luring consumers such as appellant,with low initial teaser rates that allowed for affordable monthly payments,promising that future refinancing will be available to avoid making increased monthly payments.
to support these conclusory charges,graham cites record references spanning more than pages of his page complaint.these block citations do not comply with california rules of court,rule a c and frustrate the court ability to evaluate the party position.nazari ayrapetyan th,fn.
with no record references,graham generally contends,after consumers realize substantial negative equity,payments increase beyond a sustainable debt to income ratio and consumers are forced to exhaust whatever savings they may have in order to satisfy their obligations to financial institutions in hopes of avoiding foreclosure while the defendants earn a windfall by cash payments,seizure of the property secured by the loans,and compensation from government guarantees when the buyer finally defaults on the loan.we disregard these contentions as not adequately supported by the record.liberty national enterprises,chicago title ins.th.
even overlooking these briefing irregularities,the sac does not support a claim for unfair business practices.the standard for determining what business acts or practices are unfair under the ucl for consumer actions remains unsettled.zhang superior court cal th,fn.in cel tech,the supreme court addressed the term unfair in the context of actions between competitors alleging practices,but it broadly criticized previous attempts to define unfair as too amorphous to provide guidance.cel tech,supra,cal th at.previously,courts defined unfair as a practice that offends public policy or is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers or required courts to weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.ibid.
the cel tech court concluded it must require that any finding of unfairness to competitors under section be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition and,in actions challenging a direct competitor unfair act,defined the term as conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.cel tech,supra,cal th at.
thereafter,the appellate courts split regarding the definition of unfair business practices in consumer action.we described this split in the case of in re ins.installment fee cases th,
one line of cases applied a balancing test for determining whether a business practice is unfair,under which the court examines the practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.a n unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th.
a second line of cases adopted the following test or factors for determining unfairness set forth in section of the federal trade commission act n t he consumer injury must be substantial the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.camacho automobile club of southern california th.
a third line of cases,represented by gregory albertson,th gregory,applied a more rigorous test for unfairness in consumer ucl actions.the gregory court disagreed with the balancing test applied by courts before cel tech,stating cel tech may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in all unfair competition actions and provides reason for caution in relying on the broad language in earlier decisions that the cel tech court found to be too amorphous.moreover,where a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy,we read cel tech to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.
this court has consistently followed the gregory,supra,th line of cases and has held a plaintiff alleging an unfair business practice must show the defendant conduct is tethered to an underlying constitutional,statutory or regulatory provision,or that it threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of an antitrust law.wilson hynek th,quoting durell sharp healthcare th.
without acknowledging these authorities,graham relies on the definition of unfair by asserting the utility of the defendant conduct must be weighed against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.we decline graham invitation to apply this test.
graham does not allege the defendants conduct related to his loan processing was unfair because he does not allege any statements about the appraisal or opinions about the possible future value of the home constitute conduct tethered to a violation of a constitutional,statutory or regulatory provision.wilson hynek,supra,th at.
the fraud prong of the ucl may be shown if members of the public are likely to be deceived.buller sutter health th.however,a bsent a duty to disclose,the failure to do so does not support a claim under the fraudulent prong of the ucl.id.at.additionally,the ucl imposes an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs prosecuting a private enforcement action under the ucl fraud prong.in re tobacco ii cases cal th.in other words,the plaintiff must allege he or she was motivated to act or refrain from action based on the truth or falsity of a defendant statement,not merely on the fact it was made.kwikset superior court cal th,fn.
graham allegations are based on the appraisal and his claim that defendants failed to disclose the speculative nature of the appraisal.for the reasons stated in part,ante,we conclude the defendants did not owe graham a duty to disclose related to the appraisal,which was undertaken for the benefit of the lender,or to guarantee the success of graham investment.therefore,he does not adequately state a claim for a fraudulent business practice under the ucl.levine blue shield of california th.
finally,even if we were to assume the defendants actions violated one of the ucl unfair competition prongs,graham does not allege facts demonstrating he has standing to sue under the ucl because he does not allege sufficient facts showing a causal link between the alleged ucl violations and an injury in fact resulting in loss of money or property.kwikset superior court cal th,plaintiff required to show causal connection between economic injury and alleged ucl violation.
as discussed in part,ante,graham alleges his property value declined as a result of an overall decline in the market he does not allege a correlation between his property value decline and defendants alleged conduct related to the appraisal value.he does not allege he would not have incurred loan origination contribution costs or fees had he borrowed from another lender.finally,his prospect of losing the home to foreclosure is the result of default,not the alleged conduct of defendants.jenkins jpmorgan chase bank,th,nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings triggered by default are not economic injury caused by ucl violations daro superior court th,causation requirement of ucl not met if plaintiff would have suffered the same harm whether or not a defendant complied with the law.
graham is not entitled to declaratory relief 
graham contends on appeal he is entitled to a declaration of rights on two grounds whether the defendants have complied with their obligations under the national mortgage settlement and asking the court to order defendants to refinance the property with a fully amortized year,or more,fixed interest rate loan in an amount that reflects the current,fair,and true market value of the real property,and whether the note and deed are not enforceable because the loan agreement was unconscionable.
declaratory relief is available to a ny person interested under a written instrument who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties wi
