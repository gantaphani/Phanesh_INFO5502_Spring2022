in this prosecution for bank fraud,mail fraud,and money laundering,michael arlan sprick appeals the jury verdict of guilty on one of six bank fraud counts,six of six mail fraud counts,and seven money laundering related to the bank fraud count of conviction and six related to the mail fraud counts of conviction.he contends that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his convictions for the one count of bank fraud under and one related count of money laundering under,as well as the six counts of mail fraud under and six related counts of money laundering.he also asserts that the district court erred in admitting evidence of a failed transmission,in violation of federal rule of evidence,and adopting the probation department finding that the amount of money laundered exceeded.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the failed transmission and did not commit clear error in adopting the probation department finding that the amount laundered exceeded.viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,as we must,we find that the evidence was sufficient to support that verdict as to all charges against sprick except the one count of bank fraud and the one count of money laundering related to the bank fraud.therefore,we affirm in part and reverse in part sprick convictions based on the jury verdict,and we affirm the rulings of the district court contested by sprick.
facts and proceedings 
in the,sprick went into business as a financial advisor.his principal clients were three elderly widows maurita johnson,who entrusted him with corrine parker,who entrusted him with and annie hallford,who entrusted him with.each entrusted funds to sprick in the expectation that he would manage them for her benefit.to each victim it was a given that sprick would not spend her funds to support his lavish lifestyle or otherwise for his personal benefit.yet sprick did just that,spending his investors money on,among other things,a luxurious personal residence in odessa,texas.
at the time of trial,johnson was an widow who had suffered for many years from macular degeneration,an eye disease that causes progressive blindness.because of her advancing age and deteriorating eyesight,johnson accountant counseled her to engage a financial advisor to manage her money.as johnson was a friend of sprick grandmother,he was eventually able to persuade her to entrust her life savings of roughly to him.she later entrusted another to him.according to johnson,she understood that sprick was to manage her money for her benefit at all times in fact,she instructed sprick to invest only in blue chip stocks.
johnson eyesight continued to deteriorate,so she signed a power of attorney that gave sprick authority to deal directly with her funds.she understood that he would do so only for the limited purposes of handling her investments,paying her bills,and eventually taking care of her funeral and burial.johnson did not read the power of attorney,even though she had the ability to do so,relying instead on sprick description of its contents.sprick also informed johnson that she would not have to pay him any commissions out of her money.don copeland,a special agent with the internal revenue service irs testified that nothing in the power of attorney gave sprick the right to spend johnson money on himself.
sprick placed johnson funds in an account with fidelity brokerage fidelity and set up an annuity contract for her with usg annuity life company usg.sprick listed the address for the usg contract as box,odessa,texas,which he had obtained in one of his doing business as names,southwest senior services.he also designated that entity as the beneficiary of the usg contract.in opening the annuity account with usg,sprick listed his own mailing address as box,odessa.because the numbers of the two post office boxes were different,no red flags were raised in the eyes of usg.two deposits totaling were made into the usg account in the spring of.in,two withdrawal requests were purportedly made by johnson,and two checks payable to for and the other for mailed by usg to the southwest senior services address,box,in odessa.
parker was years old at the time of trial and testified by way of a video deposition.she signed a power of attorney naming sprick as her agent,understanding that he would spend her money for her benefit only and not for his.over the course of their business relationship,sprick mailed a number of account statements to parker,reflecting that she had invested more than with him,of it with fidelity brokerage.he informed parker that his services would cost her nothing and that all commissions would come from the brokers.in all,she invested with sprick.
parker nephew,james standefer,became suspicious when sprick refused to discuss parker financial condition and when standefer learned that sprick had invested some of parker money in a,low interest annuity that would not become payable until she was years old and that charged a substantial penalty for early withdrawals.as a result,standefer had parker withdraw the power of attorney that she had given to sprick.when standefer threatened to report sprick activities to the district attorney,sprick replied i speculated and it did work out and i may do time for this 
after standefer subsequently demanded the return of his aunt remaining balance of,sprick wrote a check from his business account with bluebonnet savings bank bluebonnet this check initially bounced.sprick then made an early withdrawal of funds from johnson usg annuity account,incurring a substantial penalty.he did not inform johnson that he was withdrawing cash from this annuity,instead signing her name without her knowledge.after sprick deposited of johnson proceeds into his own account in bluebonnet,that bank called parker to inform her that the check would clear.irs agent copeland testified that sprick financial records made it clear that he sent numerous financial statements containing false investment information regarding the fidelity brokerage account to johnson and parker.
annie hallford is the grandmother of sprick.hallford invested with sprick in while he was still married to her granddaughter but did not grant him a power of attorney.she understood that sprick would invest her money for her benefit and would not spend it on himself.hallford did not give sprick permission to spend of her money in or in,as he did.these amounts represent two annuities that sprick had purchased in hallford name with guarantee reassurance company guarantee.in,a check for was mailed from guarantee to box in odessa,an address registered to sprick.in,a request to withdraw from hallford annuity contract was sent to guarantee in jacksonville,florida via federal express from another of sprick business names,southwest financial services,listing its address as amethyst cove,odessa,texas,which was sprick home address at the time.the annuity contract nowhere specified that sprick could receive checks on behalf of hallford.when the check was received,both hallford and sprick endorsed it.following sprick divorce from her granddaughter,hallford requested the return of her funds and received a check from sprick,doing business as southwest senior services,for.
the evidence reflects that sprick never opened investment accounts in the names of either johnson or parker.a document that appeared to be a contract between johnson and fidelity was found during the search of sprick home,but it was determined to be a sham.on the other hand,sprick did have an account with fidelity in the name of southwest financial services.parker three checks made out to for,another for,and a third for deposited into sprick account,on which no interest of either parker or johnson was reflected.
sprick opened a bank account at bluebonnet in in the name of southwest senior services by depositing a check from his southwest financial services account at fidelity.he then deposited into his bluebonnet account the proceeds of a certificate of deposit belonging to johnson,as well as a check belonging to her.the funds in this account were used by sprick to pay his own debts and to make investments in his own name.for example,in the spring of sprick took more than from johnson and of her money that he had run through his bluebonnet account and deposited all of it into his own fidelity account.later that year,he transferred of these funds to his personal bluebonnet account and,on the same day,wrote a check from this account to pay for lots at amethyst cove,where he would subsequently build his house.in may,sprick wrote a check for of johnson through his fidelity account and into his bluebonnet make a down payment on his house.sprick also withdrew from an annuity in johnson name and deposited that money into his bluebonnet account,using it to refund to hallford.
the government was able to trace other deposits of funds belonging to these three women directly to sprick accounts and from there to expenditures that he made for himself.irs agent copeland testified that,based on the income reported on sprick tax returns and other financial records from,he could not have afforded his new house,new furniture,expensive trips,or personal investments,such as his purchase of a business corporation called the eastland corporation,without spending funds of these three victims.
sprick accountant testified that sprick had been evasive when discussing his ability to afford a house in.in preparing sprick tax return,his accountant noticed that sprick expenses greatly exceeded his income,and when the accountant questioned this,sprick explained that he did a lot more playing than working that year.
during a search of sprick home,the contents of his computer were examined and a failed transmission was discovered.that was addressed to a radio personality known as delilah,but it was returned as undeliverable because the wrong destination had been used.over defense counsel objection grounded in federal rule of evidence,the failed was admitted into evidence.its message was 
i was successful in business earning in excess of per year,but that never seemed good enough for her i built one of the biggest houses in odessa for her.she wanted for nothing in material matters i am in the financial services industry and deal with large amounts of money.i misappropriated,or as another listener of your show mentioned the same earlier,and you straightened him out to admit stole,a large amount of money.nobody was hurt because of their resources,but that does not excuse,and i am not trying to justify my actions,what and why i did what i did.
delilah,today my attorney got a fax from the assistant attorney general of the united states.they are wanting me to admit what i did and face years in a federal prison.i know i am guilty.i did a wrong thing because of the right reason love.
this message was presented to the jury several times,including once when the entire was read aloud and again when only a portion,reproduced on a large illustration,was placed within the jury view.the trial judge issued a cautionary instruction,stating in relevant part that it is pretty clear that this was written at a time when the government was only considering charges of bank fraud.it was not written at a time when the government was considering a mail fraud charge.
the government contends that sprick defrauded johnson of,parker of,and hallford of,conceding that parker and hallford were repaid by sprick with money from johnson account.irs agent copeland testified that,because sprick commingled his legitimate income with funds fraudulently obtained from these victims,an exact tracing of the funds was not possible.
a federal grand jury initially indicted sprick on six counts of bank fraud and six related counts of money laundering,and subsequently indicted him on six counts of mail fraud and six related counts of money laundering.these charges were consolidated on motion of the government.on the completion of a trial,the jury convicted sprick of only one count of bank fraud and one related charge of money laundering from among the six bank fraud and six related money laundering charges in the initial indictment and convicted him of all six counts of mail fraud and all related money laundering charges in the subsequent indictment.the court sentenced sprick to months on the bank fraud conviction and on the related money laundering conviction,to run concurrently.the court then sentenced sprick to months on the six mail fraud convictions,and months on the six money laundering convictions related to mail fraud,to run concurrently with each other and with the bank money laundering sentences.sprick was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of.
analysisa.standard of review 
in reviewing challenges to sufficiency of the evidence,we ask whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.we resolve all credibility determinations and reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict we review evidentiary rulings,including determinations under federal rule of evidence,for abuse of discretion we examine the district court interpretation or application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its findings for clear error.
bank fraud 
sprick was convicted of obtaining moneys,under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of fraudulent pretense,representations,or promises.he contends that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to support the jury guilty verdict as to the charge of bank fraud,pursuant to sprick argues that,as a matter of law,the bank that he was charged with defrauding,bluebonnet,could not have been civilly liable to anyone as a result of his conduct.he contends that under such circumstances the requirements of,as interpreted by this court,have not been met under our precedent,for the prosecution to prove that the offense of bank fraud has been committed,it must show not only that the money or assets in the custody or control of a financial institution were obtained by means of fraud but also that doing so placed the financial institution at risk of civil liability 
when parker nephew threatened to report sprick to the authorities,he wrote a check to parker from his bluebonnet account.when that check bounced,sprick withdrew from an annuity of johnson,signing her name without her knowledge or permission and incurring a penalty in the process.at the time,sprick had a power of attorney from johnson which explicitly covered the annuity in question,so he did have legal authority to sign her name and withdraw the money.he did not,though,have any right or authority to use those funds for his own purposes or benefit.nevertheless,a few days after his check to parker had bounced,sprick deposited the check from johnson annuity account into his bluebonnet account,endorsing it maurita johnson to whom it was payable.bluebonnet then called parker and informed her that there were sufficient funds in sprick account to cover the check he had made payable to her,the one that had bounced.
the government contends that,under those facts,bluebonnet could have been civilly liable to johnson for its failure to prevent sprick from misusing her funds.the government contends that a defense expert,whom the government questioned as a hostile witness,conceded that bluebonnet could be civilly liable under the instant circumstances.we disagree all that the expert conceded,after repeated questioning by the government,was that anything possible.
we can not credit that testimony alone as probative of the government argument that bluebonnet could have been liable to johnson.the government presented no other evidence and referred us to no legal authority demonstrating that a bank could be civilly liable by acting as bluebonnet did in this instance.we express no opinion on whether the bank would have civil liability in these circumstances it is sufficient that the government provided no basis at trial or on appeal for concluding that the bank could have such liability.it follows under our jurisprudence that sprick could not be guilty of bank fraud under.
mail fraud 
sprick contends that there is insufficient evidence to support his convict
