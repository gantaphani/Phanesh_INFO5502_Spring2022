the plaintiffs,joseph carabetta and a group of companies associated with him,are the owners and managers of properties that have provided rental housing under several programs sponsored by the department of housing and urban development hud.based on a dispute with hud,the plaintiffs,which we refer to collectively as carabetta,brought a breach of contract action against the united states in the court of federal claims.on for summary judgment,the court held the united states liable for breach of contract.the court then conducted a trial on damages and entered an award.the government appeals from the trial court liability determination,and carabetta with respect to the damages award.we affirm as to both the liability appeal and the damages.
during the and,the plaintiffs acquired a number of housing properties using mortgages insured by the federal government under sections d and of the national housing act,pub,stat,as amended by pub,stat,and pub,stat.deeds insured under that program gave the owners the option of paying off the mortgages early,once years had passed since the mortgage was issued.
as the mortgage program neared its anniversary,congress became concerned that owners of properties insured under the program would pay off their mortgages and,freed of the mortgage restrictions,would convert the properties from housing to more profitable rental units.accordingly,congress passed the emergency low income housing preservation act of elihpa,pub,stat,and the housing preservation and resident homeownership act of lihprha,pub,stat.both statutes prohibited owners from prepaying section d mortgages without approval from hud.the statutes instead authorized hud to guarantee private loans on the properties in amounts up to percent of the equity in the properties plus any approved rehabilitation costs.as a condition of granting such a guarantee,hud was required to ensure that the properties would continue to operate as housing and that the property owners satisfied certain other requirements.one of the requirements was that property owners had to be in compliance with all applicable hud regulations governing the condition of the properties.a.the loans that hud guaranteed were known as section f equity loans because the guarantees were authorized under section f of the national housing act,as amended by elihpa,stat.at.
when carabetta applied for section f equity loans on its properties,hud refused to process the necessary paperwork on the ground that carabetta was not in compliance with certain hud regulations.carabetta and hud resolved that issue in august when they executed what they termed a repayment agreement.the repayment agreement provided that hud would insure loans on eight of carabetta properties.carabetta would then use million of the loan proceeds to bring itself into compliance with hud regulations.both hud and carabetta fulfilled their obligations under that portion of the agreement in.
the repayment agreement further provided that once carabetta brought itself into compliance with the hud regulations,hud would insure loans on all the carabetta properties listed on schedule d of the agreement,so long as those properties met the other eligibility requirements.schedule d listed properties the parties agree were to be insured under this provision.another property was inadvertently omitted from schedule d,but the parties have agreed to treat that property as if it had been included.accordingly,the parties agree that there were at least properties for which hud promised to insure loans.carabetta additionally contends that hud was obligated to insure a loan for a property,southford park,which was listed on schedule d under the designation subject to appeal.
while carabetta was waiting for hud to process the loan paperwork on the schedule d properties,congress enacted the department of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act,appropriations act,pub,stat.among other things,that statute repealed section f of the national housing act,thus prohibiting hud from insuring any more section f equity loans.stat.at.instead,the statute authorized hud to issue million in capital loans directly to properties in three enumerated categories,the first of which included the carabetta properties the statute gave hud discretion regarding how to distribute the million among the three groups of properties,but it limited the amount of each loan to percent of the equity in the property plus any approved rehabilitation costs.
pursuant to the authorization provided by the appropriations act,hud chose to issue a total of million in direct loans to seven of carabetta schedule d properties.it used the remaining million to fund loans to properties falling in the other two categories.the government acknowledges that it had no contractual duty to fund any of the properties in the other two categories.
when hud failed to provide capital loans for the other carabetta properties listed on schedule d of the repayment agreement,carabetta brought suit against the government in the court of federal claims.it claimed that hud had breached the repayment agreement and that hud was obliged to use what was needed from the remaining million of the appropriations act funds to provide capital loans to an additional schedule d properties.those properties included southford park but excluded five properties that did not qualify for loans under hud regulations.the government argued that the appropriations act made performance of its obligations impossible and that the sovereign acts doctrine excused the government from liability.in an opinion issued in response to for summary judgment on liability,the court of federal claims agreed with the government that the appropriations act was a sovereign act.the court found,however,that hud offer of capital loans for the seven funded carabetta properties constituted an offer to modify the repayment agreement by substituting capital loans for the section f loans.according to the court,carabetta accepted that offer when it accepted the loans on the first seven properties.hud failure to fund the loans on the remaining schedule d properties,the court concluded,was a breach of the modified repayment agreement.
the court of federal claims then conducted a trial on damages.following that trial,the court denied carabetta request that damages be calculated to include three contested categories a tax on the proceeds of the capital loans that should have been issued additional damages attributable to the rehabilitation loans for the schedule d properties and damages attributable to the loan that carabetta contends should have been issued for the southford park property,which the court did not include among the properties as to which hud was obligated to make loans.the government appeals the liability determination,and carabetta the court ruling on those damages issues.we affirm with respect to all issues.
the government argues that the trial court was correct insofar as it concluded that the appropriations act constituted a sovereign act that shielded hud from liability for breach of the original,unmodified contract.the government contends,however,that the trial court erred when it found that the parties agreed to a modification of the repayment agreement,which the government breached.because we hold that the government is liable under the original,unmodified repayment agreement,we do not address the arguments relating to whether that contract was modified and,as modified,was breached.
the sovereign acts doctrine is designed to balance the government need for freedom to legislate with its obligation to honor its contracts.united states winstar,d.it holds that the united states when sued as a contractor can not be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of a particular contract resulting from its public and general acts as a sovereign.id.at.quoting horowitz united states.accordingly,the sovereign acts doctrine exempts the g overnment as contractor from the traditional blanket rule that a contracting party may not obtain discharge if its own act rendered performance impossible.winstar,at.yet even if the sovereign acts doctrine applies,it does not follow that discharge will always be available,for the doctrine of impossibility imposes additional requirements before a party may avoid liability for breach.id.
one such requirement is embodied in the doctrine of partial impossibility or partial impracticability.according to the restatement of contracts,w here only part of an obligor performance is impracticable,his duty to render the remaining part is unaffected if it is still practicable for him to render performance that is substantial,taking account of any reasonable substitute performance that he is under a duty to render.restatement second of contracts yost council bluffs,iowa heinrich oil gas,allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts.comment b to section of the restatement states that if the obligor can render a reasonable substitute performance in place of the impracticable part,he must do so under his duty of good faith in performance,and that substitute performance will be considered in determining whether his performance would be substantial.restatement second of contracts,cmt.b internal omitted spalding son,united states,heinrich,at farnsworth.in other words,if the obligor is able to render reasonable substitute performance for what has become impossible,and that performance would substantially fulfill the contract requirements,the obligor has a duty to render that substantial performance.whether the aggregate performance would be considered substantial depends on the expectations of the obligee.restatement second of contracts,cmt.
the appropriations act made it impossible for hud to insure any of the section f loans for carabetta schedule d properties.however,the act simultaneously provided hud with the authority and capacity to render reasonable substitute performance it gave hud discretion to issue million in capital loans to carabetta and others.carabetta made clear that it would consider such loans to be substantial performance under the repayment agreement it accepted capital loans for seven of its properties and contended that the repayment agreement obligated the government to provide capital loans for the remaining qualifying schedule d properties.accordingly,even if the appropriations act was a sovereign act,hud was still obligated to fulfill its obligations under the repayment agreement through the substitute performance of providing direct loans to carabetta qualifying schedule d properties to the extent authorized under the appropriations act.
the government argues that capital loans are markedly different from section f equity loans.it points out that the new loans were direct loans instead of simply insured loans,that the size of each loan was reduced,and that the recipients were required to satisfy additional requirements to qualify for capital loans.those differences are insufficient to make capital loans ineligible to serve as substitute performance for the promised section f equity loans.any decrease in the amount of the loan or increase in the qualification requirements only benefits the government by lowering its potential liabilities.since carabetta was prepared to accept the capital loans in place of hud promised performance,only an additional burden on hud sufficient to make providing capital loans to carabetta unreasonable would make the capital loans an inappropriate substitute for the section f equity loans.the only additional burden the government points to is the fact that issuing capital loans required hud to make direct monetary outlays instead of just insuring private loans.at best,that argument is only an assertion that substituting direct capital loans for the section f loans made its performance more costly.hud does not suggest that it lacked the capacity or legal authority to provide capital loans for the schedule d properties in dispute.indeed,hud admits that it had no obligation to provide loans to any property and that it had discretion to divide the million in capital loans in any way it saw fit.accordingly,while providing capital loans for the disputed schedule d properties may have made performance more expensive than it would have been absent the statutory change,hud has not met its burden of showing that providing capital loans was unreasonable as a form of substitute performance.because hud was obligated to provide capital loans as substitute performance but failed to do so,we affirm the trial court grant of summary judgment of liability on that ground.
on,carabetta argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it denied expectation damages for a tax on the damages amount corresponding to the loans carabetta would have received,the repair and rehabilitation loans carabetta would have received had it been granted the capital loans,and the loan allegedly owed to southford park,the property whose inclusion on schedule d was designated as being subject to appeal.we hold that the trial court was correct to reject each of those damages claims.
the parties agree that the capital loans carabetta would have received absent the breach would have been,but that the damages award it will now receive is taxable.carabetta argues that in light of the differing tax treatment accorded to funds that would have been obtained through actual performance and to the funds that will be obtained pursuant to a damages award,it is entitled to an increase in the amount of the award to offset the taxes it will be required to pay.
while it is true that a tax is appropriate when a taxable award compensates a plaintiff for lost monies that would not have been taxable,home sav.of am.united states,that is not the case here because carabetta is not being compensated for the loss of untaxable funds.the measure of carabetta expectation damages is the amount it would have gained from receiving the capital loans.because carabetta would have had to repay the loans,the only benefit carabetta would have realized from each loan was the investment income earned on the principal minus any interest it would have been required to pay over the life of the loan.hud capital loans were,meaning that carabetta benefit would be measured by the total amount of the loan investment income.
carabetta method of measuring damages is actually consistent with the foregoing analysis.where carabetta argument for an additional tax on that amount goes awry is the point at which it assumes that its method results in a damages amount attributable to something other than interest earned on the loan principal.carabetta measured its expectation damages by starting with the amount of the loans it would have received under the contract,adjusting that amount to present value,and subtracting the amount it would have had to repay on the maturity date of the loans,adjusted to present value.because the capital loans would have been provided on an basis,the amount carabetta would have received under the contract is the same as the amount it would have had to repay.accordingly,the only difference between the two amounts is the adjustment to present value.since the adjustment to present value is a way of accounting for the estimated value of interest over time,carabetta damages model simply takes into account the amount of interest,in today dollars,that would accumulate over the life of the loan.that is another way of describing investment income.because,as carabetta admits,investment income from money is taxable,carabetta lost income would have been taxable and thus carabetta is not entitled to a tax 
carabetta next argues that it is entitled to damages corresponding to the capital loans it would have received to rehabilitate and repair the properties.when processing loan application paperwork,hud would identify and approve certain necessary repairs to the properties collateralizing the loans.the appropriations act provided that the capital loan granted to a property could include the amount needed to pay for those repairs.stat.at limiting the amount of the loan to the cost of rehabilitation plus percent of the property preservation equity.repair funds were placed in escrow accounts and disbursed only as the approved repairs were completed,so carab
