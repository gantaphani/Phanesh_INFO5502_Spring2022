this case involves allegations of a wrongful foreclosure and related causes of action.plaintiff john miles appeals from a judgment dismissing his breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation causes of action pursuant to a sustained demurrer,and a summary judgment in favor of defendants on the wrongful foreclosure cause of action.
with respect to the demurred causes of action,we reverse.in the record before us,the court did not offer any explanation for its ruling.based on our independent review of the complaint,we conclude plaintiff adequately stated his claims.
with respect to the wrongful foreclosure cause of action,we also reverse.the court granted summary judgment on the sole basis that plaintiff could not prove damages because he did not have any equity in the home when it was sold at a foreclosure sale.wrongful foreclosure is a tort,however,and thus plaintiff may recover any damages proximately caused by defendants wrongdoing.plaintiff offered evidence that he lost rental income and suffered emotional distress as a result of the foreclosure.this is disputed,of course,but it is sufficient to survive a summary judgment motion.
the demurrerfacts alleged in the first amended complaint 
plaintiff owned property in riverside.in july,plaintiff refinanced the loan on his property with a total loan amount of.this was an adjustable rate mortgage.the loan was serviced by defendant homeq servicing homeq.for the first months of the loan,plaintiff was current on his payments.during the period between june and september,the monthly payment on the loan increased first to per month,and then to per month.
in august,plaintiff applied for a loan modification to try making payments more affordable.in february,homeq informed plaintiff that he had to make a lump sum payment as a modification processing fee before plaintiff could see the terms of the proposed modification.plaintiff paid the fee.in march,homeq gave plaintiff a loan modification agreement,to which the parties agreed.under the terms of that agreement,plaintiff loan balance was increased to.the interest rate was fixed at percent the prior rate was percent,and the monthly payment would be.plaintiff made a payment under that agreement but the next month homeq stated they would no longer honor the terms of that agreement.instead,homeq sent a new agreement that increased the loan balance to.it offered no explanation for the change.
plaintiff believed the march agreement was valid,and thus he made payments to homeq under that agreement for march,april,and june of,totaling.in june,homeq sent plaintiff yet another loan modification agreement,this time raising the balance to,again without explanation.
in july,homeq sent correspondence to plaintiff demanding a payment of to process a new loan modification.homeq then began refusing plaintiff payments under the march agreement,requiring that he pay per month instead.when plaintiff insisted on the terms of the march agreement,homeq recorded a notice of default and election to sell the property.in october,homeq recorded a notice of trustee sale of the property with a sale date of november.
homeq then informed plaintiff it would give him a new modification if he would send a payment of.in light of the looming sale date,plaintiff complied.instead of sending a loan modification agreement,however,homeq sent a forebearance agreement and demanded a payment of before it would send a modification agreement.
plaintiff continued trying to work with homeq until february,when homeq sent another loan modification agreement,this time asking for an upfront payment of.having paid over a month period for modifications that never materialized,plaintiff had no faith that any further payments would have any better result so he declined to make the requested payment.
defendants set a sale date for plaintiff house of march.on march,plaintiff obtained a temporary restraining order against the sale of his house from the riverside county superior court.plaintiff alleges on information and belief that defendants had notice of the order.nonetheless,defendants proceeded with the sale on march,and dispossessed plaintiff.
procedural history 
plaintiff filed suit against defendants deutsche bank national trust company,the purported owner of the loan,and homeq servicing,which serviced the loan defendants demurred to plaintiff first amended complaint,and the court sustained the demurrer as to the causes of action for breach of contract,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation the court did not give any indication of the basis of its ruling,and we were not provided a record of the hearing.the court gave plaintiff days leave to amend,which plaintiff chose not to do.
defendants then moved for summary judgment on the lone remaining cause of action for wrongful foreclosure,which the court granted the facts and procedural history pertinent to the summary judgment motion will be discussed below.plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.aubry tri city hospital dist.cal th.
we begin by quickly dispensing with an argument that runs throughout respondents brief plaintiff fraud,breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation causes of action were not sustained without leave to amend,they were sustained with days leave to amend.plaintiff chose to not file a timely amended complaint pursuant to the trial court order and therefore voluntarily abandoned those causes of action.plaintiff can not appeal his decision not to pursue the other causes of action.defendants cite no authority for this remarkable proposition,and it would be an absurd rule indeed.if a plaintiff had already stated all available facts,but was given an opportunity to amend,how could forfeiture be avoided under defendants rule by making up facts that is not the law.even if given an opportunity to amend,a plaintiff may stand on the sufficiency of the complaint.county of santa clara atlantic richfield th,w hen a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend,and the plaintiff chooses not to amend but to stand on the complaint,an appeal from the ensuing dismissal order may challenge the validity of the intermediate ruling sustaining the demurrer.there was no forfeiture.
next,defendants contend the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action was properly sustained because the complaint does not allege whether the contract was in writing,oral or implied.see code civ,subd.g complaint demurrable if,i n an action founded upon a contract,it can not be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written,is oral,or is implied by conduct.this is a purely technical argument,as defendants summary judgment motion demonstrates they knew which contract was at issue,were in possession of it,and thus knew it was in writing.the problem with this purely technical argument is that defendants did not comply with their own technicalities.defendants demurrer did not mention code of civil procedure section,subdivision g.instead,the demurrer simply stated,plaintiff third cause of action for breach of contract does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against defendants.civ.proc.e and f.we will not uphold a demurrer on a technicality not asserted in the trial court.further,as noted above,plaintiff alleged that in march,homeq gave plaintiff a loan modification agreement,to which the parties agreed.and specific terms of that agreement are alleged,such as the balance of the loan,the interest rate,and the required monthly payments.a reasonable inference drawn from those allegations is that the contract plaintiff relies upon,the march modification agreement,was in writing.
defendants only remaining argument in support of the dismissal of the breach of contract cause of action is that plaintiff failed to attach the contract or to plead its terms verbatim.in support of that argument,defendants cite otworth southern pac.transportation d,otworth,which stated,if the action is based on an alleged breach of a written contract,the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must be attached and incorporated by reference.the otworth court did not offer any analysis to support that proposition.instead,it simply cited wise southern pacific d,wise overruled on other grounds in applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th.the wise court stated,where a written instrument is the foundation of a cause of action,it may be pleaded in haec verba by attaching a copy as an exhibit and incorporating it by proper reference.wise,at.it is readily apparent that the otworth court read more into that statement than is actually there.the wise court was simply stating one available method of pleading the contract it was not specifying the exclusive means of pleading a contract.the correct rule is that a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.construction protective services,tig specialty ins.cal th.because it is apparent that the otworth court misread wise,and because,in any event,we are bound by our supreme court,we decline to follow otworth.accordingly,plaintiff failure either to attach or to set out verbatim the terms of the contract was not fatal to his breach of contract cause of action.
aside from these arguments,it appears that plaintiff alleged the basic elements of a breach of contract claim.a cause of action for breach of contract requires proof of the following elements existence of the contract plaintiff performance or excuse for nonperformance defendant breach and damages to plaintiff as a result of the breach.cdf firefighters maldonado th.plaintiff alleged an express contract to refinance his loan,including the loan balance,the interest rate,and the monthly payment.he alleged he performed by making payments under the agreement.he alleged defendants breached that contract by repudiating it and refusing to accept payments under it.and he alleged he was damaged by various fees he was charged and by being evicted from his home.accordingly,we reverse the dismissal of plaintiff breach of contract claim.
defendants offer two arguments in support of the dismissal of the fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action.first,they contend a misrepresentation cause of action does not lie where the misrepresentation pertains to future events the reason for this requirement is obvious it is not possible to determine whether someone making a representation did so with knowledge,or reckless disregard,of the truth of the alleged representation if the representation was not made at a time in which it was known to be true or false.therefore,the alleged promise to modify the plaintiff loan can not form the basis of a fraud or misrepresentation claim,because the plaintiff can not allege that the person making such a representation knew it to be true or false,as it concerned a future event.defendants later concede,however,the only circumstances under which a future promise may form the basis of a fraud claim is where the plaintiff can allege facts that the promisor made a promise with no intent of performing.indeed,the nature of promissory fraud is that it is a promise of future performance with no present intent to actually perform.lazar superior court cal th.and this is precisely what plaintiff alleges.defendants induced plaintiff into entering into making payments of more than on the promise of providing plaintiff with a reasonable modification of the loan on the property.at the time that defendants made these representations,they knew them to be false as defendants had no intention of honoring their promise to provide plaintiff with a permanent loan modification but instead,intended to strip the plaintiff of all of his liquid assets and then proceed with foreclosure on plaintiff property.accordingly,the misrepresentation causes of action are not demurrable on the ground they involved a future event.
defendants second argument is that the misrepresentation allegations lack specificity.defendants rely on the rule that in alleging fraud against a corporation,the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,their authority to speak,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote,and when it was said or written.lazar superior court,supra,cal th at.we observe,however,certain exceptions which mitigate the rigor of the rule requiring specific pleading of fraud.less specificity is required when it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy,citation e ven under the strict rules of common law pleading,one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party citation.additionally,considerations of practicality enter in.committee on children television,general foods cal d,superseded by statute on other grounds in branick downey savings loan cal th.
plaintiff alleges defendants induced him to make over in payments based on the false promise that they would provide a reasonable modification of the loan.the alleged facts in support are that homeq initially agreed to the march contract but then reneged on it and on various particular dates sent more agreements and demanded more fees.the primary omission in the allegations is that plaintiff does not identify the names of the people he spoke to nor their authority to speak.in our view,this omission falls comfortably in the realm of information that lies more in the possession of defendants.see boschma home loan center,th,while the precise identities of the employees responsible are not specified in the loan instrument,defendants possess the superior knowledge of who was responsible for crafting these loan documents.defendants admitted in the summary judgment motion,for example,that they possessed a comment log of the phone calls plaintiff had made to homeq.such evidence is easily foreseeable at the demurrer stage.further,as revealed by attachments to the complaint,some of the communications from homeq were in the form of letters that were simply signed by homeq servicing.finally,in an era of electronic signing,it is often unrealistic to expect plaintiffs to know the authority when mortgage servicers themselves may not actually know the authority.accordingly,we do not consider that omission fatal.thus we will reverse the dismissal of the misrepresentation causes of action.
the summary judgment motionfacts 
on july,plaintiff obtained a mortgage loan and executed a promissory note and deed of trust in the amount of.the promissory note called for monthly interest only payments in the amount of from september to august.thereafter,plaintiff was obligated to pay principal and interest payments through the maturity of the loan.that loan was ultimately assigned to defendant deutsche bank national trust company and serviced by homeq.
in and plaintiff failed to pay his property taxes,so homeq advanced the funds for plaintiff and demanded repayment.in april there remained an escrow shortage of.homeq informed plaintiff that he needed to bring it current and that if he did not,his monthly payment would be increased to to cover the shortfall.plaintiff agreed to the increased monthly payment,which he made in may,june,july,august,and september of.in september,plaintiff submitted an application for a loan modification.plaintiff did not make payments in october or november plaintiff claims this was at homeq advice to help the modification process homeq denies this.he made a payment in december and january of the reason for the approximately shortfall is disputed.in february the proposed loan modification was ready for review.plaintiff claims,however,that homeq re
