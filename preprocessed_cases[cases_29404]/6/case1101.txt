two years later,the bank filed suit against the government in the united states claims court arguing that,as bianchi contract assignee,it should have been paid the million.the government,in turn,filed a claim against bianchi to recover the million it had paid him.on appeal,this court held that the bank,as bianchi contract assignee,was entitled be paid the amount awarded to bianchi under the settlement agreement.bank of am.trust sav.united states,bianchi i.the court further held that the sba security interests in the contracts were subordinate to the bank rights under the assignments,and that the assignment of claims act prohibited the government from setting off bianchi debts to the sba against the money owed to the bank.id.at.
with respect to the government complaint against bianchi,the court acknowledged that the terms of the settlement agreement barred the government from challenging its settlement with bianchi.accordingly,the court held that the government could not recover by way of a complaint the million it paid bianchi under paragraph one of the settlement agreement.id.at the government right to recoup erroneously paid funds can not be invoked by the government as a means to circumvent a legal obligation.
meanwhile,before the bank sued the government,bianchi pursued a claim for equal access to justice act eaja legal fees as permitted by paragraph three of the settlement agreement.in september,the asbca awarded bianchi in eaja fees.the government,however,refused to pay.as a result,bianchi filed a complaint in the nature of a writ of mandamus in the united states district court for the district of nevada seeking to compel payment.the case was eventually appealed to the ninth circuit.bianchi perry,cir bianchi ii.on appeal,the government argued that it was entitled to set off the mistaken payment to bianchi against the award of eaja legal fees.the ninth circuit disagreed,holding that the government could not attempt to recover the erroneously paid funds by way of a setoff against bianchi eaja award.id.at.

one of bianchi arguments on appeal to the ninth circuit was that this court holding in bianchi i established that he was entitled to recover the vecp i royalties under the terms of the settlement agreement regardless of whether the government also owed those royalties to the bank.the ninth circuit,however,held that the district court did not have jurisdiction to entertain this argument because it was,in essence,a breach of contract claim against the united contract being the settlement agreement.id.at because bianchi seeks damages totaling more than based on the settlement agreement,the complaint for a writ of mandamus should have been filed in the court of federal claims.
in december,the asbca awarded bianchi vecp royalties for a second of the original contracts in the amount of plus interest vecp ii royalties.in june,the government paid the bank plus interest from march.
