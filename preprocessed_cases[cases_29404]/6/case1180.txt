plaintiff brent hutton sued defendant fidelity national title company,the escrow company used in plaintiff refinance of his home loan,for allegedly charging a notary fee in excess of the amount permitted by government code section under that statute,a notary may charge only per signature for taking an acknowledgment.since only two acknowledgments were taken by the notary in connection with plaintiff loan refinance with only one signature notarized as to each acknowledgement,plaintiff asserted that defendant violated the statute by charging him for services performed by the notary based on the supposed overcharge for notary services,plaintiff complaint set forth causes of action for violation of california unfair competition law bus,et the ucl and unjust enrichment.the complaint was styled as a statewide,class action on behalf of plaintiff and all others who used defendant escrow services in real estate or loan refinance transactions and were allegedly overcharged for notary services.
after conducting discovery but before class certification,defendant moved for summary judgment on two principal grounds the fee was not a violation of section because that section only limited fees for certain services,taking acknowledgments and the notary involved in this case performed many other services,traveling to location of signing,presenting multiple documents for signature,showing where to sign or initial each document,answering questions,and the fee was charged and retained by a third party independent contractor,not by defendant,even though defendant as escrow holder disbursed the funds for such services.the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment on both grounds.plaintiff appeals from the resulting judgment.we find the first ground noted above to be dispositive and conclude on that basis that the trial court properly granted summary judgment plaintiff also appeals from the trial court postjudgment order granting an award of attorney fees to defendant pursuant to a contractual provision in the escrow instructions.plaintiff contends that said provision should not have been enforced because it was unconscionable.we agree with plaintiff on that issue and reverse the trial court order granting attorney fees.in all other respects,the judgment below is affirmed.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff complaint 
on february,plaintiff filed his complaint against defendant to obtain remedies for alleged violation of the ucl and unjust enrichment.according to the complaint,section made it unlawful for defendant to charge in excess of for each notarized signature on a deed or deed of trust.in providing escrow services in connection with plaintiff loan refinance,defendant allegedly billed a predetermined notary charge that exceeded the amount prescribed in section.that same practice by defendant allegedly resulted in other persons class members being overcharged by defendant for notary services in connection with other real estate or loan refinance transactions.the complaint explained further the law could not be simpler.california government code section sets a cap on notarization fees.under section,subdivision a,it is illegal to charge more than per notarized signature on each deed or deed of trust used in a specific real estate transaction.defendant charged more than per signature.thus,defendant violated the law.based on these core facts,plaintiff alleged a first cause of action labeled as unfair business practices elsewhere more specifically identified by plaintiff as a ucl cause of action and a second cause of action for unjust enrichment.both causes of action were explicitly premised upon defendant alleged overcharge for notary fees in violation of section.
defendant motion for summary judgment 
on december,defendant filed its motion for summary judgment.we have already summarized above the grounds upon which that motion was made.in support of the first ground for the motion,that section was not violated,defendant presented,among other evidence,the declaration of the individual notary who was involved in the document signing in this case namely,lauri kilpatrick kilpatrick.in her declaration,kilpatrick described a variety of services that she typically provided in connection with the signing of loan refinance documents in her capacity as a notary and a certified signing agent or csa.as a csa,she is familiar with the various documents necessary in the loan closing process and is able to answer questions.her declaration stated generally,during a loan closing,i will a present all of the loan documents to the borrower which generally consists of about to pages,b make all necessary disclosures required by those loan documents,c explain the purpose of each loan document,d answer any questions the borrower may have about the loan documents or the loan closing process in general,e indicate where the borrower must sign each loan document,and f take an acknowledgment of the borrower signature when necessary.i provided these services for hutton refinance closing.the majority of my loan signings are mobile loan signings where i will travel to the borrower home,the lender office,or the escrow holder office.italics added.of the services mentioned by kilpatrick,the taking of acknowledgments or the notarizing of signatures was merely one minor part.defendant motion noted plaintiff testimony in which he plaintiff recalled that a lady kilpatrick came to his home to conduct the signing of plaintiff loan refinance papers,but he recalled little else about it defendant motion also pointed out that the charge,as it appeared in the closing statement the hud form,included an explicit reference to the fact that kilpatrick was also a csa.specifically,the hud form stated notary to lauri kilpatrick,apn csa.
in support of the second ground for the motion,defendant presented evidence that kilpatrick was an independent contractor who charged and retained the entire fee,and that she was not an agent or employee of defendant preliminarily,defendant asserted that as an escrow company,it frequently made use of third party mobile notaries like kilpatrick for loan closings.defendant did so for several reasons,including that it freed up their escrow officers for other critical tasks since loan signings may take one to two hours,and because loan signings often involved travel to the borrower residence and often occurred outside of normal business hours to accommodate a borrower schedule.defendant disbursed a check to kilpatrick for after she submitted an invoice for a loan signing.defendant evidence showed that kilpatrick was an independent contractor doing business since as a good deed document notary service.kilpatrick was on defendant approved list of third party notaries for closing loans,based in part on her completion of a notary approval request packet that included an independent contractor status test.defendant further asserted that kilpatrick had her own business office,had other clients besides defendant,made her services available to other escrow companies,set her own hours and did not take instructions from defendant on how to perform her essential work.at a typical loan signing,kilpatrick practice was to disclose to the borrower that she was an independent contractor and was not an employee of the lender or the escrow holder.
plaintiff filed opposition to the motion for summary judgment,arguing that the fees charged were unlawful under section even if other services were provided because,allegedly,the only essential notary function performed was the taking of two acknowledgments and the hud described the fee as notary to lauri kilpatrick,apn csa.plaintiff opposition further argued that even if the fees were not unlawful,they were potentially unfair or fraudulent under the ucl because defendant did not itemize or disclose the various services being provided and kilpatrick answering of questions would constitute the unauthorized practice of law.according to plaintiff,since defendant motion did not negate these other potential theories,defendant did not meet its initial burden as the moving party.additionally,plaintiff opposition argued that there were triable issues of fact whether kilpatrick was defendant agent,based in part on defendant guidelines regarding its approved notaries,which guidelines may,according to plaintiff,indicate a degree of control over the manner of performing services.for these and other reasons,plaintiff argued that the motion for summary judgment should be denied.
defendant reply in support of its motion responded that all of plaintiff claims were premised on violation of section and that no other theories were alleged in the complaint.since in summary judgment proceedings the material issues are framed and limited by the pleadings,defendant reply insisted it was not necessary for defendant to negate theories that were not pled.additionally,defendant argued that the material facts showing kilpatrick to be an independent contractor were not in dispute and,therefore,that issue could properly be decided as a matter of law.
the hearing of the motion for summary judgment was held on march.following oral argument,the trial court took the matter under submission.on may,the trial court issued its written order granting the motion for summary judgment.the court granted the motion because no overcharge occurred as section only sets a price for taking an acknowledgment,and it does not limit what notaries can charge for services which are not listed in that statute.secondly,the trial court concluded that kilpatrick was a third party independent contractor and,therefore,defendant was not liable even if there was an overcharge.on june,the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant.plaintiff timely appealed from that judgment.
defendant motion for attorney fees 
the judgment entered below made defendant the prevailing party in the action.on august,defendant moved for an award of attorney fees based on a provision in the escrow instructions.defendant motion requested in attorney fees.defendant argued that this sum,though large,was reasonable in light of the fact that plaintiff had aggressively litigated and engaged in extensive and discovery,which treated the case as a,statewide class action,even though there had been no class certification.defendant substantiated the actual amount of time spent in defending the litigation by submitting declarations and copies of billing statements or invoices.
plaintiff objected to the enforcement of the attorney fees provision,contending it was so oppressive and that it was unconscionable.plaintiff also objected that the amount of attorney fees requested was unreasonable.the motion was heard on september,and following oral argument the trial court took the matter under submission.on october,the trial court granted the motion and awarded defendant attorney fees in the sum of.plaintiff then separately appealed from the order granting attorney fees,and the two appeals were consolidated by this court.
discussion 
summary judgment law and standard of review 
we begin with the summary judgment motion.summary judgment is appropriate when all of the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.
a defendant may move for summary judgment if it is contended that the action has no merit.code civ,subd.a.a defendant moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing a cause of action is without merit.a defendant meets that burden by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto,subd.p.if the defendant makes such a showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at.
the pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment motion.the function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues and to frame the outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.fpi development,nakashima d.as our supreme court has explained it the materiality of a disputed fact is measured by the pleadings citations,which set the boundaries of the issues to be resolved at summary judgment.citations.conroy regents of university of california cal th,conroy.accordingly,the burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she negate plaintiff theories of liability as alleged in the complaint that is,a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not included in the pleadings.id.at county of santa clara atlantic richfield th,lockhart county of los angeles th,see also melican regents of university of california th,we do not require defendant to negate elements of causes of action plaintiffs never pleaded.
furthermore,t he papers filed in response to a defendant motion for summary judgment may not create issues outside the pleadings and are not a substitute for an amendment to the pleadings.citation.county of santa clara atlantic richfield,supra,th at.an opposing party separate statement is not a substitute for amendment of the complaint.lackner north th,fn.similarly,d eclarations in opposition to a motion for summary judgment are no substitute for amended pleadings.if the motion for summary judgment presents evidence sufficient to disprove the plaintiff claims,the plaintiff forfeits an opportunity to amend to state new claims by failing to request it.citations.conroy,supra,cal th at.
on appeal from a summary judgment,our task is to independently determine whether an issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.brantley pisaro th.we independently review the parties papers supporting and opposing the motion,using the same method of analysis as the trial court.essentially,we assume the role of the trial court and apply the same rules and standards.kline turner th.we apply the same analysis required of the trial court.first,we identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond.second,we determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which negate the opponent claim and justify a judgment in the moving party favor.when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment,the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable issue of material fact.hamburg wal mart stores,th,chevron,superior court th.in so doing,we liberally construe the opposing party evidence,strictly construe the moving party evidence,and resolve all doubts in favor of the opposing party.johnson american standard,cal th,saelzler advanced group cal th.
ii.summary judgment was properly granted 
defendant burden as moving party was satisfied 
in this case,the trial court acknowledged that plaintiff narrowly framed causes of action limited the issues that had to be addressed by defendant summary judgment motion.according to the trial court,the only theory of liability alleged in the complaint was that defendant overcharged plaintiff for notary services and retained the benefits thereof.that is,plaintiff entire complaint was premised on the assumption that section,subdivision a,was violated in this case when plaintiff was charged for kilpatrick services.when defendant motion presented evidence showing that kilpatrick provided many other services at the loan signing besides merely taking two acknowledgments,the trial court concluded that plaintiff causes of action were without merit based on that showing and the clear language of the statute.according to the trial court,section does not limit what may be charged for services which are not listed in that statute.we agree with that analysis.
in the discussion that follows,we shall break down defendant and the trial court reasoning into three logical steps the meaning of section,the limited scope of plaintiff pleading,and defendant evidentiary showing as the moving party successfully defeating the causes of action as pled.when each step is considered,it will serve to highlight that defendant met its initial burden as the moving party.afterwards,we will address the matters presented in plaintiff opposition.
section states,in relevant part,that f ees charged by a notary public for the following services shall not exceed the fees prescribed by this section.italics added.included in the list of services regulated by section is the fee f or taking an acknowledgment,subd.a.it is plain on the face of the statute that it sets fees only for certain types of services performed by a notary namely those services listed in the statute.conversely,the statute does not regulate fees for any services not mentioned in the statute it is a prime rule of construction that the legislative intent underlying a statute must be ascertained from its language if the language is clear,there can be no room for interpretation,and effect must be given to its plain meaning.citations.mutual life ins.city of los angeles cal d.we conclude the trial court correctly recognized the clear meaning of this statute.
the pleadings 
throughout plaintiff complaint,the sole basis for liability was the claim that defendant violated section and thus overcharged plaintiff.for example,in the introductory general allegations,plaintiff complaint alleged that section adopts a specific regulatory scheme which establishes specific limits on the amount of fees that can be charged for notarizing documents.allegedly,plaintiff was charged a predetermined notary fee that was contrary to section.as to plaintiff loan transaction,defendant allegedly charged a predetermined fee of even though only two signature s were notarized in plaintiff real estate transaction.according to the complaint,defendant violated california law by overcharging plaintiff more than for notarizing the deed of trust which plaintiff signed,and defendant thereby engaged in unlawful business practices and unjustly enriched itself by overcharging plaintiff.based on these allegations of fact,the complaint goes on to specify the common question of law involved in the case the law could not be simpler.california government code section sets a cap on notarization fees.under section,subdivision a,it is illegal to charge more than per notarized signature on each deed or deed of trust used in a specific real estate transaction.defendant charged more than per signature.thus,defendant violated the law.
further,as to the first cause of action the ucl claim labeled as unfair business practices,the complaint alleged that the basis for that claim was as follows defendant engaged in unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business acts and practices.namely,defendant overcharged plaintiff by assessing and collecting set notary fees in each real estate transaction irrespective of the number of signatures actually notarized.plaintiff was charged more than california law allowed,and thus lost money due to defendant unlawful business practices.italics added.as to the second cause of action for unjust enrichment,the complaint alleged that the basis for that claim was as follows california government code section,subdivision a sets a cap on notarization fees.under section,subdivision a,it is illegal to charge more than per notarized signature.defendant,through violating california law,unjustly enriched itself at the expense of plaintiff italics added.
we conclude from these allegations that plaintiff entire complaint was founded on one,and only one,theory of liability that defendant overcharged plaintiff for notary services under the provisions of section,subdivision a.as the trial court correctly held,b ased on the causes of action alleged,plaintiffs only make a claim that defendant overcharged them for the notary fees.italics added.since that was the exclusive theory of liability pleaded by plaintiff,it was all that had to be addressed by defendant motion for summary judgment.county of santa clara atlantic richfield,supra,th at theories not pleaded by plaintiff need not be addressed in defendant motion under code civ.
defendant factual showing 
as noted above,in meeting the issue of the alleged overcharge under section,defendant motion demonstrated that kilpatrick,who was both a notary and a csa,provided a number of signing services in connection with plaintiff loan refinance in addition to merely taking the two acknowledgements.among other things,it was shown that kilpatrick presented the various loan documents for signature,read the mandatory disclosures,explained the purpose of loan documents,indicated where the borrower must sign on each document,and answered questions.in short,she traveled to the place of the signing which plaintiff recalled was his home and facilitated the closing of the loan by obtaining the necessary signatures on all of the documents in a careful,process,including answering questions.while the assistance and service provided by kilpatrick included the taking of two acknowledgments each with one notarized signature,her performance of that intrinsically notarial act was merely one part of the overall signing services she provided.
more than that,kilpatrick deposition testimony and her official notary journal evidenced that when she took the two acknowledgements in connection with plaintiff loan refinance signing,she recorded in her notary journal the fee of per notarized signature.further,kilpatrick testimony made clear that she understood per notarized signature was all she could charge for that particular function,notwithstanding the fact that the total fee she billed for the entirety of her signing services was a flat fee of,which was not broken down or itemized a reasonable inference may be drawn from this evidence that plaintiff was charged only per signature for the two acknowledgments,as set forth in kilpatrick notary journal,and that the total signing fee of was attributable to the fact that many other services were performed by kilpatrick 
in conclusion,because section only limited fees for the services specifically listed therein and did not prohibit remuneration for other services rendered,defendant evidentiary showing was sufficient to prima facie negate plaintiff claim that defendant allegedly violated the statute by charging.plaintiff complaint assumed that the charged was for taking two acknowledgments,but defendant showed that it was instead for a variety of loan signing services provided by kilpatrick.we conclude that defendant met its burden as the moving party.
plaintiff opposition 
plaintiff argued in his opposition to the motion,as he does on appeal,that even if defendant negated plaintiff claim for violation of section,defendant nevertheless failed to meet its burden as the moving party since there were other potential theories of liability available to plaintiff that defendant motion did not address.plaintiff also asserted that evidence referenced in his opposition was sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact.we now address these arguments 
other theories were not pled 
in arguing that defendant did not address certain other potential causes of action,plaintiff appeal emphasizes that the ucl has three separate grounds of liability.that is a correct statement of the law.see bus.since section is in the disjunctive,it establishes three separate types of unfair competition.the statute prohibits practices that are either unfair,or unlawful,or fraudulent.citation.pastoria nationwide ins.th.plaintiff argues that it stated a cause of action for potential unfair or fraudulent practices because the hud form or other documents provided by defendant did not itemize and disclose the specific services that were billed for notary or csa services performed by kilpatrick and kilpatrick conduct of answering questions about loan documents constituted the unlawful practice of law.whatever we may think about the viability of such theories,the problem for plaintiff at this stage is that no such claim or cause of action was ever alleged.
in an effort to persuade us that these theories were somehow pled,plaintiff notes that the first cause of action included a statement that defendant conduct was unlawful,unfair or fraudulent.but that was a bare conclusion,not the factual basis of a cause of action.moreover,we can not ignore that the next sentence of the complaint made it unmistakably clear that the first cause of action was based solely on unlawful conduct.it stated,as we previously noted above,as follows namely,defendant overcharged plaintiff by assessing and collecting set notary fees in each real estate transaction irrespective of the number of signatures actually notarized.plaintiff was charged more than california law allowed,and thus lost money due to defendant unlawful business practices.italics added.likewise,the second cause of action for unjust enrichment was premised exclusively on the identical unlawful conduct that is,on the claim that defendant charged more than what section permitted,and through violating that california law,unjustly enriched itself plainly then,the actionable wrongdoing for which relief was sought in the complaint was not a failure to disclose or itemize,nor a notary unauthorized practice of law,but that of overcharging plaintiff by exceeding the amount permitted under section.
finally,plaintiff tries to make something of the fact that the concept of itemization was briefly mentioned in the complaint.that is,the complaint alleged that defendant did not compute notary fees based on an itemization of the total number of notarized signatures taken in a transaction,but instead defendant billed a predetermined block amount.but that allegation was simply a description of the process by which defendant allegedly overcharged plaintiff under section,with the overcharge itself being the sole basis of the cause of action in the pleading.in conclusion,nothing in the allegations of the complaint indicated that insufficient disclosure or itemization,or unauthorized practice of law by a notary,constituted the actionable wrongdoing on defendant part for which relief was sought.no such causes of action were alleged.
what we said at the outset of our discussion bears repeating here for purposes of a summary judgment motion,the pleadings set the boundaries of the issues to be resolved.conroy,supra,cal th at.defendant,therefore,met its burden as the moving party when it negated the sole basis of plaintiff claims namely,the alleged excessive notary fee under section.it was not incumbent on defendant to refute liability on some theoretical possibilities not included in the pleadings.conroy,supra,at county of santa clara atlantic richfield,supra,th at.each of the suggested other grounds for liability argued by plaintiff were simply theoretical possibilities that were not included in the pleadings.finally,plaintiff can not use his opposition papers as a substitute for an amended pleading,and his failure to seek an amendment below forfeits the issue.conroy,supra,at county of santa clara atlantic richfield,supra,at lackner north,supra,th at,fn.
no triable issue of fact 
nothing in plaintiff opposition papers created a triable issue of fact on the present ground for the motion.indeed,most of the opposition evidence went to the separate issue of whether or not kilpatrick was an agent of defendant,or to show purported theories of liability that were not alleged in the pleadings.since defendant met its burden as the moving party,and plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact,we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted.code civ,subd.c p.
iii.attorney fees provision was unconscionable 
defendant,as prevailing party,moved for recovery of its attorney fees pursuant to a provision in the parties escrow instructions.plaintiff objected to enforcement of that provision on the ground that it was unconscionable.in its written order following the hearing,the trial court granted the motion and awarded to defendant the sum of as a recovery of its attorney fees.we treat the trial court order granting the motion as an implicit rejection of plaintiff contention that the attorney fees provision was unconscionable plaintiff appeal argues the trial court erred on that issue.we agree.

unconscionability is ultimately a question of law for the court.flores transamerica homefirst,th,citing.however,numerous factual issues may bear on that question.citation.where the trial court determination of unconscionability is based upon the trial court resolution of conflicts in the evidence,or on the factual inferences which may be drawn therefrom,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the court determination and review those aspects of the determination for substantial evidence.citations.gutierrez autowest,th.to the extent that there are no material conflicts in the evidence bearing on the issue of unconscionability,our review is de novo.higgins superior court th.
b.the contract provision and other evidence 
the subject attorney fees provision,which was set forth in paragraph of the general provisions of the escrow instructions,stated as follows 
in the event that a suit is brought by any party or parties to these escrow instructions to which the escrow holder is named as a party which results in a judgment in favor of the escrow holder and against a principal or principals herein,the principals or principals agent agree to pay said escrow holder all costs,expenses and reasonable attorney fees which it may expend or incur in said suit,the amount thereof to be fixed and judgment therefore to be rendered by the court in said suit.
in opposing the motion for attorney fees,plaintiff declaration described the circumstances of signing the escrow instructions on february.he stated that he did not personally choose to use defendant as the escrow company for the loan refinance,nor was he given any other options.he signed all of the loan paperwork in front of the notary selected by defendant,who presented approximately forty standard loan forms to sign.the forms were presented for signature in order for plaintiff to obtain his loan refinance,and were presented to him by the notary for quick signature.as form after form was put forward for plaintiff signature,plaintiff did not attempt a detailed review of each document,nor did he believe there was sufficient time to do so.moreover,plaintiff did not believe he could pick and choose which forms to sign or cross out any paragraphs that he did not agree with.rather,he believed that in order to obtain his loan refinance,he had to sign all of the documents presented to him,including the escrow instructions.defendant never told him otherwise,nor did defendant indicate that any of the preprinted general provisions in the escrow instructions were negotiable.further,plaintiff declaration stated that he had no idea the escrow instructions contained a paragraph that required him to pay all of defendant attorneys fees for whatever type of claim i may have against it.he asserted that had he known about that provision,he would never have signed the escrow instructions.
defendant reply in support of its attorney fees motion argued that the matters asserted in plaintiff declaration were too conclusory to adequately support a finding of unconscionability.defendant noted that,contrary to plaintiff declaration,plaintiff had testified previously that he did not recall whether the notary had offered to answer questions or whether she had explained any documents to him.defendant reply also referred to kilpatrick declaration utilized by defendant in the summary judgment motion,indicating that kilpatrick had summarized the nature of the documents to be signed and offered to answer questions.additionally,in arguing against unconscionability,defendant claimed that civil code section would make the attorney fees provision mutual.
the trial court order did not expressly address the issue of unconscionability,but simply stated defendant motion is hereby granted.defendant is contractually entitled to be recompensed for attorney fees and expenses.defendant reasonably incurred in attorney fees and expenses.hence,plaintiff or his agents shall recompense defendant in attorneys fees and expenses 
overview of law of unconscionability 
a court may deny enforcement of a contractual provision that is determined to be unconscionable.if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result,subd.a.
our supreme court recently summarized the law of unconscionability in pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th pinnacle,as follows unconscionability consists of both procedural and substantive elements.the procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation,focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.citations.substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or.citations.a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.citation.id.at see also little auto stiegler,cal th,little procedural unconscionability generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz.
both procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must be shown,but they need not be present in the same degree and are evaluated on a sliding scale.citation.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at,citing armendariz,supra,cal th at.
application 
we now consider whether the attorney fees provision at issue was unconscionable and,therefore,unenforceable.we do so by evaluating whether plaintiff showed both the procedural and the substantive elements of unconscionability.
procedural unconscionability 
as indicated above,procedural unconscionability requires either oppression or surprise.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.procedural unconscionability,and in particular oppression,generally entails a contract of adhesion that is,a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz,supra,cal th at see also walnut producers of california diamond foods,th.s urprise typically involves a provision hidden within the prolixness of a preprinted form contract drafted by the party having superior bargaining strength.baker osborne development th,a m produce,supra,d at armendariz,supra,at.
here,we conclude that procedural unconscionability existed based on surprise created by defendant escrow company.preliminarily,we agree with plaintiff that in his situation as an individual homeowner or consumer seeking to refinance his home loan,the escrow company handling the signing and escrow settlement process,defendant was in a superior bargaining position.see akin business title d,recognizing escrow company generally has superior bargaining strength over customers needing its services.further,the escrow instructions were,to a significant extent,adhesive in the sense that they were set forth in a form contract imposed on plaintiff,the weaker party,and the disputed attorney fees provision was neither known to nor negotiated by plaintiff see morris redwood empire bancorp,supra,th at,applying armendariz,supra,cal th at.
as to the specific issue of surprise,plaintiff demonstrated that the attorney fees provision was hidden or obscured in more than one way.first,there was the signing process itself.the record showed that during the signing event conducted by the notary selected by defendant,plaintiff was presented in one sitting with approximately preprinted forms for his signature in order to complete his loan refinance transaction,and the escrow instructions were but one document among that multitude of preprinted forms.we believe the quantity of loan and escrow documents that plaintiff was asked to sign at one time each one of which would presumably have its own assortment of fine print or boilerplate provisions was relevant to the issue of surprise.it is not unreasonable to expect that a single provision contained in one document may get missed or overlooked when the signing party must also work through and sign a large number of other preprinted form documents at the same time.but that was not all that was involved here.the provision was also hidden within the escrow instructions themselves.in our observation of the escrow instructions,the entirety of which were printed in a relatively small font size,the attorney fees provision was inconspicuously buried in the prolixness of the densely packed,harder to read boilerplate general provisions section of the last part of that form document.see,pardee construction superior court th,pardee surprise shown where disputed provision was buried in the preprinted form contracts supplied by party with superior bargaining strength,and were difficult to read due to format and font gutierrez autowest,supra,th at surprise shown where disputed clause was printed in typeface on the opposite side of the signature page of the lease and lessee was never informed that the lease contained an arbitration clause.the above described conditions were sufficient,by themselves,to adequately show surprise for purposes of procedural unconscionability.
we note further that there was nothing in the escrow instructions or otherwise that would have drawn plaintiff attention to the specific fact that the prolixness of the preprinted,standardized form included a highly unexpected or irregular term that had never been discussed by the parties that is,a attorney fees provision that encompassed all types of claims and exclusively benefitted defendant although the party asserting unconscionability has the burden of proving that defense woodside homes of,superior court th,it has also been held that the party who prepared and submitted a form contract containing unexpected or harsh terms has the burden of showing that the other party had notice of them ellis mckinnon broadcasting th.that did not occur here.
on this record,we conclude that plaintiff adequately established grounds for surprise as a matter of law.therefore,the element of procedural unconscionability was satisfied and the trial court implied finding to the contrary was in error.
substantive unconscionability 
the substantive element of unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or.citations.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.this includes consideration of the extent to which the disputed
