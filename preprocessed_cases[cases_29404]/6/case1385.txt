in this consolidated appeal of the trial court ruling after a bench trial,defendant charter one bank charter one appeals the trial court ruling that charter one was liable to plaintiff midamerica bank midamerica for the value of a cashier check charter one had refused to honor,and midamerica appeals the trial court ruling denying it attorney fees.for the reasons that follow,we reverse in part and affirm in part.
the parties do not dispute the basic underlying facts.mary christelle,the mother of david hernandez who was also president of essential technologies of illinois,eti,purchased a check payable to eti with funds from her charter one account,and the check was deposited in eti account at midamerica.four days after eti deposited the cashier check,christelle asked charter one to stop payment on the check.charter one did so and subsequently refused to honor the check when midamerica presented it for payment.charter one returned the check to midamerica with a stop payment stamp across the front,and midamerica sent the check to eti after removing the credit from eti account.within two weeks,the balance of eti midamerica account dropped to approximately negative due to a series of checks that were returned for insufficient funds.midamerica closed the account and instigated a lawsuit in which it was assigned eti interest in the check.midamerica then filed the present suit against charter one to recover the value of the check,and charter one in turn filed a complaint against christelle,david hernandez,his wife gina nelson hernandez,and eti.though a copy of the cashier check was used as an exhibit at trial,the parties were unable to produce the original cashier check.some testimony indicated that the check may have been in an eti office,but there was no definitive evidence as to the check location.
after hearing testimony and receiving other evidence,the trial court ruled that charter one was obligated to honor its cashier check and thus was liable to midamerica for,because t he law under the uniform commercial code code ilcs et west is that cashier checks are as good as currency.the court further found that eti and david and gina hernandez had used christelle as a pawn in a scheme to defraud charter one and that charter one was entitled to a judgment against them for the same.based on its reading of the relevant case law,the court declined to award midamerica attorney fees in connection with the lawsuit.charter one had argued that it was entitled to a setoff against midamerica because midamerica,as an assignee of eti,inherited eti liability to charter one along with the right to enforce the check against charter one.however,because charter one had failed to request a setoff in its pleadings,the court declined to award one.charter one and midamerica both filed timely appeals.
in its appeal case,charter one first argues that its refusal to honor its cashier check was justified,because it accepted a stop payment order from christelle.midamerica counters that illinois law does not allow a bank to stop payment on a cashier check and thus that charter one refusal to honor its check was not justified.
in support of its position,midamerica directs us to the decision in able associates,orchard hill farms of illinois,d.in able,the court addressed the very question presented here whether the law allows a bank to stop payment on a cashier check.able,d at.the court in able recognized a split of authority between cases,including one illinois appellate court case that held that a bank could stop payment on a cashier check consistent with those provisions of the uniform commercial code relat ed to holders in due course,and cases that adhere d to a contrary rule that cashier checks are not,under any circumstances,subject to countermand by the issuing bank.able,d at.the court sided with the latter line of cases,and it explained its reasoning as follows 
it is clear that in illinois,a cashier check is regarded as accepted by the act of issuance.citations.further,under section of the uniform commercial code,a stop order is ineffective after the bank has accepted or certified the item,ch,par.able,d at.
other courts clarified that this rule,that a cashier check be considered accepted by the act of issuance,was based on language from the code that a cceptance is the drawee signed engagement to honor the draft as presented,ch,par.these courts considered a bank officer signature on a cashier check as sufficient for acceptance under the quoted language.see da silva sanders.
the able court also argued that policy considerations favored its holding,because cashier checks operate as the commercial equivalent of cash,and allowing a bank to stop payment and thus renege on its guarantee to honor the check would undermine the public confidence in the bank and its checks and thereby deprive the cashier check of the essential incident which makes it useful.able,d at,quoting national newark essex bank giordano.
the able decision was consistent with illinois case law preceding it.see,gillespie riley management,the cashier check is substantially equivalent to a certified check in that neither generally can be countermanded and both circulate in the commercial world as primary obligations of the issuing bank as substitutes for the money represented.but see bank of niles american state bank,d,departed from in able.the approach followed in able came to be known as the cash substitute or cash equivalency approach,or the acceptance approach.see carter,uniform commercial code a bank right to dishonor a cashier check,hereinafter carter discussing differing views to the problem presented in able davis,the future of cashier checks under revised article of the uniform commercial code,wake forest,hereinafter davis.
while illinois followed the approach described above,other jurisdictions followed a divergent approach that allowed a bank to dishonor its cashier check where it could assert a defense that would be valid against enforcement of a note.see bank one northern trust bank,noting split between this approach and the illinois approach carter.at discussing two approaches under which courts treated cashier checks as negotiable instruments instead of cash equivalents.proponents of this approach,which we term for purposes of this discussion the note approach,criticized the approach reliance on the code rule that a stop order may be issued only before acceptance see,ch,par.a.they argued that the concept of stopping payment has relevance only to relations between a bank and its customer who draws a check against the bank and,since the bank,as drawer and drawee,is its own customer when it issues a cashier check,it is nonsensical to speak of the bank liability to itself for failing to stop payment on its own cashier check.da silva.at summarizing criticism.critics of the approach also argued that it contravened section a of the code,which provided that a draft drawn on the drawer is effective as a note,ch,par.a.davis,wake forest.at criticizing approaches that treated cashier checks as drafts instead of notes.these critics instead advocated for a position that would allow a bank to dishonor a cashier check to the extent it had any defense that would be valid against a note.see,ch,pars,defenses to honoring a note.
most courts that reached this result did so in two different ways.da silva.at explaining various approaches.some courts relied on section a,quoted above,to hold that a cashier check should be treated as a note.da silva.at.other courts agreed with the premise from the approach that a cashier check could be considered a draft accepted by the act of issuance,but they argued that,under section of the code,an acceptor was bound in the same way as was a maker and thus should have the same defenses as a maker.da silva.at see,ch,par.the maker or acceptor engages that he will pay the instrument according to its tenor at the time of his engagement see also davis,wake forest.at discussing this approach.
in an attempt to quell this dispute and provide uniformity to the treatment of cashier checks,the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws and the american law institute completely
