the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims that dismissed it from this action for lack of standing based on our decision in landmark land,united states,landmark.admiral fin.united states,fed.cl.we affirm.
background 
this and other cases involve claims against the government stemming from the thrift crisis of the early.the background and history of that crisis and the government subsequent enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea,stat,have been thoroughly discussed in the decision of the supreme court in united states winstar,d,and in a number of decisions of this court,including,landmark,glass united states,california federal bank,fsb united states,and glendale federal bank,fsb united states.it is not necessary for us to expand upon these very thorough decisions accordingly,we limit our discussion in this opinion to the specific circumstances relevant to this appeal.
in the,the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic provided certain economic incentives to encourage private investors to purchase struggling savings and loans institutions,or thrifts.this policy represented an attempt to avoid having the government liquidate struggling thrifts and being forced to use fslic funds to reimburse depositors.fslic primary inducement to potential thrift purchasers was a partial forbearance from regulatory capital requirements.fslic accomplished this by allowing the thrift purchaser to treat the thrift asset shortfall as a fictional asset.in other words,the difference between the thrift assets and liabilities was transformed,under fslic regulations,into an asset in an amount equal to the difference between the assets and liabilities.for example,if a thrift had in assets and in liabilities,fslic would allow the thrift purchaser to allocate the shortfall in real assets to a fictional asset called supervisory goodwill.fslic then permitted this supervisory goodwill to be included among the assets that the purchaser could use to meet regulatory capital maintenance requirements under fslic regulations.supervisory goodwill was to be amortized over a long period,thereby allowing the thrift purchaser to contribute far less in actual capital to the thrift.these forbearance policies typically were memorialized in a forbearance letter pursuant to an agreement between fslic,on behalf of the government,and the thrift institution.see generally california federal bank,at.because of these policies,failing thrifts became far more attractive as investments to potential purchasers,without any additional cost to fslic.
the regulatory policies undertaken by fslic were not successful in resolving the thrift crisis,however.see winstar,at.as a result,on august,congress enacted firrea.firrea made dramatic changes in the thrift industry.see id.at.among other things,these changes phased out the inclusion of supervisory goodwill in the calculation of regulatory capital and imposed upon thrifts additional capital requirements.this change in the method of calculating regulatory capital was especially problematic for purchasers of thrifts who had used the fictional asset of supervisory goodwill to meet their regulatory capital requirements under regulatory capital maintenance agreements signed with the government.
firrea also changed the structure of the government regulation of the thrift industry.under firrea,fslic was abolished and its functions transferred to other agencies,while a new thrift deposit insurance fund under the management of the fdic was created.at the same time,firrea replaced the bank board with the office of thrift supervision ots,an office within the treasury department responsible for the regulation of all federally insured savings associations.finally,the resolution trust corporation rtc was created to manage and liquidate or otherwise dispose of failed thrifts.see winstar,at.until it went out of existence on december,see m,the rtc operated in two capacities and.the task of the rtc in its receiver capacity was to wind up the business affairs of failed thrifts.winstar,at.one of the things that did after a thrift failed was to convey to,by contract of sale,certain assets of the thrift.landmark,at.in that way,rtc corporate assumed all of the failed thrift legal claims,formerly held by.id.
the thrift deposit insurance fund managed by the fdic was given the name fslic resolution fund frf.upon passage of firrea,the assets of fslic were placed in frf.landmark,at.in,frf received the assets and liabilities of the rtc.id.at.the liabilities of the rtc,as successor to fslic,included the obligation to pay breach of contract claims against fslic.id.at.the assets of the rtc included the right to repayment of payments made to insured depositors when the rtc paid insured depositors of a failed thrift.by making such payments,the rtc became subrogated to all rights of the depositor against the failed thrift to the extent of such payment or assumption.g.the assets of fslic were placed in an account maintained as.id.the assets of the rtc were placed in an account maintained as.id.m therefore,a claim asserted by a thrift that had failed as a result of firrea capital requirements resulted in the fdic,as manager of frf,asserting the claim as an asset of against fslic,the governmental party to the original contract between the united states and the failed thrift.landmark,at.any award constituted an fslic liability and would be paid out of.consequently,the net effect of any damage award to the fdic on behalf of the failed thrift would result in a transfer of funds from to.
in due course,ots issued regulations implementing firrea capital requirements,along with a bulletin that stated that firrea eliminates capital and accounting forbearances previously granted to certain thrifts.winstar,at.quoting office of thrift supervision,capital adequacy guidance on the status of capital accounting forbearances and capital instruments held by a deposit insurance fund,thrift bulletin.as a result of the new capital compliance standards,many thrifts immediately fell out of capital compliance,making them subject to immediate seizure by the thrift regulators.id.at.ultimately,the supreme court held that the government breached its contracts with several financial institutions,and their investors,by enacting firrea.id.at.
after the enactment of firrea,the rtc commonly advanced failing thrifts sufficient money to pay off their depositors upon liquidation.this resulted in the rtc,and,after termination of the rtc in,becoming a priority creditor of failed thrifts.that is because under the statutory scheme of priority for thrift creditors,the fdic is obligated to completely satisfy the claim of the government,specifically that of,against the failed thrift for reimbursement of deposit liability before distributing any proceeds to the failed thrift other creditors.d 
the facts of this case are as follows.in,admiral financial corporation admiral approached haven federal savings and loan association old haven with a proposal to form a new thrift institution.under the proposal,admiral would acquire old haven through a transaction in which all of old haven issued and outstanding stock would be exchanged for stock of admiral.on august,admiral and old haven executed an agreement and plan of reorganization.on april,the bank board conditionally approved admiral application to acquire old haven.in that connection,the bank board sent a letter to admiral counsel authorizing the new thrift haven to amortize any intangible asset such as goodwill over a period not to exceed years by the accounting method.thereafter,on june,admiral and fslic entered into a regulatory capital agreement rcma.under the agreement,admiral was required to ensure that haven regulatory capital was maintained at certain specified levels.from its inception,however,haven lost money and fell out of capital compliance on march,causing admiral to be in default on its obligations under the rcma.
by december,haven was insolvent by approximately million.on march,ots closed haven for failure to meet the regulatory capital requirements mandated by firrea and appointed the rtc as receiver for haven.as haven receiver,the rtc succeeded to all of haven assets,including any legal claims that haven possessed.on march,ots created a new institution called haven federal savings and loan association,haven federal pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement,haven federal received all of the assets and most of the liabilities resulting from the haven receivership.
the rtc operated haven federal in conservatorship until december,at which time ots appointed rtc receiver for the purpose of liquidating haven federal assets.as receiver,the rtc immediately sold certain assets and transferred all haven federal deposits to barnett federal savings and loan association barnett.in connection with that transaction,advanced sufficient funds to haven federal to enable it to compensate barnett for the difference between haven federal assets and liabilities,at a cost to the rtc of approximately.the money advanced to haven federal was required to induce barnett to assume haven federal deposit liabilities.because of this cash advance for depositor liability,the rtc became the priority creditor of haven federal in the amount of.that same day,sold other assets of haven federal including all legal claims to.when the rtc went out of existence,all assets and liabilities it held in its corporate capacity were transferred to.m.
on august,admiral filed suit against the united states in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,a.in its complaint,it alleged that the enactment and implementation of firrea breached the government contract with admiral,in which the government i agreed to allow haven to count supervisory goodwill toward its regulatory capital for the purpose of meeting regulatory capital maintenance requirements and ii agreed to allow haven to amortize that capital over a period not to exceed years 
it is admiral contract claim that is at issue in this case.admiral alleges that t he provisions of firrea restricting the inclusion of supervisory goodwill for purposes of satisfying minimum capital requirements constitute a repudiation or breach of admiral contract rights for which admiral claims it is entitled to monetary relief in the form of damages or restitutionary relief.admiral also alleges that 
t he regulatory forbearances granted by the government which permitted the inclusion of supervisory goodwill for purposes of satisfying minimum capital requirements were essential terms and conditions of admiral agreement to acquire and recapitalize haven.because the capital requirements of firrea abrogated and superseded these contractual obligations,that statute effected a complete frustration of the agreement and a failure of the consideration for which admiral bargained.
under its breach of contract claim,admiral initially sought recovery of.that amount had several components.the first was the sum of in restitution,representing the excess of old haven liabilities over old haven assets that admiral said it assumed when it purchased old haven.according to admiral,through its assumption of these liabilities,it relieved the government from having to pay them.second,admiral claimed that it was entitled to recover a total of,representing added capital infusions into haven.in addition,it asserted entitlement to in acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of old haven.admiral subsequently adjusted its breach of contract claim to seek total restitution in the amount of,comprised of,representing capital contributions to haven,and,representing the amount that admiral claims it saved the government by delaying the need to liquidate old haven.finally,admiral seeks reliance damages for amounts it alleges it expended in performance of,and in preparing to perform,its contractual obligations.thus the total amount of recovery being sought by admiral is.
eventually,the fdic moved to intervene in the suit and,in the alternative,to be substituted as plaintiff in place of admiral.the court of federal claims granted the fdic motion to intervene but denied its motion to be substituted for private plaintiffs.plaintiffs in all cases at court,fed.cl,the court concluded that the fdic interests were not adequately protected by the existing parties.id.at.
subsequently,on march,the fdic filed its complaint,asserting the following four claims against the united states a taking of property without just compensation a deprivation of property without due process of law breach of contract and frustration of purpose.the fdic claimed that it was asserting these claims as successor to the rights of haven federal savings and loan association and as manager of the fslic resolution fund that succeeded by operation of law to the assets and liabilities of the resolution trust corporation.fdic complaint at.the fdic states that it seeks to recover the cash equivalent value of haven lost right to count supervisory goodwill as capital million.in addition,the fdic asserts that,as successor to the interests of haven,it is the proper owner of the restitution claim asserted by admiral.
in due course,the government moved to dismiss the fdic on the grounds that its claims were and not timely filed.while the motion was pending,this court decided landmark.like the present litigation,landmark was a case.in,landmark entered into a contract the assistance agreement with fslic to acquire two failing thrifts dixie federal savings and loan association dixie and heritage federal savings and loan association heritage.landmark,at.under the assistance agreement,landmark was required to make an initial capital contribution of not less than.landmark did this by contributing real estate and cash valued at million.in exchange for the capital contribution,fslic agreed to allow dixie,the thrift surviving the merger,to treat its shortfall in actual assets as supervisory goodwill,which could be applied to its regulatory capital maintenance requirements.id.in order to maintain dixie financial strength as the value of the goodwill was reduced through amortization,the assistance agreement required landmark to make additional capital contributions to dixie as necessary to maintain dixie net worth at not less than three percent of its liabilities.id.in,dixie and the government entered into an agreement under which dixie acquired another thrift,bernard federal savings and loan association.id.at.dixie then merged with bernard.id.the merged thrift,however,went bankrupt,was seized by federal regulators,and was placed in receivership,with the rtc acting as receiver.id.
eventually,landmark brought suit in the court of federal claims,alleging that,through firrea,the government had breached the assistance agreement.id.in its action,landmark sought,as damages,compensation for the assets that it contributed to dixie in and,as well as use value as compensation for the loss landmark allegedly suffered by reason of not being able to use those assets after contributing them to dixie.id.the court of federal claims granted the fdic motion to intervene,as dixie successor in interest,so that it could assert claims to recover dixie contribution to bernard and the unamortized portion of dixie goodwill that had been created by the assistance agreement and subsequently eliminated by firrea.id.in due course,the court granted landmark and the fdic motions for summary judgment against the government on the issues of liability for breach of the assistance agreement and the contract under which dixie acquired bernard.id.after a trial on damages,the court awarded landmark million for its contribution under the assistance agreement and the fdic million in restitution for the breach of the contract.id.the court concluded that million was the value of the benefit that dixie had provided to the government in connection with its acquisition of bernard.id.
on appeal,the government argued that the court of federal claims erred in awarding damages to landmark.more importantly for present purposes,it also argued that the fdic claims had to be dismissed.the government urged that the claims did not satisfy the requirement because the government and the fdic were not adverse parties as to
