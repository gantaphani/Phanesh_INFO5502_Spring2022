in this bankruptcy case,in which john mccormick is the debtor,suntrust bank,filed a proof of claim for repayment of a loan that it claimed was secured by a deed of trust on two contiguous parcels of mccormick real property in orange county,north carolina,known as tract i and tract ii.the trustee commenced this action under a to avoid the lien on tract i because the deed of trust,while recorded on the official recordation index of orange county as to tract ii,was not so recorded as to tract 
suntrust contended that even though the recordation was deficient,the trustee was imputed with constructive knowledge of the lien on tract i because either he had constructive knowledge of the deed of trust that was properly recorded as to tract ii,which by its terms also created a lien on tract i or the deed of trust was recorded in an unofficial index in orange county and a careful and prudent title examiner would have found the lien on tract i in that index.
the bankruptcy court rejected suntrust arguments and ordered suntrust lien on tract i avoided under a,and the district court affirmed.we too affirm.because the trustee status the title of tract i is,under a,that of a bona fide purchaser under north carolina law,the trustee is only imputed with the notice that would be imputed to a bona fide purchaser of tract i under north carolina law.and north carolina law allows a purchaser to rely exclusively on the official recordation index of the county to discover liens,regardless of what other independent knowledge that purchaser might have.
in,john mccormick and his wife acquired two contiguous parcels of real property in orange county,north carolina tract i,consisting of six lots,and tract ii,consisting of two lots.the deed for both tracts was properly recorded on january,on the pin parcel identifier number index in orange county.the pin index,which is the county official real property recording index,was adopted by orange county in as the official index in lieu of its previous index system used by the county before.under the pin index system,each parcel of real property in the county is given a unique parcel identifier number,which is then used as the basis for recording all instruments relating to that parcel.orange county continued to use the traditional index system,but it did so only as an unofficial index on which to record instruments on an interim basis for the period between when the instrument is offered for recordation and when its recordation on the pin index is certified,usually a few days.
in,the mccormicks borrowed from central carolina bank and trust company later merged into sun trust bank,herein,suntrust,and they secured the loan with a deed of trust given as to both tracts i and ii.when submitted for recordation,however,the deed of trust included only the pin number of tract ii and not the pin number for tract accordingly,it was recorded only on the pin index against tract ii.
in,john mccormick borrowed from marc and maryann macky,and he secured that loan with a deed of trust on four lots lots,and in tract i.that deed of trust was properly recorded on the pin index in orange county.
mccormick was placed into involuntary bankruptcy in august,and john northen was appointed trustee of the bankruptcy estate.in administering the estate,northen sold all of the lots in tract i and transferred the liens recorded against tract i to tract i proceeds of sale.he thereafter commenced this adversary proceeding under a to avoid suntrust lien claimed by sun trust against the proceeds,because the lien against tract i had not been properly recorded on the pin index and,as the parties agreed,a search of the pin index as to tract i on the date of the bankruptcy petition would not have disclosed the existence of suntrust deed of trust on tract i.the mackys,whose lien for was created in after suntrust lien,supported the trustee position,which would benefit the mackys lien by avoiding suntrust prior but improperly recorded lien.
in response to the trustee motion for summary judgment,suntrust argued that even though its deed of trust was not recorded on the pin index against tract i,a competent title searcher,upon examining the deed of trust for tract ii,would have discovered tract i as a result of such examination,because the text of the deed of trust created liens on both tracts i and ii.suntrust also argued that a search of the unofficial index would have revealed the existence of the suntrust deed of trust as a lien against both tracts i and ii.
the bankruptcy court rejected suntrust arguments,observing that north carolina is a pure race jurisdiction such that the first to record an interest in land holds an interest superior to all other purchasers for value,regardless of actual or constructive notice as to any unrecorded conveyances.the court concluded that north carolina indexing statutes indicate a legislative intent to require that when a county has adopted a pin index as its official index,an instrument must be indexed in such an official index in order to be registered.thus,where,as is the case in orange county,a county has implemented a pin index that complies with the requirements of,such a pin index is the only index that is required by statute to be maintained t he result is that when a county adopts a pin index as its official index,an instrument must be indexed as provided for in.in order to be registered.accordingly,based on.a and a,the court avoided suntrust lien against tract 
on appeal,the district court affirmed for substantially the same reasons given by the bankruptcy court,entering judgment dated august,in favor of the trustee and the mackys.this appeal followed.
suntrust acknowledges that its deed of trust on tract i was not recorded against tract i on the pin index as of august,when the bankruptcy petition was filed.it also acknowledges that the pin index was the official index on which to record real property instruments in orange county,and that a title search of tract i in the pin index in august would not have disclosed its deed of trust.it argues nonetheless that the trustee can not avoid its lien on tract i,relying on two facts the deed of trust was recorded on the pin index in connection with tract ii,and anyone searching the title to tract ii would have seen the deed of trust,which,by its terms,creates a lien also on tract i and the deed of trust was recorded in the index,and the lien on tract i would have been discovered by a search of that index.accordingly,it contends that a bona fide purchaser would have had constructive notice of its lien on tract i,and the trustee,who stands in the shoes of a bona fide purchaser,would have been imputed with the same notice.
the trustee agrees that he stands in the shoes of a bona fide purchaser at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.but he argues that a bona fide purchaser of tract i at that time would not have purchased tract i subject to suntrust lien,regardless of the knowledge imputed to the purchaser,because the lien was not recorded in the official recordation index in orange county the pin index.
the trustee authority to avoid liens arises from a,which provides 
the trustee shall have,as of the commencement of the case,and without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor,the rights and powers of,or may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by 
a bona fide purchaser of real property from the debtor,against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected,that obtains the status of a bona fide purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the commencement of the case,whether or not such a purchaser exists.
emphasis added.thus,when determining whether a trustee can avoid a lien created before the bankruptcy petition was filed,the trustee actual knowledge of the lien is irrelevant.his right to avoid is determined by whether,under state law,a bona fide purchaser of the property would have taken the property subject to the lien.if a bona fide purchaser would not have taken it subject to the lien,then neither would the trustee.see havee belk,cir explaining that gives the tr
