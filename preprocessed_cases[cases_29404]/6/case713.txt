unitedhealth group uhg brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment that its failure to file timely reports with the securities and exchange commission sec violated no duties owed to its noteholders.wilmington trust company wilmington trust,as trustee for certain uhg notes,filed counterclaims asserting violations of the notes indenture,the trust indenture act of,and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the district court granted judgment in favor of uhg on all claims and counterclaims.we affirm.
the basic facts of this case are undisputed and relatively straightforward.on march,uhg publicly issued million of senior notes due march,the notes.the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture entered into by uhg and the bank of new york as trustee.as trustee,the bank of new york was charged with enforcing,as necessary,the indenture provisions against uhg.throughout the life of the notes,uhg has made all required interest payments and the debt has continuously been rated investment grade.
as a publicly traded company,uhg is required to make periodic financial disclosures,including quarterly filings on sec form.see securities and exchange act of exchange act,d,d.uhg came under public scrutiny in for backdating employee stock options by using the benefit of hindsight to assign option grant dates retroactively in order to reflect the most favorable historical market values.in response to public concerns about this practice,uhg formed a committee of independent directors to study its financial affairs.because of this ongoing review,uhg failed to file its second quarter form by its august due date.under such circumstances,sec regulations require a delinquent filer to submit a form notification of late filing.uhg complied with this requirement on august.the company filing explained the reasons for the delay and was accompanied by a page appendix containing substantially the same information as the company would have included in a timely form.a copy of this filing was forwarded to the trustee on august.
on august,a notice of default was sent to uhg on behalf of certain hedge funds which collectively owned more than twenty five percent of the outstanding principal balance on the notes.the notice claimed that uhg failure to file a timely violated i of the trust indenture.that section reads as follows 
so long as any of the securities remain outstanding,the company shall cause copies of all current,quarterly and annual financial reports on forms,and,respectively,and all proxy statements,which the company is then required to file with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section or d of the exchange act to be filed with the trustee and mailed to the holders of such series of securities at their addresses appearing in the security register maintained by the security registrar,in each case,within days of filing with the commission.the company shall also comply with the provisions of tia trust indenture act ss.a.
emphasis added.at the very least,i requires that uhg forward to the indenture trustee copies of the company required financial reports within fifteen days of actually filing such reports with the sec.the notice of default claimed that i also imposed an affirmative duty to file timely reports with the sec and that uhg failure in that regard constituted a default under the indenture.the notice gave uhg sixty days to cure the default.
uhg publicly disclosed the notice of default in an sec form filing.the company asserted it was not in default and intended to defend itself against the allegation.in mid october,the company filed another form in which it reported the findings and recommendations of the review committee and added that it was still digesting the report and had not yet determined if it needed to restate its past financials.it further announced it would delay filing a third quarter.
on october,uhg filed this action against the bank of new york as trustee seeking a declaratory judgment that it had not violated the terms of the indenture by failing to file a timely.shortly thereafter,on october,the hedge funds caused a notice of acceleration to be served on uhg.the notice observed that uhg had not cured the alleged default under i and,based on that failure,demanded accelerated payment of the full principal amount of the notes.effective january,wilmington trust company succeeded the bank of new york as trustee and was substituted as the defendant.on january,wilmington trust counterclaimed for breach of contract,violation of the trust indenture act of tia a,a,and breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
uhg finally filed its on march,almost seven months late.it simultaneously submitted an amended form for the first quarter of,a tardy form for the third quarter of that year,and a form for the year ending december.the financial information contained in the differed by less than one percent from the preliminary data which had accompanied the august form notice of late filing.
both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of uhg on all claims and counterclaims.wilmington trust now appeals,arguing the district court erroneously construed uhg contractual and statutory duties.uhg urges that we affirm the district court.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.carraher target,cir.summary judgment is proper where there are no genuine issues of material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.here the basic facts are undisputed,and the outstanding issues are purely legal questions of contract interpretation and statutory construction.resolution of the issues by summary judgment was therefore appropriate.
section of the indenture provides that its terms shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the state of new york.under new york principles of contract interpretation,t he words and phrases used by the parties must be given their plain meaning.brooke group jch syndicate,see also whitebox convertible arbitrage partners,lp ivax,cir.
wilmington trust advances three main arguments,all of which relate to uhg failure to file a timely.according to wilmington trust,this failure violated uhg obligations under i of the indenture,tia a,and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.we examine each in turn.
section i of the indenture 
wilmington trust argues that i of the indenture imposes an independent obligation on uhg to file timely sec reports and,within fifteen days afterwards,to forward copies of such reports to the trustee.under the trust interpretation,when uhg failed to file its on time,it not only ran afoul of the exchange act and sec regulations,but it also violated the indenture duties to its noteholders.uhg asserts that i imposes no independent obligation to make timely sec filings.rather,the provision merely requires the company to transmit to the trustee copies of whatever reports it actually files with the sec.based on this analysis uhg maintains that its indenture obligations were not even triggered until march when it finally filed its tardy.since the company forwarded a copy to wilmington trust within fifteen days of actual filing,uhg argues that it has not defaulted under the indenture.
section i,reduced to its essence,reads as follows the company shall cause copies of financial reports which the company is then required to file with the commission pursuant to section or d of the exchange act to be filed with the trustee within fifteen days of filing with the commission.wilmington trust argues that the plain meaning of the phrase then required to file imposes an independent obligation to file timely reports.wilmington trust correctly notes that the word then means at that time.but for our purposes the word placement and function within the sentence are just as important as its definition.
in i the phrase then required to file is part of a longer clause introduced by the relative pronoun which.the antecedent of which is clearly and unambiguously the word reports.thus,as a simple matter of syntax,the phrase the
