the james island public service district,which provides fire protection services to rural areas in south carolina,seeks protection under d of the consolidated farm and rural development act,b,against certain actions taken by the city of charleston.the district court found the district entitled to this protection.we affirm.
congress enacted the agricultural act of in part to provide insured loans to sparsely populated rural communities for a variety of otherwise unaffordable services and improvements.see,reprinted in.one portion of the act,formerly known as the farmers home administration act fmha,but renamed the consolidated farm and rural development act in,authorizes federal loans to local associations to provide water service and other essential community facilities to farmers and other rural residents.a.
as a condition of accepting these loans,congress has always required that 
the service provided or made available through any such association shall not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served by such association within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or other public body,or by the granting of any private franchise for similar service within such area during the term of such loan.
the very same year in which congress originally enacted this legislation,the south carolina legislature created the james island public service district james island or the district to provide various services,including fire protection,to rural residents.see act.in order to purchase and maintain equipment and facilities,james island,since its inception,has obtained loans from the federal government by selling bonds first to the fmha and then to its successor,the rural development association rda.
during this period,from to the present,the city of charleston has,at various times,annexed portions of james island as it is generally empowered to do under south carolina law.see ann.supp.after annexation,the city historically has provided services,including fire protection services,to those areas formerly served by james island.in addition,after annexation,the city has taxed the former james island residents,just as it taxes all of its residents.prior to annexation,these taxpayers would have paid taxes to james island,which used a portion of these taxes to pay down its federal debt to the rda and operate and maintain its fire department.
in,after a spate of annexations by the city,james island filed this action in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.james island alleged that by providing fire service and diverting tax monies away from james island,the city violated b.the district court granted james island motion for summary judgment and issued the requested declaration and a permanent injunction,prohibiting the city from curtailing fire service and directing the city to allocate to james island a portion of tax revenues from the annexed properties to cover both the debt service taxes and the operating of the james island public service district fire service.this appeal followed.
the united states constitution authorizes congress to lay and collect taxes,duties,imposts and excises,to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states.const.art.i,cl.incident to this power,congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds,and has repeatedly employed the power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.south dakota dole,d quoting fullilove klutznick,d.
although broad,the congressional spending power has limits.federal expenditures must benefit the general welfare,and the conditions imposed on their receipt must be unambiguous,reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure,and can not violate any independent constitutional prohibition.new york united states,d see also dole,at.further,in some circumstances the financial inducement to comply with a condition attached to funds offered by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
unquestionably,and unquestioned by the city,the rda funds provided to james island benefit the general welfare,and b imposes conditions on south carolina and its political subdivisions that are unambiguous and reasonably related to the purpose of the rda loans.thus,the first three restrictions on congress power under the spending clause have been met.moreover,as in dole,the conditional grant of federal money at issue here can not be held unconstitutional coercion simply by reason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.id.indeed,the city does not suggest that transgresses dole coercion limitation.
the city argues,however,that the fourth violation of any independent constitutional prohibition has not been met.specifically,the city contends that the state did not consent to the conditions of b,and thus the statute application violates the tenth amendment this claim ignores the fundamental precept that the tenth amendment itself does not act as a constitutional bar to congress spending power rather,the fourth restriction on congress spending power stands for the more general proposition that congress may not induce the states to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.kansas united states,cir emphasis added.see also new york,at.because the federal expenditure is supported by affirmative constitutional grants of power to congress under the spending clause,it is not inconsistent with the tenth amendment.dole,at.a perceived tenth amendment limitation on congressional regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants instead,we think that the fourth restriction stands for the unexceptionable proposition that the spending power may not be used to induce states to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional f or example,a grant of federal funds conditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action.
although the tenth amendment does not independently invalidate the conditions of a federal spending program,a state receiving federal funds must voluntarily and knowingly accept those conditions.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d l egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract in return for federal funds,the states agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.the legitimacy of congress power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the state voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the contract.
courts usually cite the supreme court language in pennhurst in the context of determining whether a federal spending program unambiguously notifies the fund recipient of the attached conditions,thus allowing for voluntary and knowing acceptance.see,bell atl,mci worldcom,cir congress grant to states of conditional funds is in the nature of a contract,the legitimacy of which rests on whether the state voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms.pennhurst i,at.by insisting that congress speak with a clear voice,we enable the states to exercise their choice knowingly,cognizant of the consequences of their acceptance from congress of a gift or gratuity.although there is no suggestion in this case that the conditions set forth in b are anything but clear,the city seems to argue that south carolina refused to agree or consent to those conditions.
the city apparently maintains that south carolina did not agree or consent to the conditions imposed by b because the state assertedly did not authorize james island to issue and sell general obligation paid and secured by general james island the federal government to receive rda loans.rather,according to the city,the state only authorized james island to issue revenue paid and secured by fees for fire obtain loans from the rda this argument must fail in light of express provisions in the south carolina constitution,the south carolina code,and the james island enabling act 
it is undisputed that the constitution of south ca
