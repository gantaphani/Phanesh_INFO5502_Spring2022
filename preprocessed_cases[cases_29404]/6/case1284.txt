this is an appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained defendants demurrer.the dispositive issue before us is whether the remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement is available in a class action asserting violation of the state unfair competition statutes.we conclude that it is not.we therefore affirm the judgment.
background 
in june,plaintiff jerome feitelberg filed this action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated and on behalf of the general public,against defendants credit suisse first boston llc csfb and its former employee frank quattrone.the complaint asserts that defendants engaged in unfair business practices,in violation of the california statutory scheme commonly known as the unfair competition law or ucl.bus,et see generally,witkin,summary of cal.law supp.equity.
the complaint makes these assertions defendant csfb issued biased stock research reports to gain favor with investment banking clients.as a result of this conflict of interest,the reports produced by csfb stock analysts contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims and failed to provide those holding the subject companies stock with a sound basis for evaluating their investments.this conduct is unfair and unlawful.it also violates rules of the new york stock exchange and the national association of securities dealers nasd.defendants made substantial profits received substantial compensation as a result of these wrongful and unfair business practices.
the complaint also notes the existence of a global settlement between wall street firms,including csfb and various regulatory bodies,including the securities and exchange commission sec and state regulators.as to csfb,the settlement was entered as a consent judgment in october in united states district court for the southern district of new york.that judgment imposed injunctive relief and monetary sanctions.
the complaint in this matter seeks class certification,an injunction,disgorgement of defendants gains,and other relief.
in july,the case was removed to federal court by defendants,based on their contention that the action satisfies the requirements of the federal securities litigation uniform standards act,slusa.see feitelberg credit suisse first boston llc,no.c sc wl.in october,the action was remanded to state court on plaintiff motion.id.wl at.in its order for remand,the federal district court concluded that the case did not fall within the standards for mandatory removal under slusa,because the complaint does not allege misrepresentations in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.id.at pp.
once the action was back in state court,defendants demurred to the complaint.they also moved to strike plaintiff prayer for nonrestitutionary disgorgement.in supporting papers,defendants argued that the court should sustain the demurrer because plaintiff failed to allege any injury.they also argued that the unfair competition law does not apply to this case,which involves securities,and they urged the court to apply the abstention doctrine.in support of their motion to strike plaintiff prayer for nonrestitutionary disgorgement,defendants argued that no such remedy is available under the ucl.in making that argument,defendants relied on two recent california supreme court decisions kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus,and korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply.
plaintiff opposed the demurrer and the motion to strike.in responding to the demurrer,plaintiff countered each of defendants arguments.he thus asserted that he sufficiently alleged injury,that his facts put him within the scope of the unfair competition law,and that the abstention doctrine does not apply here.in opposition to defendants motion to strike the prayer,plaintiff argued that the high court decisions in kraus and korea supply do not foreclose the remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement in cases such as this,where class certification is sought.
the hearing on defendants demurrer and motion to strike took place in march.all parties appeared through counsel.the court first asked plaintiff to justify the complaint based on section,claim for damages.plaintiff responded first we are not seeking damages.we are seeking an equitable remedy when pressed by the court to explain how such relief would be computed,plaintiff stated that the remedy sought would take into account the stockholders loss in value over the period of time that credit suisse published what we contend were unjustified reports.and then allocate the monies we have recovered,the disgorgement of profits that we seeking on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares traded and the dollar amounts involved.the court stated does not authorize that type of recovery.the only recovery that you permitted under is a restitutionary recovery based upon what has been received from the plaintiffs by the defendant improperly under the terms of the statute.plaintiff disagreed,arguing that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is an available remedy under section in the event the plaintiff is able to satisfy the court that the requirements of code of civil procedure section for class certification are met.the court was not persuaded by plaintiff argument.it therefore sustained the demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend.
in april,plaintiff gave notice that he did not intend to amend the complaint.
in may,the court entered judgment of dismissal.
this appeal ensued.in addition to their opening,response,and reply briefs,the parties submitted supplemental letter briefing prior to oral argument,which we have considered.
contentions 
on appeal,plaintiff renews the arguments that he made in the trial court.first,he argues,california law allows for disgorgement in unfair competition class action suits such as the one at issue here.next,plaintiff contends,he is entitled to relief on the facts alleged in his complaint,since he is suing on behalf of holders of securities,not buyers or sellers.third,plaintiff asserts,the abstention doctrine does not apply to this case.
defendants dispute each of plaintiff arguments.first,they contend,the remedy that plaintiff seeks is unavailable under unfair competition law,even in class actions.next,defendants argue,the unfair competition law does not apply to securities claims,such as those asserted by plaintiff.finally,defendants urge,this case calls for application of the abstention doctrine.
discussion 
as we explain,we conclude that the remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not available in statutory unfair competition cases,even those brought as class actions.our conclusion is compelled by the rationale of korea supply and it is consistent with amendments to the ucl statute.in light of that conclusion,we need not decide plaintiff other claims,a point we also explain more fully below.
to establish the proper framework for our analysis,we first set forth the standards that guide our review and the precepts that govern our task of statutory construction.we next describe the relevant legal principles.we then apply those principles to the case before us.
appellate review 
scope and standard of review 
this appeal challenges the judgment of dismissal that followed the order sustaining defendants demurrer.a demurrer tests the pleading alone,and not the evidence or the facts alleged.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.for that reason,we take as true the factual allegations of the complaint.construction protective services,tig specialty ins.cal th,d.see also,korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.

principles of statutory construction 
this case requires us to consider and apply the unfair competition law,statutes authorizing class actions,and the interplay between those provisions.for that reason,we begin by summarizing some familiar rules of statutory construction.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.in determining legislative intent,we first look to the statutory language itself.ibid.if the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,judicial construction is not necessary and a court should not indulge in it.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.
where judicial construction is necessary,the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.in cases involving two codes,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.tripp swoap cal d,overruled on another ground in frink prod cal d.
ii.general legal principles 
unfair competition law 
as the california supreme court explained in korea supply,the ucl prohibits unfair competition,including unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business acts.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.see.a ucl action is an equitable action by means of which a plaintiff may recover money or property obtained from the plaintiff or persons represented by the plaintiff through unfair or unlawful business practices.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.the ucl protects consumers as well as business competitors.barquis merchants collection cal d,communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
the ucl covers a wide range of conduct.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.section borrows violations from other laws by making them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices.citation.in addition,under section,a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.ibid.
nevertheless,some conduct is beyond the reach of the ucl.for example,as one court recently concluded,section does not apply to securities transactions.bowen ziasun technologies,th,d.see generally stern,bus.practice the rutter group,to stern.
furthermore,under the abstention doctrine,courts may decline to decide ucl claims where a regulatory or administrative mechanism addresses the conduct at issue.see,desert healthcare dist.pacificare fhp,th,d see generally stern,supra,to.the notion of abstention in the context of the ucl originally arose in cases involving the intersection of federal and state law.desert healthcare,at,d.but the notion applies more broadly.id.at,d.as has been said,because the remedies available under the ucl,namely injunctions and restitution,are equitable in nature,courts have the discretion to abstain from employing them.where a ucl action would drag a court of equity into an area of complex economic policy,equitable abstention is appropriate.id.at,d.
while the scope of conduct covered by the ucl is broad,its remedies are limited.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.suits asserting statutory ucl claims are equitable actions.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.for that reason,compensatory damages are not available in such suits.ibid.
the ucl evolved from a amendment to civil code section.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,see,former,as amended by stats,ch.with respect to remedies,the amendment provided express authority for courts to enjoin acts of unfair competition,but it did not explicitly empower courts to order monetary relief.kraus,at,d,korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.forty years later,in the jayhill case,the california supreme court recognized the courts inherent equitable power to order restitution under the ucl,notwithstanding the absence of explicit statutory authorization to do so.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,discussing people superior court jayhill cal d.three years after jayhill,express authority to order restitution was added to civil code section,the predecessor to section.stats,ch.korea supply,at,d.but this revision of the act was intended to codify,not change,the remedies available to a trial court under the ucl.ibid.the following year,the legislature removed the unfair competition law from civil code section and placed it in the business and professions code stats,ch.corbett superior court th,d.
more recently,the ucl was amended by voter initiative,with the passage of proposition in november.as relevant here,those amendments limit private representative actions to persons who meet the standing requirements set forth in section,which include injury in fact,and comply with class action certification requirements set forth in code of civil procedure section,as amended by proposition.
the question of whether proposition applies retroactively is now pending before the california supreme court.see,californians for disability rights mervyn th,d,review granted april,cal th,d.as we explain below,the answer to that question does not affect the outcome of this case.
relevant provisions 
the relief available under the ucl is addressed in section.that section currently reads any person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments,including the appointment of a receiver,as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,as defined in this chapter,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure,but these limitations do not apply to claims brought under this chapter by the attorney general,or any district attorney,county counsel,city attorney,or city prosecutor in this state,as amended by.
standing is addressed in section.that section currently reads actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by the attorney general or any district attorney or by any county counsel authorized by agreement with the district attorney in actions involving violation of a county ordinance,or any city attorney of a city,or city and county,having a population in excess of,and,with the consent of the district attorney,by a city prosecutor in any city having a city prosecutor or,with the consent of the district attorney,by a city attorney in any city and county in the name of the people of the state of california upon their own complaint or upon the complaint of any board,officer,person,corporation or association or by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition,as amended by.
ucl remedies 
section authorizes the court to fashion remedies to prevent,deter,and compensate for unfair business practices.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.but as the california supreme court explained in korea supply,overall,only two remedies are available to redress violations of the ucl injunctive relief and restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs may combat unfair competition by seeking an injunction against unfair business practices.actual direct victims of unfair competition may obtain restitution as well.id.at,d.this observation follows from the statutory language itself.the first sentence of section provides that those engaging in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the second sentence of section recognizes the court power to prevent acts of unfair competition and to restore money or property acquired by means of such unfair competition.nevertheless,the statute provides,the remedies and penalties available under the ucl are cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.
injunction 
for more than years,the ucl statute has expressly provided for injunctive relief.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.in,in the barquis case,the california supreme court confirmed that private plaintiffs could use the unfair competition law for injunctive relief.corbett superior court,supra,th at,d,citing barquis merchants collection,supra,cal d.but an injunction must seek to prevent harm,not to punish the wrongdoer.brockey moore th,d.thus,the injunctive remedy should not be exercised in the absence of any evidence that the acts are likely to be repeated in the future.cisneros registry,th,d.
restitution 
the object of restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.consistent with that objective,restitutionary awards encompass quantifiable sums one person owes to another cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.such awards represent money that once had been in the possession of the person to whom it is to be restored.id.at,d.
the notion of restoring something to a victim of unfair competition includes two separate components.the offending party must have obtained something to which it was not entitled and the victim must have given up something which he or she was entitled to keep.day v.at t th,d.restitution thus is available where a defendant has wrongfully acquired funds or property in which a plaintiff has an ownership or vested interest.alch superior court th,d alch.see korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,kraus,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,in the ucl context restitution means the return of money to those persons from whom it was taken or who had an ownership interest in it.madrid perot systems th,d madrid.
disgorgement 
disgorgement generally is a broader remedy than restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.it may include a restitutionary element,but is not so limited.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.put another way,there are two types of disgorgement.frieman san rafael rock quarry,th,d.with restitutionary disgorgement,the focus is on the plaintiff loss.it is typified by the situation where the disgorged money or property came from the prospective plaintiff in the first instance.korea supply,at,d.restitutionary disgorgement also refers to situations where it is not possible to restore the money to the specific direct victims of the unfair practice.kraus,at,d.by contrast,with nonrestitutionary disgorgement,the focus is on the defendant gain from the unfair practice the plaintiff need not have suffered a loss.see frieman san rafael rock quarry,at,d plaintiffs seeking nonrestitutionary disgorgement had no individual monetary loss that may be redressed by disgorgement.
as the california supreme court held,disgorgement of money obtained through an unfair business practice is an available remedy in a representative action only to the extent that it constitutes restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,discussing kraus,supra,cal th,d,italics added.in korea supply,the california supreme court reached the same conclusion with respect to individual actions.there,the question was whether disgorgement of profits that is not restitutionary in nature is an available remedy for an individual private plaintiff under the ucl.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the high court answered that question in the negative,saying we hold that nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is not an available remedy in an individual action under the ucl.id.at,d.as the california supreme court explained this court has never approved of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits as a remedy under the ucl.while prior cases discussing the ucl may have characterized some of the relief available as disgorgement,we were referring to the restitutionary form of disgorgement,and not to the nonrestitutionary type sought here by plaintiff.id.at,d.
class actions 
courts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.citations.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.
generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.to obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citations.other relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.linder,supra,cal th at,d.
class actions are provided only as a means to enforce substantive law.city of san jose superior court cal d.accord,washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d.class certification does not serve to enlarge substantive rights or remedies.altering the substantive law to accommodate procedure would be to confuse the means with the sacrifice the goal for the going.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
interplay with the unfair competition law 
there is no inherent incompatibility between the unfair competition law and class actions.both consumer class actions and representative ucl actions serve important roles in the enforcement of consumers rights.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.as stated in an appellate decision published prior to proposition,a trial court may certify a ucl claim as a class action when the statutory requirements of section of the code of civil procedure are met.corbett superior court,supra,th at,d.that authority is now explicit in the amended statute,which authorizes the pursuit of representative claims or relief on behalf of others provided that the claimant complies with section of the code of civil procedure,as amended by.
class action remedies 
one recognized method for disbursing disgorged funds in class action litigation is fluid recovery.the term fluid recovery refers to the application of the equitable doctrine of cy prés in the context of a modern class action.granberry islay investments cal th,fn,d,citing state of california levi strauss cal d.see generally karas,the role of fluid recovery in consumer protection litigation kraus trinity management services cal.fluid recovery developed as a means by which to distribute the residue of a favorable class action judgment remaining after payment to those class members who have sufficient interest in obtaining recovery and can produce the documentation necessary to file individual claims.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.fluid recovery is now expressly authorized by statute.code civ.proc.
the propriety of fluid recovery in a particular case depends upon its usefulness in fulfilling the purposes of the underlying cause of action.state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d at,fluid recovery methods may be employed in appropriate cartwright act cases.it may well be that in a proper case a court may order disgorgement of profits into a fluid recovery fund in a ucl class action at least one case has so held.alch,supra,th at,d,citing corbett superior court,supra,th at,d.fluid recovery in class actions,however,is merely a method of paying out damages after they have been awarded.alch,at,d.the fluid recovery mechanism does not enlarge the remedies available under the applicable substantive law.ibid.
iii.analysis 
nonrestitutionary disgorgement 
as explained above,the california supreme court has recognized limits on disgorgement in ucl actions.in kraus,a representative ucl action,the high court observed that restitution is the sole available monetary remedy.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.in korea supply,an individual action,the court reached the same conclusion.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.
as was true in korea supply,the remedy sought by plaintiff in this case is not restitutionary because plaintiff does not have an ownership interest in the money it seeks to recover from defendants.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.nor does he have a vested interest in the monetary relief he seeks.ibid.
as we now explain,the nonrestitutionary remedy that plaintiff seeks is not available under the ucl,regardless of whether the claim is prosecuted as a class action.in reaching that conclusion,we are in accord with the third district recent decision in madrid,supra,th at,d.
nonrestitutionary disgorgement is impermissible under the ucl.
there is neither explicit nor implicit legislative authorization for allowing nonrestitutionary disgorgement.as our high court stated in kraus,restitution is the only monetary remedy expressly authorized by section.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.moreover,it is the only monetary remedy implicitly authorized by the statute.there is nothing in the legislative history that suggests that the legislature intended to provide relief in the form of nonrestitutionary disgorgement.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.given that there is nothing in the express language of the statute or its legislative history indicating that the legislature intended to provide such a remedy,the remedy is not available,citing kraus,supra,cal th at,d.thus,no statutory authority allows a judge to order a defendant to disgorge all profits to a plaintiff who does not have an ownership interest in those profits.korea supply,at,d.
nor do courts have inherent equitable power to order nonrestitutionary disgorgement.a court can not,under the equitable powers of section,award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.as the statutory language makes clear,the equitable powers of a court are to be used to prevent practices that constitute unfair competition and to restore to any person in interest any money or property acquired through unfair practices.id.at,d.the prevent prong of the statute reflects the legislative goal of deterrence,but that objective need not be accomplished through monetary relief.id.at,d.the fact that the restore prong of section is the only reference to monetary penalties in this section indicates that the legislature intended to limit the available monetary remedies under the act,fn.omitted.
the california supreme court has explained the policy reasons that underlie this limitation of monetary remedies.the nonrestitutionary disgorgement remedy sought by plaintiff closely resembles a claim for damages,something that is not permitted under the ucl.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.allowing the plaintiff in this case to recover nonrestitutionary disgorgement under the ucl would enable it to obtain tort damages while bypassing the burden of proving the elements of its tort claim.id.at,d.the result could be that the ucl would be used as an substitute for a tort or contract action,something the legislature never intended.ibid.in addition,it is possible that due process concerns would arise if an individual business competitor could recover disgorgement of profits under the ucl.while restitution is limited to restoring money or property to direct victims of an unfair practice,a potentially unlimited number of individual plaintiffs could recover nonrestitutionary disgorgement.allowing such a remedy would expose defendants to multiple suits and the risk of duplicative liability without the traditional limitations on standing.id.at,d.overall,limiting monetary relief to restitution honors the balance struck in this state unfair competition law between broad liability and limited relief.id.at,d.
for all these reasons,monetary relief in a ucl action is limited to restitution.permitting a nonrestitutionary remedy would be at odds with the language and history of the statute,previous decisions construing the ucl,and public policy.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.
the nature of the litigation as a class action does not change the result.
notwithstanding kraus and korea supply,plaintiff contends,nonrestitutionary disgorgement is available in class actions.he argues the holding of korea supply is limited to individual actions and does not address class cases such as the case at bar.as plaintiff correctly observes,the court there did expressly limit its discussion to individual private actions brought under the ucl.korea supply,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the court thus distinguished public actions,where civil penalties may be collected from a defendant.ibid.the high court also remarked further,in kraus we noted that the legislature has authorized disgorgement into a fluid recovery fund in class actions.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.these issues are not before us,and therefore we need not address them further.ibid.in light of that limitation,one court has observed the issue of the availability of nonrestitutionary disgorgement in a properly certified ucl class action was not resolved in korea supply.frieman san rafael rock quarry,supra,th at,d.
although korea supply arose in the context of an individual action,its rationale applies beyond that context.in our view,it controls here.see madrid,supra,th at,d alch,supra,th at,d.
a class action aggregates individual claims,which makes it appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.blue chip stamps superior court cal d.but class action status does not alter the parties underlying substantive rights.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at,madrid,supra,th at,d.if a specific form of relief is foreclosed to claimants as individuals,it remains unavailable to them even if they congregate into a class.
although fluid class recovery is not improper in class actions in general,the specific law under which the action is brought might preclude the use of such a damage distribution device.bruno superior court d.thus,for example,the cartwright act permits fluid class recovery.ibid.see also,state of california levi strauss,supra,cal d at.the question here is whether the ucl permits nonrestitutionary fluid class recovery.the answer is no.
our conclusion that nonrestitutionary relief is unavailable in class actions brought under the ucl finds support in two recent appellate decisions,madrid and alch.
in madrid,the plaintiff attempted to pursue a class action under the ucl on behalf of california electricity customers.madrid,supra,th at,d.he did not seek to recover utility overcharges.id.at,d.instead,he sought an order requiring the defendants to return profits earned from their unfair business practices.id.at,d.the court rejected plaintiff claim to that remedy,saying that his assertion that defendants received gain does not make a viable ucl claim unless the gain was money in which plaintiff had a vested interest.id.at,d.plaintiff also claimed that because he filed the lawsuit as a class action certification of which was denied by the trial court,he is entitled to pursue nonrestitutionary disgorgement of wrongfully obtained profits,because fluid recovery of disgorgement is a remedy available in class actions.id.at,d,fn.omitted.that claim fared no better.after analyzing the relevant authorities,the court concluded that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not an available remedy in a ucl class action.id.at,d.
in alch,a group of writers sued as a class under the fair employment and housing act,asserting age discrimination.alch,supra,th at,d.they did not seek disgorgement of unlawfully obtained profits into a fluid recovery fund they sought an award of classwide backpay into a fluid recovery fund.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the court framed the issue as follows the question is not whether the trial court could order fluid class recovery of a damages award it is whether the trial court has the authority to award nonrestitutionary backpay under the ucl in the first instance.it does not.id.at,d.
in supplemental letter briefing,plaintiff cites three recent cases,which,he says,recognize the availability of nonrestitutionary disgorgement in class actions.those cases are state altus finance cal th,fn,d,johnson ford motor cal th,fn,d,and fireside bank superior court th,d.none involves the interplay between the ucl and class action litigation,and none persuades us to a different conclusion.
in this case,plaintiff seeks nonrestitutionary monetary relief.that remedy is foreclosed by the rationale of korea supply.
as in korea supply,the analysis logically begins with the statutory authorization for relief under the ucl,found in section.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.an examination of section discloses no basis for granting nonrestitutionary monetary relief here.korea supply,at,d,see alch,supra,th at,d.
the prevent prong of the statute does not authorize such relief.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,alch,supra,th at,d,frieman san rafael rock quarry,supra,th at,d not reaching plaintiffs claim that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is available under this prong.as the court said in kraus section also grants the court the power to make orders necessary to prevent the use of unfair business practices.such orders may encompass broader restitutionary relief,including disgorgement of all money so obtained even when it may not be possible to restore all of that money to direct victims of the practice.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
conversely,the restore prong of the statute demonstrates that the legislature intended to limit the available monetary remedies under the act to restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.thus,there is no explicit statutory authorization to grant nonrestitutionary disgorgement in a case such as this.nor does the legislative history suggest an implicit grant of such authority.id.at,d.
beyond the statutory analysis,other considerations support the application of korea supply rationale here.for one thing,as that case makes clear,courts lack inherent equitable power to order nonrestitutionary disgorgement.a court can not,under the equitable powers of section,award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,some of the policy considerations cited in korea supply apply in this case.thus,for example,there is the same risk here that nonrestitutionary disgorgement under the ucl would enable plaintiff to obtain tort damages while bypassing the burden of proving his claim.id.at,d.the court in korea supply also cited due process concerns in reaching its decision,including the lack of any limit on the number of times the remedy could be sought or any limit on the monetary relief available.id.at,d.with class certification,that particular concern is attenuated,though not entirely eliminated.dean witter reynolds,superior court d.discussing the threat to defendant from persons not bound by the class action judgment.overall,we conclude the factors cited in korea supply support its application in the context of this class action.
as plaintiff points out,there is another statute in play here,which specifically permits fluid recovery in class of the code of civil procedure.as we have already explained,however,that procedural provision does not override the substantive remedial provisions of the unfair competition law.bruno superior court,supra,d at.the tail does not wag the dog.city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at.
conclusion 
in korea supply,the california supreme court reaffirmed that a nonrestitutionary remedy would be at odds with the unfair competition law language and history,with the high court own prior decisions,and with public policy.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.although korea supply involved an individual private plaintiff,its rationale has broader application.korea supply definitively construes the unfair competition law,particularly its remedies as set forth in section.because the ucl is the specific substantive law from which plaintiff claims arise,it controls the remedies that may be obtained in the class action context.bruno superior court,supra,d at.under the logic and compulsion of korea supply,we conclude that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not available to a private plaintiff,regardless of the nature of the ucl proceeding as a class action.
stock holdings 
as explained above,the unfair competition law covers a wide range of conduct.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.but its reach is not unlimited.the question of whether the unfair competition law applies to securities transactions has not been addressed by our state high court,but there is appellate case law holding that the ucl does not apply to such claims.bowen ziasun technologies,supra,th at,d.in addition,the abstention doctrine may apply to ucl claims,desert healthcare dist.pacificare fhp,supra,th at,d.
in this case,plaintiff contends that his claims are within the reach of the ucl because they arise from the holding of corporate stock,not from its purchase or sale.a similar claim by plaintiff was rejected in a federal district court decision.feitelberg merrill lynch d,aff.
we need not resolve the issue here,given our conclusion regarding available remedies under the ucl.in this case,plaintiff seeks only nonrestitutionary monetary relief.as we have just explained,he is not entitled to that remedy.for that reason,plaintiff ucl claim necessarily falls and we need not decide whether the ucl applies to the challenged conduct.
injunctive relief
