opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal by a bankruptcy trustee from a final order of the district court entered august,affirming two orders of the bankruptcy court.following a state foreclosure action and the satisfaction of the foreclosure judgment,the bankruptcy court granted the motion under b section b to award it attorneys fees and expenses for services its attorneys rendered in the state and bankruptcy courts relating to the foreclosure.the trustee argues that the is not entitled to fees under section b because the note and mortgage,which included a provision for attorneys fees and expenses,were extinguished by their merger into the final judgment of foreclosure.the trustee further argues that a potential exception to the merger doctrine predicated on the parties intent to preserve the mortgagee right to seek its attorneys fees after entry and satisfaction of the foreclosure judgment does not apply because the terms of the mortgage did not evidence that the parties had any such intent.we agree with the trustee and will reverse the order of the district court.
ii.factual background and procedural history 
on or around february,the debtor,a p diversified technologies realty,executed a promissory note in favor of fleet bank,fleet in the amount of secured by a mortgage on the debtor property.the mortgage provided,in relevant part 
agreement to pay attorneys fees and expenses.in the event that the mortgagor should default under any of the provisions of the note or any other loan document and the mortgagee shall employ attorneys or incur other costs and expenses for the collection of payments due or to become due,the realization upon any collateral,or for the enforcement or performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the mortgagor of any guarantor under any loan document,whether by litigation or otherwise,the mortgagor agrees that it will pay to the mortgagee,on demand,the reasonable fee of such attorneys,together with all other costs and expenses incurred by the mortgagee,and that all of said costs and expenses shall be secured by the mortgage.
at emphasis added.the mortgage also provided that t he mortgagor waives and releases,to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so,all benefit of any present or future moratorium law or any other present or future law,regulation or judicial decisions which conflict with any provision herein or in the other loan documents.at.
the debtor defaulted,leading fleet to institute a foreclosure action in the superior court of new jersey.while the foreclosure proceedings were pending,the debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court,which automatically stayed the foreclosure,but the bankruptcy court granted fleet relief from the stay and allowed it to continue with the foreclosure.ultimately,the bankruptcy court converted the debtor case to a chapter proceeding and appointed catherine youngman as the chapter trustee for the debtor estate on may.after the stay was lifted,fleet obtained a final judgment of foreclosure in the amount of which included in counsel fees awarded to fleet in accordance with court rule a rule a as well as substantial taxes and interest not in dispute here fleet collected the full amount of the judgment through the foreclosure process.
the trustee subsequently filed a motion in the bankruptcy court to expunge fleet claim.fleet opposed the motion and for attorneys fees pursuant to section b.the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion and granted fleet motion,awarding attorneys fees in the amount of and expenses in the amount of.it appears that the court contemplated that the trustee would pay the fees and expenses from the debtor estate but that this will not be possible as the debtor estate is valued at far less than the fees and expenses awarded.nevertheless,the trustee appealed to the district court from the bankruptcy court orders.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court orders awarding attorneys fees and expenses to fleet and denying the trustee motion to expunge fleet claim.although the district court acknowledged that the merger doctrine,which normally extinguishes a creditor rights under a mortgage once judgment is entered,applied in this case,it held that it is clear from the language of the agreement that the parties intended their rights under the mortgage to be preserved beyond any judgment,more specifically,the state court foreclosure judgment.at.thus,in the district court view,fleet right to recover fees and expenses was not extinguished by merger of the mortgage into the judgment.in reaching its result the court relied on language we already have quoted contained in the mortgage,which provided that t he mortgagor waives and releases,to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so,all benefit of any present or future moratorium law or any other present or future law,regulation of judicial decisions.at.the district court also found that the amount of attorneys fees awarded by the bankruptcy court was reasonable and that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in awarding them.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under a as the bankruptcy court orders were final and appealable.see in re walsh trucking,cir we believe that the considerations that led this court to adopt the more flexible standards of finality in reviewing bankruptcy proceedings are equally applicable in the context of appeals of orders of the bankruptcy court to the district court.our determination in this regard comports with those of other courts of appeals in similar circumstances.see,in re smith,cir court of appeals has jurisdiction under d and on an appeal from a district order affirming a bankruptcy court award of attorneys fees in re wade,cir several types of bankruptcy orders are final and appealable,for example,orders allowing or denying claims.in re baudoin,cir holding that an order allowing a proof of claim is,likewise,a final judgment.
we have jurisdiction under d,and.inasmuch as the district court sits as an appellate court in bankruptcy cases,our review of the district court order is plenary.in re visual,cir.
iv.discussion 
in general,new jersey courts are said to follow the american rule,under which parties bear their own litigation costs,including attorneys fees.see trump castle hotel casino.rule a provides,however,that,in actions for the foreclosure of a mortgage,the prevailing plaintiff is entitled to attorneys fees.although rule a limits the amount of recoverable attorneys fees through a percentage formula,the bankruptcy code will,if applicable,preempt this rule,see in re kord enters.ii,cir,as it provides 
to the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which,after any recovery under subsection c of this section,is greater than the amount of such claim,there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim,interest on such claim,and any reasonable fees,costs,or charges provided for under the agreement or state statute under which such claim arose.
notwithstanding section b,the trustee asserts that fleet possessed no entitlement to counsel fees under section b because the note and mortgage on which it relied for its section b claim had been extinguished by merger into the final judgment of foreclosure.appellant br.at.in response and in urging us to affirm the award of attorneys fees and expenses,fleet argues that the loan documents clearly evidence the parties intent for the exception to the merger doctrine to apply.appellee br.at.like the district court,fleet emphasizes the fact that the debtor waived and released the benefit of all laws,regulations,and judicial decisions.
we agree with the trustee for the following reasons.under the merger doctrine,a contract is deemed to merge with the judgment,thereby depriving a plaintiff from being able to assert claims based on the terms and provisions of the contractual instrument.in re roach,cir in new jersey,as in many states,the mortgage is merged into the final judgment of foreclosure and the mortgage contract is extinguished.see
