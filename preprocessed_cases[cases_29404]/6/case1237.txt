this is an appeal from judgment against plaintiff and appellant william opp hereafter appellant.judgment was entered after the court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant and respondent paul fire marine insurance company hereafter respondent.we affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
appellant was at all relevant times a california licensed building contractor.appellant was also president of mountain connection,a montana corporation hereafter mci.mci did not hold a california building contractor license.on july,as president of mci,appellant executed a subcontract with,the general contractor for work at california state university,stanislaus.appellant inserted his individual contractor license number where the various contract documents called for a license number.
prior to paying its subcontractors,filed for bankruptcy.respondent had issued a payment bond on behalf of.mci sued respondent under the payment bond.when respondent asserted that mci was unlicensed,appellant filed a first amended complaint substituting as plaintiff william opp dba mountain connection and mountain connection,except as it was alleged to be merely a fictitious business name under which appellant did business,mci,as a separate entity,dropped out of the case.
respondent answered the first amended complaint and filed a motion for summary judgment.the motion was based on documentary evidence that appellant was not a party to the contract and did not have standing to bring this action.appellant countered with two basic types of evidence.first,appellant sought to establish that he supervised most of the work under the subcontract.second,he tried to show that everyone involved,including,had treated mci merely as an alter ego or a fictitious name under which appellant did business.the trial court excluded most of this evidence as hearsay and irrelevant.
the court concluded mci,not appellant,was the party to the contract and had performed the work under the contract.it concluded appellant was not a party to the contract and use of his contractor license number on the contract documents did not make him a party to the contract.in addition,the court concluded mci was not entitled to recover on the payment bond because business and professions code section precluded recovery by the unlicensed corporation.the court granted the motion for summary judgment and thereafter entered judgment for respondent and against appellant.
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
on an appeal from summary judgment,w e review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.merrill navegar,cal th,d,italics added.appellant alleges a number of erroneous evidentiary rulings by the trial court,implying that upon consideration of all proper evidence,triable issues of fact will appear.however,we do not reach these evidentiary claims because,even if error,none of these exclusions of evidence was prejudicial all the items of evidence were proffered in support of appellant various substantive theories the theories fail as a matter of law so,in this sense,it does not matter what evidence may support the theories.
as to our review of the merits of the appeal,w hen the defendant is the moving party,he must show either that one or more elements of a cause of action can not be established,or there is a complete defense.code civ,subd.o.once that burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to that cause of action or defense.ibid.we review the trial court decision to grant defendant summary judgment de novo.we review the ruling,not the rationale.silva lucky stores,th,d.
appellant asserts two areas in which he contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent.we will address each area separately 
a.the court did not weigh the evidence or resolve factual disputes 
appellant complains the trial court accepted respondent evidence that mci did the work under the contract and was the sole subcontractor on the contract.he says the evidence showed appellant put his own contractor license number on the contract with,that he supervised most of the work,and that dealt with him as a sole proprietor,doing business under the name of mountain construction.
corporations,of course,can not physically perform work they can only work through human agents and employees.if the issue were who physically performed the work,no corporation could ever perform on a contract at all and there would be no practical reason for corporate contractor licenses.
however,business and professions code section makes it clear that the contractor license is not required for the person who does the work but,instead,for the person who is the building contractor.all further section references are to the business and professions code.section,subdivision a provides,in part,that no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract.a contractor,including a corporation so acting,for the purposes of this chapter,is synonymous with builder and,within the meaning of this chapter,a contractor is any person who undertakes to or offers to undertake to,or purports to have the capacity to undertake to,or submits a bid to,or does himself or herself or by or through others,construct,alter,or repair,inter alia,a structure,italics added.
the issue,then,is not who did the work,but who was engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.the evidence was undisputed that there was a valid corporation called mountain connection,and that it was,in this case,engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.the evidence was undisputed that the contracting party on the subcontract was mci and that the complaint sought compensation for the performance of an act or contract where a license is required.accordingly,on the face of it,mci was the contracting party and its suit should be barred by section.
appellant,however,contends the evidence excluded and disregarded by the trial court established a triable issue of fact about either a whether mountain connection,was simply a fictitious business name under which appellant did business as alleged in the first amended complaint or b whether appellant was in some manner a joint party to the subcontract because he used his individual contractor license on all documents not alleged in the complaint.
the first claim is barred as a matter of law.no person shall adopt any fictitious business name which includes corporation,incorporated,or unless that person is a corporation organized pursuant to the laws of this state or some other jurisdiction,subd.a.further,section,subdivision a provides,in relevant part no person transacting business under a fictitious business name contrary to the provisions of this chapter,or his assignee,may maintain any action upon or on account of any contract made,or transaction had,in the fictitious business name in any court of this state until the fictitious business name statement has been executed,filed,and published as required by this chapter.not only is there no suggestion in the record that appellant has attempted to comply with this requirement,such an attempt would be futile section,subdivision c states a county clerk shall not accept a fictitious business name statement which would be in violation of this section.accordingly,there is no evidence that could establish appellant first proposition,that appellant individually was merely doing business as mountain connection,and was,therefore,the actual contracting party.
the only subcontractor named in the subcontract is mci,and the contract was
