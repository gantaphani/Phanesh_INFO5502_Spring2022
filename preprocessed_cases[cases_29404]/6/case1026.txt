national city bank of kentucky ncb appeals the bankruptcy court decision,affirmed by the district court,that ncb failed to perfect a security interest in a fund held in escrow for alabama land and minerals corporation alabama land and resources corporation.on for summary judgment,the district court characterized the fund subject funds as a certificate of deposit cd and reasoned that ncb interest was unperfected because ncb did not possess a certificate.the district court granted summary judgment to the bankruptcy estates of alabama land and,represented by andr√© toffel trustee.whether ncb interest was perfected turns on how the subject funds are characterized.we conclude that the district court characterization results in the elevation of form over substance,and reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the trustee.because the subject funds are more properly characterized as a deposit account governed by the common law of the pledge,we conclude that ncb interest in the subject fund was perfected,and reverse the district court denial of ncb motion for summary judgment.
background 
in late,ncb entered into three agreements with alabama land.first,ncb issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit for alabama land in favor of insurance company in the amount of.second,ncb and alabama land entered into a reimbursement and security agreement in which alabama land agreed to reimburse ncb should draw on the letter of credit third,alabama land and its parent,applied for an escrow account in which to keep the subject funds unless and until requested payment under the letter of credit.under the escrow agreement,alabama land and had the right to request that ncb invest the subject funds in a cd.alabama land and deposited the subject funds and requested investment,and ncb created cd.it is undisputed that ncb never issued a certificate to represent cd.
on june,both alabama land and filed voluntary chapter petitions,which were subsequently converted into chapter.on august,presented a million sight draft on the letter of credit.at that point,ncb requested that the trustee for the bankruptcy estate provide ncb with and the fee for drawing the funds.the trustee did not do so.ncb paid to on august in accordance with the letter of credit,and retained cd 
ncb then sought relief from the automatic stay to apply the fund to the obligations of alabama land and.the bankruptcy court denied relief to ncb,and granted summary judgment to the trustee.ncb appealed to the district court.on for summary judgment,the district court denied ncb motion and granted the trustee motion.ncb appeals.
ii.discussion 
an appellate court reviews de novo the grant of summary judgment by a bankruptcy court.in re optical,cir.like the bankruptcy court and the district court,we will apply kentucky state law.see krs b providing that perfection of a security interest in collateral is governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the collateral is when the last event occurs on which is based the assertion that the security interest is perfected or unperfected.the uniform commercial code ucc has been adopted in kentucky.krs.it is relevant that we are applying the version of the ucc in effect at the time of the transactions we are not applying revised article,which took effect in kentucky on july.krs.
whether we uphold the ruling of the bankruptcy court turns on our characterization of the subject funds.according to the bankruptcy court,the subject funds should be characterized as a cd.relevant kentucky law provides that a cd is a negotiable instrument,krs,and that the only method of perfecting an interest in such an instrument is possession.krs.the bankruptcy court reasoned that because ncb did not possess the instrument,the certificate,ncb interest was not perfected.
we acknowledge that multiple characteristics of the subject funds support the bankruptcy court decision ncb created an account labeled cd,alabama land received a receipt for the creation of a cd,the subject fund generated interest and matured periodically.the bankruptcy court decision,however,is fundamentally flawed in two respects.the first flaw is global the substance of the transaction was ncb transfer of credit in consideration for alabama land collateral.the second flaw of the bankruptcy court decision is technical the cd was not represented by a negotiable instrument.as such,possession of the certificate was not the appropriate test for perfection.
first we address the substance of the transaction.kentucky law has long recognized that t he substance instead of the form of a transaction must control in its interpretation and in determining the rights or liabilities of the parties.ducker latonia deposit bank.reading the three agreements between ncb and alabama land,it is clear that the substance of the transaction was the creation of a letter of credit.ncb issued the letter in favor of the insurance company,ex.a.in return,alabama land agreed that 
if at any time and from time to time ncb require s collateral or additional collateral security,we agree to deliver,convey,transfer assign to ncb as security for our obligations and liabilities hereunder howsoever created,arising or evidenced,whether joint or several,direct or indirect,absolute or contingent,now or hereafter existing,due or to become due collectively,liabilities,such collateral security as you may request.
ex.b.the letter of credit escrow account agreement makes it clear that ncb extended the letter of credit in exchange for collateral in consideration of the issuance of the letter of credit the parties hereto hereby agree on the date hereof,to pay into the letter of credit account,an amount of cash equal to one hundred percent of the letter of credit amount,ex.c.alabama land and its parent,explicitly granted ncb a security interest the applicant does hereby sell,mortgage and grant a security interest to the bank in the monies deposited in the letter of credit account security interest,such security interest perfected by the bank possession and control of such monies.id.at.there is no question that the substance of the transaction was the extension of credit by ncb in consideration for a security interest in the subject funds deposited by alabama land 
the trustee responds by pointing to a provision in the letter of credit escrow account agreement the applicant may request that the bank invest some or all of the cash in the letter of credit account in one or more certificates of deposit issued by the bank,ex.c.while it is true that ncb invested the subject funds in a cd in response to alabama land request,this fact does not alter the substance of the transaction between the parties.ncb did not relinquish its security interest in the subject funds by investing them in a cd.had alabama land not requested investment,or if ncb had refused the request,the substance of the agreement between the parties would be the same the only difference would be that alabama land would have earned no interest.
with the global flaw addressed,we turn to the technical flaw in the bankruptcy court decision application of ucc article.because cd was not evidenced by a written fact not in cd is not governed by article.the issue is definitional.under the version of article in effect at the time of these transactions,a cd is defined as an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money.krs emphasis added.an instrument is defined as a negotiable instrument.krs.a negotiable instrument is defined as 
an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money if it 
a is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder 
b is payable on demand or at a definite time and 
c does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money 
krs.the only written evidence that the fund had been invested in a cd was a confirmation and advice statement issued periodically by ncb,ex.because the confirmation and advice statement is not payable to bearer or to orde
