appellants eduardo gil eduardo and rafael gil rafael appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court granted the demurrer of respondent bank of america,national association bank to their second amended complaint.we are asked to determine whether the california uniform commercial code supersedes a payee common law cause of action for negligence where the collecting bank accepts a check with a missing indorsement.we hold that the negligence cause of action stated here is subsumed in a conversion action dictated by the california uniform commercial code.the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
contentions 
appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting bank demurrer because the california uniform commercial code does not supersede common law negligence claims where bank paid on a check with a missing indorsement under the california uniform commercial code,bank is liable for conversion and appellants stated a cause of action for misrepresentation.
facts and procedural background 
appellants filed the operative second amended complaint sac on october,against bank and other defendants for,among other causes of action,misrepresentation,negligence,and conversion 
the sac alleged the following.eduardo and his son rafael,owned a house in whittier,which was damaged by fire in january.in response to appellants claim,on march,allstate insurance company drew a check on its account at bank,in the amount of made payable to eduardo,washington mutual,and insurance adjuster claims west adjusters the check.washington mutual was the of the whittier residence.reyes construction company reyes contracted with appellants to repair the whittier residence.allen connette connette,an employee of claims west adjusters,and marco galindo galindo,an employee of reyes,falsely represented to eduardo that upon eduardo indorsement,they would present the check to washington mutual.after eduardo indorsed the check,it was accepted by bank and deposited into reyes account at a branch of bank,without the indorsement of washington mutual.reyes failed to repair the whittier residence and abandoned the project.
the sac alleged that as part of a fraudulent scheme,ezequivel montejano montejano,bank branch manager,established a practice of accepting fire insurers checks and depositing them into reyes account at bank,without the necessary indorsements by lienholder financial institutions named as payees.this happened on at least four separate occasions.the sac alleged that by accepting the check without the indorsement of washington mutual,bank was negligent and also committed conversion within the meaning of california uniform commercial code section.
bank paid washington mutual in.appellants alleged that they suffered consequential and special damages,which included giving up the family home.
on december,the trial court granted bank demurrer to appellants sac.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
the appellate court assumes the truth of all properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint,and gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and its parts in their context citation.silberg anderson cal d.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.blank kirwan cal d.if the complaint can be cured,the trial court has abused its discretion.ibid.
ii.appellants can not state a negligence cause of action 
common law actions are displaced by particular provisions of the california uniform commercial code 
the purpose of the california uniform commercial code the code is to simplify and clarify the law governing commercial transactions in a uniform manner among the various jurisdictions.the code states that unless displaced by particular provisions,the principles of law and equity,including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract,principal and agent,estoppel,fraud,misrepresentation,duress,coercion,mistake,bankruptcy,or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.
in their sac,appellants prayed for consequential,special and punitive damages.however,as we conclude,post,appellants only remedy lies in an action for conversion under section.section,subdivision b provides that the measure of liability is the amount of the plaintiff interest in the instrument.in an attempt to circumvent the limited recovery imposed by that section,appellants contend that the code does not supersede claims of common law negligence,where,as here,bank paid on a check with a missing indorsement.
the definitions set forth in roy supply,wells fargo bank th,d roy supply are helpful to our discussion of the statutory provisions governing the check collection process and duties and liabilities between banks and customers.a check is a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand,subd.b,subd.a presentment is a demand for acceptance or payment of the check made upon the person or entity responsible for payment,subd,subd.the bank upon which the check is drawn and by which it is payable is referred to as the drawee or payor bank,subd.b.when a maker or drawer issues a check in favor of a payee,that person will generally submit the check to a bank which may or may not be the payor bank.regardless whether it is also the payor bank,the first bank to which a check is submitted for collection is called the depositary bank,subd.a.if the depositary bank is not also the payor bank,it will present the check to the payor bank either directly or through one or more intermediary banks,defined as any bank to which the check is transferred in the course of collection except the depositary bank and the payor bank,subd.c.in this process any bank handling the check for collection,including the depositary bank but excluding the payor bank,is referred to as a collecting bank,subd.d.roy supply,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.
missing indorsements are addressed in the code 
appellants argument is first,they claim that the code addresses forged or unauthorized indorsements,but not missing indorsements.next,they assert that since missing indorsements are not covered by the code,common law negligence principles apply.they are wrong on both counts.
appellants are incorrect in making the flat statement that the code does not address missing indorsements.under section,subdivision a,customers or collecting banks that transfer items warrant that a ll signatures on the item are authentic and authorized,and the liability of the collecting bank arises from its implied warranty of the indorsement rather than negligence principles.cal.mill supply bank of america cal d.as bank asserts,the warranties of section,subdivision a,apply to missing indorsements.feldman constr.union bank d.the warranty provisions of apply where the validity of an indorsement is not in issue but the indorsement is missing.
these warranties,however,do not apply to payees.the warranties are made to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank,subd.a.as discussed,post,appellants proper remedy lies in a conversion action under the code.
section supersedes appellants negligence claim 
we disagree with appellants contention that their claim based on a missing indorsement is not covered by the code.rather,regardless of whether the indorsement was forged,unauthorized,or missing,their remedy lies in a conversion action.
section provides a the law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments.an instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer,other than a negotiation,from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.an action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a.
the allegations of the sac fall squarely within section.eduardo,a,receiv
