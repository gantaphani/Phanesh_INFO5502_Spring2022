this is a case that straddles a crossroads formed by the intersection of federal and state law.it requires us to decide an issue of first impression in this circuit regarding the enforceability in bankruptcy of agreements that allow the subordination of certain indebtedness.our decision partially contradicts the decision of the only other court of appeals to have grappled with this same set of questions,see chem.bank first trust of in re southeast banking,cir,and to that extent creates a circuit split.
the precise dispute between the parties focuses on the priority if any that attaches to payment of interest on indebtedness that benefits from the contractual subordination of other indebtedness.as the question has been framed by the litigants and the lower courts,the answer depends on whether the subordination provisions at issue comply with the rule of explicitness.so phrased,the question assumes the continued vitality of that rule.because we doubt the accuracy of that assumption,we step back to the beginning and inquire into the basis for believing that the rule of explicitness remains alive and well.
that step places us at the head of a long and winding path.after traveling it,we conclude that the enactment of section a of the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,codified at a,extinguished the rule of explicitness in its classic form.we further conclude that states are not free to adopt rules of contract interpretation that apply only in bankruptcy.for purposes of this case,then,the rule of explicitness is a dead letter.
faced with this reality,we proceed to analyze the effect of the subordination provisions under new york generally applicable principles of contract that do not embody any canon that operates in the same manner as the rule of explicitness.that analysis reveals an ambiguity in the language of the subordination provisions.the resolution of this ambiguity requires an inquiry into the parties intent.that inquiry is and the bankruptcy court has not made the necessary findings.consequently,we vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the underlying facts are largely undisputed.in its halcyon days,the bank of new england bone issued six separate series of debt instruments clearly worded choice of law provisions tie the construction and interpretation of these instruments to the law of new york.three of these offerings the senior debt are entitled to the benefit of contractual subordination provisions.they include i a series of debentures bearing interest at per annum,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of ii a series of debentures bearing interest at per annum,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of and iii a series of notes bearing interest at a rate of per annum,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of.hsbc bank usa and jpmorgan chase bank,appellants here,serve as indenture trustees for the senior debt.the remaining three offerings the junior debt are subordinated to the senior debt.they include i a series of floating rate debentures,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of ii a series of debentures bearing interest at per annum,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of and iii a series of debentures bearing interest at per annum,due in,in the aggregate principal amount of.each trust indenture referable to junior debt contains a subordination provision that is substantially similar to the following 
e ach holder likewise covenants and agrees by his acceptance thereof,that the obligations of the company to make any payment on account of the principal of and interest on each and all of the notes shall be subordinate and junior,to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth,in right of payment to the company obligations to the holders of senior indebtedness of the company.
each of these indentures also specifies that 
the company agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets of the company of any kind or character,whether in cash,property or securities,to creditors upon any dissolution or winding up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the company,whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy,insolvency,receivership,conservatorship or other proceedings,all principal and premium,if any,sinking fund payments and interest due or to become due upon all senior indebtedness of the company shall first be paid in full,or payment thereof provided for in money or money worth in accordance with its terms,before any payment is made on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the junior notes due and owing at the time 
on january,bone filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.see.at that time,much of the senior and junior debt was still outstanding.everyone agrees that,in bankruptcy,the holders of the senior debt are contractually entitled to priority.withal,the parties fiercely dispute whether that priority extends to the payment of interest.
since filing for bankruptcy,bone,under the careful stewardship of its chapter trustee,has made three distributions to creditors.through these distributions,the bankruptcy estate has paid the holders of the senior debt the full amount of all unpaid principal and interest,together with all approved fees and expenses incurred through the date of the last distribution october.the trustee then created an ample reserve for future fees and expenses and,at that point,concluded that he had satisfied the obligations owed to the holders of the senior debt.when,thereafter,the trustee determined that there existed sufficient unencumbered funds,he sought permission to make a distribution in the amount of to the holders of the junior debt.the appellants objected on the ground that the trustee had not yet paid interest on the senior debt.
the bankruptcy court overruled this objection and authorized the proposed distribution.in re bank of new engl.the court based its decision on the rule of explicitness,holding that new york law recognized the rule and that the language of the subordination provisions failed to satisfy it.id.at.the district court affirmed.hsbc bank usa bank of new engl.in re bank of new engl.the court analysis differed somewhat from that of the bankruptcy court,but it too deemed the rule of explicitness controlling.id.at.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we cede no special deference to the district court initial review of the bankruptcy court decision.see gannett carp in re carp,cir.rather,we look directly to the bankruptcy court decision,examining that court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.insofar as the bankruptcy court decision hinges on an interpretation of the bankruptcy code,it presents a question of law and,thus,engenders de novo review.united states yellin in re weinstein,cir.
as the litigants and the lower courts have framed the issue,the pivotal question is whether the language of the subordination provisions satisfies the rule of explicitness.we do not agree that this is the correct question.thus,we retreat to first principles.
subordination agreements are essentially arrangements.lawrence king et,collier on bankruptcy,at ed.they are designed to operate in a wide range of contingencies,one of which is insolvency.as a hedge against the ravages of a future bankruptcy,subordination agreements typically provide that one creditor will subordinate its claim against the debtor the putative bankrupt in favor of the claim of another creditor.this subordination alters the normal priority of the junior creditor claim so that it becomes eligible to receive a distribution only after the claims of the senior creditor have been satisfied.id.at,at.
prior to,the bankruptcy act contained no specific mention of subordination agreements.see alan resnick brad eric scheler,the right of a senior creditor to receive interest from a subordinated creditor distributions did the rule of explicitness survive the enactment of the bankruptcy code,uniform.accordingly,subordination provisions were enforced in bankruptcy through the bankruptcy court equitable powers.see,bankers life mfrs.hanover trust in re kingsboro mortg,cir per curiam matter of time sales fin,cir bird sons sales tobin,cir.enforcing such agreements was necessary to prevent junior creditors from receiving windfalls after having explicitly agreed to accept less lucrative payment arrangements.see matter of credit indus,cir in re hinderliter.equity dictated enforcement because e quality among creditors who have lawfully bargained for different treatment is not equity but its opposite.chem.bank trust kheel,cir.
defining the outer limits of this equitable rule,especially with respect to interest,posed a thorny problem.generally,the accrual of interest on an unsecured or undersecured claim stops upon the debtor filing of a bankruptcy petition.see,nicholas united states,d sexton dreyfus.see also b bankruptcy act of,a.yet,subordination agreements sometimes contain language that prioritizes or,at least,arguably prioritizes the payment of interest on senior indebtedness over any recovery on junior indebtedness.from the outset,courts have been uncomfortable with enforcing this type of prioritization for fear that cases would arise where a senior creditor may potentially recover more under a subordination agreement than its allowable claim against the estate.collier on bankruptcy,supra,at.
to ease this discomfiture,judges fashioned an equitable doctrine to deal with and,essentially,limit the prioritization of interest payments.see resnick scheler,supra at.in its simplest form,this equitable doctrine,called the rule of explicitness,required that a subordination agreement show clearly that the general rule that interest stops on the date of the filing of the petition is to be suspended.time sales,at.over time,this evolved into a requirement that only unequivocal language could overcome the generic bar on recovery of interest.
that was the state of the law when congress enacted the bankruptcy code in,stat.unlike the earlier bankruptcy act,the code deals explicitly with subordination agreements.section a provides that a subordination agreement is enforceable in bankruptcy to the same extent as under applicable nonbankruptcy law.a.this statutory provision supplants the doctrine through which the courts previously had dealt with such agreements.because equitable powers possessed by bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the bankruptcy code,norwest bank worthington ahlers,d,the enactment of section a means that the enforcement of subordination provisions is no longer a matter committed to the bankruptcy courts notions of what may or may not be equitable.first fid.bank midlantic bank in re ionosphere clubs.
that congress cabined the bankruptcy courts equitable powers while providing an alternate means for preserving the viability of subordination agreements does not resolve the further question of whether the rule of explicitness,through some other medium,survived the enactment of section a.to answer that query,we begin,as always,with the text of the relevant statute.see main.dep t of envtl.prot.in re main,cir.we are mindful,of course,that the language of an unambiguous statute normally determines its meaning.id.
in terms,section a provides that a subordination agreement is enforceable in a bankruptcy case to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.a.it is clear beyond peradventure that the phrase applicable nonbankruptcy law can refer to either federal or state law.see patterson shumate,d.since the construction of private contracts is usually a matter committed to state law,volt info,bd.of,d,the presumption is that state law will furnish the proper benchmark.that presumption is especially robust here because we can find no federal statute that might guide us in interpreting subordination agreements.accord southeast banking,at.
of course,it might be possible to argue for the use of federal common law in this context.but resort to a federal common law of contract enforcement ordinarily is justified only when required by a distinct national policy or interest.see bartsch,cir.the interpretation and enforcement of financial arrangements between private parties does not fill that bill.see southeast banking,at.
to be sure,there is an important federal interest in the uniform application of the bankruptcy that interest will not suffice in this instance to justify resort to federal common law.by requiring that the enforceability of subordination agreements be subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law,congress determined that such agreements should be interpreted using principles.it is not our province to this determination.to cinch matters,the supreme court has instructed us that in the absence of specific statutory provisions to the contrary,property interests should not be analyzed differently as a result of a party involvement in a bankruptcy case.butner united states,d.we take this to mean that bankruptcy courts should only modify the usual compendium of rights and remedies if and to the extent that such modifications are specifically authorized or directed by the bankruptcy code.
for these reasons,we conclude that the applicable nonbankruptcy law referred to in section a is state law and,particularly,state contract law.accord in re best prods,d bankr.it follows inexorably that if the rule of explicitness retains any vitality,it does so only as part and parcel of state law.see collier on bankruptcy,supra,at,t he rule of explicitness can not be found in the code,but resort must be had to the state law governing the contractual subordination agreement.see also southeast banking,at.
this brings us to the parameters of the authority delegated by section a.one thing seems very clear in keeping with the principle that bankruptcy is an area of distinct federal competence,congress has conferred on the federal courts the power to apply any and all generally applicable state rules of contract interpretation in construing subordination agreements.but section a does not vest in the states any power to make rules the statute clear directive for the use of applicable nonbankruptcy law leaves no room for state legislatures or state courts to create special rules pertaining strictly and solely to bankruptcy matters.see in re cross,int l shoe pinkus.clarifying that states are not free to enact laws that interfere with federal bankruptcy law or that provide additional or auxiliary regulation with respect to bankruptcy matters.
formulation of the bankruptcy law requires congress carefully to balance competing considerations.that effort is manifest here.on the one hand,bankruptcy highly values equitable distribution that is in line with the priorities embodied in the code itself.on the other hand,equity typically operates to enforce voluntarily positions some of which may contradict the code normal priorities.section a encapsulates congress reconciliation of this conflict.a state creation of a rule of enforcement would outstrip the authority that congress conferred and,thus,upset the equilibrium that section a was designed to achieve.we conclude,therefore,that such a course is not open to the states.
if the rule of explicitness is an interpretive principle unique to bankruptcy,it offends this principle.see ionosphere clubs,at suggesting that the old rule of explicitness cases may be inconsistent with the code new mandate that subordination provisions be enforceable in bankruptcy to the same extent that they are enforceable under nonbankruptcy law.a contrary that allowed a state to adopt a rule of require certain contractual provisions those arguably entitling senior noteholders to the payment of interest becoming due at future dates to achieve a heightened degree of clarity only if the effort to enforce them arose in bankruptcy rather than in some other context.such a holding would go well beyond the intended reach of section a.
the short of it is that the enforceability of subordination agreements in bankruptcy must be judged by reference to generally applicable state contract law.as it pertains here,this holding limits our consideration to the general principles of new york contract law.only rule of explicitness is such a general principle can it be given effect in this case.
