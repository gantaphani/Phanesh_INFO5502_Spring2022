as framed by the parties,this case raises a question about whether the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,in its rhode island incarnation,laws to,restricts a court,in setting aside a fraudulent conveyance,to awarding against the transferee a money judgment that is limited to the value of the property at the time of the transfer.
on may,rosalina verduchi and her husband coriolano cal transferred their home at chestnut street,north providence,to their son,dennis,for no consideration.the problem was that they made this gift while they owed the irs more than in taxes and interest,as had been finally adjudicated in court a year earlier.see schwartz comm r,cir unpublished table decision 
on march,the irs issued an assessment against rosalina and cal for their tax liability,which by then had ballooned to almost because of interest.a federal tax lien arose on all of the verduchis property upon the date of assessment,see,and in january,the irs filed its notice of tax lien.
rosalina and cal successfully went through bankruptcy proceedings in and discharged their debts.but the discharge did not apply to any tax obligation that the debtors sought to avoid by fraudulently conveying property that would have been available to satisfy that debt.see a c.in april,the united states brought suit against rosalina and dennis pursuant to and seeking to reduce rosalina unpaid tax liabilities to judgment,to set aside the transfer of the chestnut street property as fraudulent,and to foreclose the federal tax lien against the property.
the government learned in discovery that dennis,on november,had given a mortgage on chestnut street to option one mortgage corporation option one in exchange for.it then filed an amended complaint on march,naming option one as a defendant with an interest.see b.before trial,the government conceded that any federal tax lien on the chestnut street property would be subordinate to option one mortgage.
in the amended complaint,the government sought,inter alia foreclosure of its federal tax liens upon and the sale of chestnut street pursuant to and and,or money judgment against dennis for the greater of three possible current market value of the property,the market value,or the he received from the mortgage,plus interest.initially,these two remedies were sought in the alternative however,in a memorandum submitted to the district court on june,the government stated its intention to seek foreclosure of the lien,as well as a money judgment against dennis for,plus interest,representing the amount of the mortgage he had taken out on the property.
after a bench trial on november,the district court held that the transfer of the chestnut street property to dennis was fraudulent,set aside the transfer,and ordered that the federal tax lien should be foreclosed and the property sold.see united states verduchi,wl,at.the court ordered that judgment be entered against rosalina for plus interest accrued since march,for a total of more than and that the proceeds from the sale of the property in excess of option one mortgage amount be applied toward rosalina unpaid tax liabilities.id.the court also entered a money judgment against dennis as transferee in the sum of plus interest,on the basis that the sum received from the sale of the property would be diminished by the amount of option one mortgage id.dennis appeals 
we offer a brief background on how the federal tax laws operate in this arena.
where the united states seeks to recover a tax debt,it has at its disposal a formidable arsenal of collection tools.united states rodgers,d see also markham fay,cir cataloging various means by which the government can collect from deficient taxpayers.in a fraudulent transfer case,the government can elect,among other options,to bring an action either to enforce a lien under or against the transferee of a taxpayer.united states perrina,citing rodgers,at.see also leighton united states.noting,among other methods of recovering an outstanding tax debt,the right of the united states to proceed against transferees by suit.
the threshold question in all cases where the federal government asserts its tax lien is whether and to what extent the taxpayer had property or rights to property to which the tax lien could attach.aquilino united states,d.in answering that question,both federal and state courts must look to state law id.at.see also united states craft,d w e look initially to state law to determine what rights the taxpayer has in the property the government seeks to reach,then to federal law to determine whether the taxpayer rights qualify as property or rights to property within the compass of the federal tax lien legislation.quoting drye united states,d internal quotation marks omitted united states murray,cir.accordingly,in the present case,the question of whether the chestnut street property was fraudulently transferred is a matter of rhode island law.see laws see also united states bryant,cir.
if the government proceeds under to enforce a lien,once a court declares a transfer fraudulent and void,the asset reverts back to the ownership of the and federal law governs the foreclosure of the lien and the selling of the asset.see c.
in contrast,if the government seeks to recover a debtor tax deficiency in the form of a judgment against the transferee,state law applies to set the amount of recovery.see comm r stern,d holding,in an action arising under,which provides the federal government with a procedural remedy against transferees for transferors tax liabilities,that state law governs the extent to which a transferee can be held liable united states westley,x,cir unpublished decision holding that state law controls the determination of transferees liability even if the government does not proceed under see also laws defining the limits on transferee liability.
in the present case,the district court determined under state law that the conveyance of chestnut street was fraudulent,set aside the transfer of the property,and issued judgment against rosalina and the property,pursuant to,as well as against the transferee,dennis,for plus interest.see verduchi,wl,at.
on appeal,dennis does not contest the district court determination that the property was fraudulently transferred.instead,he takes issue only with the district court remedy,arguing that,pursuant to certain provisions of the rhode island fraudulent transfer act,laws b,c,t he judgment is wrong because it awards the united states the current market value of chestnut street even though the law states clearly that creditors may recover only the value of the asset at the time of the transfer.
although dennis does not specify which portion of the judgment he is contesting,we understand him to be appealing only the money judgment against him,not the judgments against rosalina and the property,for three reasons.first,rosalina has not contested the amount of her tax liability,which appellants acknowledge is far greater than the current market value of the property.thus,once the transfer is voided and the ownership of the chestnut street property is reverted to rosalina,the government is entitled to force the sale of the property and to collect all the proceeds in excess of option one take.see,a.
second,the rhode island statute dennis invokes solely governs transferee liability.see laws defenses,liability,and protection of transferee.because a judgment pursuant to is essentially a judgment against the property,see rodgers,at.likening to an in rem proceeding,or against the,not against the transferee,laws can apply to limit only the money judgment against dennis,not the amount the government can recover from the sale of the property.
further,the government in its brief framed the issue on appeal as w hether the district court erred in entering judgment against dennis verduchi for.the government also noted that rosalina raised no defense to the amount of the tax liabilities and by implication to the amount of the lien on the property except for her contention that they had been discharged in bankruptcy.appellants do not contest the government characterizations,and we proceed accordingly.
