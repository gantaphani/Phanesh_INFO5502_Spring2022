on june,ellipso,a telecommunications company that specializes in satellite communications products for cellular phone companies,filed a complaint against appellants john mann and mann tech,and against robert patterson,consulting management,and registry solutions ellipso claimed,among other things,that it was fraudulently induced to enter a loan agreement with the appellants and sought various remedies including rescission of the loan.in,ellipso was struggling financially and hired robert patterson to secure financing from investors,which patterson did.patterson put together a deal in which mann tech loaned ellipso,secured by more than shares of ico global communications holding.stock icoha shares that ellipso held.at the time of the loan agreement in january,the icoha shares were valued at about,twice the amount of the loan.while he was acting as ellipso agent in securing the financing from mann tech,patterson had a financial interest in mann to stood to benefit from the loan.according to ellipso,patterson presented the loan as ellipso only feasible financing option,and ellipso relied on patterson expertise when agreeing to it.ellipso claims that patterson took advantage of his insider knowledge of ellipso precarious financial condition to benefit himself by persuading ellipso to enter the loan agreement.the month following the loan agreement,patterson strengthened his financial interest in mann technologies when he and john mann incorporated mann technologies in nevada.according to ellipso,patterson continued to take advantage of his dual interests in ellipso and mann technologies to harm ellipso and benefit himself by persuading ellipso to transfer title and possession of the icoha shares to mann technologies in august.a month later,patterson,on behalf of mann technologies,and ellipso executed a joint sales order permitting the sale of of those shares.sometime thereafter the record is not clear mann tech sold off nearly another icoha shares and transferred some of the resulting proceeds to other accounts again,the record is not clear as to the precise amounts or accounts.mann tech counters that it was entitled to sell the shares because their value had fallen below and ellipso had failed to make a single payment on the loan,both grounds for default under the agreement.when ellipso moved for a preliminary injunction in august,the price of icoha had rebounded dramatically,and the total market value of the shares that ellipso pledged as collateral exceeded.
ellipso moved for a preliminary injunction to ensure that the remaining icoha shares held by mann technologies and the proceeds from those that had been sold would be protected while ellipso pursued its claims against mann tech and patterson.ellipso argued that only an injunction freezing mann technologies assets would guarantee satisfaction of any judgment on its claims.the district court agreed,concluding that ellipso had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its fraud claim because patterson had not disclosed his dual role to ellipso,see ellipso,mann,slip op.at,wl,ellipso i there was a likely threat of irreparable injury to ellipso from mann tech further sale of the icoha shares because they were mann technologies only substantial assets,see id.at,wl the balance of hardships favored ellipso because without an injunction ellipso might not be made whole and an injunction would harm no business interests of mann technologies,which would be allowed to hold on to the shares,see id.at,wl and the public interest in preventing fraud favored granting an injunction,see id.at,wl.mann tech filed a motion for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction arguing that new evidence showed that ellipso knew of patterson dual role and with that knowledge actually affirmed the loan agreement by continuing to act under its terms,eliminating rescission as a remedy.the district court rejected mann tech motion for reconsideration and held that the purportedly new facts would not change its conclusion that ellipso had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its fraud claim.ellipso mann,slip op.at,ellipso ii.mann tech timely appealed to this court.

mann tech challenges the district court determination that ellipso has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its fraud claim,that ellipso would be irreparably harmed without the injunction freezing mann technologies assets,and that mann technologies would not be harmed by the injunction.we examine these arguments in turn and find each lacks merit.
as to the merits of the fraud claim,mann tech argues first that ellipso failed to prove,as is required for fraud,that it reasonably relied on patterson to accept mann tech loan.see,alicke mci communications.mann tech alleges that ellipso had been willing to accept a previous similar loan offered by another prospective investor argyll equities llc.because ellipso was willing to accept this previous similar loan,so the argument goes,the district court was mistaken to conclude that ellipso relied on patterson to accept a substantially similar loan from mann tech.mann tech also argues that ellipso could not have reasonably relied on patterson because it knew of his prior felony theft conviction and disbarment.we need not consider either argument because i t is well settled that issues and legal theories not asserted at the district court level ordinarily will not be heard on appeal.district of columbia air florida,citations omitted.mann tech failed to raise either reliance argument in its opposition to ellipso motion for a preliminary injunction,at the district court hearing on the injunction,or in its motion for reconsideration.they were both raised for the first time on appeal.the district court clearly did not err in failing to consider arguments that mann tech failed to present.although mann tech did note in its opposition to a preliminary injunction that it was disputed when ellipso became aware of patterson criminal history,it did not argue that reliance on patterson would have been unreasonable.instead,mann tech argument about the likelihood of success on the merits of the f
