appellant trans texas holdings trans texas appeals the decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences board in reexamination and.the board affirmed the examiner rejection of all of the claims of patent filed,patent and patent filed,patent as obvious under.we affirm.
background 
trans texas is the assignee of both the patent and the patent.the patent is a continuation of the patent.the patents specifications,which are nearly identical,describe a system of deposit and loan accounts.patent patent.by adjusting the interest paid on deposit accounts,or received on loan accounts,to compensate for inflation,the patented system purports to insulate the value of assets from inflationary fluctuations.in addition,the patented system seeks to match,or hedge,any increased interest a financial institution must pay to depositors as a result of inflation adjustments with the increased interest payments it receives from borrowers,thereby providing stability to the financial institution.patent patent d uring times of inflation negative cash flows attributable to deposit accounts will be compensated for by incoming payments on loan accounts.
the patent has three independent claims,claims,and.independent claim claims a n investment system for providing an improved capital structure for an institution composed,basically,of a deposit account and an account management data processor.patent.the claimed deposit account has a principal component representing the initial cash investment of the depositor and an accrual component representing interest paid that has both a fixed interest and a variable interest component.id.claim notes that the deposit accrual component is adjusted in a manner responsive to the rate of inflation,id.emphasis added,which the specification defines as directly responsive to a market indicator of prior actual inflation and it is not meant to include the market expectation of future inflation,id.emphasis added claim also specifies that the data processor includes means for retiring the fixed interest component and paying the deposit principal component according to schedules over the term of the deposit account.id.
independent claim is generally similar to claim for purposes of this appeal and includes the responsive to the rate of inflation limitation.id.it excludes claim reference to retiring the fixed interest and paying the principal according to schedules.id.independent claim is similar to claim for purposes of this appeal but covers both deposit and loan accounts.id.similar to claim,it claims a means for adjusting the amount in the deposit account in a manner responsive to the rate of inflation and a means for determining the amount in the loan accrual component in a manner responsive to the rate of inflation.id.emphases added.most of the patent dependent claims were not argued separately on appeal and thus stand or fall with their corresponding independent claim.see in re dance.some of the dependent claims include other limitations described below.
the patent has four independent claims,claims,and.claim claims a method of managing financial accounts by providing deposit and loan accounts that are adjusted as a function of a rate of inflation,paying the deposit accounts,and receiving repayment of the loan account.patent.claim also recites the use of an account data processor.id.claim claims a method whereby an institution provides a deposit account to a depositor,uses a portion of the funds deposited to obtain a financial instrument whose rate of return adjusts with inflation,and pays the depositor a rate of return on funds based on a rate of inflation.id.emphases added claim is nearly identical to claim,except that it calls for the institution to obtain a mortgage secured by real estate,rather than a financial instrument.id.claim is also similar to claim for purposes of this appeal,except that it specifies that the financial instrument pays the principal component at the end of the term,which the parties refer to as balloon payments.id.none of the dependent claims of the patent was argued separately on appeal,and they therefore stand or fall with their independent claim.see dance,at.
on october,trans texas requested reexamination of the and patents based on a substantial new question of patentability.the united states patent and trademark office pto granted this request on december,and initiated separate reexamination proceedings for each patent.
in the course of the reexamination proceeding,trans texas urged that the pto was bound by a claim construction rendered in an earlier infringement proceeding to which the pto was not a party.on october,trans texas had filed a complaint against pimco advisors,in the united states district court for the western district of texas,alleging infringement of the and patents.on august,the district court had issued its claim construction ruling,which adopted the definition of the term responsive to the rate of inflation found in the specification,that is,it held that the term should be defined as directly responsive to a market indicator of prior actual inflation and is not meant to include the market expectation of future inflation.trans texas holdings pimco advisors,slip op.at,markman order.relying on language in the accompanying district court opinion,trans texas urges that the district court also interpreted the responsive to the rate of inflation language to require a continuous,relationship between inflation and adjustments.see id.at the patent uses the phrase responsive to the rate of inflation which more clearly imparts a correlation.for purposes of this appeal,we will assume that trans texas interpretation of the district court order is correct.the district court also held that the term as a function of the rate of inflation in claim of the patent had the same meaning as the term responsive to the rate of inflation.id.at.the district court construed the term based on the rate of inflation in claims and of the patent to require the rate of return to be directly related to the rate of inflation.id.at.
the parties then reached a settlement before trial,and the district court issued an order of dismissal with prejudice on january.
on february,the examiner mailed final office actions in the reexamination proceedings rejecting all of the claims of the and patents as obvious under.the primary issue before the examiner was the construction of the terms responsive to the rate of inflation and as a function of a rate of inflation.in holding the claims unpatentable,the examiner principally relied on santosh mukherjee claire orlans,indexation in an inflationary economy a case study in finland,vol.xl,broadsheet,pep the social science institute,april,at,mukherjee.mukherjee discusses the decision of banks in finland in the to adjust both their loans and deposits for inflation,on the basis of quarterly inspections of the index.id.among other accounts,it describes a deposit accounts,which provided per cent index compensation for every one percent increase in the cost of living index that is,for every one percent increase in the cost of living index,the capital was increased by one percent.mukherjee also discloses that banks charged an surcharge on their loans in order to provide the funds needed for fully deposit accounts.it notes that t he amount of the surcharge was usually fixed according to the proportion of the bank deposits benefiting by index adjustment,so that the bank could just balance its commitments.id.although mukherjee lacks an explicit recitation of the for account management,the examiner concluded that patent filed,musmanno demonstrates that it was notoriously to employ to manage plural accounts and therefore it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to apply musamanno data processor to mukherjee.
on march,trans texas appealed the examiner decisions on both the and patents to the board.trans texas first argued that under our decision in in re freeman,issue preclusion bound the board to apply the district court claim construction of the terms responsive to the rate of inflation and as a function of a rate of inflation.the board,in similar but separate opinions for each reexamination proceeding,rejected this argument.the board held that a different claim construction standard applies in pto proceedings,giving claims their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification.see ex parte trans texas holdings,reexamination,slip op.at may,board decision ex parte trans texas holdings,reexamination,slip op.at may,board decision.the board also concluded that the district court claim construction was not necessary to the judgment rendered in the previous action in light of the settlement and dismissal.board decision at board decision at.
alternatively,trans texas argued that,even apart from issue preclusion,the claims require a continuous,nonstepped relationship such that different amounts of prior actual inflation will result in different inflation adjustments.board decision at see also board decision at.the board disagreed.it noted the specification definition of responsive to the rate of inflation directly responsive to a market indicator of prior actual inflation and it is not meant to include the market expectation of future inflation.board decision at.the board concluded that this was meant to emphasize that the calculations of inflation adjustments must be based on the market indicator data which represents prior actual inflation.id.emphasis in original.relying as well on the dictionary definition of directly,the board concluded that the claims were broad enough to cover adjustments.board decision at board decision at.
the board upheld the examiner obviousness rejection of all of the claims of the and patents based on these constructions and its interpretation of other claim terms.it concluded that claims,and of the patent and claims of the were unpatentable over mukherjee in view of musmanno.the board rejected the remaining claims of the and patents over mukherjee in view of musmanno and additional references.
trans texas timely appealed the decisions,and we consolidated the appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a a.we review questions of issue preclusion and claim construction without deference.see shell petroleum,united states,issue preclusion cybor fas,claim construction.
discussion 
trans texas first argues that the board erred in construing the term responsive to the rate of inflation in the patent and the related terms as a function of a rate of inflation and based on a rate of inflation in the patent.trans texas has treated these terms as equivalent and focused on the responsive to the rate of inflation limitation,and we will do likewise.
trans texas primarily argues that the board should have given preclusive effect to the district court markman order,which construed responsive to the rate of inflation to mean directly responsive to a market indicator of prior actual inflation and is not meant to include the market expectation of future inflation.markman order at.as discussed above,we assume,as trans texas argues,that the district court construed the term to require a continuous,correlation with the inflation rate.appellant br.see also markman order at.
traditionally,issue preclusion,also known as collateral estoppel,applied only where the same parties to an earlier proceeding were involved in later litigation involving the same issue.see restatement second of judgments id.reporter note.more modern decisions in some circumstances apply issue preclusion even where the parties to the subsequent suit are not the same.see parklane hosiery shore,d restatement second judgments.the latter doctrine is known as collateral estoppel,and it is this latter doctrine that trans texas relies on here.
issue preclusion is not warranted in this case because the pto was not a party to the earlier litigation.our case law has identified four prerequisites to the application of issue preclusion identity of the issues in a prior proceeding the issues were actually litigated the determination of the issues was necessary to the resulting judgment and,the party defending against preclusion had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues.jet,sewage aeration,emphasis added.
the pto as the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted thus must have been accorded a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue in the earlier case.allen mccurry,d freeman,at.however,the pto was not even a party to the earlier district court litigation and can not be bound by its outcome.trans texas nevertheless argues that this requirement should somehow be excused because the pto proceedings were ex parte.this argument simply makes no sense.the pto is plainly a party to these appeal proceedings,and if it were not treated as a party,there would be no basis for even considering the application of issue preclusion in the first place.
we have never applied issue preclusion against a to the first action.in fact,the supreme court has specifically held that litigants who never appeared in a prior action may not be collaterally estopped without litigating the issue due process prohibits estopping them despite one or more existing adjudications of the identical issue which stand squarely against their position,of,d see also parklane hosiery,at.it is a violation of due process for a judgment to be binding on a litigant who was not a party or a privy and therefore has never had an opportunity to be heard.restatement second of judgments reporter note the proposition that a can not be bound by a judgment,unless he is represented by a party or has interests that are derivative from a party,is a rule of constitutional law.
recognizing the general rule against collaterally estopping a,trans texas asserts that it somehow represented the pto interests in the district court action.however,the presumption that nonparties are not bound by a judgment can only be rebutted in limited circumstances,such as when the was in privity with a party,has interests that are derivative from a party,or participate d in an active and controlling way in the litigation.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed restatement second of judgments reporter note.the pto interests were not represented in the earlier litigation even though trans texas there urged that the district court reject the construction that the district court adopted.since the pto was not a party to the district court litigation,issue preclusion does not apply.
contrary to trans texas argument,our decision in freeman does not require the application of issue preclusion.in freeman,we held that a patentee in a pto proceeding was barred by issue preclusion from asserting a claim construction already rejected in a district court infringement action brought by the patentee against a third party.at.nothing in freeman suggests that issue preclusion could be applied against the pto or another to the infringement proceeding 
alternatively,trans texas urges that the board erroneously rejected its proposed claim construction and that the claims require continuous,adjustments.it is not entirely clear what trans texas means by continuous or.any is subject to the available inflation data.that is,it is limited by the way in which inflation data are reported,both in terms of the frequency of reporting,monthly,quarterly,yearly,and the specificity of reporting,how many decimal places the rate of inflation is carried out.thus,no system can truly be continuous and with the true rate of inflation.instead,as best we can understand it,trans texas argument is that for every increase in the reported rate of inflation,there must be an immediate and equal inflation adjustment.we understand this argument to be an attempt to distinguish the mukherjee prior art reference,which did not disclose an immediate inflation adjustment to deposit accounts for every increase in the rate of inflation.instead,increases were only made when the increase in the rate of inflation reached one percent 
trans texas argument is not persuasive.claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation,consistent with the specification,in reexamination proceedings.in re yamamoto.the term responsive to the rate of inflation is defined in the specification as mean ing directly re
