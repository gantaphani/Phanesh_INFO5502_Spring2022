this appeal arises from one of several actions brought against the united states department of agriculture department or usda alleging discrimination in the administration of various loan and benefit programs for american farmers the appellants,individual hispanic farmers,seek to represent a class of similarly situated hispanic farmers throughout the nation who claim that the department discriminated against them in denying them farm loans and other benefits because of their ethnicity and that it failed to investigate the discrimination complaints they subsequently filed with the department.in the district court,the appellants sought class certification and the usda moved to dismiss,inter alia,the claim.the district court granted the department motion to dismiss and denied class certification,concluding that the appellants had failed to meet the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a and b.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and remand in part.
the farm service administration fsa administers the department various loan programs for american farmers through county committees,the members of which are selected locally and are located in over counties nationwide.a farmer seeking a loan must first obtain an application from his county committee.b.he then submits the completed application to the committee which determines whether the farmer meets specific usda loan criteria,including,inter alia,citizenship,legal capacity to incur debt,education and farming experience,farm size,inability to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere and character.id,a.if an unsuccessful applicant believes the committee discriminated against him in denying his application,he may lodge a complaint with either the usda secretary or the usda office of civil rights.id.usda regulations provide that complaints shall be investigated in the manner determined by the assistant secretary for civil rights and such further action taken by the agency or the secretary as may be warranted.id.
on october,ten hispanic farmers filed this action in the district court.the complaint set forth three counts count i sought a declaratory judgment to determine the rights of plaintiffs and the class members under the defendant farm programs including their right to equal credit,and equal participation in farm program,and their right to full and timely enforcement of racial discrimination complaints.am.compl.at,reprinted in joint appendix ja.the second count alleged a violation of the equal credit opportunity act ecoa,et ja.specifically,the appellants alleged that the d efendant acts of denying plaintiffs and class members credit and other benefits and systematically failing to properly process their discrimination complaints was racially discriminatory and contrary to the ecoa.ja.finally,the appellants alleged a violation of the administrative procedure act,et.ja.the appellants sought declaratory relief as well as billion in damages.ja.their complaint also proposed a class of 
all hispanic participants in fsa farm programs who petitioned or would have petitioned had they not been prevented from timely filing a complaint against usda at any time between january,and the present for relief from racial discrimination and who,because of the failings in the usda civil rights complaint processing system were denied equal protection and due process in the handling of their complaints.

on december,the department moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that the court lacked jurisdiction over the ecoa claim because the appellants had not exhausted their administrative remedies and that,in any event,their claims were.in addition,the department moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the appellants had failed to state a claim under ecoa,the apa or the declaratory judgment act,et.on march,the district denied the motion in part and granted it in part,relying on its in love johanns.garcia veneman,wl,reprinted in ja.of relevance here,the court dismissed the claim,concluding that the appellants failed to state a claim under ecoa because the investigation of a discrimination complaint is not a credit transaction within the meaning of ecoa.ja.it further held that the claim was not cognizable under the apa because ecoa provides an adequate remedy.ja.
on december,the district court denied class certification.garcia veneman,garcia i.it concluded that the appellants failed to show the required commonality under federal rule of civil procedure a and did not represent a certifiable class under rule b.they did not show commonality,the court concluded,because they did not demonstrate that the department operated under a general policy of discrimination nor did they identify a common usda policy or practice that disparately affected them.id.at.the court then considered whether the requested class could be certified under rule b and concluded that rule b certification was inappropriate because the billion in damages they sought predominated over their request for equitable relief.id.at.the court also found rule b certification inappropriate because they had not shown that common questions predominated.id.at.
after additional discovery,the appellants submitted a supplemental brief on the issue of commonality,which the district court treated as a renewed motion for class certification.garcia veneman,garcia ii.they had obtained in discovery usda loan and disaster benefit files as well as two usda databases which,they alleged,showed the requisite commonality for both their disparate impact and their disparate treatment allegations of discrimination.id.at.they argued that the files revealed that the usda had denied hispanic farmers applications based on the subjective,rather than the objective,eligibility criteria set forth in and that,as a result,the use of subjective criteria had a disparate impact on them.id.at.they also claimed that the usda as a single actor had treated them discriminatorily through a pattern and practice of discrimination.id.at.they listed five of discrimination,including i refusal to provide hispanic farmers with loan applications or assistance in completing applications ii subjecting hispanic farmers to protracted delays in processing and funding their loans iii using subjective criteria to reject the applications of hispanic farmers iv unnecessarily subjecting hispanic farmers to the inconvenience of supervised bank accounts and v delaying or denying loan servicing for hispanic farmers.id.at.the court nevertheless concluded that,even with their supplementation,they failed to demonstrate commonality.
on september,the appellants moved the district court to certify the order dismissing their claim for interlocutory appeal under b,which motion the court granted.garcia veneman.in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure f,the appellants petitioned this court on september,for leave to file an interlocutory appeal of the class certification denial,which petition we granted.in re garcia.before us for review,then,are three orders,namely garcia,wl,granting motion to dismiss,garcia i,denying class certification,and garcia ii,denying class certification again.
as we have recognized,the district court is uniquely well situated to rule on class certification matters.wagner taylor.accordingly,we review a certification ruling conservatively only to ensure against abuse of discretion or erroneous application of legal criteria,and we will affirm the district court even if we would have ruled differently in the first instance.see mccarthy kleindienst.
under federal rule of civil procedure a,a plaintiff seeking class certification must show that 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
failure to adequately demonstrate any of the four is fatal to class certification.see in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust.the district court found that the appellants failed to show questions of law or fact common to the class or commonality under rule a.we affirm that ruling 
to establish commonality under rule a,a plaintiff must identify at least one question common to all members of the class.see in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir.not every common question,however,suffices under subsection a.as the united states supreme court declared of an alleged disparate treatment class in a title vii action,
there is a wide gap between a an individual claim that he has been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds,and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination,and b the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual,such that the individual claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual claim will be typical of the class claims.
of sw.falcon,d following falcon,we have required a plaintiff seeking to certify a disparate treatment class under title vii to make a significant showing to permit the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination that pervaded all of the employer challenged employment decisions.hartman duffey.and in love johanns,we held that a showing of commonality for a disparate treatment class under ecoa requires the plaintiff to show i discrimination ii against a particular group iii of which the plaintiff is a member,plus iv some additional factor that permit s the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination.at.emphasis in original citation omitted alteration in original.
regarding the appellants challenge to department action with an allegedly discriminatory impact,they must make a showing sufficient to permit the court to infer that members of the class experienced discrimination as a result of the disparate effect of a facially neutral policy.see cooper,cir.that is,similar to our formulation of the commonality showing necessary for a disparate treatment class set out in love johanns,the appellants must show for their disparate impact class i a discriminatory impact,ii affecting a particular group,iii of which the plaintiffs are members,iv resulting from a common facially neutral policy or practice.
first,the appellants contend that the district court erred in denying class certification of their discriminatory treatment claim based on the geographic spread of the local decisionmakers,labeling it a pattern and practice claim,see appellants br.at.but see garcia i,at commonality is defeated by the large numbers and geographic dispersion of the.as with a title vii claim,to establish a charge of pattern and practice discrimination under ecoa,a putative class must prove that discrimination was the company standard operating regular rather than the unusual practice.bazemore friday,d quoting teamsters united states,d.similarly,to show commonality under federal rule of civil procedure a,the plaintiff must make a significant showing to permit the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination that pervaded all of the defendant challenged decisions.hartman,at.
as is now well recognized,the class action commonality criteria are,in general,more easily met when a disparate impact rather than a disparate treatment theory underlies a class claim.stastny bell,cir.establishing commonality for a disparate treatment class is particularly difficult where,as here,multiple decisionmakers with significant local autonomy exist.id.at reversing class certification because of geographic separation of workforce and autonomy of local decisionmakers see also cooper,at.the appellants failed to identify any centralized,uniform policy or practice of discrimination by the usda that formed the basis for discrimination against hispanic loan applicants with varied eligibility criteria in over counties nationwide over a period.rather,despite the appellants allegation that the usda actions are those of a single actor,their claims arise from multiple individual decisions made by multiple individual committees.moreover,they do not cite a single reversal of a district court denial of class certification based on no commonality resulting from the geographic spread of the decisionmakers stastny,at district court abused discretion in certifying class of employees spread through great number of geographically dispersed facilities with almost complete local autonomy.our standard of review is deferential and the appellants have failed to convince us that the district court abused its discretion in denying class certification to the appellants alleged disparate treatment class.
we next consider the appellants claim that the district court erred in failing to certify a class on whose members the department facially neutral action has had a discriminatorily disparate impact.assuming without deciding that a disparate impact claim is cognizable under ecoa the claim would require a plaintiff to identify a specific policy or practice which the defendant has used to discriminate and must also demonstrate with statistical evidence that the practice or policy has an adverse effect on the protected group.powell am,d,recognizing disparate impact claim under ecoa.
the appellants press two alternative theories to support their contention that the district court erred in not certifying a disparate impact class.first,they argue that they do not need to specify a facially neutral practice if it is impossible to determine which of the usda eligibility criteria have had the discriminatory effect,instead borrowing from title vii one employment practice notion alternately,they argue the usda subjective decisionmaking process constitutes the common facially neutral practice.we reject both theories and instead affirm the district court denial of class certification because the appellants failed to show a common facially neutral usda farm loan policy,resulting in the disparate effect on them and the putative class of hispanic farmers.see caridad commuter,cir.of course,class certification would not be warranted absent some showing that the challenged practice has a disparate impact on employees at.as the supreme court noted in class certification was denied t he mere fact that an aggrieved private plaintiff is a member of an identifiable class of persons of the same race or national origin is insufficient to establish his standing to litigate on their behalf all possible claims of discrimination against a common employer.falcon,at.
in garcia i,at,the district court rejected the appellants disparate impact claim because they did not connect disparate impact with a common facially neutral usda policy.they had submitted the declaration of jerry hausman,an expert in econometrics and microeconomics,in which declaration he concluded that hispanic farmers received a lower percentage of usda loans than white farmers received in.ja.hausman,however,analyzed all farmers white and hispanic as opposed to only those farmers white and hispanic who had applied for usda loans.after further discovery produced usda loan databases,two of which the appellants used to support their renewed class certification motion,they submitted the declaration of statistician karl pavlovic,who found that per cent of white applications were approved in the period from october to january while per cent of hispanic applications were approved in the same period.ja.in garcia ii,the district court assumed a disparate impact without discussion of pavlovic declaration.garcia ii,at.the court,however,again concluded that the appellants had failed to connect the disparate impact to a common facially neutral usda policy.id.rejecting appellants argument because n ot only does it leapfrog to the merits,but it also boils down to the proposition that unexplained discrepancies in the distribution of government benefits satisfy the commonality requirement of rule a without more.
the appellants attempted to connect the disparate impact to usda subjective loan decisionmaking criteria,relying in part on statistical evidence.but t
