today case a diversity suit governed,the parties agree,by massachusetts substantive law arises from the efforts of plaintiff hsbc realty credit corporation usa to recover million from defendant brian under a guaranty.a district judge struck defenses,dismissed his counterclaims,denied him leave to replead,and granted hsbc judgment on the pleadings.appeals.but after saying what needs to be said,we affirm.
how the case got here 
given the litigation present posture,we describe the facts alleged in the pleadings discussing too the documents fairly incorporated within them in the light most agreeable to,drawing every reasonable inference in his favor.see,grajales ports,cir.
the players and the project 
hsbc is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york.is a pennsylvania resident who is a principal of a company called brandywine partners,llc back in the mid,brandywine wanted to buy a particular piece of industrial property in delaware and redevelop it for residential use.because of some fairly serious environmental problems with the delaware site,brandywine concluded after an extensive investigation that the best course of action was to raze the existing buildings and start from scratch.eventually brandywine turned to hsbc for a loan.and hsbc agreed to dole out million pursuant to a agreement between them.
the project loan agreement 
among other things,the agreement requires brandywine to pay for an appraisal of the property.and the agreement says that this appraisal has to yield a ratio of no more than.that condition,the document continues,is for hsbc sole benefit,meaning no other person has the right to rely on its satisfaction.using that ratio,the property appraised value had to be at least million to support the million loan or so alleges also relevant,brandywine expressly acknowledges in the agreement that hsbc was rel ying on the experience of brandywine and its general partners,members,and principals in owning and operating properties like this and that hsbc ha s a valid interest in maintaining the property value to ensure that,should brandywine default in the repayment and performance of the obligations under the project loan documents,hsbc can recover the obligations by selling the property of note too,brandywine signed a promissory note and gave hsbc a mortgage on the delaware property among other things.
the guaranty 
because,as he acknowledged,hsbc would not lend brandywine a cent unless he unconditionally guaranteed the loan repayment,signed an absolut e personal guaranty for the loan,agreeing that he had a direct or indirect interest in brandywine and so would directly benefit from the loan and that he occupied the status of primary obligor of the guaranteed obligations defined as the prompt and unconditional payment by brandywine of the loan and interest thereon the guaranty clause caps liability at million,however 
pertinently too,the guaranty lists a bunch of representations and warranties that made to hsbc.for example,he affirmed both that he was familiar with,and ha d independently reviewed books and records regarding,brandywine financial condition and also that he was familiar with the value of the property offered as collateral.he confirmed that neither brandywine condition nor the pledge of collateral induced him to sign the guaranty.and he declared that hsbc said nothing to induce him to execute that document,either 
the guaranty also has a no duty to pursue others clause,which stresses that hsbc need not enforce its rights or exhaust its remedies against brandywine or the property and that gives up whatever rights he may have to force hsbc to do either of these things but there is more.guaranty declares that he waives any common law,equitable,statutory or other rights that he may have because of a ny action taken regarding the loan or the collateral that increases the likelihood that he will be required to pay the guaranteed obligations.topping things off,the guaranty has an integration clause saying that this document is the final and complete expression of its terms,that there are no oral agreements between the parties,and that no one can use extrinsic evidence of any kind to contradict or modify any term 
the default and the lawsuit 
brandywine defaulted on its repayment obligations,so hsbc demanded that make good on his million guaranty.but he turned a deaf ear,causing hsbc to file suit on the guaranty agreement.returned fire with defenses and counterclaims.some of his defenses defy simple labels.others do not,like his defenses of mitigation,promissory estoppel,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of an implied covenant of dealing,fraudulent inducement,duress and undue influence,unconscionable contract of adhesion,no meeting of the minds,and failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted.as for his counterclaims,they were for fraudulent inducement,promissory estoppel,negligent misrepresentation,unfair and deceptive business practices under.laws ch,breach of an implied covenant of dealing,breach of duty to mitigate damages,declaratory and injunctive relief,and breach of contract.
convinced that there were no material facts in dispute and that judgment should enter enforcing the guaranty express terms,hsbc moved the judge to strike defenses and to grant it judgment on the pleadings under.c.resisted by saying that his defenses and counterclaims barred the guaranty enforcement in the alternative,he asked the judge for leave to replead his defenses and counterclaims under.a 
taking up hsbc motion,the judge said that a common theme pervaded defenses and counterclaims that hsbc must seek to recover any amount owed by brandywine by proceeding against the delaware property before turning to personal g uaranty,since hsbc allegedly represented to him that it would in the first instance seek recourse against the collateral property in the event of a default.and when all was said and done,the judge concluded that the guaranty unambiguous language wiped out that theory.so the judge rejected defenses and counterclaims and granted hsbc judgment on the pleadings too.concluding that any attempt to amend would be an exercise in futility,the judge also denied plea to replead.
which gets us to the here and now.
our view of the matter 
hurls a barrage of arguments our way,challenging the grant of judgment on the pleadings and the denial of his request to replead.we review a rule c dismissal like we would a rule b dismissal de novo,taking as true the losing party facts and seeing if they add up to a plausible claim for relief.see,grajales at.and as a general rule,we review a decision regarding amendments of pleadings for abuse of discretion,though when as is the case here futility is the linchpin for the judge ruling and the request came before the closing of discovery and the filing of any motion,the correctness of the futility tag is tested under the rule b standard.see,hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir.ultimately,however,none of arguments persuades.
judgment on the pleadings 
a fraudulent inducement 
loudly protests that his claim should have been enough to defeat hsbc dismissal efforts.his theory rises or falls on his belief that two provisions in the agreement constitute false statements of material fact made to induce him to sign the guaranty and that he reasonably relied on those false statements to his detriment.see,hogan riemer,laying out the elements of a claim.his theory falls,as we now explain.
the first provision he points to involves the ratio,which he alleges put the collateral property value at million and is an hsbc representation that the chance of its having to call the million guaranty was basically zero.hsbc made that representation,he adds,even though hsbc and not he knew that this was not the property real value.he does not say what the property actual value was,but he intimates that it had to have been less when he signed the guaranty and that hsbc had to have known it was less.this theory,however,flies in the face of the guaranty the very document where the reader will recall he expressly confirmed that he was familiar with the property value,that he was not relying on the property as an inducement to sign the guaranty,and that hsbc made no representations to induce him to execute that document.
the second provision he harps on provides emphasis ours that if brandywine defaults,hsbc can recover the obligations by selling the property.he reads this contract language as an hsbc representation that it would move against the property before turning to his guaranty a representation he continues made even though hsbc intended all along to collect only against the guaranty.we are unmoved.merely to state the obvious,that proviso says that hsbc can proceed first against the property,not that it must do so.anyway,what drives a stake through the heart of this part of his inducement theory is his agreeing in the guaranty that hsbc said nothing to induce him to make the guaranty.and do not forget that his guaranty specifically proclaims that it is the entire agreement between the parties,superseding all prior understandings,and explicitly provides that hsbc may enforce its rights against him the primary obligor without first trying to recover the debt from any pledged collateral.
ultimately and unhappily for we must enforce the guaranty according to its terms,with the parties rights ascertained from the written text.see first bank of boston ibarra,citing merrimack valley bank baird,and shawmut bank,wayman.but hang on a minute,says,a massachusetts rule holds that one can not induce a contract by fraud and then use contractual contrivances to duck liability.see,starr fordham,citing bates southgate,and noting,for example,that a n integration clause in a contract does not insulate automatically a party from liability where he induced another person to enter into a contract by misrepresentation.true enough.but another rule the one that holds sway here,for reasons we will discuss in a minute declares that reliance on supposed misrepresentations that contradict the terms of the parties agreement is unreasonable as a matter of law and so can not support a claim.id.quoting turner johnson johnson,cir accord masingill emc,calling this second rule a rule of long standing.and as we have just shown,the misrepresentations that trumpets are irreconcilably at odds with the guaranty express terms.to repeat and we apologize for the monotony of our analysis specifically warranted in the guaranty that he was familiar with the collateral property value,that the property did not operate as an inducement for him to make the uaranty,and that hsbc said nothing to induce him to execute the guaranty all of which destroys his thesis centered on the agreement provision see starr,at.he also agreed with the guaranty tagging him as the primary obligor and with its allowing hsbc to go after him first to recoup the debt provisions that put the kibosh on his other suggestion that hsbc must first seek recourse against the property.see id.
our case bears a striking resemblance to turner an opinion mentioned in a case parenthetical above.applying massachusetts law,there we affirmed a lower court decision rejecting plaintiffs claims.see turner,at.turner key facts may be swiftly summarized.
the turner plaintiffs sold an business to defendant for cash considerations and royalties based on future sales.id.at.plaintiffs later claimed that defendant had induced them to sell by misstating various things during negotiations,including that it would promote the thermometer sale.id.at.importantly,however,the contract final version stated that defendant had no obligation to market the thermometer.id.at.canvassing the cases,we found that the of negotiations would become meaningless if,after making concessions in order to obtain contractual protections,a knowledgeable party can later reclaim what it had given away by alleging that it had,in fact,relied not on the writing but on the prior oral statements.id.at.so we said that massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,for short undoubtedly would find that the threat to contractual certainty usually would outweigh the possible injustice of denying a claim of fraud.id.we added 
t he sjc would reject as a matter of law plaintiffs fraud claim based on defendant alleged promise to aggressively market the thermometer.certainly in this case,where both parties were experienced in business and the contract was fully negotiated and voluntarily signed,plaintiffs may not raise as fraudulent any prior oral assertion inconsistent with a contract provision that specifically addressed the particular point at issue.
id.at.and we concluded 
while we do not condone misrepresentations in contract negotiations,we also reject the notion that courts or juries should rewrite a fully negotiated contractual agreement that so precisely sets out the rights and obligations of two sophisticated parties.we do not believe this rule of law awards undue protection against fraud claims.it means only that a knowledgeable buyer should not sign a contract that conflicts with his or her understanding of the agreement.
id.at.turner stands on all fours with this case,given that the misrepresentations here are at odds with the guaranty terms.
desperate for a way around this reality,spends a lot of time trying to convince us that the sjc rejected turner in mcevoy travel bureau,norton.he also believes that the facts of his case fit snugly within mcevoy,which,he adds,obliges us to follow mcevoy anyway.he is wrong on both scores.
the mcevoy defendant,norton company,was a huge international conglomerate.at.the plaintiff,mcevoy travel bureau,was a small travel agency in worcester,massachusetts.id.for decades mcevoy had provided travel services to norton,always without a written contract.id.eventually the two reached an oral agreement calling for mcevoy to become norton exclusive travel agent for all of norton business.id.this would be a arrangement,they agreed.id.based on this understanding,mcevoy moved into norton building and hired extra personnel and bought extra equipment necessary to handle the extra business.id.
mcevoy had been fully performing under the agreement for two months when norton sent over a written version of the contract.id.mcevoy at first refused to sign it,complaining that the document stated that norton could terminate it on days notice and that it was renewable yearly.id.norton replied that the termination clause was inoperative and meaningless,a mere technicality added to make its lawyers happy though at that very time,norton was secretly considering an option that could make mcevoy expendable.id.at.an obviously mcevoy signed the contract.id.at.
three years later,norton invoked the termination clause that it had previously as pointless.id.at.unwilling to let its duper off the hook,mcevoy sued norton in state court for among other things fraud in inducing the contract.id.at.a jury found for mcevoy.id.and the sjc affirmed,saying,most relevantly,first,that statements of present intention as to future conduct like a fraudulent promise not to use the termination clause may be the basis for a fraud action if the statements misrepresent the actual intention of the speaker and were relied upon by the recipient to his damage,id.at and second,that mcevoy reliance was reasonable,because the long existing relationship between the parties entitled it to take norton statements at face value and credit them,id.at.
now back to arguments.sure,in reaching its result,the sjc reaffirmed that contracting parties,whether experienced in business or not,should deal with each other honestly,and that no one should be permitted to engage in fraud to induce the contract meaning the sjc saw no reason to create,as turner suggests,a new rule or an exception for cases where the players are considered sophisticated business enterprises.id.but mcevoy did not brush off turner core holding.and cases after mcevoy have embraced it,agreeing with turner that if the contract was fully negotiated and voluntarily signed,then plaintiffs may not raise as fraudulent any prior oral assertion inconsistent with a contract provision that specifically addressed the particular point at issue.starr,at quoting turner,at see also masingill,at same.and despite what he says,our facts look nothing like mcevoy.for one thing,he identifies no specific statement signifying hsbc intention that it in the future would treat a contract provision as so much hot air.mcevoy,at.for another,he alleges no history of performance with hsbc that could make his reliance on the duping conduct reasonable.id.given all this,mcevoy offers him no help.
however,has another massachusetts decision up his sleeve that he says supports his position,this one penned by a trial justice linear retail danvers,llc casatova,llc,wl.june.linear arose from an alleged default on a commercial lease by.id.at.when defendants signed the lease,they also signed a personal guaranty of the lease.id.claiming that defendants breached the lease by not paying rent as required,sued them in massachusetts state court,arguing that they,as guarantors of the rent obligation under the lease,were absolutely liable for the rent owed.id.at.to fend off plaintiff motion,defendants argued that plaintiff had drawn them into the lease by falsely representing that it would improve the leased premises in certain ways.id.at.the court denied the motion,concluding that w hether these representations were made,and whether,if made,they misrepresented plaintiff actual intentions,are factual issues ripe for determination by a factfinder.id.but there is a distinction between that case and that makes all the difference linear never says whether the pertinent contract there the lease had any provision directly contradictory to the misrepresentations.contrastingly,the pertinent contract here the guaranty has plenty of those.clearly,then,linear can not turn the tide for.
the net result of all this is that arguments fail.so we press on.
also believes that judgment on the pleadings was a because,he says,the guaranty clause is ambiguous on its face.as a refresher,we note again that this provision so far as relevant provides that n otwithstanding anything in this guaranty or any of the loan documents to the contrary,liability under the guaranty shall be limited to the guaranteed amount,defined as an amount equal to.sees ambiguity because he thinks that this proviso can either mean that he is responsible for the first million of the million loan which is hsbc preferred reading,he says or the last million which is his preferred reading,naturally.
unfortunately for,ambiguity does not arise simply because contracting parties bicker over a provision meaning,see,suffolk const.lanco scaffolding,if it did then reducing a contract to writing would give parties little or no protection,see fed.deposit ins.grace,cir posner,making contract drafting a real.instead,ambiguity arises only if a reasonable person could read the provision more than one way.see,brigade leveraged capital structures fund pimco income strategy fund.of course,whether a provision is ambiguous is a question of law that we must answer ourselves,see,eigerman putnam,mindful of this that we must read the provision in the context of the entire contract rather than in isolation,because the interplay between different provisions may cast some light on their meaning,see convention of the new jerusalem in the mackenzie,and that a dose of c ommon sense is as much a part of contract interpretation as is the dictionary or the arsenal of canons,see roberts enter.rent a car of boston,quoting fishman lasalle nat.bank,cir.
these basic principles spell doom for ambiguity claim.nothing in the contested provision or elsewhere in the guaranty,for that matter limits his guaranty obligation as primary obligor on the note to the last million of the million loan.the clause language is crystal clear,putting an million ceiling on his liability without providing even the faintest whisper of a suggestion that he is responsible only for the loan final million.what has done is pull his reading of the provision out of thin air,relying on mental gymnastics inconsistent with the guaranty actual words and with common sense.that his interpretation is not plausible wipes out his ambiguity theory.see,citation ins.gomez,mitcheson izdepski,n.
chapter and good faith dealing 
we can make quick work of charge that his pleadings alleged enough to push his chapter and claims across the plausibility line.for those not in the know,we point out that chapter prohibits u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,see.laws ch,a,and that courts read a duty of dealing into every massachusetts contract,see,harrison netcentric,anthony pier four,hbc.now,as argued on appeal,premises these claims on his fraud theory,which we state again runs like this first,that the ratio in the agreement is an hsbc representation that it would not need to collect on his guaranty an entirely false representation,he alleges and second,that the agreement saying that hsbc can recover against the collateral property if brandywine defaults is an hsbc representation that it would proceed against the property rather than against him as guarantor another entirely false representation,he posits.but because as we have explained his fraud theory fails,so too does his chapter claim.see,macoviak chase home mortg,holding that a litigant can not succeed on a chapter theory based on a fraud claim that is insufficient as a matter of law.and because he is not a party to the agreement between hsbc and brandywine,his claim necessarily fails as well.see,ayash dana farber cancer,stressing that t his implied covenant of dealing may not be invoked to create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship quoting uno,boston kenmore realty.
looking to deflect attention from this powerful body of massachusetts caselaw,talks up sections and of the restatement third of suretyship and guaranty,which we will simply call the restatement to save some keystrokes.as he tells it,both sections bolster his chapter and claims.not so,we conclude.
reader alert when perusing the next two paragraphs,keep in mind that hsbc here is the obligee,brandywine is the principal obligor,and is the secondary obligor at least that is how he sees things.
broadly speaking,section provides that if an obligee acts to increase the secondary obligor risk of loss by increasing its potential cost of performance or decreasing its potential ability to cause the principal obligor to bear the cost of performance,the secondary obligor is discharged as described in subsections and.see restatement.subsection allows a discharge if the obligee releas es the principal obligor from a duty other than the payment of money or agree s to modify the duties of the principal obligor that either amounts to a substituted contract or imposes a risk on the secondary obligor fundamentally different than those imposed before the modification.id.subsection provides a list of acts that allow a discharge,but the gist of this subsection is that a discharge is in order if the obligee committed any act or omission that impairs the principal obligor duty of performance,the principal obligor duty to reimburse,or the secondary obligor right of restitution or subrogation.id.is adamant that his case fits section to a t.but he makes no attempt to explain why this is so,alleging nothing showing how hsbc conduct comes within the ambit of subsections or.his argument therefore goes nowhere see,ruiz sánchez goodyear tire rubber,cir stressing that claims woven entirely out flimsy strands of speculation and surmise do not satisfy the plausibility standard morales cruz of,cir explaining that speculation,unaccompanied by any factual predicate,is not sufficient to confer plausibility.
as for section,it provides that an obligee may be required to liquidate collateral to satisfy a debt when to do otherwise would result in unusual hardship to the secondary obligor and enforcing the security interest would not materially prejudice or burden the obligee or other beneficiaries of the secondary obligation.see restatement b.and,building to the ultimate crescendo,he theorizes that hardship and prejudice burden issues are questions of fact for a jury,not for a judge on a rule c motion.now admittedly,he does say in his pleadings emphasis ours that he will face unusual hardship if required to pony up the million and that hsbc will not face any hardship,nor be materially prejudiced or burdened if forced to first look to the property for repayment of any money owing on the loan.but these are conclusory allegations,simply parroting the legalese of the restatement without providing any factual support that might give them plausibility.consequently,we need not credit them see,elsevier,cir holding that w hen allegations,though disguised as factual,are so threadbare that they omit any meaningful factual content,we will treat them as what they are naked conclusions that can not help a party pass the plausibility test shay walters,cir emphasizing that in deciding whether allegations cross the plausibility threshold,an inquiring court need not give weight to bare conclusions,unembellished by pertinent facts.
undue influence and unconscionable contract of adhesion 
the judge rejected and claims,concluding that both theories were undone by sophistication in real estate matters and by the language of the g uaranty itself.only complaint about this on appeal is with the sophistication comment.to his way of thinking,this remark shows that the judge,when addressing these two claims,considered matters outside the pleadings and resolved credibility issues against him.see generally.d declaring that i f,on a motion under rule c,matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule,and adding that a ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all material that is pertinent to the motion.the problem for is that his pleadings and the undisputed documents he attached to them showed his sophistication.his counterclaims,for example,played up the legal ly and technical ly complex environmental problems that brandywine navigated in its quest to convert the property to residential use.and of course he acknowledged in his guaranty that he held an ownership interest in brandywine.he also acknowledged there that he had independently reviewed brandywine financial records and was familiar with the collateral property value.if more were needed,brandywine acknowledged in the agreement that hsbc had examined and relied on the experience of brandywine and its general partners,members,and principals in owning and operating properties like the property at issue.additionally,never tried to support his unconscionability and theories by claiming that he was a unsophisticate.the bottom line is that we see nothing resembling reversible error here.
post briefing letter 
by way of a letter,see fed.j,spotlights a lawyer comment in an article that w hen dealing with a guarantee limited to an amount,a lender g enerally intends that the last x dollars be guaranteed and that the guarantor may make the argument that his guarantee does kick in until the lender has liquidated its collateral from its primary obligor.see william barnett,limited guarantees variations,limitations,and lamentations,banking.but he cites us no case showing that massachusetts buys into any of this.also,generally is not the same as always,see newman krintzman,cir,and even the article that he clings to stresses that t he parties can,of course,create their own arrangements regarding the order in which the lender will proceed against guarantors or collateral,see barnett,supra,at.again,that is precisely what the parties did here,with the guaranty crystalline words declaring that hsbc is in no way required to move first against the collateral,brandywine,or others to collect what it is owed.so the article does nothing to help him.
letter also intimates for the first time on appeal that hsbc may have breached some fiduciary duties to him.but the general rule applicable here is that issues not developed in a party opening brief are waived.see,ins.of point judith marina,llc,cir.we say no more about that subject.
summing up 
floats an array of reasons why the judge stumbled in granting hsbc judgment on the pleadings.but not one can carry the day for him,which is the short of this very long section of our analysis.that leaves his last category of argument that the judge slipped in denying him leave to replead his defenses and counterclaims an argument to which we now turn.
leave to replead 
a judge should freely give leave to replead when justice so requires,as notes at some length.see.a.but a judge may deny leave if amending the pleading would be futile that is,if the amendment does not plead enough to make out a plausible claim for relief.see hatch,at see also foman davis,noting that in addition to futility,undue delay,bad faith,and the absence of due diligence on the movant part may justify denying leave to amend.never tells us what further facts he could plead to get around the problems highlighted above.he simply believes that his pleadings as currently fashioned do the trick a belief that is blown away by the unambiguous guaranty,for the reasons recorded in these pages.in other words,he has not provided below or here any additional facts which,if repled,would permit him to cross the plausibility threshold when matched up against the guaranty express language.consequently,the judge ruling on this issue stands.see,gray evercore restructuring,cir finding futility where the party could not allege anything that could repair the problem in its case.
final words 
concluding,as we do,that the district judge committed no reversible error,we uphold the judgment that entered below.
affirmed,with hsbc awarded its costs on appeal.

as a,whenever we quote a document in the text,we do away with unnecessary capitalization or bolding of words.but to give the reader a better sense of the documents setup,we present some of the relevant provisions like these ones in footnotes,reproducing them essentially as they appear in the papers ii.the loan section conditions precedent to disbursement of project loan proceeds conditions of advances p appraisal.hsbc shall have received an appraisal of the property,commissioned by hsbc at brandywine cost and expense,that indicates an as is loan to value ratio which does not exceed and that is otherwise satisfactory to hsbc in its sole discretion.no reliance.all conditions and requirements of this agreement are for the sole benefit of hsbc and no other person shall have the right to rely on the satisfaction of such conditions and requirements by brandywine.
the loan documents say nothing about the property value.but theorizes that hsbc must have pegged the property value at million,because the agreement provides that the million loan amount can not exceed of the property value.
that piece of the agreement is set out this way vi.transferssection agent and lenders reliance.brandywine acknowledges that hsbc ha s examined and relied on the experience of brandywine and its general partners,members,and principals in owning and operating properties such as the property in agreeing to enter into this agreement and make the project loan,and will continue to rely on brandywine ownership of the property as a means of maintaining the value of the property as security for repayment and performance of the obligations under the project loan documents.brandywine acknowledges that hsbc ha s a valid interest in maintaining the value of the property so as to ensure that,should brandywine default in the repayment and performance of the obligations under the project loan documents,hsbc can recover the obligations by a sale of the property.
this part of the guaranty i
