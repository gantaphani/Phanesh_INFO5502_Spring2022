background 
bank,a delaware corporation,owns bank national association,which is a federally chartered national banking association that was formed in accordance with the national bank act.the bank is governed by a board of directors,which is empowered by the bank bylaws to elect and discharge officers.
kathy kroske began working for the bank in as a teller.on april,the bank board of directors elected kroske as an officer in the role of assistant vice president.during restructuring due to a merger,the bank changed kroske position from retail market manager to manager of the manito bank branch in spokane,washington.as manager,kroske was notified that her branch was not meeting the bank goals and quotas for business activity.although kroske contends that her branch was the smallest in the area with the fewest employees,and that she was,the bank continued to insist that her branch meet fixed business activity levels and warned that she would be disciplined if it did not.ultimately,in july,the bank terminated kroske for allegedly failing to meet the daily performance goals.the board of directors subsequently ratified kroske termination in a meeting convened in minneapolis,minnesota.
kroske filed suit in washington state superior court against the bank.she alleged that at the time of her termination,the other branch managers in the region were in their twenties and thirties,while kroske was years old.further,the bank allegedly gave these younger managers a reasonable opportunity to meet the business activity goals and denied kroske such an opportunity.in addition,kroske contended that she was replaced by an employee who was in his and possessed less experience than kroske.kroske therefore alleged that the bank had terminated her on the basis of her age in violation of the wlad,and sought damages,as well as attorney fees and costs.in her complaint,kroske did not allege any federal causes of action.
the bank removed the case to federal court and,once in federal court,filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that kroske state discrimination claim was preempted by the national bank act,specifically fifth,which grants national banks the power to dismiss officers at pleasure.kroske opposed the motion,contending that she was not an officer under fifth and,in the alternative,that the national bank act did not preempt her age discrimination claim under the wlad.
the district court granted the bank motion for summary judgment.the court held that kroske qualified as an officer under the national bank act.further,the district court concluded that fifth preempts the field of law regulating the bank employment practices and therefore preempted kroske age discrimination claim under the wlad.kroske timely appealed,challenging the district court jurisdiction and the grant of summary judgment.
ii.amount in controversy 
kroske first contends that removal of her case to federal court was improper because the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction under she argues that the bank did not meet its burden of establishing that the amount in controversy exceeded.we review de novo a district court determination that diversity jurisdiction exists.breitman may,cir.the factual determinations necessary to establish diversity jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error.energy csl,cir.
where,as here,the complaint does not demand a dollar amount,the removing defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds.singer state farm mut.auto.ins,cir cohn petsmart,cir.the amount in controversy includes the amount of damages in dispute,as well as attorney fees,if authorized by statute or contract.see galt jss scandinavia,cir.when the amount is not facially apparent from the complaint,the court may consider facts in the removal petition,and may require parties to submit evidence relevant to the amount in controversy at the time of removal.singer,at quoting allen r h oil gas,cir.
here,kroske complaint alleged that she suffered and continues to suffer economic and emotion sic injuries and other damages,with specific amounts to be proven at the time of trial.in response to the bank interrogatories,kroske further identified the following categories of damages lost wages,benefits including but not limited to health and mental insurance,k contributions,value of life insurance policies,stock options,and emotional distress damages,as well as attorney fees and costs.kroske did not,however,allege the amount of damages or fees she sought.
in determining the amount in controversy,the district court properly considered kroske interrogatory answers and emotional distress damage awards in similar age discrimination cases in washington.see de aguilar boeing,cir.based upon a preponderance of the evidence,the court concluded that kroske lost wages amounted to at least,that her k contribution amounted to at least,and that her emotional distress damages would add at least an additional to her claim.therefore,even without including a potential award of attorney fees,the district court found that the amount in controversy exceeded.this finding was not clearly erroneous diversity jurisdiction properly exists in this case.
iii.preemption 
kroske contends that the district court erred in concluding that her age discrimination claim under the wlad,was preempted by the national bank act.the national bank act provides that a national bank shall have the power t o elect or appoint directors,and by its board of directors to appoint a president,vice president,cashier,and other officers,define their duties,require bonds of them and fix the penalty thereof,dismiss such officers or any of them at pleasure,and appoint others to fill their places.fifth emphasis added.kroske concedes that she was appointed and terminated by the board of directors and does not challenge the district court determination that she was an officer under fifth.kroske contends,however,that the district court erred in determining that her state law age discrimination claim is preempted by the provision of fifth.we agree.

further,w here federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.debuono med.clinical servs.fund,d internal quotations omitted rice,at.the presumption of does not apply,however,when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.united states locke,d see also air conditioning refrigeration inst.energy res.conservation dev.comm n,cir.here,although we recognize that there is a significant federal presence in the regulation of national banks,see bank of am.city county of san francisco,cir,wlad was enacted pursuant to the state historic police powers to prohibit discrimination on specified grounds.see.thus,we begin with the presumption that congress did not intend the national bank act to preempt the wlad.pg e california,cir holding that presumption against preemption of generally applicable state law applies in bankruptcy area.coast ry.city of palm beach,cir although the federal government through the iccta has legislated in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence,west palm beach is acting under the traditionally local police power of zoning and health and safety regulation.footnote,citation and quotation omitted.
the provision of fifth is part of the scheme of federal laws governing the duties and powers of federally chartered banks.congress has legislated in the field of banking from the days of maryland,wheat,creating an extensive federal statutory and regulatory scheme.bank of,at.the purpose of this scheme was to facilitate what representative hooper termed a national banking system,marquette bank first of omaha serv,d footnote and citation omitted,and to protect national banks against intrusive regulation by the states,bank of,at.accordingly,the history of national banking law is one of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily preempting,contrary state law.barnett bank,nelson,d.
nonetheless,s ince shortly after the bank act was enacted in,the supreme court has oft reiterated that federal substantive authority over national banks is not exclusive.wells fargo bank boutris,cir citation and footnote omitted.rather,regulation of banking has been one of dual control with the states since the passage of the first national bank act.state bank long,cir.accordingly,federal banking statutes and regulations do not deprive states of the power to regulate national banks,where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.barnett bank,at.state laws regulating the conduct of national banks are void only if they conflict with federal law,frustrate the purposes of the national bank act,or impair the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties.bank of,at see also barnett bank,at.holding that a federal statute granting national banks authority to sell insurance conflicts with and therefore preempts state law forbidding banks from selling insurance franklin bank new york.holding that national banks power to receive deposits conflicts with and therefore preempts a state statute prohibiting use of the word savings in banking advertisements anderson bank luckett.holding that a state statute providing for transfer of abandoned bank deposits was not preempted because national banks are subject to state laws,unless those laws infringe the national banking laws or impose an undue burden on them.
in light of the historic dual regulation of banks by state and federal law,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that the provision of the national bank act preempts the entire field of law governing national banks employment practices.indeed,the provision is not accompanied by a pervasive regulatory scheme that governs the dismissal of bank officers,the mere volume and complexity of which demonstrate s an implicit congressional intent to displace all state law.bank of,at quoting geier am.honda motor,d.rather,the national bank act simply contains one undefined clause dismiss such officers or any of them at pleasure.fifth.this clause does not reflect that congress clear and manifest purpose was preemption of the entire field of state law.
we therefore must determine the intended purpose and scope of the provision and,given that scope,whether the wlad conflict s with federal law,frustrate s the purposes of the national bank act,or impair s the efficiency of national banks to discharge their duties.bank of,at the meaning and scope of the provision is not defined by statute,regulations,or legislative history.in fact,the only evidence of congressional intent regarding the purpose and scope of the national bank act provision is provided by case law.
an early leading case addressing the clause explained the purpose of the provision as follows 
observation and experience alike teach that it is essential to the safety and prosperity of banking institutions that the active officers,to whose integrity and discretion the moneys and property of the bank and its customers are intrusted,should be subject to immediate removal whenever the suspicion of faithlessness or negligence attaches to them.high credit is indispensable to the success and prosperity of a bank.without it,customers can not be induced to deposit their moneys.when it has once been secured,and then declines,those who have deposited demand their cash,the income of the bank dwindles,and often bankruptcy follows.it sometimes happens that,without any justification,a suspicion of dishonesty or carelessness attaches to a cashier or a president of a bank,spreads through the community in which he lives,scares the depositors,and threatens immediate financial ruin to the institution.in such a case it is necessary to the prosperity and the very a banking institution that the board of directors should have power to remove such an officer,and to put in his place another,in whom the community has confidence.in our opinion,the provision of the act of congress to which we have referred was inserted,ex industria,to provide for this very contingency.

similarly,we have concluded that the provision of the national bank act bars contract claims challenging a bank dismissal of an officer.see mackey pioneer bank,cir holding that fifth has been consistently interpreted to mean that the board of directors of a national bank may dismiss an officer without liability for breach of the agreement to employ.we further have concluded that the national bank act raise s a defense to both contract and tort claims.id.at.in mackey,we explained,
it would make little sense to allow state tort claims to proceed,where a former bank officer contract claims are barred by section fifth.the effect would be to substitute tort for contract claims,thus subjecting the national bank to all the dangers attendant to dismissing an officer.the purpose of the provision in the national bank act was to give those institutions the greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers,in order to maintain the public trust.
we also have held that the provision in the federal home loan act,a,bars state tort wrongful discharge claims.see inglis,at.in inglis,we considered a wrongful discharge claim based upon the california law exception to termination under tameny atl.richfield,cal d.inglis,at.we held that the plaintiff claim,which alleged that the reason for his termination was his insistence that the bank conform its practices to federal law,was preempted by the federal home loan act,a.see also bollow fed.reserve bank,cir holding that federal reserve bank employee claims alleging a right to a hearing before termination under state law conflicted with and were preempted by the provision in fifth.
we again addressed a bank authority to dismiss a bank officer under an provision in walleri fed.home loan bank,cir.in walleri,we concluded that the federal home loan bank act provision,a,preempted a state wrongful discharge claim alleging that the bank wrongfully terminated the plaintiff because she prepared a report critical of the bank lack of compliance with the federal banking laws.walleri,at.we also held that walleri emotional distress claim was preempted.although we recognized that the bank power to dismiss at pleasure would not necessarily preempt claims based on an employer wrongful act directed at the employee outside of the employment relationship,the conduct complained of in the plaintiff emotional distress allegations relate d solely to the employment relationship.id.at.we therefore affirmed the dismissal of the emotional distress claim,concluding w hen a vested power in the federal home loan banks to select,employ,and fix the compensation of their employees to define their duties and to dismiss them at pleasure it left no room for oversight under state law over the manner in which that power is exercised.id.alterations in original.
in light of our past holdings delineating the preemptive scope of the banking laws provisions,the bank argues that fifth also preempts kroske claim under the wlad.to support this contention the bank cites the sixth circuit ruling in leon fed.reserve bank,cir.in leon,the sixth circuit concluded that the act,michigan statute.comp.laws ann,was preempted by the federal reserve act provision,fifth.leon,at.with little analysis of the issue,the court concluded that the provision preempts any employment right to the contrary,including the plaintiff claim under the state law.see also arrow,at applying leon and holding that a state claim was preempted.
we disagree with the sixth circuit summary conclusion that state statutes enacted under a state police powers are preempted by the banking laws simply because they are part of a general category of employment right s.unlike the cases involving state common law employment claims,here we are confronted with a state statute prohibiting discrimination,which is modeled after and incorporated into the federal laws.thus,federal preemption of the wlad must be considered in light of congress enactment of relevant federal employment discrimination laws and the cooperative scheme 
federal statutes are relevant to our inquiry because federally chartered banks are not exempt from liability under these laws.see cooper fed.reserve bank,d holding that members of a class of black employees of a federal reserve bank could maintain separate actions against the bank under title vii see also enforcement guidance on coverage of federal reserve banks,eeoc decision no.concluding that federal reserve banks are not executive agencies and are covered by title vii,the adea,the equal pay act epa,and the americans with disabilities act ada as private employers.indeed,courts that have addressed the issue consistently have held that banks are subject to liability for discrimination under federal laws irrespective of the bank right to dismiss an officer or employee at pleasure.see,leon,at noting that plaintiff could have brought her discrimination claim under title vii diniz fed.reserve bank,wl,at,holding that the federal reserve bank may be sued for violations of title vii mueller.at holding that fifth does not bar a discrimination claim under the adea.
here,because kroske has alleged age discrimination under the wlad,we are particularly concerned with the congressional intent expressed in the enactment of the adea,which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age.see.the adea is part of an ongoing congressional effort to eradicate discrimination in the workplace,and reflects a societal condemnation of invidious bias in employment decisions.mckennon nashville banner publ g,d.accordingly,the adea shares a common purpose with title vii the paramount federal statute to eliminate discrimination in employment and to remedy the effects of such discriminatory conduct.id.at.because the laws are part of a consistent remedial scheme,t he substantive,provisions of the adea are modeled upon the prohibitions of title vii.id.at.see also trans world airlines,thurston,d.
the provisions of the adea conflict with the banks authority to dismiss officers at pleasure.as a result,we must give effect to the congressional intent expressed in the adea by limiting the power granted to banks through fifth.we recognize that when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.morton mancari,d.we have held,however,that fifth grants banks the greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers.mackey,at.in light of the broad power extended to banks to dismiss officers at pleasure without limitation,we are not able to harmonize fifth with the adea prohibition against discrimination.
rather,we conclude that the two provisions are in irreconcilable conflict with regard to the banks power to dismiss an officer on the basis of age.there is no ambiguity as to the nature of the remedial scheme congress enacted in the adea,and that scheme simply can not work if fifth is allowed to operate concurrently.kee leasing mcgahan in re glacier bay,cir.although repeals by implication are not favored,morton,at.quoting posadas city bank,where provisions in the two acts,such as the provisions at issue,are in irreconcilable conflict,the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one.radzanower touche ross,d quoting posadas,at.
however,when,as here,two statutes are partially in conflict,r epeal is to be regarded as implied only to the minimum extent necessary.in re glacier bay,at first alteration in original quoting silver stock,d.we therefore conclude that the provision of fifth is repealed by implication only to the extent necessary to give effect to the adea accordingly,the authority to dismiss officers at pleasure does not encompass the right to terminate an officer in a manner that violates the prohibitions against discrimination enumerated in the adea.
it follows that the provision of the wlad prohibiting age discrimination does not conflict with the provision of the national bank act.the wlad provides that it is an unfair practice for any employer t o discharge or bar any person from employment because of age.this provision mirrors the substantive provisions of the adea and is interpreted consistently with the adea.see anderson pac.ass n,cir washington law against discrimination tracks federal law grimwood of puget sound,holding that because.does not provide any criteria for establishing an age discrimination case,washington courts look to federal cases construing the adea.thus,in the absence of clear congressional intent to the contrary,we hold that kroske claim of age discrimination under the wlad is not preempted by fifth,as limited by the adea.shaw delta air lines,d holding that state laws are not expressly preempted by erisa insofar as they are consistent with title vii aloha islanda
