iii.discussion 
this case presents the question whether the court of federal claims correctly granted partial summary judgment for the government on the issue of damages by interpreting the agreement to require amortization of goodwill in accordance with gaap.
contract interpretation begins with the language of the written agreement.foley united states.it is significant in this case that both coast and the government agree that the contract is unambiguous.where,as here,the provisions of the agreement are phrased in clear and unambiguous language,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning,and we may not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them.mcabee,united states.the agreement must be considered as a whole and interpreted so as to harmonize and give reasonable meaning to all of its parts.id.
relying on the statement in a c that the cash contribution shall be credited to coast net worth account and shall constitute regulatory capital and extrinsic evidence,coast argues that regulatory capital is permanent,which it assumes precludes amortization of a corresponding amount of goodwill.the government,however,urges us to look no further than the plain language of the contract to find that coast was required to abide by gaap,which requires the amortization of goodwill.
we agree that the agreement unambiguously incorporates gaap and does not support coast interpretation.section of the agreement states in pertinent part 
except as otherwise provided,any computations made for purposes of this agreement shall be governed by generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the savings and loan industry,except that where such principles conflict with the terms of the agreement,applicable regulations of the bank board or fslic,or any resolution or action of the bank board approving or relating to the acquisition or to this agreement,then this agreement,such regulations,or such resolution or action shall govern.
agreement,accounting principles emphasis added.section requires that the computations and filings made pursuant to the agreement be prepared in accordance with gaap,unless provisions elsewhere in the agreement authorize a departure from gaap.thus,the sophisticated parties in this case incorporated into the agreement accounting practices and established meanings forged in the relevant gaap.
gaap are the official standards adopted by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa,such as aicpa accounting research bulletins,accounting principles board apb opinions,and financial accounting standards board fasb statements and interpretations.see generally donald kieso et,intermediate accounting ed.particularly germane to this case,fasb statement,entitled accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions,requires that if,and to the extent that,the fair value of liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in the acquisition of a banking or thrift institution,the intangible asset recognized generally must be amortized.fasb statement of financial standards apb opinion stating that intangible assets should never be written off immediately or amortized over more than forty years,superseded by fasb statement of financial standards june stating that intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
the court of federal claims determined that fasb statement requires coast to amortize goodwill recognized under the agreement over a period of years.coast,fed.cl.at.goodwill,an intangible asset,is the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.see,kieso et,supra,at.in this case,goodwill recognized under the agreement amounted to million,the difference between the million of central net liabilities and the zero dollars coast contributed to the transaction.accordingly,gaap require coast to amortize the million of goodwill over a period of years.
to be sure,in some respects the terms of the agreement conflict with gaap.for example,as discussed below,gaap,which require coast to offset the million of goodwill with the
