background 
the history and circumstances surrounding the thrift crisis of the early and the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea,pub,stat,in have been extensively discussed in the original winstar cases and will not be revisited here.see united states winstar,d winstar iii.
this action is one of more than pending cases.to improve efficiency and preserve judicial resources,the court of federal claims selected four exemplary cases,including this one,that it considered via hearings and summary judgment motions to decide the common issues pertaining to the liability of the government and to resolve dispositively any common issues for the remaining cases.the numerous plaintiffs were organized into a plaintiffs coordinating committee pcc which identified common issues it believed were raised in the government summary judgment briefing.the court found of these to be present in the four exemplary cases.
the transactions at issue here are threefold cal fed acquisition of three georgia thrifts and one florida thrift the southeastern transaction cal fed acquisition of brentwood savings and loan association brentwood,a california thrift and cal fed acquisition of family savings and loan association family,a nevada thrift.
in the southeastern transaction,cal fed assumed million in net liabilities through four supervisory mergers in february.it entered into an assistance agreement with the government under which it received a forbearance letter permitting the excess liabilities to be recorded as supervisory goodwill and amortized over to years,and a million capital credit from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic as an additional inducement.cal fed later sold these southeastern thrifts.the government does not dispute the presence of a contract with cal fed regarding the southeastern transaction because the assistance agreement contained a provision that explicitly incorporated the contemporaneous forbearance letters.
however,the government does contest the presence of a contract in the remaining two transactions,in which there was no capital credit inducement provided by the fslic and,accordingly,no assistance agreement explicitly incorporating the forbearance letters into a single document.by a september,letter,in its acquisition of brentwood,cal fed specifically requested approval from the federal home loan bank board fhlbb to amortize goodwill created by the acquisition over the estimated useful life of years.the fhlbb approved the acquisition on september,and on october,issued a forbearance letter stipulating that the resulting association may amortize any goodwill created over years.the fhlbb agreed not to enforce its net worth requirements for a period of five years to the extent that cal fed failure to meet the requirements was attributable to the assets or liabilities acquired from brentwood.cal fed assumed million in net liabilities from brentwood in october.
the family acquisition proceeded similarly,though the commitment regarding amortization of goodwill was contained in the acquisition agreement,article a,which stated that the resulting association of cal fed and family may amortize any goodwill created under the purchase method of accounting using the straight line method over the useful life of years.this amortization was structured in the agreement as a condition precedent to cal fed obligations.the merger application sent to the fhlbb included the acquisition agreement and an additional request to approve the amortization.in two subsequent forbearance letters dated november,and january,the fhlbb confirmed cal fed entitlement to record the merger under the purchase method of accounting and amortize resulting goodwill over years.cal fed assumed million in net liabilities in its acquisition of family in.as in the brentwood transaction,the fhlbb agreed not to enforce its net worth requirements for a period of five years to the extent that cal fed failure to meet the requirements was attributable to the assets or liabilities acquired from family.in all three transactions,cal fed was permitted to count goodwill as an asset for regulatory capital purposes for as long as it remained on their accounting records.
cal fed brought suit against the government in the court of federal claims for breaching its merger agreements by enacting firrea,which forced the accelerated of goodwill over a period beginning in.the court held on summary judgment that the government was liable for breach of its contract with cal fed and referred the case to trial on the issue of damages.before trial,the court denied the claim for lost profits on summary judgment because of their highly speculative nature.after trial,the court awarded cal fed the sum of million in damages as the cost of replacing the regulatory capital lost due to the accelerated phase out of goodwill under firrea.the court denied cal fed request for restitution because it had not proven that its agreement to assume the net liabilities of the acquired thrifts was a cost in the circumstances of this case,and rejected wounded bank damages based on insufficient proof of causation.the united states appeals and cal fed.

the government concedes that a contract existed in the southeastern transaction,but argues that the absence of an assistance agreement incorporating the forbearance letters precludes a finding that a contract existed in the brentwood and family transactions.winstar ii,however,did not rely exclusively on the assistance agreements to find a contract it considered contemporaneous documents and surrounding circumstances that included forbearance letters like those present here.at.the assistance agreements were executed between acquiring thrifts and the government only in those situations where the government included a further inducement to the acquiring thrift to complete the transaction in the form of a capital credit.such credits arose when fslic itself contributed cash to further a supervisory merger and permitted the acquiring institution to count the fslic contribution as a permanent credit to regulatory capital.winstar iii,at.the fact that cal fed did not enter into an assistance agreement by which it would receive direct cash assistance from the fslic in the brentwood and family transactions as it did in the southeastern transaction is not dispositive of the issue of contract formation between the government and cal fed.similarly,the difference in the form of consideration offered by the government in the southeastern transaction,on the one hand,and the brentwood and family transactions,on the other,does not negate the exchange in the latter two transactions.here,as in winstar iii,the government bargained with cal fed to assume the net liabilities of the acquired thrifts in exchange for favorable regulatory consideration allowing goodwill to be counted as an asset for regulatory capital purposes and to be amortized over to years.we agree with the court of federal claims that i f the factual records of individual cases show intent to contract with the government for specified treatment of goodwill,and documents such as correspondence,memoranda and fhlbb resolutions confirm that intent,the absence of an assistance agreement or supervisory action agreement should be irrelevant to the finding that a contract existed.cal.fed.i.at.we therefore conclude that there were legally binding exchanges in the brentwood and family transactions as well as in the southeastern transaction.
we have no doubt that both the government and cal fed provided consideration for the agreements.based on all of the contemporaneous documents in each of the three transactions,the fhlbb and the fslic were contractually bound to recognize the supervisory goodwill and the amortization periods reflected in the forbearance letters.in the southeastern transaction,the government also was bound by the terms of the assistance agreement to provide a capital credit of million in addition to the favorable regulatory treatment of supervisory goodwill.cal fed was reciprocally bound to assume the net liabilities of the acquired thrifts million in its acquisition of southeastern,million in its acquisition of brentwood,and million in its acquisition of family.it is clear from the documents that this was the intent of the parties.as we held in winstar ii,i f the parties did not intend to use supervisory goodwill for regulatory capital purposes there would simply be no reason for the extensive negotiations and the conditions regarding its use.winstar ii,at.once specific terms as to the amount of supervisory goodwill and its amortization periods under that regulatory policy were incorporated in a negotiated arm length contract,both parties were bound to them.id.
we have already answered the question of whether the fhlbb and the fslic have the authority to enter into contracts like these in the affirmative.id.at.since its inception,the fslic has had the authority under c to make contracts.id.further,both the fslic and its supervisory agency,the fhlbb,have had the authority both to extend assistance to acquirers of insolvent thrifts,f a repealed,and to set minimum capital limits on a basis,t repealed.id.
in winstar iii,the supreme court recognized that the issue of whether there was a contract between the thrifts and the government was not strictly before it,at,but did not doubt this court conclusion that the overall documentation in the winstar transaction establishes an express agreement allowing winstar to proceed with the merger plan approved by the fhlbb,including the recording of supervisory goodwill as a capital asset for regulatory capital purposes to be amortized over years.at.quoting winstar ii,at.just as in winstar iii,all of the necessary elements of contract formation are present here,and the parties are bound by the terms of that contract.
the government further argues that,even if there were contracts in the brentwood and family transactions,their term was limited to five years by the net worth forbearances.these allowed cal fed to be considered in compliance with its reserve and net worth requirements to the extent that any noncompliance is due to a operating or capital losses on acquired assets,b the amount of net liabilities of the acquired thrift,or c other items solely attributable to the acquisition.because these agreements expired prior to the passage of firrea,the government argues that firrea and its regulations did not breach any contracts with cal fed.
notably,the government did not claim that the expiration of the net worth forbearances barred the inclusion of supervisory goodwill for regulatory capital purposes until the common issue proceedings that led to the instant summary judgment of liability in.the court of federal claims agreed with the pcc that two of the three winstar test cases involved forbearance letters issued by the fhlbb that contained net worth forbearances similar,if not identical,to those now at issue.cal.fed.i.at.in those cases,the supreme court allowed amortization of goodwill over the entire period authorized by the forbearances and not merely for the term of the net worth forbearances.winstar iii,at.these contracts permitting special accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill were breached by firrea and its regulations.id.at.we view the expiration provision as relating only to the net worth forbearances that barred the fhlbb from enforcing its capital requirements for five years to the extent that any violation of those requirements was traceable to the subject acquisitions.the terms of the forbearance letters permitting the amortization over to years were separate and apart from the terms.in any event,the expiration provision of the net worth forbearances does not negate other obligations under the merger plan,including the specific time periods for amortization of goodwill.winstar ii,at.
as shown by the documentary evidence for the brentwood and family transactions,this amortization of goodwill was a central consideration in cal fed acquisitions.the documentary evidence for both the brentwood and family transactions demonstrates that purchase accounting and amortization of goodwill were essential terms of the negotiated transactions.there is no factual dispute concerning these documents,and they are precisely the type of evidence relied upon by the winstar courts to establish the existence of contracts between acquiring thrifts and the government.therefore,the government breach of that contractual promise was substantial and material.
we now turn to the matter of damages for the government breach.cal fed sought expectancy damages in the form of lost profits from the forced shrinkage of its assets to reestablish capital compliance,and reimbursement for the cost of replacing the capital previously provided by the supervisory goodwill with cash.cal fed additionally requested restitution of the benefit it had conferred on the government by assuming the net liabilities of the acquired thrifts.finally,it sought reliance damages in the form of wounded bank damages allegedly incurred as a result of the government withdrawal of the right to use supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital.
one way the law makes the party whole is to give him the benefits he expected to receive had the breach not occurred.glendale,at citing restatement second of contracts a.the benefits that were expected from the contract,expectancy damages,are often equated with lost profits,although they can include other damage elements as well.id.citing restatement second of contracts.lost profits are a recognized measure of damages where their loss is the proximate result of the breach and the fact that there would have been a profit is definitely established,and there is some basis on which a reasonable estimate of the amount of the profit can be made.neely united states.
according to wells fargo united states,
if the profits are such as would have accrued and grown out of the contract itself,as the direct and immediate results of its fulfillment,then they would form a just and proper item of damages,to be recovered against the delinquent party upon a breach of the agreement but if they are such as would have been realized by the party from other independent and collateral undertakings,although entered into
