plaintiffs jack martin and anita martin the martins,appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered upon an order sustaining the demurrer of defendant wells fargo bank the bank to their first amended complaint.
the bank issued business credit cards to the law offices of jack martin,one in the name of plaintiff jack martin,and one in the name of plaintiff anita martin,which they used for personal and household expenses.the bank exercised a right of setoff for amounts due on anita card by debiting the martins joint checking account.
the martins,as credit card debtors and depositors,sued the bank to recover damages caused by a claimed improper exercise of the setoff.the validity of the action turns on the applicability of financial code section to the martins debt the section limits a bank right to setoff a matured debt arising from an extension of credit to a natural person primarily for personal,family,or household purposes hereafter consumer goods,subd.a.
the martins claim an extension of credit occurs when a debt is created by the use of a credit card.the bank claims an extension of credit occurs when the bank issues a credit card and it is at that point that it must be determined whether the credit is primarily for personal,family or household purposes.we agree with the bank.
the application of section is conditioned by the primary purpose for which credit is extended and that is determined when the credit card is issued rather than on each occasion when the card is used for a transaction or purchase.since the primary purpose of a business credit card is commercial,the bank may setoff the debts incurred in its use without compliance with section.conversely,the primary purpose of a personal credit card is for personal expenditures and the bank is subject to the setoff limitations of section.
we will affirm the judgment.
