in this putative class action for securities fraud,financial acquisition partners and john may plaintiffs appeal the federal rule of civil procedure b dismissal of their second amended complaint pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act pslra.plaintiffs claims arise from their purchase of shares,and the bankruptcy shortly thereafter,of amresco.plaintiffs challenge the district court holding implicitly that collateral estoppel did not preclude the individual defendants raising certain defenses striking opinions from an expert affidavit attached to the complaint holding plaintiffs failed to satisfy the pslra pleading requirements and denying leave to amend their complaint.affirmed.
the following factual recitation is based on the complaint at issue and public filings,all of which may be considered in deciding a rule b motion,as discussed infra.
amresco was publicly traded.as a debtor in bankruptcy when this action was initiated,it was subject to the automatic stay provisions.
defendants keith blackwell,jonathan pettee,randolph brown,and ron kirkland individual defendants are former officers and directors of amresco.brown was chairman of the board and ceo from november until amresco bankruptcy filing blackwell,its general counsel and president pettee,its chief financial officer and kirkland,its senior vice president and chief accounting officer.defendant deloitte touche llp was amresco auditor.
prior to its july bankruptcy filing,amresco was a small and lending company with three main segments commercial finance,asset management,and home equity lending.its operations centered around its commercial finance line of business.commercial finance revenues were primarily earned from interest and fees on loans to small and business owners accrued earnings on retained interests in securitizations servicing fees on its loan portfolios and gains on the securitization on sale of loans.
one of amresco significant divisions was a lender to restaurants including national chains and other small to businesses.amresco funded these loans through a warehouse financing facility revolving credit line before bundling them for sale to a third party.these bundled loans were into a trust and then bonds backed by underlying trust loans issued.amresco retained an interest in the securitized loans.borrowers signed a note for an amount to greater than the amount loaned and paid interest on that greater amount credit enhancement.the credit enhancement also served as collateral for the loan but,of course,if net losses in the securitization pool exceeded,amresco cash flow would decrease.the premium was returned to borrowers if there were no deficiencies within the pool otherwise,they forfeited those payments.if the loans became more than to days delinquent depending on the loan,payments to investors were accelerated amresco cash flow would decrease and it would have to some of its subordinated interests.
because the anticipated payments on the retained interests extended into the future,amresco had to estimate,and report on its financial statements,the present fair value of those payment streams.the form for the year,signed on march and filed on april,noted that different assumptions might materially affect the estimates.
two key assumptions in that were the projected credit loss and the discount.amresco believed net losses would not exceed the credit enhancement range,so that borrowers would absorb the entire loss.therefore,it estimated a net credit loss of zero percent.amresco stated that a credit loss increase would reduce the value of amresco retained interest by million.
amresco,accompanied by deloitte audit,reported assets of million and shareholders equity of million.it also showed amresco suffered losses of million in,million in,and million in.the stated amresco no longer had access to its prior warehouse financing.therefore,amresco needed to find a new lender but,the stated a new lender was not guaranteed and that,until one was found,amresco ability to make new loans was substantially impaired.
this action concerns shares of amresco purchased from march to july by a claimed class.again,the primarily at issue was signed on march and filed on april.plaintiffs claim fraud relating to amresco financial statements statements its officers made to certain shareholders and other omissions.the allegations primarily involve the following events in april,amresco agreed to a material executive compensation plan for its officers,including the individual defendants,that should have been,but was not,disclosed immediately to the public on march,amresco retained greenhill to explore restructuring options,including,but not limited to,bankruptcy on april,amresco filed its,signed by brown,pettee,and kirkland plaintiffs allege numerous material misstatements and omissions related to this filing,including amresco not disclosing the potential for default,and eventually the default,of a million loan to duke long and on may,brown,pettee,and blackwell met with shareholders in oklahoma,allegedly telling them amresco would obtain new warehouse financing.these alleged statements were the subject of another action,discussed infra,prescott group aggressive small cap,blackwell,et,m.unpublished.
plaintiffs complaint was filed in.approximately six months later,by joint motion,plaintiffs declared their intention to file an amended complaint and defendants agreed to delay moving to dismiss until that complaint was filed.the motion was granted.
the first amended complaint was filed in early.after defendants moved to dismiss,plaintiffs filed an opposed motion for leave to amend to file the second amended complaint at issue.in july,in granting leave to amend,the district court cautioned additional amendment would not be granted absent extraordinary circumstances.fin.acquisition partners,blackwell,wl.july unpublished.
accordingly,that month,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint sac defendants moved to dismiss,including deloitte moving to strike plaintiffs expert affidavit attached to the sac.responding in opposition to the motions to dismiss,plaintiffs,inter alia,urged application of collateral estoppel,from the oklahoma prescott litigation,to certain matters in dispute.in a detailed and comprehensive opinion that exceeded the sac by only a few pages,the district court granted,in part,deloitte motion to strike granted the motions to dismiss and denied leave to amend the sac to file a fourth complaint.
plaintiffs contest the district court implicitly denying application of collateral estoppel striking part of their expert affidavit holding the sac failed to satisfy the pslra pleading requirements and denying leave to amend the sac.
in the prescott litigation,plaintiffs alleged blackwell,brown,kirkland,and pettee made misstatements in may of the that april in connection with their incentive compensation arrangements,amresco ability to obtain a warehouse line of credit,and the impairment of the duke long loan.that action was settled,but only after denial of the individual defendants motion to dismiss regarding the compensation and duke long claims.plaintiffs maintain such denial in prescott provides collateral estoppel for those claims in this action.
the sac was filed in july the prescott dismissal order,that august.plaintiffs first urged application of collateral estoppel in opposition to the motions to dismiss.in dismissing the action at hand,the district court by implication rejected such application.no authority need be cited for the rule that a reviewing court will consider an issue properly presented to a district court,even though not addressed by it.
some opinions by our court hold review of a decision is de novo,see,united states brackett,cir,cert.denied,d others,for abuse of discretion,see,aguillard mcgowen,cir,cert.denied,d.because plaintiffs contention fails under either standard,we need not decide which to apply.
a judgment is preclusive in federal court if the prior federal decision resulted in a judgment on the merits the same fact issue was litigated in that court and the issue disposition was necessary to the prior action outcome.am.home assur.chevron,usa,cir.in addition,there must not be any special circumstances making application of collateral estoppel unfair.winters diamond shamrock chem,cir,cert.denied,d.settlement agreements,like consent judgments,are not given preclusive effect unless the parties manifest their intent to give them such effect.hughes santa fe int l,cir.finally,collateral estoppel does not apply unless the facts and legal standards used to assess those facts are the same in both proceedings.copeland merrill lynch,cir.
concerning such legal standards,the prescott court in part based its denial on the tenth circuit permitting group pleading in pslra cases.group pleading 
in its broadest form allows unattributed corporate statements to be charged to one or more individual defendants based solely on their corporate titles.under this doctrine,the plaintiff need not allege any facts demonstrating an individual defendant participation in the particular communication containing the misstatement or omission where the defendants are insiders or affiliates of the company.
southland sec.inspire ins,cir.unlike the tenth circuit,our circuit does not permit such pleading.id.at.
in their reply brief,plaintiffs concede the prescott plaintiffs used group pleading,which,again,is not permitted for pslra actions in our circuit.in addition,denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final judgment on the merits because the action continues after the denial.falcon transportes aeros de coahuila,cir.in sum,the prescott denial can not be given preclusive effect in this action.
plaintiffs next challenge the district court granting,in part,deloitte motion to strike the expert affidavit attached to the sac.they claim the affidavit should be considered part of the sac,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure exhibit attached to the pleading considered part of it.in any event,they claim the district court erred by not considering the entire affidavit.
plaintiffs contend this ruling should be reviewed de novo.instead,we review for abuse of discretion.see pedraza jones,cir discussing whether to strike an expert affidavit and stating decisions to do so are reviewed for abuse of discretion.

plaintiffs rely on barrie,modified and reh g denied,cir,for the proposition that pslra plaintiffs can rely on expert affidavits to defeat motions to dismiss.barrie held dismissal of a pslra action improper where the facts were in dispute.in doing so,it noted the complaint was supported by sworn expert analysis.id.at.barrie does not hold,however,that,in actions,district courts must consider experts affidavits attached to complaints.apparently,the appropriateness vel non of considering such an affidavit was not raised in barrie.in any event,the question was not decided by our court,webster fall.ruling that questions neither brought to the court attention nor ruled on are not precedent thomas.dep t of crim.justice,cir stating an opinion is not binding precedent for questions not squarely before the court.
in its rule b dismissal,the district court held the affidavit was not a written instrument under rule and it was not appropriate to consider the opinions in the affidavit.in striking those parts of the affidavit,the district court cited,and quoted from,demarco depotech,d.as demarco noted,allowing plaintiffs to rely on an expert opinion in order to state securities claims requires a court to confront a myriad of complex evidentiary issues not generally capable of resolution at the pleading stage.id.in addition,considering such opinions might require ruling on the expert qualifications.id.this would be inappropriate at the pleading stage.
pslra complaints must allege specific facts demonstrating material misstatements or omissions made with scienter.even if portions of an expert affidavit constitute an instrument pursuant to rule,opinions can not substitute for facts under the pslra.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider the in the affidavit.
plaintiffs claim the district court erred by holding they failed to satisfy the falsity and scienter requirements of the pslra and federal rule of civil procedure b requiring pleading fraud claims with particularity.we review de novo a complaint being dismissed under rule b for failure to state a claim,lowrey.a m,cir.

in ruling on rule b motions,district courts generally may rely only on the complaint and its proper attachments,travis irby,cir.they are permitted,however,to rely on matters of public record.davis bayless,cir.moreover,in securities actions,the court may,as did the district court here,rely on public disclosure documents required by law to be,and that have been,filed with the sec,and documents that the plaintiffs either possessed or knew about and upon which they relied in bringing the suit,without,pursuant to rule b,converting the motion into one for summary judgment,rothman gregor,cir internal citations omitted.
plaintiffs claim violations of b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,as amended by the pslra,b.section b makes it illegal for a person to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the sec rules.rule makes it unlawful for anyone to make a false statement of material fact or to omit a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading.to state a claim under b and rule,a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities a misstatement or an omission of material fact made with scienter on which plaintiff relied that proximately injured him,abc arbitrage tchuruk,cir internal quotation omitted.
the pslra was enacted in response to an increase in securities fraud lawsuits perceived as frivolous.newby enron,cir.it requires the complaint to specify each allegedly misleading statement and the reason why it is misleading if an allegation is made on information and belief,the complaint must also state with particularity all facts on which the belief is formed.b.its pleading requirements incorporate rule b standard.abc arbitrage,at.that rule requires a plaintiff to specify the alleged fraudulent statements,the speaker,when and where the statements were made,and why they are fraudulent.see also.b.a district court must dismiss a claim failing to satisfy either the pslra pleading requirements or those of rule b.abc arbitrage,at.
as discussed,to survive a motion to dismiss a action,plaintiffs must,inter alia,plead specific facts establishing a strong inference of scienter.nathenson zonagen,cir.restated,pursuant to the pslra,failure to adequately plead scienter requires dismissal of the complaint.b a.scienter can be established by demonstrating the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.for pslra purposes,plaintiffs may establish scienter by demonstrating either intent or severe recklessness.see nathenson,at defining severe recklessness as highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations demonstrating an extreme departure from standards of ordinary care.circumstantial evidence can support a scienter inference.id.
plaintiffs fail to satisfy the pslra pleading requirements.accordingly,their complaint was properly dismissed.
