timothy swanson was convicted of one count of bank fraud under,which makes it a crime to knowingly execute,or attempt to execute,a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution.the underlying indictment charged that swanson defrauded nationsbank,of wichita and two other financial institutions by means of a check kite scheme.swanson engaged in an elaborate scheme of circulating checks backed by insufficient funds among eleven bank accounts.when nationsbank detected the scheme,it stopped swanson check writing ability and allowed all outstanding checks to be presented against his accounts.the resulting overdraft was approximately.following a jury verdict of guilty,swanson was sentenced to a prison term of months.swanson now appeals both his conviction and sentence for the reasons below,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
since,swanson has managed oil and gas businesses in kansas and oklahoma under his own name and under the umbrella of other entities.during this period,swanson maintained at least eleven personal and business checking accounts at nationsbank in wichita,kansas.swanson had signatory powers on all of these accounts.swanson and his companies also borrowed substantial sums of money from nationsbank.these loans were secured by personal guarantees and collateral,which included mortgages of oil and gas properties.
as a customer of nationsbank,swanson frequently wrote checks that caused his accounts to be overdrawn,sometimes in amounts as high as.these overdrafts were routinely paid by nationsbank.in february,nationsbank gave swanson,in his capacity as owner and manager of swanson oil,the use of a controlled disbursement account cda,an account reserved for use by businesses.a cda is a checking account that provides the account holders with a daily report on which checks will be clearing the account and on what collected balances they have in the account,allowing businesses to determine their daily cash position.the cda was coded pay all,meaning that the bank would pay all the checks presented against the account.this account also had a feature providing for an automatic transfer of funds from the cda,which was maintained at a remote site,into a regular business account.the remote location had the effect of lengthening the float time before posting for the checks written on the account.
in march,swanson started day trading in the stock market,using his established brokerage accounts at prudential securities in wichita to buy and sell blocks of securities on a daily basis,in an attempt to make money on changes in market prices.swanson daily purchases and sales of securities frequently exceeded a day.swanson brokerage accounts at prudential also had check writing privileges through banks in columbus,ohio and boston.these banks required stock values or deposits sufficient to cover all of the checks swanson wrote on these accounts.this requirement resulted in a daily margin call in which swanson was required to deposit funds with prudential which were adequate to cover the value of the stocks he had purchased on the margin,with money borrowed from the brokerage firm.prudential did not accept payments for the daily margin calls based on uncollected funds.therefore,when swanson delivered checks to prudential,which he did on a daily basis,the prudential staff called nationsbank to confirm that swanson had collected funds in his accounts sufficient to cover his checks.eventually,for administrative convenience,prudential required swanson to provide cashier checks,a cash equivalent,to cover his margin calls.
in spring and summer of,swanson losses in the stock market grew,and margin calls became more difficult to meet.thus,swanson began to use the float time provided by the cda as a means of gaining time in meeting financial demands,writing and numerous checks among eleven of his nationsbank accounts.in addition,swanson purchased cashier checks from nationsbank nearly every day.each time swanson requested a cashier check,the bank teller would determine whether the account on which the check would be drawn contained sufficient collected funds.the bank teller testified that normally they did not.thus,the teller was required to seek the approval of a bank officer before she issued the cashier check to swanson.the bank officers routinely approved such cashier checks.
on july,a computer operation of nationsbank in florida informed the wichita branch that they believed that swanson was running a check kite due to his pattern of writing checks.that same day,tom mcgrath,one of the nationsbank wichita officers,caused all of swanson accounts to be changed from pay all to an immediate charge,creating an overdraft of.mcgrath notified swanson of this overdraft,and they discussed converting the overdraft into a promissory note to be collateralized by the existing oil and gas mortgages and the stock accounts.within two weeks of its discovery,swanson paid the entire overdraft.
procedural background 
on march,swanson was indicted on one count of violating and,and he proceeded to a jury trial.at trial the government showed that between march,and june,swanson wrote and made more than checks and transfers drawn on one of the eleven accounts and subsequently deposited into another of the eleven accounts,causing the numerical balances in the accounts to be artificially inflated.the government also showed that swanson obtained approximately cashier checks from nationsbank,valued at,which he deposited into one of the eleven checking accounts at nationsbank.the government demonstrated that at the time all of the checks were written and deposited,the checking accounts had insufficient legitimate funds to properly cover the checks when they were deposited and later presented to the drawee banks.thus,from march,to june,swanson deposited into the eleven checking accounts,of which amount resulted from the deposits of kited checks and transfers and cashier checks.
the jury convicted swanson of one count of bank fraud under,which,under the sentencing guidelines,warrants a base offense level of.ussg.the testimony of the government expert,fbi special agent randall wolverton,as well as the report,established that the amount of loss to the bank was,which increased swanson base offense level by levels to.ussg b h.the court also found that because swanson crime affected a financial institution and he derived more than in gross receipts from the offense,his offense level should be increased to.ussg b a.swanson was sentenced to a prison term of months.
on appeal,swanson argues that a risk of loss is an element of a violation of b the district court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to establish the elements of a violation of and c the district court erred in its instructions to the jury regarding proof of risk of loss.in addition,swanson argues that d his sentence should be reversed and remanded because the district court sentenced him in a manner which contravened the ex post facto clause of the constitution and which was based on improper and inadequate findings and e the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss by failing to make proper and adequate findings as to the amount of loss at the time of sentencing and also by failing to grant credit for immediately available collateral.we address each of swanson arguments below,and affirm his conviction and sentence.
ii.swanson challenges to his conviction 
elements of 
the federal bank fraud statute,reads,
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution or to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
swanson was convicted for a violation of,not of,but we include subsection to underscore a distinction that is relevant to our discussion below of the evidence required to prove a scheme to defraud.see section.
in order to establish a violation of,the government must show that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution that the defendant did so with the intent to defraud the financial institution and that the financial institution was federally insured.united states hill,cir.
swanson argues that in addition to these elements,the government must prove a fourth element,that the defendant victimize d the bank by exposing it to an actual loss or risk of loss.aplt br.at.in contrast,the government has asked us specifically to hold that inquiry about risk of loss is merely one way of establishing intent to defraud in bank fraud cases,citing united states hoglund,cir.aple br.at.
an examination of our case law reveals that the risk,potential risk,or risk of loss aspect is subsumed within the first element of bank fraud under,that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution.hill,at.see united states young,cir holding that the government proof that the bank was put at potential risk by the scheme to defraud was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant knowingly executed a scheme to defraud a bank united states sapp,cir reaffirming young united states akers,cir emphasizing that young did not hold that potential risk of loss to the bank was a separate element that had to be alleged in the indictment.we conclude below that the government proved that swanson conduct put the bank at a risk of loss equal to the sum of his bank accounts overdrafts each day and that the jury instructions were adequate to instruct on the risk of loss issue.
b.the denial of swanson motion for judgment of acquittal 
at the close of the government case,swanson moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the conduct the government proved at trial does not violate.the court denied this motion,and swanson,inexplicably,failed to renew it at the conclusion of the case.on appeal swanson asserts that the court erred in failing to grant the motion because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict.
standard of review 
ordinarily,a defendant who moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government case must move again for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the entire case or the issue will be waived.united states bowie,cir.however,if no motion for acquittal is made at the close of all evidence,we nevertheless review for plain error under.b and the standard actually applied is essentially the same as if there had been a timely motion for acquittal.id.thus,we review this denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states austin,cir.r eversal is only appropriate if no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this standard requires this court to review the trial record to determine if there is evidence to support the verdict.id.
existence of a scheme to defraud 
swanson contends that the government did not establish the existence of a scheme to defraud because the evidence failed to prove that a nationsbank issued the cashier checks by relying on the falsely inflated balances,aplt br.at,and b the defendant did something more than write checks on accounts with insufficient funds.aplt br.at.we disagree with swanson assessment of what is required to prove a case brought under and his assessment of the evidence.
falsely inflated balances 
as to swanson contention that the government failed to establish that nationsbank issued the cashier checks in reliance on the falsely inflated balances,swanson appears to have confused the elements of with those of.we have held that a lthough largely overlapping,a scheme to defraud,and a scheme to obtain money by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,are separate offenses.united states cronic,cir.indeed,
the plain language of sets forth two distinct crimes concerning federally insured financial institutions.each crime requires a defendant first to knowingly execute a scheme or artifice.to convict a defendant of a crime under subsection,the government would have to prove the scheme defrauded the financial institution.to convict a defendant under subsection,the government would have to prove the scheme enabled the defendant to obtain certain property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises.
united states bonnett,cir quoting and adding emphasis to.had swanson been charged under subsection,his argument that the government was required to prove that nationsbank relied on falsely inflated balances when issuing the cashier checks may have carried more weight.however,swanson was charged under subsection,which only requires the government to prove that the defendant scheme defrauded a financial institution.see also cronic,at the offense of a scheme to defraud focuses on the intended end result,not on whether a false representation was necessary to effect the result.schemes to defraud,therefore,may come within the scope of even absent an affirmative misrepresentation.
evidence swanson did something more than write checks on accounts with insufficient funds 
swanson next argues that nationsbank made a conscious business decision when it allowed him to maintain overdrafts in his accounts and that the government did not establish a sufficient pattern of conduct designed to deceive.however,our cases liberally construe the bank fraud statute,young,at,and we have clearly held that check kiting,or a series of worthless checks,constitutes a scheme to defraud under.united states ratchford,cir affirming conviction under for cronic,at stating that constitutes a scheme to defraud under bonnett,at,adopting the same.in ratchford,we held that the government proved a violation of when 
t he government evidence at trial showed that on the dates the checks charged in the indictment were written,there were insufficient funds in the respective accounts to cover the checks and that the covering deposits for these checks were in the form of checks written on either the account to which the original indicted check was deposited or an account of one of defendant other companies involved in the float scheme.
at.accordingly,f or purposes of,the relevant inquiry is whether defendant knowingly had insufficient funds in the accounts being utilized on the date the checks were written.id.
we emphasize that this is not a case of an isolated overdraft or a few occurrences of minor overdrafts.instead,there were scores of transactions.thus,in this case,the jury could rationally find that the evidence established that swanson strategically used the cda to circulate the insufficient funds checks among his eleven accounts on a daily basis,in order to take advantage of the float time inherent in the banking system so that his account balances were artificially inflated.accordingly,we hold that there was ample evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that swanson did something more than write checks on accounts with insufficient funds.
risk of loss 
finally,swanson contends that the government did not establish that nationsbank was ever at a risk of loss because the bank was always fully secured by the collateral on swanson loans.however,this contention improperly analogizes the assessment of loss in cases to the assessment of loss in fraudulently obtained loan cases.we concede that both types of cases involve violations of the bank fraud statute.moreover,we have held that in fraudulently obtained loan cases,t he security of a loan is a valid consideration in evaluating a defendant realistic intent and the probability of inflicting the loss.united states williams,cir quoting united states nichols,cir.here,however,swanson activity was independent from and unrelated to the loans he obtained from nationsbank.we agree with the government that swanson argument is tantamount to a suggestion that if an account holder has sufficient collateral at a bank,he can commit fraud against the bank so long as his activity does not exceed the value of his collateral.aple br.at.see united states flowers,cir check kiting is more akin to theft than to fraudulently obtaining a loan.the offender in a fraudulently induced loan transaction at least asked the bank to provide the funds and gave some kind of security in return.united states frydenlund,cir c heck kiting is not more equivalent to a fraudulent loan transaction than to simple theft the bank voluntarily places a limit on its risk when it lends money,but it is at the mercy of the check kiter for the amount of loss he may cause.we hold that the government produced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that swanson conduct put the bank at a risk of loss equal to the sum of his bank accounts overdrafts each day,which on the day his check writing ability was stopped,amounted to.accordingly,we hold it was not error for the district court to deny swanson motion for judgment of acquittal.
jury instructions 
swanson requested that the district court instruct the jury specifically that the government must prove that the bank was exposed to a risk of loss by the defendant conduct as a separate and distinct element of bank fraud.the district court overruled this request,finding that the risk of loss issue was adequately covered in its other instructions.the district court subsequently offered to give an instruction setting out the risk of loss language requested by swanson.however,the district court stated that it would also instruct the jury,pursuant to the government request,that it was not necessary to find an actual loss or that the bank sustained a loss.swanson stated that he would prefer to leave the instructions the way they both parties specific requests being omitted from the instructions.on appeal,swanson reiterates his objection to the jury instructions,claiming that they were legally deficient in that they failed to require proof that the bank was actually victimized by incurring a loss or risk of loss attributable to the defendant conduct.aplt br.at.
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion and consider the instructions as a whole de novo to determine whether they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.united states mcphilomy,cir.
the district court instructed the jury as follows 
instruction 
the indictment in this case charges that this scheme and artifice resulted in an actual loss to nationsbank sic of approximately and a daily risk of loss based on the amount of the overdrafts outstanding for each day.
aple.vol.i at.
instruction 
before the defendant may be found guilty of the offense charged in count of the indictment,the government must prove the following essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
first that the defendant timothy swanson knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution as alleged in count 
second that the defendant did so with intent to defraud and 
third that the financial institution was then insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.
as used here,a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution and an intent to defraud means any deliberate plan of action or course of conduct by which someone intends to deceive or cheat that financial institution and to obtain something of value,such as money,from the financial institution.
it is not necessary that the government prove each and every one of the details in the indictment concerning the precise nature of the alleged scheme,or that the alleged scheme actually succeeded in defrauding someone.the government must show,however,that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme that was substantially similar to the scheme alleged in the indictment.
id.at emphasis added.swanson requested instruction would have added the phrase with intent to victimize the bank by exposing it to an actual or potential loss following the phrase such as money in the fifth paragraph of instruction.aplt app.vol.iii,at.
we have already determined that the risk of loss aspect is subsumed within the first element of bank fraud under,and we agree with the district court that its instruction adequately encompassed the issue.instruction requires the jury to find that the government proved a scheme substantially similar to the one alleged in the indictment,and instruction makes it clear that the indictment charges an actual loss and a risk of loss.see aple.vol.i,at indictment.moreover,requiring the jury to find that swanson deceive d or cheate d the financial institution to obtain something of value,such as money,from the financial institution,see id.at instr,necessarily implies a finding of risk of loss.indeed,the very point in criminalizing check kiting is that each deposit of a false check places the bank at a risk of loss,causing a significant portion of the testimony in such a case to focus on exactly how such a scheme creates the risk.see united states hickman,cir reiterating the holding in united states hord,cir,that each deposit of a false check puts the bank at risk of loss.
because the instructions that the district court gave the jury were sufficient to advise it on the risk of loss issue,it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to refuse swanson requested language.moreover,we hold that the jury instructions as a whole accurately informed the jury of the governing law.
iii.swanson challenges to his sentence 
swanson maintains that the sentencing court erred by applying the sentencing guidelines to him,in contravention of the ex post facto clause of the constitution by basing the finding that swanson received more than in gross receipts on improper and inadequate findings by failing to make proper and adequate findings as to the amount of loss and by failing to grant credit for immediately available collateral in the loss calculation.we address each of swanson contentions and find no error in his sentencing.
standard of review 
we review de novo questions of law regarding application of the sentencing guidelines,and review for clear error the district court factual findings.united states spencer,cir.we will not disturb the court factual findings unless they are without support in the record,or unless after reviewing all the evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.united states burridge,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also e.
application of the sentencing guidelines 
swanson contends that the district court erred when it applied the sentencing guidelines to him because the amendment to the applicable guideline disadvantaged him by increasing the punishment for his crime above the punishment imposed by the version,which was in effect at the time of his offense.thus,swanson argues that the application of the guidelines violates the ex post facto clause of the constitution.in response to swanson objection to the use of the guidelines,the district court determined that the amendment did not work a substantive change to the guideline.aplt app.vol.iii,at.accordingly,at swanson sentencing on january,the district court applied the guidelines,which were in effect at that time.
the sentencing court generally must apply the sentencing guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing rather than those in effect at the time of the offense.united states orr,cir ussg a.the ex post facto clause,however,prohibits retroactive application of an amended guideline provision if the amendment disadvantages the defendant by inflicting a greater punishment for an offense than the law allowed when the offense was committed.orr,at internal quotation marks omitted.if the court determines that use of the guidelines manual in effect on the date of sentencing would violate the ex post facto clause,the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.ussg b.
the sentencing guidelines manual directs the sentencing court to increase the offense level by four levels i f the offense affected a financial institution and the defendant derived more than in gross receipts from the offense.ussg b b em
