appellants orlando,resorts associates,and kissimmee lodge,appeal from the district court order reversing the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment against the florida department of revenue fdor.the district court concluded as a matter of law that c,which exempts from stamp or similar taxes the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a confirmed chapter plan,does not extend to transactions involving property.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to d and.we reverse because we conclude that the transfer at issue in this case was necessary to the consummation of a confirmed chapter plan.
appellants orlando,and resorts associates,collectively,the debtors own three hotels in the orlando,florida area.in february of,the debtors,facing foreclosure of the mortgage encumbering the three hotels,filed for chapter bankruptcy.although the mortgage debt on the three hotels exceeded million,the mortgage lender,recp orlando,agreed to accept million in satisfaction of the outstanding mortgage balance.recp conditioned its offer on receipt of million by august.
berkshire mortgage finance corporation was the only lender willing to advance the debtors million before august.berkshire,however,conditioned its offer to lend the debtors million on the agreement of kissimmee lodge,a that owned a hotel adjacent to one of the debtor hotels,to refinance its hotel through berkshire as part of the same transaction.kissimmee agreed to participate in this transaction solely as an accommodation to the debtors.kissimmee hotel was not subject to the rcap mortgage,and it was under no obligation to refinance its hotel at the time.
effective july,berkshire issued four commitment letters,under which it agreed to make the following loans million to orlando secured by a mortgage on its hotel million to resorts secured by a mortgage on one of its two hotels million to resorts secured by a mortgage on the other of its hotels and million to kissimmee secured by a mortgage on its hotel.pursuant to this agreement,the debtors filed a chapter joint plan of reorganization the orlando plan which provides,in pertinent part 
berkshire willingness to make the loan to the debtors is contingent upon kissimmee lodge agreement to refinance its hotel through berkshire berkshire will not provide any financing to the debtors unless kissimmee lodge refinances through berkshire.the kissimmee lodge refinancing therefore is incident to an a condition precedent to the reorganization of the debtors and that refinancing therefore is exempt from florida documentary stamp taxes,intangible and similar taxes pursuant to c.
the fdor filed a timely objection to the confirmation of the plan.the fdor argued that the plan failed to comply with a because the c exemption the proposed plan conferred on the kissimmee transaction was not available as a matter of law to entities.at the august,confirmation hearing,the bankruptcy court sustained the fdor objection without prejudice and confirmed the plan.with respect to the kissimmee transaction,the confirmation order provided 
the plan is hereby confirmed,and all objections thereto are overruled,except that the objection raise by the fdor is sustained without prejudice,and the plan is hereby amended such that the mortgage refinancing transaction between kissimmee lodge and berkshire shall not,until further order of this court be deemed exempt from florida documentary stamp taxes under c.
kissimmee paid in florida documentary stamp taxes and intangible taxes under protest.
the debtors and kissimmee then filed suit in the circuit court for osceola county,florida seeking declaratory relief and a refund of the in stamp and intangible taxes that kissimmee had paid.in response,the fdor removed the case to federal bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy court found that kissimmee agreement to refinance was done pursuant to the orlando plan,was essential to the confirmation of the plan,and was necessary to consummate and implement the plan.accordingly,the bankruptcy court concluded that kissimmee refinancing of its mortgage was under a plan within the meaning of c and that kissimmee was entitled to a judgment of against the fdor.the district court reversed,holding that c was inapplicable because the transaction involved two.
the district court interpretation of c is a question of law this court reviews de novo.see in re morgan,cir.section c provides 
the issuance,transfer,or exchange of a security,or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section of this title,may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.
c.to qualify for an exemption under this provision,three conditions must be satisfied there must be a stamp tax or similar tax,imposed upon the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer,under a confirmed chapter plan.see in re amsterdam dev.ass n.there is no dispute that the first two conditions are met in this case.the controversy centers on whether the mortgage berkshire secured on kissimmee hotel was a transfer under the orlando plan where neither estate property nor the debtor was involved in the transaction.
we begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair,d.if the language of the statute is plain,our sole obligation is to enforce the statute according to its terms.id.quoting caminetti united states.by its terms,c exempts from stamp taxes or similar taxes any instrument of transfer under a confirmed chapter plan.the third circuit has held that the phrase under a plan confirmed in c was most likely intended to mean authorized by a plan confirmed.in re hechinger inv.of,cir.similarly,the fourth circuit concluded that the term under may be construed as w ith the authorization of a chapter plan.see in re nvr lp,cir quoting webster ii new riverside university dictionary.the second circuit has recognized that a chapter plan impliedly authorizes any transfer that its necessary to the consummation of the plan.see city of new york,cir w here,as here,a transfer,and hence an instrument of transfer,is necessary to the consummation of a plan,the plan seems implicitly to have dealt with the transfer instrument.emphasis added.we agree with our sister circuits interpretation of c.a transfer under a plan refers to a transfer authorized by a confirmed chapter plan.in turn,a plan authorizes any transfer that is necessary to the consummation of the plan.
since the orlando plan expressly authorized the kissimmee transaction,which the bankruptcy court found was necessary to consummation of the orlando plan,the mortgage kissimmee extended to berkshire is exempt from florida stamp tax under the plain language of c.while the fdor argues that no reported decision extends a c exemption to a transaction involving property nothing in the plain language of c restricts its application to transactions involving the debtor or estate property.we therefore conclude that the phrase under a plan refers to a transfer that is necessary to the consummation of a confirmed chapter plan irrespective of whether the transfer involved the debtor or property of the estate.
the fdor objects that construing c to encompass transactions involving property would extend the bankruptcy court jurisdiction beyond its statutory limits.in support of this argument,the fdor cites this court decision in united states huckabee auto,cir.in huckabee,this court held that a bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the irs from assessing a penalty under against corporate officers of the debtor.see at.notwithstanding the bankruptcy court finding that the assessment would adversely affect the corporate debtor reorganization efforts,this court concluded 
the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts encompasses determinations of the tax liabilities of debtors who file petitions for relief under the bankruptcy laws.it does not,however,extend to the separate liabilities of taxpayers,who are not debtors under the bankruptcy code.it is therefore irrelevant that the penalty,if assessed,will adversely affect the corporate debtor reorganization.
id.the fdor argues that conferring an exemption on the kissimmee transaction would contraven
