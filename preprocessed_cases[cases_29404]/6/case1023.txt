express check services,doing business as payday now payday,and quick pawn shop franchising,frank evans,charlotte evans,and jeffrey evans collectively referred to as the other defendants,appeal the district court denial of their motion to compel arbitration of the claims against them by luna clifton colburn.we vacate and remand for a trial on how many of colburn claims are subject to arbitration.
background 
this lawsuit was filed as a class action against payday and the other defendants for alleged violations of state and federal law arising out of check advances or deferred payment transactions between the plaintiffs and defendants.in such transactions,a customer writes a check to the vendor in exchange for an immediate cash payment in an amount less than the face value of the check.at.the vendor agrees to hold the check for a specified period of time,generally five to fourteen days.upon the expiration of the agreed time,the customer may redeem the check by paying back the full face value,or the vendor will present the check for payment.id.the plaintiffs allege that deferred payment transactions actually are loans governed by the alabama small loan act,et,and that payday and the other defendants violated this statute by making loans to the plaintiffs without the requisite license and at usurious rates of interest.the plaintiffs also allege that the collection of this usurious interest constituted the collection of an unlawful debt in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et 
colburn was added as a named plaintiff by way of an amended complaint.the amended complaint alleges that colburn engaged in three deferred payment transactions with payday on january,on february,and on february.at.the record also indicates that colburn engaged in two other deferred payment transactions with payday on may,ex.b and on june,evans aff.at some point,colburn signed an arbitration agreement,which reads as follows 
i understand that if i have any dispute s with express check services,including any of its past,present,and future officers,directors,agents,employees,representatives,parents,subsidiaries,affiliates,predecessors,successors,heirs assigns hereinafter referred to collectively as express check services,arising out of or in connection with the check advance or any other aspect of my transaction with express check services,as defined above,including,but not limited to,the check advance transaction,the terms of the check advance,representations concerning any aspect of the check advance transaction,the money advanced,the check advance charges assessed,the payments made,or the recovery of any funds due express check services,as defined above,i hereby agree that any such dispute s shall be resolved only through binding arbitration.the arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the american arbitration association aaa that are in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced.the arbitrator may,in his or her discretion,allow discovery as per the alabama rules of civil procedure.although the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the rules of the aaa,the arbitration shall not be conducted through the aaa unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.i further understand that arbitration shall be the exclusive method of resolving any and all disputes,and i am waiving my right to have such disputes resolved through a trial by jury.
ex.although the arbitration agreement is signed,it is not dated.there is no evidence in the record as to whether colburn signed any other arbitration agreements,nor is there evidence that any of the other named plaintiffs signed arbitration agreements.
invoking the arbitration agreement,payday and the other defendants moved to compel arbitration of colburn claims pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa,et.colburn opposed this motion,inter alia,on the following grounds the arbitration agreement could not be enforced because the deferred payment transaction in general was void as illegal under alabama law the arbitration agreement was void on its face because it is undated and the arbitration agreement is unconscionable.without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration simply by stamping denied on the motion,offering no reasons for the denial.
payday and the other defendants filed a notice of appeal from the denial of their motion to compel arbitration.after hearing oral argument,we remanded this case to the district court for the limited purpose of explaining its denial,retaining jurisdiction in this court over the appeal.bess check express,unpublished cir.on remand,the district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its denial of the defendants motion.after finding that the arbitration agreement fails to specify certain details about the method of arbitration,including the costs of such,the district court found that colburn is unable financially to pay more than to resolve his claim against payday and the other defendants.the district court also found that,should it appoint an arbitrator,the fee would be at least per hour and the arbitration would require at least four hours.based on these findings,the district court concluded that colburn could not afford to pay his share of the arbitration costs,and it expressly relied on this court decision in randolph green tree fin,cir,aff in part and rev in part,d,in refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement.
we ordered supplemental briefing on the issues presented by the district court order following remand.having reviewed the supplemental briefs,we proceed to consider the issues raised in this appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.we review de novo the district court denial of the motion to compel arbitration.see,perez globe airport sec,cir.
iii.discussion 
payday and the other defendants contend that the district court reliance on randolph green tree fin,cir,which was reversed in relevant part by the supreme court,see green tree fin.randolph,d,necessitates reversal of the district court decision.colburn,on the other hand,asserts that the district court holding in this case is distinguishable from randolph,and he additionally argues that we may affirm the district court on several alternative bases.we conclude that the district court articulated reason for denying the motion to compel arbitration can not be sustained in light of the supreme court decision in randolph.we also conclude that colburn alternative arguments concerning the illegality of the deferred payment transactions and the unconscionability of the arbitration agreement do not provide adequate grounds for affirming the district court.colburn argument that the arbitration agreement can not be enforced because it is undated,however,raises unresolved questions of fact that necessitate a remand to the district court.
a.the district court articulated reason 
as explained above,the district court expressly declined to enforce the arbitration agreement on the authority of this court decision in randolph.in that case,a panel of this court determined that an arbitration provision in a retail installment contract was unenforceable because it potentially gave rise to high costs to the party pursuing arbitration.see randolph,at.specifically,the arbitration clause said nothing about the payment of filing fees,the apportionment of the costs of arbitration,the ability to waive such fees and costs due to financial hardship,or the set of rules that would govern the arbitration.id.the lack of specificity as to these matters meant that neither the court nor the parties possessed adequate information about how claimants would fare under the arbitration clause.id.for this reason,the court determined that the clause potentially could lead to prohibitive costs and therefore failed to safeguard the plaintiff ability to vindicate her rights.accordingly,the court held that the clause was unenforceable.id.
the supreme court reversed this holding because the record failed to show that the plaintiff in fact was likely to bear prohibitive costs if the dispute went to arbitration.see randolph.at.although the plaintiff asserted that the american arbitration association aaa would conduct the arbitration,and therefore assumed that its filing fees and arbitrator fees would apply,the court pointed out that no factual showing was made to support these assertions.instead,the plaintiff relied entirely on unfounded assumptions,which provide d no basis on which to ascertain the actual costs and fees to which she would be subject in arbitration.id.at.the only fact established by the record was that the arbitration clause was silent on the subject of fees and costs,and that fact alone was plainly insufficient to render the clause unenforceable.id.at.as the party seeking to invalidate the arbitration clause on the basis of prohibitive costs,the plaintiff bore the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.id.because she failed to meet that burden,the court rejected this court conclusion that the clause was unenforceable.
similarly,we must reject the district court rationale for refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement in this case.although colburn attempts to distinguish the district court holding from the rejected holding in randolph,we find no meaningful distinction.the district court specifically found that the arbitration agreement does not specify the manner in which arbitration is to be commenced or the manner in which an arbitrator is to be chosen by the parties.additionally,the district court found that,like in randolph,the arbitration agreement is silent on the issue of arbitration costs.the district court then found,without any citation to the record,that the arbitrator fee would be at least per hour if the court were to appoint an arbitrator,and that the arbitration of colburn claims against payday would require at least four hours.finally,without any findings about how these fees and costs would be allocated or what amount colburn might actually be expected to pay,the district court concluded that colburn could not afford the costs of arbitration.we have reviewed the record and can find no support for the district court findings concerning the costs that colburn likely would bear in arbitration or his ability to pay those costs.because the record does not show that colburn likely will incur prohibitive costs,this case is indistinguishable from randolph.
we acknowledge that,unlike the arbitration clause in randolph,the arbitration agreement in this case provides that arbitration will be conducted under the rules of the aaa.colburn contends that the district court made findings of fact as to colburn costs under those rules,and therefore,this case is different from randolph.we disagree for two reasons.first,although the district court discussed the fees and costs set forth under various rules of the aaa,it specifically found that there is no uniform set of aaa rules and that the arbitration clause failed to specify which set of rules were applicable.the district court could not have made any findings about colburn costs without finding which set of rules,and concomitantly,which set of fees and costs,applied to the dispute.second,we note that the arbitration clause specifically states that the aaa will not conduct the arbitration unless the parties agree otherwise.therefore,the arbitration clause remains ambiguous as to whether it even contemplates the fees and costs charged by the aaa,a fact conceded by colburn.see appellee br.following remand,at because there is no indication of the organization which would perform the arbitration,customers are given no idea of what the costs of arbitration would be or whether the organization has a history of fairness to customers.for these reasons,any discussion of colburn potential costs under the aaa rules necessarily is based on speculation and can not provide an adequate basis for concluding that her costs likely would be prohibitively expensive.as was the case in randolph,the record reveals only that the arbitration agreement is silent on the subject,and that fact alone is insufficient to render the agreement unenforceable.see randolph.at.thus,the district court articulated reason for denying the motion to compel arbitration is in error.
b.the legality of the deferred payment transactions 
that brings us to colburn alternative argument that the deferred payment transactions are void ab initio because they violate the alabama small loan act colburn contends that the court,rather than the arbitrator,must decide the legality of these transactions,and the district court therefore was correct in not compelling arbitration until this issue is resolved.payday,by contrast,maintains that the validity of the transactions is an issue for the arbitrator,not the court,and it asserts that its motion to compel arbitration should therefore have been granted.thus,before considering the legality of the deferred payment transactions,we must decide whether this issue is one for the court or the arbitrator.
the starting point for our analysis is the faa.the faa makes valid any written agreement to arbitrate a dispute arising out of a transaction involving interstate commerce,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see.where a party to such an agreement fails or refuses to arbitrate,the other party may move the district court for an order compelling arbitration.see id.the district court must grant the motion if it is satisfied that the parties actually agreed to arbitrate the dispute.see id.if the making of the arbitration agreement is in issue,however,the court must first adjudicate whether the agreement is enforceable against the parties.see see also chastain,cir.
the resolution of our question,then,turns on whether colburn assertions of illegality with regard to the deferred payment transactions place the making of the arbitration agreement in issue.our answer is informed by the supreme court decision in prima paint flood conklin,d.the plaintiff in that case brought an action in federal court to rescind a contract on the grounds that the contract was fraudulently induced.invoking the contract arbitration clause,the defendant moved to stay the action pending arbitration,which the district court granted.the supreme court upheld the district court stay,concluding that a claim of fraudulent inducement of the contract generally was a matter to be resolved by the arbitrator,not the court.id.at.at.the court distinguished this claim from a claim that the arbitration clause itself was fraudulently induced,a claim that clearly would put the making of the arbitration agreement in issue.id.because the plaintiff alleged fraudulent inducement only as to the underlying contract generally,and not as to the arbitration clause specifically,the district court properly stayed the litigation.
because colburn allegations of illegality go to the deferred payment transactions generally,and not to the arbitration agreement specifically,it would appear that,under prima paint,an arbitrator should decide those questions.colburn,however,contends that this court decision in chastain,supported by several decisions from other circuits,mandates a different conclusion.in chastain,this court held that the district court,rather than the arbitrator,must decide the validity of two contracts containing arbitration clauses where it was undisputed that one of the parties to the litigation never signed the contracts.see chastain,at.the court distinguished the allegations of fraudulent inducement in prima paint by noting that,in the case before it,the allegation was that a contract never existed at all,an allegation that the holding in prima paint did not reach.id.at emphasis in original.the court also distinguished the unique facts of the case before it with what it described as normal circumstances,under which an arbitration provision within a contract admittedly signed by the contractual parties is sufficient to require the district court to send any controversies to arbitration.id.at.under such circumstances,the parties have at least presumptively agreed to arbitrate any disputes,including those disputes about the validity of the contract in general.id.e
