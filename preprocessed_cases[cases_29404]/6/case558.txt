this action involves the right of a national bank,under of the federal reserve act,to act as an insurance agent in towns with a population of or less.the plaintiffs,a national bank and several organizations whose memberships include national banks,filed suit against the ohio superintendent of insurance seeking a declaratory judgment that certain ohio licensing provisions as applied to national banks are preempted by and a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of these provisions against national banks to the extent that they are preempted.specifically at issue is the viability of ohio principal purpose test,as well as various statutory licensing requirements.faced with for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,providing them with the requested declaratory and injunctive relief.
subsequent to the filing of the action,a number of insurance trade organizations intervened as defendants.they now appeal the district court decision.however,because the state superintendent of insurance,the original,has not appealed,apparently acquiescing in the order of of the state statutes in question,the plaintiffs challenge the standing of the intervenors before this court.for the reasons set out below,we conclude that the intervenors do indeed have standing to bring this appeal but,nevertheless,we affirm the judgment of the district court on the merits.because of legislation enacted after judgment was entered,however,the case must be remanded for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
this challenge to the ohio insurance licensing laws began when the association of banks in insurance,the american bankers association insurance association,the ohio bankers association,and the huntington national bank filed suit against harold duryee in his official capacity as head of the ohio department of insurance shortly thereafter,the independent insurance agents of ohio,the ohio association of life underwriters,the ohio association of professional insurance agents,the ohio land title association,the independent insurance agents of america,the national association of life underwriters,and the national association of professional insurance agents,intervened as defendants in the suit.the are all insurance trade associations that represent independent insurance agents.they joined suit to protect their constituents economic interests,which they claimed would be threatened if national banks were allowed to sell insurance without having to comply fully with ohio insurance laws.
plaintiffs sued for declaratory and injunctive relief under and.they sought a ruling that preempts certain ohio insurance licensing provisions under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,const.art vi,cl.they also sought an injunction to prevent duryee from enforcing these provisions against national banks to the extent that the provisions were preempted by federal law.specifically,the plaintiffs argued that preempts both ohio principal purpose test as codified in b,a,c and d,and the provisions of e and,g and,and c,to the extent that they condition a national bank exercise of its powers on the bank qualifying to do business in ohio under the general corporation law,remaining in good standing with the ohio secretary of state,and organizing for the purpose of acting as an insurance agent 
in conjunction with the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the united states office of the comptroller of the currency submitted a brief as amicus curiae,urging the district court to find that the challenged ohio provisions were preempted because they prevent or impair the ability of national banks to exercise their powers to sell insurance.defendant duryee and the filed for summary judgment.all of the parties agreed that the issues presented in this case were primarily questions of law and that there were no genuine issues of material fact.
subsequently,the district court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs,granting a declaratory judgment and permanently enjoining the superintendent from enforcing the challenged ohio provisions against national banks located and doing business in towns with or fewer inhabitants.the now appeal the district court decision.
discussion 
standing of intervenors 
as a preliminary matter the plaintiffs argue that the lack standing to appeal,on the ground that they do not claim to have been injured by the district court decision.this question is complicated by the fact that,having declined to appeal the judgment of the district court,the ohio superintendent of insurance apparently does not intend to enforce the provisions of the statute at issue here and instead,we assume,will invoke the alternate provisions of.see infra.
permission to intervene in a district court action does not automatically confer standing to appeal.see diamond charles,d.when considering whether the have standing to appeal,our focus is on the injury caused by the judgment rather than the injury caused by the underlying facts.see charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.although the determination of an injury may not always be simple,standing to appeal is recognized if the appellant can show an adverse effect of the judgment,and denied if no adverse effect can be shown.id.
in this case,regardless of the decision of the ohio superintendent of insurance not to appeal in his own name,the judgment of the district court has the effect of easing restrictions on the entry of national banks into the ohio insurance arena.consequently,as potential competitors of those banks,the face the threat of economic injury should the ohio statutory provisions not be enforced.such threatened injury is sufficient to confer appellate standing on the and allows them to challenge the merits of the district court decision.see,kelley selin,cir.
ii.applicable federal statutes 
as the district court noted in its extensive and opinion 
national banks are brought into existence under federal legislation,and are instruments of the federal government which are subject to the paramount authority of the united states.nahas,first national bank of hot springs,cir.thus,it is well established that any state law limiting the operation of national banks is preempted by federal law and invalid under the supremacy clause if the state law expressly conflicts with the laws of the united states,and either frustrates the purpose of national legislation or impairs the efficiency of national banks to discharge the duties,for the performance of which they were created.davis elmira savings bank.congress may confer power on the states to regulate national banks or may retain that power.independent comm.bankers ass of south dakota,board of governors of federal reserve system.the question is one of congressional intent,that is,did congress,in enacting the federal law,intend to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the laws of the state california fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d.absent explicit language,courts must consider whether the federal statute structure and purpose,or nonspecific statutory language,nonetheless reveal a clear,but implicit,intent.jones rath packing,d.
the supremacy clause invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.hillsborough county,automated medical,d quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.federal law may state law where it is in irreconcilable conflict with state law.rice norman williams,d.this may occur where compliance with both statutes is an impossibility.florida lime avocado growers,paul,d.is also appropriate where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.lawrence county school dist,d quoting hines davidowitz.
where state and federal laws are inconsistent,the state law is even if it was enacted by the state to protect its citizens or consumers.as the supreme court noted in gade national solid wastes management ass n,d,in holding that a state law designated to promote worker safety was preempted 
in determining whether state law stands as an obstacle to the full implementation of a federal law,hines davidowitz,at,it is not enough to say that the ultimate goal of both federal and state law is the same,international paper ouellette,d.a state law also is if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach th at goal.see also michigan canners freezers,agricultural marketing and bargaining,d.
see also morales trans world airlines,d holding that a state statute allegedly designed to prevent market distortion caused by false advertising of airfares was precluded by federal law state regulation of the rates,routes or services of air carriers.
an additional doctrine is relevant where the state law in question consists of insurance regulation.under the provisions of the mccarran ferguson act,n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.b.
in the area of national banks may occur even if compliance with both state and federal laws is possible where the state laws infringe the national banking laws or impose an undue burden on the performance of the banks functions.anderson national bank luckett.in fidelity federal savings and loan association de la cuesta,d,the supreme court found that a state law which prohibited the use of clauses in loan instruments was preempted by a federal regulation that expressly granted to federal savings and loans the power to include such clauses in loan instruments,even though federal law merely permitted but did not compel federal savings and loans to include clauses in their contracts.
the supreme court recently addressed the issue of under in barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.in that case,the court held that a florida law which prohibited national banks serving small towns from selling insurance policies.
the court in barnett bank noted that the statutes did not impose directly conflicting duties on national banks because merely permitted but did not require national banks to sell insurance.id.at.however,the court stated that the language of suggests a broad,not a limited,permission for insurance sales,under the rules and regulations of the comptroller of the currency.id.at.the court also referred to previous cases establishing a history of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.id.at.the court stated that these cases take the view that normally congress would not want states to forbid,or to impair significantly,the exercise of a power that congress explicitly granted.id.at.states retain the power to regulate national banks only where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.id.
the supreme court in barnett bank also addressed the issue of whether fell within the ambit of the mccarran ferguson act rule.the court held that specifically relates to the business of insurance,and therefore falls within the scope of the specifically relates exception to the rule.id.at.
on november,some five months after the district court opinion was filed in this case,president clinton signed into law the act.the new act creates separate preemption standards for state laws dealing with the sale,solicitation or of insurance and distinguishes between affected state laws adopted before and those adopted after september.see senate comm.on banking,housing,and urban affairs,financial services modernization act of,at.the former are subject to preemption under the barnett bank statutory preemption standards pursuant to d a and in cases involving these state laws,the occ is entitled to deference under the principles set out in chevron,natural resources defense council,d 
state insurance sales,solicitation,and laws adopted after september,are subject to preemption not only under the barnett bank standard laid out in d a,but also under a new standard established in e.see at.this standard preempts any state statute,regulation,order,interpretation,or other action that 
distinguishes by its terms between insured depository institutions,or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof,and other persons or entities engaged in such activities,in a manner that is in any way adverse to any such insured depository institution,or subsidiary or affiliate thereof 
as interpreted or applied,has or will have an impact on depository institutions,or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof,that is substantially more adverse than its impact on other persons or entities providing the same products or services or engaged in the same activities that are not insured depository institutions,or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof,or persons or entities affiliated therewith 
effectively prevents a depository institution,or subsidiary or affiliate thereof,from engaging in insurance activities authorized or permitted by this act or any other provision of federal law or 
conflicts with the intent of this act generally to permit affiliations that are authorized or permitted by federal law between insured depository institutions,or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof,and persons and entities engaged in the business of insurance.
e.the standard for legal review of these state statutes is without unequal deference.see e.
iii.ohio principal purpose test 
ohio principal purpose test is codified in b,a,and c and d.these statutes authorize ohio superintendent of insurance to deny or revoke an insurance license upon determining that the principal purpose of the license is or has been to solicit or place insurance on the property or lives of persons in certain prohibited categories.
for example,c and d concern licenses to sell life insurance.section c provides in relevant part 
upon written notice by a life insurance company authorized to transact business in this state of its appointment of a corporation,partnership,or limited liability company to act as its agent in this state,the superintendent of insurance shall furnish such corporation,partnership,or limited liability company with an application for an agent license which shall contain such questions as will enable the superintendent to determine that in applying for such license it is not the appointee purpose or intention principally to solicit or place insurance on the lives of the appointee officers,employees,or shareholders,or the lives of persons for whom they,their relatives,or the appointee is agent,custodian,vendor,bailee,trustee,or payee.
section d authorizes the superintendent of insurance to suspend or revoke the license of a life insurance agent after a hearing,if the superintendent finds that the principal use of the license has been to solicit,place,or effect insurance on the lives of persons in the categories enumerated in c.
sections b,a and concern licenses to sell insurance other than life insurance.section b provides in relevant part 
the superintendent of insurance shall issue to an applicant a license that states in substance that the person is authorized to do the business of an other than life insurance agent in this state,if the superintendent is satisfied that in applying for a license it is not the applicant purpose or intention principally to solicit or place insurance on the applicant own property or that of relatives,employers,or employees or that for which they or the applicant is agent,custodian,vendor,bailee,trustee,or payee.
section governs the appointment of solicitors employed by insurance agents licensed under.under a,the superintendent of insurance will not issue an appointment to the solicitor unless satisfied that it is not the solicitor purpose or intention principally to solicit or place insurance on the solicitor own property or on the property of persons in the prohibited categories,listed in above.in pertinent part,instructs the superintendent to deny a license to an agent or solicitor or to revoke the license of an agent or solicitor when satisfied that the principal use of the license has been or is to procure,receive,or forward applications for insurance of any kind,other than life,or to solicit,place or effect such insurance directly or indirectly upon or in connection with the property of such agent or solicitor or that of persons in the prohibited categories laid out in the excerpt of b above.
the ohio department of insurance enforces the principal purpose requirement in part through a numerical percentage test.the superintendent will presume that an agent is violating the principal purpose requirement if the agent sales to persons within one or more of the restricted classes amounts to percent or more of the total premium volume for any one calendar year.see,indep.ins.agents of ohio,fabe,ohio,describing the principal purpose test.to rebut this presumption,the agent must establish that it is not targeting customers in the restricted classes.instead,according to the brief,it must show that it is engaging in a bona fide agency it is making its insurance services available to a wide range of customers and not solely to its existing though it happens to have greater success better than percent in selling insurance to its existing enumerated customers.
an advisory opinion issued by the ohio attorney general that deals in part with the principal purpose requirement describes the types of relationships between a bank and its customers that would make the bank the agent,custodian,vendor,bailee,trustee,or payee of its customers.see op,ohio ag lexis.according to the opinion,banks are payees of persons to whom they extend credit.id.at.the opinion also explains that a bank is a trustee when it exercises its trust powers a bailee and custodian when it provides safety deposit boxes for its customers property an agent when it is designated to act in that capacity on behalf of persons for whom the bank provides financial services and arguably a vendor when selling certificates of deposit,money market certificates,corporate securities,bonds,promissory notes,and other investment instruments.see id.at.the attorney general further notes that the relationship between a bank and its general depositors is widely considered to be a relationship.see id.at.
several of the ohio provisions implementing the principal purpose test were adopted before september,c and d,concerning licenses to sell life insurance a concerning the appointment of solicitors to represent insurance agents and authorizing the superintendent to deny or revoke the license of an agent or solicitor who has failed the test.under the act,these statutes are subject to preemption under the standards laid out in barnett bank.d a.
section b became effective on october,however.this section lays out the standards for licensing insurance agents in all branches of insurance except life insurance because b was adopted after september,it is subject to preemption both under the traditional barnett bank standards and the new standards laid out in e of the act.
on appeal,the emphasize that ohio principal purpose test was enacted as a consumer protection regulation.the superintendent of insurance has explained that the test was undoubtedly intended to prevent an unfair advantage in the placing of insurance and the licensing of persons who were not intending to do a general insurance business,but simply to supplement their primary business.the argue that the plaintiffs object to the application of the principal purpose test because it operates precisely as the ohio legislature intended it prevents national banks from capturing business that they effectively control without subjecting their insurance products to the rigors of competition.they claim that allowing national banks to shield their insurance products from competition would lead to higher prices and unsound consumer purchasing decisions.but,as noted above,the fact that the state legislature enacted the principal purpose requirement to protect general insurance agents and consumers does not,for that reason alone,preclude federal preemption.
the also argue that the principal purpose test is a law of general application that in no way discriminates against national banks.the plaintiffs insist,however,that the test does discriminate against national banks.they emphasize that the admitted goal of the test is to discourage the licensing of those who,like national banks,do not intend to engage in the general insurance business,but seek instead to supplement their primary business.they also emphasize that although transactions between a bank and its customers commonly make the bank the agent,custodian,vendor,bailee,trustee,or payee of its customers,these relationships are not routinely created in the general insurance business.
indeed,the plaintiffs claim that the principal purpose test should be preempted precisely because it would prevent national banks from marketing insurance products primarily to their own customers.they contend that in preventing national banks from marketing insurance to a significant segment of this,their most logical market,the principal purpose test would significantly interfere with a bank exercise of its powers under the preemption standards laid out in barnett bank.they also argue that as a practical matter,the principal purpose test would force national banks to set up a costly and burdensome tracking system to determine whether a potential insurance sale fell within the restricted categories.
it is certainly true that under the ohio attorney general opinion,a national bank customers are very likely to fall within one of the restricted statutory classes.to comply with ohio law,a national bank would,therefore,have to limit its business with many if not most of its customers until it could generate sufficient business outside this restricted customer base to stay below the percent range.and if a national bank is unable to sustain sufficient outside business,it would have to reduce its business with its own customers to ensure that it collects less that percent of its premiums from them.the test would also inevitably impose administrative costs on national banks.
the contend,however,that under barnett bank,the principal purpose test should not be considered to significantly interfere with a national bank exercise of its powers unless it essentially thwarted the bank exercise of its powers.they emphasize that in barnett bank,the state statute at issue totally prohibited affiliated national banks from selling insurance.see barnett bank,at.they then insist that because the principal purpose test at issue here does not totally prohibit national banks from selling insurance,the test can not be preempted under federal law.
the intervenors attempt to redefine significantly interfere as effectively thwart is unpersuasive,however.in barnett bank,the supreme court held that states may regulate national banks only where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the banks exercise of their powers.id.at.the intervenors are asking this court to interpret significantly interfere in a way that would render the two prongs of the barnett bank standard redundant.moreover,immediately after laying out the prevent or significantly interfere standard,the barnett bank opinion cited two cases that do not support the intervenors interpretation of the standard.see mcclellan chipman.considering whether state statute would impair the efficiency of national banks or would destro y or hampe r national bank functions first bank kentucky,wall.considering whether state law would interfere with or impair national banks efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve the federal government.
the also argue that the principal purpose test does not significantly interfere with a national bank exercise of its powers because a national bank can simply set up an affiliate or subsidiary to sell insurance and thereby avoid the impact of the test.they claim that banks in ohio have traditionally satisfied the principal purpose test by exercising this option.national banks are not likely to avoid the principal purpose test by selling insurance through a subsidiary,however.the supreme court of ohio has held that a subsidiary would be prohibited from obtaining a license when that subsidi
