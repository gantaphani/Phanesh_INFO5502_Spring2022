the home equity sales contracts act,et,hesc was enacted to protect homeowners faced with mortgage foreclosure proceedings from being victimized by persons employing oral and written misrepresentations,intimidation,and other unreasonable commercial practices to induce the homeowners to sell their homes for a fraction of their fair market values and lose the equity in the home.boquilon beckwith th,d.in,the legislature amended the hesc to add sections through,which made the home equity purchaser liable for all damages caused by the purchaser representative and imposed licensing and bonding requirements on and disclosures by the representatives.stats,ch.the construction and operation of these sections,which have yet to be explored by the courts,is at the core of the present dispute.
in,plaintiff ingo schweitzer home mortgage was in foreclosure.defendant westminster investments,westminster,through its representative cote,agreed in writing to purchase schweitzer home and,upon expiration of the statutorily prescribed waiting period,schweitzer conveyed title to the home to westminster by grant deed.six months later,schweitzer filed this action to void the deed,arguing the purchase contract was voidable under the hesc because,among other things,westminster did not provide proof that cote was bonded,as required by section.the court ruled that because cote was not bonded and westminster concomitantly failed to provide proof of the bond the purchase contract was voidable and schweitzer was entitled to reclaim title to the home from westminster.
on appeal,westminster asserts the proper interpretation of section is that the bonding requirement applies only to representatives who use undisclosed equity purchasers to purchase homes in foreclosure,and that because cote disclosed she was acting on behalf of westminster,the requirements of section are inapplicable.westminster asserts that a contrary interpretation would render section invalid under the equal protection clause of the united states constitution.westminster also argues the bond requirement is void for vagueness under the due process clause and the attorney fees award to schweitzer was error.
schweitzer argues the trial court erred when it found the purchase contract provided adequate notice of schweitzer right to cancel,and erroneously excluded evidence of a purported violation by westminster of section.because of the nature of the issues in this case,we have received and considered amicus curiae briefs from the state of california and the california association of realtors.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the facts 
a home owned by schweitzer was the subject of mortgage foreclosure proceedings and,by september,the day before the scheduled trustees sale,schweitzer was in arrears on monthly payments exceeding.on september,webster an agent working for westminster contacted schweitzer regarding westminster potential purchase of the home.that evening,webster and cote another agent working for westminster came to schweitzer home and schweitzer signed a contract to sell the home to westminster.schweitzer knew westminster was the buyer and webster and cote were acting as agents for westminster.
on september,schweitzer signed the grant deed and delivered it to westminster,which recorded it.also on september,westminster asked the foreclosure trustee to ascertain the amount required to reinstate the loan.the trustee postponed the sale and,on september,informed westminster that nearly would be required to reinstate the loan.westminster sent the necessary funds to the lender the following day and the loan was reinstated.
the purchase contract allowed schweitzer to stay in the home until january,at a rental rate of per month,to be paid by deducting the monthly rents from the purchase contract cash consideration westminster owed to schweitzer.westminster later extended schweitzer occupancy to january.when schweitzer did not vacate the home,westminster commenced unlawful detainer proceedings.schweitzer responded by filing the present action and tendered restitution of the amounts paid by westminster to reinstate the loan.
b.the litigation 
schweitzer complaint alleged the purchase contract was voidable because westminster did not provide proof of cote bonding.schweitzer complaint also alleged the purchase contract was voidable because it did not provide adequate notice of his right to cancel and was unconscionable.westminster disputed those allegations.
westminster contended the statutory language,considering the legislative history of the amendments,showed the bond requirement was intended to apply only when an undisclosed equity purchaser used a front man to importune the homeowner into selling his or her home,and did not apply when the agent disclosed the identity of the equity purchaser to the seller.westminster asserted that if the statute were construed to require that a disclosed principal use a bonded agent to negotiate with a seller,it would discriminate against corporate buyers which can act only through agents by imposing a bond requirement on corporate buyers while imposing no similar bond requirement on individuals who negotiate directly with sellers to acquire homes in their individual names.westminster argued this discriminatory impact would invalidate the statute under the equal protection clause because there was no rational basis for distinguishing between individual and corporate equity purchasers and treating them differently under the bonding statute.westminster also asserted,in response to the court ruling denying westminster motion for judgment on the pleadings,that application of section to this transaction would violate due process because westminster did not receive fair notice of what it was required to do to comply with the bonding provisions of section.
on the eve of trial,schweitzer moved to amend his complaint to allege the contract was also voidable because a provision violated section,which prohibits limitation of liability in a home equity purchase contract.westminster opposed the motion,and concurrently filed a motion in limine to preclude schweitzer from raising the issue at trial.the court denied the motion for leave to amend and granted the motion in limine.
the matter was tried on stipulated facts.the court rejected schweitzer arguments that the contract was rescindable because of inadequate notice of schweitzer right to cancel or because of unconscionability.however,the court ruled the deed could be canceled for noncompliance with the bond requirement of section.the court concluded the statutory requirement for a bond applied to all persons acting as representatives for an equity purchaser,regardless of whether the identity of the purchaser was disclosed to the seller,and rejected westminster argument that this interpretation rendered the statute unconstitutional under the equal protection clause.the court also rejected westminster due process claims.accordingly,the court declared the deed to the home void and ruled schweitzer was entitled to title to the home based on westminster violation of section.the court awarded attorney fees to schweitzer in a posttrial motion.
on appeal,westminster challenges the judgment both as to the court declaration awarding title to the home to schweitzer and as to the posttrial order awarding attorney fees to schweitzer we reverse the judgment on the merits and necessarily vacate the order awarding attorney fees to schweitzer.by,schweitzer challenges the orders denying him leave to amend his complaint and granting westminster motion in limine precluding him from raising the section issue.we affirm the latter rulings.
the key disputed issue is whether section is enforceable,either as applied to this transaction or more generally to any transaction subject to the hesc.section provides 
a any representative,as defined in subdivision b of section,deemed to be the agent or employee,or both the agent and the employee of the equity purchaser shall be required to provide both of the following 
written proof to the equity seller that the representative has a valid current california real estate sales license and that the representative is bonded by an admitted surety insurer in an amount equal to twice the fair market value of the real property which is the subject of the contract.
a statement in writing,under penalty of perjury,that the representative has a valid current california real estate sales license,is bonded by an admitted surety insurer in an amount equal to at least twice the value of the real property which is the subject of the contract and has complied with paragraph.the written statement required by this paragraph shall be provided to all parties to the contract prior to the transfer of any interest in the real property which is the subject of the contract.
b the failure to comply with subdivision a shall at the option of the equity seller render the equity purchase contract void and the equity purchaser shall be liable to the equity seller for all damages proximately caused by the failure to comply.
section defines a representative,for the purposes of the licensing and bonding requirements,subd.a,to mean a person who in any manner solicits,induces,or causes any property owner to transfer title or solicits any member of the property owner family or household to induce or cause any property owner to transfer title to the residence in foreclosure to the equity purchaser.
the trial court determined section was applicable to the purchase contract in this matter and rejected westminster challenges to its validity.the parties agree that we review de novo the court interpretation of the statutory scheme,as well as its application to the undisputed facts.

the bond requirement 
westminster argues we may rely on the legislative history accompanying the amendments to the hesc,which added the bond requirement,to construe the bond requirement as applicable only when the agent is representing an undisclosed principal.the cited legislative history reflects one of the concerns addressed by the legislation was that agents representing undisclosed principals were engaged in reprehensible conduct toward home equity sellers.see,reading analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended.however,nothing in the statutory language suggests the licensing and bonding requirements were applicable only to agents representing undisclosed principals westminster proposed construction would require the addition of language limiting section to agents for undisclosed principals.a court may not add to or alter the clear language of the statute to insert conditions or exceptions not included by the legislative enactment.code civ,in the construction of a statute,the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted.we conclude westminster was subject to the bond requirement of section under the facts of this case.
vaguenessa.applicable principles 
a statute is void for vagueness if persons of common intelligence must guess as to its meaning and differ as to its applications.franklin leland stanford junior university d.the doctrine reflects the principle that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.citation.the requirement that government articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among competing social values,reduces the danger of caprice and discrimination in the administration of the laws,enables individuals to conform their conduct to the requirements of law,and permits meaningful judicial review.roberts united states jaycees,d.
when assessing a facial challenge to a statute on vagueness grounds,courts should where possible construe the statute in favor of its validity and give it a reasonable and practical construction in accordance with the probable intent of the legislature a statute will not be declared void for vagueness or uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language.turner board of trustees cal d.the statute must nevertheless be sufficiently clear to give fair warning of the prohibited or required conduct,although a statute not sufficiently clear may be made more precise by judicial construction and application of the statute in conformity with the legislative objective.franklin leland stanford junior university,supra,d at.
evaluation 
westminster asserts the statutory requirement that representatives of home equity purchasers subject to the hesc be bonded by an admitted surety insurer in an amount equal to twice the fair market value of the real property which is the subject of the contract is so vague and ambiguous with regard to the nature and conditions of the required bond that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to what is required 
the amount is ambiguous 
the statute does not specify the total amount of the bond required by the statute.there are two conflicting interpretations as to the amount of the bond.the first interpretation is that the representative must proffer proof that he or she has a separate bond for each transaction in an amount equal to at least twice the fair market value of the home subject to that transaction.the alternative interpretation is that a representative may conduct multiple transactions under the umbrella of a single blanket bond as long as the blanket bond is at least twice the amount of the fair market value of the real property on any individual transaction.neither the text of the statute nor the accompanying legislative history provides guidance to determine the legislative intent regarding the amount of the bond,and there are no administrative rulings or regulations addressing this issue.
the trial court below concluded a single blanket bond satisfies the statutory requirement.the attorney general,appearing in an amicus curiae capacity on appeal,relies on the interpretative maxims that we should select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes general purpose while simultaneously avoid ing a construction that would lead to unreasonable,impractical,or arbitrary results copley press,superior court cal th,d,to argue the trial court correctly held a blanket bond is what is required.however,the basis for this conclusion rests not on statutory language,but instead on the practical recognition that the alternative interpretation would require such a massive outlay of collateral by the representative that it would produce an unreasonable or impractical result.
we agree these economic realities suggest individualized bonds would be unreasonable or impractical.however,although this interpretation in favor of a blanket bond may rely on sound economic considerations,that interpretation is untethered to any statutory language and could be contrary to the apparent textual focus of section,subdivision a,because the language of that subdivision defines the amount of the bond by reference to the individual transaction for which it is proffered moreover,to the extent the statute is to be interpreted with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statute general purpose copley press,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,it appears individualized bonds would provide a source of recovery for injured equity sellers but a blanket bond could be exhausted as a source of recovery were it subjected to numerous claims by injured equity sellers the attorney general supports his interpretation with a second rationale.he argues that,because a surety only issues bonds to persons with demonstrable financial strength and good character,the blanket bond is consistent with the statutory goal of preventing representatives from acting as representatives.whatever merit this argument may have,it introduces or perhaps merely reveals yet another ambiguity in the statute at which persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess what type of bond does the statute require for example,a representative may be covered by a fidelity bond in the requisite amount,thereby establishing the bondability the attorney general suggests would suffice,but this type of bond would protect the representative employer for specified malfeasance as to the employer see generally conners,cal.surety fidelity bond practice forms of fidelity,et,et rather than the equity seller.other types of bonds in the requisite amount would similarly satisfy the representative bondability,but the statute is silent on whether any bond of whatever form would suffice.accordingly,the statute is equally susceptible to the interpretation that the protective purpose of the bond requirement necessitates a separate bond for each transaction.we are convinced that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess what the statute requires as to the amount of the bond,because the resort to its language provides no guidance and considerations extraneous to the statutory language would equally support diametrically opposed interpretations.
the obligee is uncertain 
even were we comfortable speculating based on economic considerations extraneous to statutory language or legislative history that a blanket bond would satisfy the statute,the statute would still be devoid of adequate notice of other essential elements of a bond that would guide a representative to know what bond would comply with the statute.section requires the representative be bonded without identifying who is to be the obligee on the bond.unlike other statutory bonds required as conditions to various business activities a representative of an equity purchaser seeking to comply with section must speculate whether the bond is to identify the obligee on the bond as the individual home equity seller if individualized bonds are required by the section,or the state of california,or some other undefined obligee.
the attorney general posits that because code of civil procedure section specifies the bond shall be to the state of california when a statutory bond does not specify the beneficiary of the bond,the absence of any specific identification in section does not deprive the representative of notice of what is required.assuming the default provision of code of civil procedure section provides a person of common intelligence notice of who the obligee on the bond shall be,this construction leaves unanswered an entirely new set of issues relating to the conditions that must be included in the requisite bond if the state of california is indeed the intended obligee,what are the conditions for payment on the bond,and who is the beneficiary of the bond 
the conditions on and beneficiaries of the bond are undefined 
ordinarily,a bond identifies the obligation secured and the conditions precedent to the surety obligation to the identified beneficiary see generally conners,cal.surety fidelity bond practice,supra,et,et,and when a bond is posted as required by a statute,the terms and conditions of the bond are statutorily defined.id.at,accord,electrical electronic control,los angeles unified school dist.th,d.here,however,section does not identify the obligation secured,does not describe the terms and conditions of the bond,and is even silent on the identity of the person or persons for whose benefit the bond is provided.this court asked how claims on the bond would be made and resolved.the attorney general code of civil procedure section,subdivision a governed these questions by providing the bond could be enforced by or for the benefit of,and in the name of,any and all persons for whose benefit the bond was given who are damaged by breach of the condition of the bond only highlights the absence of clarity in the statute.unlike other statutes that identify the person for whose benefit the bond is given and the conditions to recovery on the bond see fn,ante,section does not identify the beneficiary of the bond,the liability covered by the bond,or the conditions to recovery on the bond.a person of ordinary intelligence could only guess at what the law required of him or her to satisfy the bond obligation of section,and this quagmire of vagueness adds to our conclusion that the bond aspect of section offends due process.
the delivery or posting requirements are unidentified 
a bond is ordinarily ineffective until it has been delivered to the obligee see flora aetna cas.surety d,and it appears the various statutes that require surety bonds carry a concomitant posting or filing requirement to effectuate the requisite delivery.see generally bonds,moses royal indemnity.unlike other statutory bonds section is silent on where or to whom the referenced bond should be delivered,posted or filed.the attorney general posits that the hesc obviates the need for filing because section,by requiring the representative to provide proof to the homeowner of the bond,provides assurance the bond will be maintained.however,this construction of the statute leaves unanswered the fundamental question of the enforceability of the bond and instead raises further ambiguities.for example,if the bond is never filed with or delivered to the obligee,which the attorney general presumes is the state of california,how does the representative know whether the terms and conditions of the required bond have been approved and accepted by the obligee see bonds,every bond,in order that it may be a binding obligation,must not only be executed and delivered by the obligor,but must also be accepted by the obligee.statutory or official bonds made payable to the state can not become effective until they are accepted by those duly authorized to accept them,fns.omitted.how does the representative know the term for which the bond must be maintained if only a single blanket bond is contemplated,is leaving possession of the bond in the representative hands for display to prospective equity sellers inconsistent with limiting the bond to the stated monetary limits 
conclusion 
we are convinced that the amorphous requirement of section,requiring proof the representative is bonded by an admitted surety insurer in an amount equal to twice the fair market value of the real property which is the subject of the contract,provides no guidance on the amount,the obligee,the beneficiaries,the terms or conditions of the bond,the delivery and acceptance requirements,or the enforcement mechanisms of the required bond.instead,persons of ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess at what the statute requires for them to comply with its obligations.under these circumstances,the bond requirement of section is void for vagueness under the due process clause and may not be enforced.see,city of san bernardino city of san bernardino th,d.
although we conclude the bond requirement may not be enforced,the remainder of the statutory scheme remains valid if the bond provisions are severable from the balance of the enactment.california gillnetters department of fish game th,d.the hesc contains a severability provision specifying that if any provision of the hesc is declared unconstitutional,the remainder shall not be affected.although not conclusive,a severability clause normally calls for sustaining the val
