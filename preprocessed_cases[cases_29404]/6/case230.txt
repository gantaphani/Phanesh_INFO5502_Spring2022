this action stems from a dispute over the rights to natural gas stored in the bammel gas storage facility,an underground gas reservoir located in texas.the plaintiffs,aep energy services gas holding company aep,houston pipe line company lp hpl,and hpl resources company lp hplr hereinafter sometimes collectively the plaintiffs entered into a complex series of transactions with enron corporation or affiliates thereof hereinafter collectively enron,bank of america,and the bank of new york with respect to the right to use certain natural gas and assets contained in the bammel gas storage facility.the bammel gas storage facility is owned by the bammel gas trust,a entity formed and owned in equal part by enron and bank of america,of which the bank of new york is trustee.
after enron entered bankruptcy proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york in december,bank of america and the bank of new york attempted to repossess the gas contained in the bammel gas storage facility,purportedly pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements among the parties.the plaintiffs refused.instead,they brought suit against the two banks in the united states district court for the southern district of texas the texas district court alleging a superior right to continue to use the gas.bank of america responded by counterclaiming against the plaintiffs for conversion,breach of bailment agreement,and replevin,asserting a superior secured interest in the gas that had vested upon enron bankruptcy.following the approval by the bankruptcy court of a settlement agreement among enron,bank of america,and the bank of new york relating to the bammel gas transaction at issue in this appeal,the texas district court severed the plaintiffs declaratory claims from their claims,which were based on tort and contract theories,and transferred the declaratory claims,and bank of america related counterclaims,to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the new york district court.the texas district court retained the plaintiffs claims and bank of america related counterclaims.
upon this transfer,over the plaintiffs objections and contrary to the express intention of the texas district court,the new york district court adjudicated the entire controversy,including the claims and counterclaims that had been retained by the texas district court.then,in a series of rulings,the new york district court granted defendant bank of america motion for summary judgment as to both the plaintiffs declaratory claims and claims,and bank of america counterclaims,and awarded damages to bank of america on its counterclaims in the amount of plus prejudgment interest.at the same time,the district court denied the plaintiffs motions filed during the pendency of the summary judgment proceedings to amend the complaint and to postpone a decision on the summary judgment motions in order to permit the conduct of further depositions.
we agree with the district court with respect to the grant of summary judgment as to the declaratory claims and related counterclaims,which had been properly transferred by the texas district court to new york,and as to the denial of the plaintiffs motions to amend and to allow them to take further depositions.we conclude,however,that adjudication of the nondeclaratory claims by the new york district court was an abuse of discretion.the texas district which the claims were first a clear intention to retain the nondeclaratory claims and no special circumstances were present to outweigh the presumption in favor of the jurisdiction therefore,the new york district court should have declined to consider them.having so determined,we vacate the summary judgment with respect to the claims,which we conclude should be adjudicated in texas.

the transaction 
in november,enron in an effort to generate capital before the end of the year,entered into a series of interrelated agreements the operative agreements with bank of america bofa and the bank of new york as trustee bony or the trustee,among other entities,to monetize the natural gas owned by enron owned subsidiary hpl.at that time,hpl owned and operated an underground natural gas storage reservoir in harris county,texas,called the bammel gas storage facility the storage facility.hpl and its own subsidiary,hplr,owned approximately billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas kept in the storage facility the storage gas.
in order to achieve its goal of financing,enron and bofa predecessor in interest in this transaction,nationsbank,created the bammel gas trust bgt or the trust,a entity that was owned in equal parts by the two entities.bony was designated to act as the trustee of bgt.
following the creation of bgt,enron caused hpl and hplr to sell the storage gas to bgt for a purchase price of million.the sale was pursuant to a storage gas sale agreement,which stated,among other things,that the agreement would serve as a bill of sale for the storage gas without the necessity of having any separate bill of sale or other evidence of the transfer of the ownership of the storage gas from hpl to bgt,and that bony,as trustee of bgt,would be deemed to have taken delivery of the storage gas as of the date of purchase.storage gas sale agreement dated december,sale agreement,exh.h to the declaration of aaron rubinstein in support of defendants motion for summary judgment rubinstein decl,aep energy gas servs.holding bank of,civ.see generally participation agreement dated december,participation agreement,exh.a to rubinstein decl.
to fund this purchase,bofa through its affiliate,kitty hawk funding loaned bgt approximately million,and bofa and enron each injected approximately million of equity into bgt,with enron equity contribution also financed by bofa as collateral for the loan,bony,the trustee of bgt,granted bofa a security interest in all of the assets held in the trust,including the storage gas,pursuant to a security agreement.see security agreement dated december,security agreement,exh.b to rubinstein decl.
concurrently with this transaction,bgt granted hpl and hplr continued use of the storage gas and the storage facility under a pressurization and storage gas borrowing agreement the pressurization agreement in exchange for the payment of pressurization fees to bgt,which bgt then used to pay the interest on the bofa loan.pursuant to this agreement,hpl and hplr could use the storage gas to pressurize the storage facility,in order to facilitate the storage and withdrawal of other customers natural gas hpl and hplr could also borrow and withdraw up to a certain quantity of the storage gas for other working uses,subject to replacement.
the pressurization agreement provided that title to and ownership of the storage gas remained with the trustee until such time as the storage gas was either withdrawn and sold by the trust or borrowed by hpl.the pressurization agreement also provided that beginning in when the loan principal was due to be repaid to bofa,hpl was obligated to withdraw the storage gas from the facility and make it available to bgt in accordance with a withdrawal schedule.enron was then obligated to sell that gas pursuant to a marketing agreement and to pay to bgt the houston ship channel index for the gas,irrespective of the price that enron actually received from the sale.the proceeds from this sale were to be applied by bgt to repayment to bofa of the principal of the loan.
hpl also had the option under this agreement,instead of withdrawing the storage gas to be sold pursuant to the withdrawal schedule,to supply enron with exchange gas of equivalent quality and value to be sold by enron pursuant to the marketing agreement to fund bgt repayment of the bofa loan,and thereby to continue to use the storage gas in the storage facility after the withdrawal date.
in addition,through a performance guaranty the guaranty,enron guaranteed all the obligations of its subsidiaries,including hpl and hplr,under the operative agreements.the guaranty provided that in the event of a guaranty default,the trustee had the right to immediate possession of the gas.a guaranty default was deemed to exist to the extent that,inter alia,a ny representation or warranty made by enron under or in connection with this guaranty shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made and such materiality is continuing or enron or any of its principal subsidiaries shall become the subject of a bankruptcy event.performance guaranty dated december,guaranty a,c,exh.e to rubinstein decl.
although bgt nominally owned the storage gas and the storage facility following this transaction,hpl and hplr right to use the sold assets continued uninterrupted except for the payment from bgt to hpl for the purchase of the storage gas and the storage facility,fees paid by hpl to bgt for the use of the storage gas and the storage facility,and the fact that enron could now book this as a sale for accounting purposes.in effect,the transaction functioned similarly to a sale and leaseback of the gas.
the transaction 
in,enron decided to sell hpl however,for its own accounting advantage,it wanted to keep the existing structure in place.aep expressed interest in purchasing hpl outright,but enron was unwilling to unwind the transaction structure in order to make the sale of hpl to aep.
in may,enron and aep settled on the following transaction structure enron created a new subsidiary,bam leaseco leaseco,which assumed all of the rights and obligations of hpl under the operative agreements,as well as specified assets of hpl,pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement.thus leaseco effectively stepped into the shoes of hpl with respect to its transaction with bgt,freeing hpl of these rights and obligations.aep then bought hpl.soon after,hpl bought approximately bcf of gas back from bgt for million.bofa thereafter agreed to release its security interest in this gas.that left bgt with title to only bcf of storage gas,and bofa with this same amount of storage gas as secured collateral for the loan.leaseco then subleased the storage facility and associated pipelines and equipment back to hpl for a term of thirty years with a further option,for which aep prepaid the rent of million to leaseco.
additionally,under a right to use agreement,leaseco granted hpl quiet enjoyment of the storage gas for the entire term of the sublease.specifically,section b of the right to use agreement provides,in relevant part,that 
leaseco covenants and agrees that,so long as no hpl default has occurred and is continuing,and notwithstanding the terms,provisions and restrictions in any counterparty agreement,leaseco will have sufficient rights in and to the storage gas to enable it to make,and that it will cause and allow,such storage gas to be available to hpl at the storage facility for hpl right to quiet enjoyment at all times during the term of the sublease the existence of a permitted lien shall not be a breach by leaseco of this section b provided,however,that leaseco covenants and agrees with hpl that leaseco shall timely perform and comply with those of its obligations under the counterparty agreements to which leaseco is a party applicable to the storage gas,and shall timely perform and comply with its obligations hereunder with respect to amounts secured by permitted liens,to ensure that hpl has the quiet enjoyment of the storage gas throughout the term.
right to use agreement dated may,right to use agreement b,exh.w to rubinstein decl.quiet enjoyment is defined in the right to use agreement as the enjoyment of the storage gas free of adverse claims of third parties,of any kind or nature,in,to or with respect to the storage gas,or any part thereof,that interfere with,restrict or impede the enjoyment of the storage gas.id.definition of quiet enjoyment.the bofa secured loan is among the permitted liens that are contemplated by this provision,id.definition of permitted liens,whose existence does not infringe on the right to quiet enjoyment under the agreement.
the right to use agreement further provides that leaseco shall use only exchange gas to satisfy its obligations under article iii of the pressurization agreement setting forth the requirement to withdraw the gas in pursuant to the withdrawal schedule to be sold by enron in repayment of the loan to make withdrawals of natural gas from the storage facility.id.this clause effectively provided the mechanism by which leaseco and enron would repay the principal on the bofa loan when it came due in without interrupting hpl right under the restructured agreements to quiet enjoyment and continued use of the storage gas for the term of the sublease.
as part of the transaction,each of the operative agreements executed in the participation agreement,pressurization agreement,security agreement,and amended and restated to replace hpl and hplr with leaseco.see amended and restated participation agreement dated may,participation agreement,exh.l to rubinstein amended and restated pressurization and storage gas borrowing agreement dated may,pressurization agreement,exh.n to rubinstein amended and restated security agreement dated may,security agreement,exh.m to rubinstein amended and restated performance guaranty dated may,guaranty,exh.o to rubinstein decl.leaseco was used as a vehicle for granting hpl and thereby aep,which was purchasing hpl all of the rights that hpl had had under the transaction,while enron continued to retain all of the obligations of hpl under that transaction via leaseco,such that hpl could continue to use and operate the storage facility and the storage gas,but leaseco was now responsible for the payments of fees and other obligations to bgt.
all told,aep paid more than million for hpl and for the right to use the storage gas and storage facility.
as a condition precedent to the transaction,bofa signed a consent and acknowledgment consent,consenting to the assignment of hpl rights and obligations under the operative agreements to leaseco,and to hpl use of the storage gas and storage facility as provided in the sublease and the right to use agreement.the consent acknowledges that hpl was entering into these transactions in reliance upon the execution of this consent and that but for this consent,aep would not purchase hpl and hpl would not enter into the agreements with leaseco.consent and acknowledgment dated may,consent a ii,exh.x to rubinstein decl.
the consent contains several provisions of particular relevance to the plaintiffs claims.section e of the consent,which provides the basis for aep tort and contract claims,reads 
estoppel and release.each of bofa and the trustee hereby agrees and acknowledges that each operative agreement is in full force and effect and that,to its actual knowledge,no defaults by leaseco,holdings,enron,enron north america or hpl exist and no events or conditions exist which after the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default or event of default by leaseco,holdings,enron or enron north america or hpl thereunder.
id.e.under section of the guaranty,one of the operative agreements,any materially incorrect representation made by enron under the guaranty constitutes a default.included among the representations made by enron under the guaranty is that 
the audited consolidated balance sheet of enron and its subsidiaries as of december,and the related audited consolidated statements of income,cash flows,and changes in stockholders equity accounts for the fiscal year then ended and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of enron and its subsidiaries as of march,and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income,cash flows,and changes in stockholders equity accounts for the fiscal quarter then ended,fairly present,in conformity with gaap,the consolidated financial position of enron and its subsidiaries 
guaranty d i.this representation,as it subsequently would be learned,was dramatically false.
as related to the plaintiffs declaratory claims,section g of the consent provides that 
in connection with the assignments referred to in clause a i of this section providing for the assignment by hpl and hplr of all rights and obligations under the operative agreements to leaseco hereinafter the assigned obligations,each of bofa and the trustee has agreed,and hereby agrees,to enforce payment and performance of the assigned obligations solely against leaseco and holdings and has agreed to release,and hereby releases,each of hpl and hplr from all liabilities and obligations under the operative agreements 
consent g.section further provides,for avoidance of doubt,nothing herein shall impair the lien and security interest of bofa under the security agreement or,except as expressly set forth in section hereof,reduce the rights and remedies of bofa under the security agreement.id.section of the consent gives hpl,among other things,the right but not the obligation to cure any defaults that may arise that affect hpl right to use the gas,and precludes the trustee and bofa from exercising any of their rights and remedies granted by the operative agreements upon a default absent notice to and failure to cure by hpl.in addition to hpl right to notice of and the opportunity to cure a default,under a purchase option agreement another of the operative agreements,hpl received from leaseco the right to purchase the storage gas outright if certain events of default occurred,including but not limited to enron entry into bankruptcy proceedings.
as relevant to this dispute,the rights and remedies of bofa under the security agreement include,in the event of a guaranty default,the right to obtain the remedies set forth in section of the guaranty.this section permits the trustee,upon a guaranty default,to issue a settlement notice to enron for the payment and settlement of all outstanding fees by a fixed date.if enron fails thereafter to deliver,or to cause leaseco to deliver,exchange gas in lieu of the storage gas by that date,the trustee may then,at bofa direction and provided that neither enron nor the plaintiffs have since cured the default,take possession of and withdraw the storage gas.
these restructured transactions all closed concurrently on may.
in december,enron petitioned for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.enron petition for bankruptcy constituted a guaranty default under the operative agreements.see guaranty c a guaranty default shall exist if enron or any of its principal subsidiaries shall become the subject of a bankruptcy event.
texas state court proceedings 
in may,following enron filing of its bankruptcy petition,bofa demanded access to the storage facility to enforce its security interest under the operative agreements by taking possession of the storage gas.when the,hpl,and,bofa filed an action against hpl in texas state court seeking declarations that bofa held a valid and enforceable security interest in the storage gas,that it was entitled to pursue contractual remedies against hpl to foreclose on this interest and take possession of the gas,and that hpl rights to use the storage gas were subordinate to bgt ownership rights and bofa security interest.hpl then filed a breach of contract counterclaim against bofa,asserting that by bringing this lawsuit against hpl,bofa breached its representation that it would not interfere with hpl rights to exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the gas,and sought to enjoin bofa interference with hpl continued use of the gas.
in december,the texas state court granted summary judgment in defendant bofa favor on both its declaratory claims and hpl counterclaims,concluding that bofa had a valid security interest in the gas that was superior to any rights of hpl to use the gas,and that hpl was estopped to deny that bgt was the owner of the gas.see bank of,houston pipe line,slip op.at.hpl appealed.on august,the texas state court of appeals vacated the judgment and ordered bofa claims dismissed.it concluded that the judgment was void because it violated the automatic stay implemented upon enron bankruptcy.houston pipeline bank of.
the federal proceedings 
meanwhile,in october,aep filed a complaint in the texas district court asserting claims for fraud,breach of contract,and negligent misrepresentation against bofa collectively,the tort and contract claims based on the allegedly false representation contained in section e of the consent that bofa had no knowledge of any enron default existing at the time of the execution of the agreement.on january,aep filed an amended complaint adding five claims for declaratory relief seeking to confirm hpl superior right to use the gas the declaratory claims,and adding hpl and hplr as plaintiffs and bony as a second defendant.
meanwhile,over aep objections,on january,the enron bankruptcy court in new york issued an order approving a settlement agreement among enron,bofa,and bony the enron settlement agreement.the order allowed the claims relating to the bammel gas transaction filed by bofa and bony as creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding,provided that bofa and bony would look solely to the proceeds,if any,from any sale of the storage gas,as paid to bofa and bony pursuant to section of the settlement agreement,for recovery on any allowed bgt claim order approving settlement agreement at,in re enron,ajg.the order also permitted the automatic bankruptcy stay to be lifted for the sole purpose of allowing the secured party bofa and the trustee bony to attempt to realize upon the value of the storage gas,including allowing the secured party the trustee to cause the issuance of a settlement notice and a written notice of an event of default as each such term is defined in the operative agreements.id.
pursuant to this order,bofa sent notices of default and settlement notices,in accordance with the terms of the guaranty,to enron and leaseco,with copies to aep and hpl.enron did not perform its purported obligations under the guaranty in response to these letters.nor did aep exercise its options under the operative agreements to cure the default or to purchase the gas.as a result,on may,bofa demanded that aep withdraw and transfer custody of bcf of natural gas in the storage facility to bofa.aep refused.
back in texas,on april,the texas district court,adopting a september,memorandum and recommendation of a magistrate judge,severed the plaintiffs declaratory claims from their tort and contract claims and transferred the declaratory claims only to the new york district court pursuant to a.the texas district court concluded that transfer was proper because the resolution of the declaratory claims,insofar as they sought a declaration of the rights and obligations under the operative agreements to which enron was a party,and to the extent that they implicated the terms of the enron settlement agreement,could affect legal interests at issue in the enron bankruptcy proceeding then pending in the southern district of new york.the texas district court retained aep tort and contract claims,however,which claims did not implicate the terms of any agreements at issue in the bankruptcy proceedings.
that month,bofa filed an answer in the texas district court action.it also asserted counterclaims,in its capacity as bony representative,against hpl for breach of contract,breach of bailment agreement,and the declaratory counterclaims and,in its own capacity,against aep and hpl for fraud and fraudulent inducement the tort counterclaims based on those parties purported misrepresentations that induced bofa to execute the consent.
shortly thereafter,bofa moved in the texas district court to transfer the entire action to the new york district court.on june,a magistrate judge in the texas district court recommended that this motion be granted in part and denied in part.in recommending against the transfer of aep tort and contract claims to new york,the magistrate judge explained that the court decision in its previous order to transfer the declaratory claims and retain all other claims was deliberate and that t he declaratory claims that were transferred are clearly distinct in nature from the tort and contract claims retained in this suit.memorandum,recommendation and order at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no.june.the magistrate judge further concluded that bofa reiteration of this transfer argument is improper,noting that bofa had made the same argument to the texas district court in objecting to the september,recommendation to transfer only the declaratory claims,which argument the district court had necessarily rejected at that time by adopting the magistrate judge recommendation to transfer those claims alone.id.at.
the magistrate judge recommended,however,that the declaratory counterclaims filed by bofa,which paralleled the declaratory claims filed by the plaintiffs,be severed from the tort counterclaims and transferred to the new york district court,and that aep motion pending in the texas district court to amend the complaint to eliminate the declaratory claims in conformance with the previous transfer order be granted.on august,the texas district court adopted this recommendation in full and ordered the declaratory counterclaims severed and transferred to new york.
pursuant to the texas district court initial transfer order,the record in this action,including the original complaint,was administratively transferred from the texas district court to the new york district court to initiate proceedings here.the plaintiffs then moved in the new york district court,as they had in the texas district court,to amend the complaint in order to conform the pleadings to the transfer order.specifically,the plaintiffs moved,inter alia,to restate the declaratory claims that had been transferred to new york,to eliminate the tort and contract claims that remained in texas,and to eliminate aep as a plaintiff.
the new york district court held two status conferences with the parties to address this issue,during which the court informed the parties that for reasons of judicial economy,the entire case should be tried in one place.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.to this end,the court suggested that if it were to grant the plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint to eliminate the tort and contract claims,bofa could simply file a complaint on these same issues against aep in new york in order to effectively bring those claims before this court.id.on november,the new york district court issued a memorandum to the parties inviting defendant bofa to file a complaint against aep in order to bring all the issues before the court in the new york case,and stating that it deemed aep subject to the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of having appeared here as a plaintiff,even though it now seeks to withdraw as such.memorandum to counsel at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.bofa then filed that complaint as the court suggested.
in light of these developments,as the new york district court later explained recognizing that it could not avoid litigating the claims in this court,aep consented to the denial of the part of its may motion to amend the complaint that related to the elimination of aep as a plaintiff and the tort and contract claims,thereby agreeing to have them remain in the complaint.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.accordingly,on january,the new york district court denied aep motion to amend the complaint in these respects,stating only that it had essentially been agreed that these motions would be denied.aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ,slip op.at.the court did grant plaintiff aep motion to amend the complaint in other respects,however,including a restatement of the declaratory claims that were properly before the new york district court.it also dismissed defendant bofa complaint as moot.consistent with this order,on january,the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the new york district court that included the tort and contract claims.
based on what had transpired in new york,and in light of the new york district court expressed intention to adjudicate the entire dispute,defendant bofa filed a renewed motion in the texas district court to transfer venue of the tort and contract claims and the related tort counterclaims to new york.in a september,order,the texas magistrate judge denied the motion.she emphatically rejected the validity of any purported new grounds for transfer 
the recent development from which all of bofa arguments flow is the sua sponte decision of the new york court to exercise jurisdiction over the contract and tort claims and counterclaims.however,as far as this court is concerned,this court has retained jurisdiction over those claims.this court severed the declaratory actions from the contract and tort claims and counterclaims and transferred only the former to new york 
bofa makes no attempt to explain how the united states district court for the southern district of new york can assert jurisdiction over claims presently before this court absent some legal explanation of that court jurisdiction over the contract and tort claims and counterclaims,this court finds no reason to revisit the transfer issue.in fact,the parties should be concerned whether those claims are properly before the new york court and whether a judgment issued by the united states district court for the southern district of new york on the contract and tort claims and counterclaims would be a nullity.
order at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no.on october,the texas district court adopted this order and denied the motion for transfer.
bofa then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the fifth circuit,seeking to vacate the texas district court order denying the motion to transfer and to compel the texas district court to transfer the remaining claims to the new york court.petition for writ of mandamus at,in re bank of,cir.on december,the fifth circuit denied this petition.
back in the texas district court after the fifth circuit denial of mandamus,and following three essentially failed motions by bofa for a continuance and to stay the trial,the tort and contract claims and related tort counterclaims were assigned to district judge hittner for trial beginning in april.at the same time,in new york,the tort and contract claims along with the declaratory claims and counterclaims proceeded toward summary judgment.
on june,the,hpl,and in the new york district court for partial summary judgment as to two of the declaratory claims and as to the declaratory counterclaims.bofa opposed this motion,and also separately moved for summary judgment on all of the claims and counterclaims asserted by the parties.
on october,after the texas state court of appeals vacated the texas state trial court judgment in favor of bofa on the grounds that it violated the automatic bankruptcy plaintiffs moved in the new york district court to file a third amended complaint to add a declaratory claim that the bammel gas transaction was not a true sale of the gas.they had theretofore been precluded from pleading the claim because the texas state court judgment then in effect had estopped them from denying that bgt was the true owner of the gas.at the same time,the plaintiffs again moved in the new york district court to strike the tort and contract claims from the complaint.
on january and february,the new york district court held oral argument on the parties summary judgment motions.at its conclusion,the court announced various findings on the record regarding the declaratory claims and counterclaims,but reserved judgment as to the tort and contract claims.on february,prior to the new york district court resolution of the tort and contract claims,aep moved in the texas district court to enjoin bofa from seeking rulings on these claims in new york,which motion was denied.
on march,the new york district court held a hearing on the subject of the tort and contract claims.after indicating that it would require significant additional time to resolve these issues,and in response to the parties inquiry as to how to handle the upcoming texas trial on these issues scheduled for less than a month later,the new york district court stated that it would suggest to judge hittner in texas that any such trial should be put off pending resolution of the summary judgment motions in new york.transcript of record at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.
the following day,in apparent response to the new york district court statement,defendant bofa filed a third motion for continuance in the texas district court seeking to postpone the scheduled trial to allow the new york district court to resolve the pending summary judgment motions.in support,bofa attached and quoted from the relevant portions of the hearing transcript in which judge griesa indicated that he would communicate to judge hittner his belie f that the trial date should be continued to allow him to complete his work on the summary judgment motion.bank of america third motion for continuance at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no.on march,notwithstanding several prior refusals to continue or stay the trial,judge hittner granted bofa third motion for a continuance pending the issuance of a summary judgment order by the new york district court.order at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no.
finally,on march,the plaintiffs filed another motion in the new york action under federal rule of civil procedure f,seeking to continue the summary judgment motions and to reopen discovery in order to permit the plaintiffs to depose two additional witnesses former enron cfo andrew fastow and former arthur andersen auditor mary cilia.
the new york district court decisions 
in a february,memorandum and an august,opinion,the new york district court granted summary judgment in bofa favor,dismissing all of the plaintiffs declaratory claims and tort and contract claims,and granting bofa relief on its counterclaims for conversion,breach of bailment agreement,and replevin.the remaining counterclaims were contingent on aep prevailing on its tort claims and were therefore rendered moot by this judgment.see aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis at,see also memorandum to counsel memorandum op,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.
the district court first rejected the plaintiffs contention that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the tort and contract claims,reasoning that since aep consented to the arrangement whereby the tort and contract claims remained in this court,aep waived its objection to this court jurisdiction.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court therefore denied the plaintiffs renewed motion to amend the complaint to eliminate these claims,reiterating its view that it is most efficient to have this case tried in one forum.memorandum op.at see also aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.it also denied the plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint to add a new declaratory claim based on the assertion that there had been no true sale of the gas,concluding that such an amendment would be futile because the transaction was not a sham as the plaintiffs had alleged.memorandum op.at see also aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the court then turned to the parties summary judgment motions.with respect to the declaratory claims and counterclaims,the court determined that defendant bofa had a valid,presently enforceable security interest in the storage gas that was not subordinated in the transaction and that was superior to the plaintiffs right to use the gas.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also transcript of record at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.it also concluded that the enron bankruptcy constituted an event of default under the relevant agreements,and that bofa right to enforce its security interest upon an event of default was not affected by the enron settlement agreement.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also transcript of record at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.in light of these findings,the court concluded that hpl refusal to relinquish the gas upon bofa demand constituted conversion,breach of bailment,and replevin,and granted summary judgment to bofa on these claims.see memorandum op.at.
turning to the tort and contract claims,the court concluded that section e of the consent,on which these claims were based,was an estoppel provision and not a representation and therefore could not constitute the basis for any claims as a matter of law.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.assuming arguendo that section e was a representation,however,the court nonetheless rejected these claims on the merits based on a lack of evidence that plaintiff aep had relied on bofa for such accounting judgments related to enron financials,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court summed up its views as follows 
when all the complexities of these transactions are sorted out in light of the various detailed arguments of the parties,two basic conclusions emerge.bofa dealt with enron and its related entities on a secured basis.aep dealt with enron and its related entities on a basis and thus took the risks that were unfortunately involved with that dealing.this litigation has been concerned with the effort of aep to remove bofa from its secured position.however,bofa has done nothing,by contract or otherwise,to relinquish that position.
wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
finally,in light of its finding that the plaintiffs could not prove reliance with respect to the tort and contract claims,the court denied the plaintiffs request to continue summary judgment proceedings in order to take two additional depositions to determine the status of defendant bofa knowledge.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on december,the new york district court issued a second opinion as to the form and amount of judgment due defendant bofa on its conversion counterclaim.see aep ii,wl,dist.lexis.the court concluded that because aep converted the gas by refusing to turn it over to bofa when bofa requested it,bofa was entitled either to money damages or to the return of the gas under texas law,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.bofa elected money damages for the value of the gas,which the court determined to be,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.this figure represented the houston ship channel market value of the gas on the date of conversion,which the court fixed at may,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded,however,that this amount was required to be reduced by the cost to bofa of removing the natural gas from the storage facility had it elected to take possession rather than money damages,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.those costs were to be determined at a later date,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the,hpl,and for reconsideration of the court finding that conversion occurred on may,contending that instead the correct date of conversion was july,when the gas market price was lower.on april,the court denied that motion as untimely because,it found,the plaintiffs had failed to raise this argument prior to the court december decision.aep iii,wl,at,u.dist.lexis,at.the court nonetheless then proceeded to address this question on the merits,confirming its view that may,was the correct date of conversion because bofa had no legal right to demand or obtain custody of the gas until after the automatic stay in the enron bankruptcy was lifted in,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
in a fourth opinion,on august,the district court calculated the withdrawal cost of the gas,at three cents per mmbtu,as million and set bofa total damages at plus prejudgment interest.aep iv,wl,at,u.dist.lexis,at.
the instant appeal 
the,hpl,and from these judgments on several grounds.as an initial matter,they contend that the new york district court lacked jurisdiction over the tort and contract claims in light of the texas district court unambiguously limited transfer orders and therefore erred in adjudicating these claims.the plaintiffs urge us to vacate the grant of summary judgment as to these claims on this ground.
in the alternative,the plaintiffs assert that even if the new york district court did have the power to adjudicate the tort and contract claims,it nonetheless erred in concluding that section e of the consent was an estoppel provision rather than a representation and granting summary judgment in favor of bofa on the merits of these claims.
the court also erred,the plaintiffs assert,in granting summary judgment in favor of bofa on the declaratory claims and bofa counterclaims and in its determination of the award of damages due to bofa on its counterclaim for conversion.
finally,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in denying their motions to amend the complaint to add the no true sale claim and to continue summary judgment proceedings in favor of additional depositions.
we conclude that in light of the content of the texas district court transfer orders,the new york district court abused its discretion in compelling the plaintiffs to litigate the tort and contract claims in new york.we therefore vacate the grant of summary judgment as to these claims,which we conclude should properly be adjudicated in texas.we disagree with the plaintiffs with respect to their remaining contentions on appeal.we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of bofa on the declaratory claims and counterclaims,which had been properly transferred by the texas district court to new york,and properly awarded damages to bofa in the amount of plus prejudgment interest.we further conclude that the district court denial of the plaintiffs motions to amend the complaint to add the no true sale claim and to continue summary judgment proceedings was proper.we therefore affirm the district court judgment in each of these respects.
discussion 
summary judgment as to the tort and contract claims 
the,hpl,and on appeal that because the tort and contract claims and related tort counterclaims were never transferred by the texas district court to the new york district court under,nor were they properly filed in the new york district court,the new york district court had no valid basis for exercising jurisdiction over these claims.the defendants take issue with the plaintiffs interpretation of as it relates to jurisdiction,arguing that section speaks solely to the power of a district court to transfer venue of an action,which,they contend,is different from the question of a district court power to exercise general subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute.therefore,they assert,the texas district court decision to transfer venue of only the declaratory claims and counterclaims in no way affected the new york district court general constitutional power to adjudicate the entire dispute.appellees br.emphasis,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.
we are reluctant to couch our decision in terms of the new york district court jurisdiction to hear these claims.arbaugh y h,condemning the use of jurisdictional rulings that conflate a federal court subject matter jurisdiction with the question whether the federal court had authority to adjudicate the claim in suit quoting steel citizens for better env t,steel,at jurisdiction is a word of many,too many,meanings that is often misused to describe the remedial powers of the court to adjudicate a claim and to impose penalties emphasis in original quoting united states vanness.
under the circumstances presented,the new york district court abused its discretion in adjudicating the tort and contract claims and related tort counterclaims that remained pending in the texas district court.we therefore vacate the new york district court grant of summary judgment as to these claims,which we conclude should be adjudicated in texas.

a district court decision whether to stay or dismiss an action on grounds of comity is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see adam jacobs,cir citing kerotest fire equip.
b.the power to adjudicate the tort and contract claims 
to resolve the question whether the new york district court had the power to adjudicate the tort and contract claims,we must first examine the implications of a transfer of venue under.section a provides that f or the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.a see also van dusen barrack.pursuant to this provision,the texas district court severed the declaratory claims and related counterclaims from the remaining tort and contract claims and counterclaims,and transferred only the declaratory claims and related counterclaims to the new york district court.despite the clear terms of the transfer order,the new york district court proceeded,over the plaintiffs objections,to exercise jurisdiction over the entire dispute.it then resolved all claims on summary judgment,even while the tort and contract claims and counterclaims were still actually pending in the texas district court.the question,therefore,is whether the new york district court had a valid basis for doing so.we conclude that it did not.
we begin with the premise that the question whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute,as a general matter,is substantively different from the question whether a district court has,or has acquired,the power to adjudicate a particular dispute.it is that subject matter jurisdiction concerns a court competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases.wachovia bank schmidt,u,see also verizon.pub.serv.comm of,explaining that subject matter jurisdiction refers,as a general matter,to the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.unlike venue,subject matter jurisdiction does not entail an assessment of convenience.it poses a whether,not a where question has the legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre schmidt,at.
this action was filed in the texas district court pursuant to a,which grants federal district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions that meet the requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction enumerated therein.the new york district court,no less than the texas district court,then,has general federal subject matter jurisdiction over the category of cases into which this dispute falls.we have been given no reason to doubt that had this action been properly filed in the new york district court in the first instance rather than in texas,the new york district court would therefore have had the power to adjudicate these claims.but,of course,it was not first filed in new york it was filed in texas.as to the new york district court power to decide these claims,using the language of schmidt,the question of whether has been answered in the affirmative it is the where that remains in issue.
once the texas district court severed the tort and contract claims and counterclaims from the declaratory claims and counterclaims,they became two separate actions.see wyndham assocs.bintliff,cir where certain claims are properly severed,the result is that there are then two or more separate actions,and the district court may,pursuant to a,transfer certain of such separate actions while retaining jurisdiction of others.the texas district court ordered only the declaratory claims transferred to new york,a plainly deliberate act on its part.memorandum,recommendation and order at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no.june.it is also clear that the new york district court,as the transferee court,could not transfer to itself the tort and contract action currently pending before the texas district court.as we have explained,the language of section a clearly presupposes that the action to be transferred is pending in the transferor court and does not therefore allow for an action to be transferred by another district court before whom the action is not then pending.see equip.rental,fowler,cir noting that t he administration of justice would be chaotic indeed if one district court could order another to divest itself of jurisdiction and to transfer a case properly before it.
there is no dispute that the texas district court did not validly transfer the tort and contract claims and counterclaims to new york.and it is undisputed that it intended to,and did,retain jurisdiction over these claims.indeed,this remained true even after the texas district court became aware of the sua sponte decision of the new york court to exercise jurisdiction over the contract and tort claims and counterclaims.order at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civil no,perceiving no explanation of how the united states district court for the southern district of new york can assert jurisdiction over claims presently before this court and cautioning the parties to be concerned whether those claims are properly before the new york court and whether a judgment issued by the united states district court for the southern district of new york on the contract and tort claims and counterclaims would be a nullity.
nor do we conclude that the tort and contract claims and counterclaims were properly brought in the new york district court.following the transfer order,the texas district court promptly permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint,which included the tort and contract claims,to eliminate the declaratory claims that had been transferred to new york the plaintiffs promptly moved in the new york district court to amend similarly the transferred complaint to eliminate the tort and contract claims to comport with the transfer order 
to be sure,following the denial of their motion to amend,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the new york district court that included the tort and contract claims.it is clear from the record,however,that the plaintiffs did not consent to the new york district court adjudication of these claims,and in fact repeatedly and vigorously protested it.the plaintiffs november,letter to the new york district court,regarding their motion for leave to amend the complaint prior to summary judgment in order to,inter alia,eliminate the tort and contract claims,made their position clear 
plaintiffs never consented to this court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the aep tort and contract claims,nor could they following transfer of the declaratory claims to this court,plaintiffs moved for leave to amend the complaint.although plaintiffs informed the court that aep tort and contract claims had not been transferred to new york,the court nevertheless denied permission to amend the complaint to eliminate reference to the tort and contract claims.the court indicated that it would allow defendants to duplicate those claims in this court through a complaint.in order to avoid duplication,plaintiffs agreed that the most efficient way to implement the court decision was to deny the motion to amend as to the tort and contract claims.however,as the texas court recently pointed out in its denial of bofa third motion to transfer these claims,these events were insufficient to convey jurisdiction on this court that it otherwise does not have.
plaintiffs letter to court at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ,it was only when faced with the hobson choice presented to them by the new york district court that the plaintiffs retained the tort and contract claims in the amended complaint filed in new york 
in light of these events,we can not say that the amended complaint that included the tort and contract claims was properly or voluntarily brought by the plaintiffs in new york.we therefore see insufficient grounds for the new york district court adjudication of the tort and contract claims and counterclaims in this case.
we have recognized the basic proposition that the first court to obtain jurisdiction of the parties and of the issues should have priority over a second court to do so.fowler,at citing joseph bancroft sons spunize of,cir.thus,we have held that where there are two competing lawsuits,the first suit should have priority,absent the showing of balance of convenience or special circumstances giving priority to the second.first city bank trust simmons,cir alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.deference to the first filing embodies considerations of judicial administration and conservation of resources,id.at,and recognizes that a party who first brings an issue into a court of competent jurisdiction should be free from the vexation of concurrent litigation over the same subject matter,fowler,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is,then,that when a case is brought in one federal district court and the complaint embraces essentially the same transactions as those in a case pending in another federal district court,the latter court may enjoin the suitor in the more recently commenced case from taking any further action in the prosecution of that case.fowler,at affirming order by new york court enjoining laterfiled action from proceeding in alabama see also martin graybar,cir citing the established general rule that the party filing later in time should be enjoined from further prosecution of his suit.
even in the absence of such an injunction,however,the second court may be bound to stay its consideration of an action in deference to the proceedings.while the decision whether or not to stay or dismiss a proceeding rests within a district judge discretion,normally s ound judicial discretion dictates that the second court decline its consideration of the action before it until the prior action before the first court is terminated,fowler,at,and a district court can go beyond the allowable bounds of discretion when it refuses to stay or dismiss a duplicative suit,adam,at quoting semmes motors,ford motor,cir friendly.
in this case,the texas district court,as the court of first filing,might well have enjoined the tort and contract claims from proceeding in new york.we are not in a position to offer a view as to the texas district court action or inaction in this regard.but we need not do so to recognize the separate obligation that the new york district court had to consider whether to hear the tort and contract claims and counterclaims that were already pending,and proceeding to trial,in the texas district court.
we addressed a similar situation in semmes motors.there,we considered a new york district court refusal to stay its consideration of an action pending before it that had first been filed in federal court in new jersey.even though the new jersey court in semmes motors,like the texas district court in this case,had not acted to enjoin the new york lawsuit from proceeding,we concluded that the new york court had an independent obligation to defer to the primacy of the suit and had abused its discretion in not doing so.semmes motors,at.although we had no doubt that the new jersey court could properly have enjoined prosecution of the new york action,and might even have been bound to do so,we saw no reason why the end result should be different when the party seeking to preserve the primacy of the first court moves the second court to stay its hand rather than asking the first court to enjoin prosecution of the second case.id.at.whatever the procedure,we concluded,the first suit should have priority.id.
in semmes motors it was the plaintiff who had instituted both actions and preferred to press the second suit in new york,stipulating to discontinue the first in new jersey,rather than the defendant who attempted to thwart the plaintiff chosen forum by filing second in the forum of its own choice.id.at.neither this,nor the fact that in a vacuum,new york is a more logical forum than new jersey,were sufficient grounds for departing from the general rule that in the absence of sound reasons the second action should give way to the first.id.at.
and in adam,we concluded that a new york district court had abused its discretion by failing to abstain from consideration of an action that should have been asserted as a compulsory counterclaim in another,previously filed proceeding.relying on fowler and semmes motors,we concluded that the failure of the court in which the first filing had been made to enjoin the second action was irrelevant to the second court obligation to stay its own consideration while the normal chronology would have been for the court of first,the michigan have enjoined the second court,this procedure is not mandatory.the same policies are furthered by the second court exercising judicial.adam,at.we also noted that f or us to refuse to stay our own proceedings while exercising a willingness to enjoin parties from litigating in other courts would be inconsistent.id.at.
in other words,regardless of the action or inaction of the first court,s ound judicial discretion ordinarily requires that the second court decline consideration of the action in deference to the proceedings pending before the first court.fowler,at.the same policies are furthered by the second court exercising judicial as by the first court issuing an injunction.adam,at 
bofa can identify no special circumstances sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of adjudication of the tort and contract claims in the texas district court.first of all,there is absolutely no evidence that a manifest wrong or injustice would have befallen either party had the new york district court stayed its hand.joseph bancroft sons,at.in fact,after transferring the declaratory claims to new york,the texas district court continued to adjudicate the tort and contract claims before finally staying proceedings in anticipation of the new york district court ruling.second,there is no evidence that aep initial decision to bring suit in texas was motivated by.see william gluckin int l playtex,cir finding special circumstances where forum shopping alone motivate s the choice of the situs for the first suit rayco chicopee,deferring to the second jurisdiction because forum shopping motivated the plaintiff choice of new york.finally,the tort and contract claims are not so inextricably intertwined with the declaratory claims so as to require a court adjudicating one group to reach a conclusion about the other.as a result,they can proceed in parallel litigation before separate courts.we therefore conclude that,under the circumstances presented in this case,it was an abuse of discretion for the new york district court to adjudicate the tort and contract claims that had first been filed,and were in the process of being adjudicated,in the texas district court.
ii.motion to amend the pleadings 
before we can address the remaining issues on appeal,we must turn to the plaintiffs contention that the district court erred in denying their motion to amend the complaint seeking,in relevant part,to add another declaratory claim that the transaction did not,in economic substance,constitute a true sale of the gas,such that bgt never acquired a legal ownership interest in the gas and could not therefore grant bofa a valid security interest in that property.as the plaintiffs point out,if we were to reverse the district court judgment on this issue,we must also vacate and remand as to the remaining issues on finding by the district court on remand that the transaction did not constitute a true sale would,the plaintiffs contend,render the defendants ownership and security interests void and thus compel a finding in the plaintiffs favor on the remaining declaratory claims and counterclaims.such a remand is unnecessary in this case,however,because we conclude that leave to amend the complaint was properly denied.
we ordinarily review a district court denial of a motion to amend the pleadings for abuse of discretion.gorman consol.edison,cir milanese,cir.however,if the denial of leave to amend is based upon a legal interpretation we review it de novo.gorman,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that leave to amend the pleadings should be freely give n when justice so requires.a.the rule in this circuit has been to allow a party to amend its pleadings in the absence of a showing by the nonmovant of prejudice or bad faith.block first blood,cir.we have referred to the prejudice to the opposing party resulting from a proposed amendment as among the most important reasons to deny leave to amend.state teachers ret.bd.fluor,cir reasons for a proper denial of leave to amend include undue delay,bad faith,futility of amendment,and perhaps most important,the resulting prejudice to the opposing party.amendment may be prejudicial when,among other things,it would require the opponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare for trial or significantly delay the resolution of the dispute.id.
the defendants contend that because the plaintiffs motion to amend was not made until three years after they filed their complaint and only after defendants moved for summary judgment,the district court was correct to deny the plaintiffs belated attempt to inject a new legal theory into the case on grounds of undue delay and prejudice.appellees br.however,instead of denying the motion as untimely,the court denied it on the ground that the proposed amendment would have been futile,aep i,wl at,dist.lexis,at,based on its conclusion that the record does not permit a finding that what the bank of america did was a sham,transcript of record at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ.leave to amend may be denied on grounds of futility if the proposed amendment fails to state a legally cognizable claim or fails to raise triable issues of fact.see milanese,at.
it is not altogether clear whether the district court ruling was based upon a legal interpretation of the plaintiffs proposed claim or on a factual determination of the claim ability to withstand summary judgment,which may affect our standard of review.see,gorman,at reviewing denial of motions for leave to amend de novo where district court denied the motions as futile based on its interpretation of the statute under which the proposed claims were purportedly brought milanese,at reviewing for abuse of discretion district court determination that amendment,sought in response to summary judgment motions,would be futile because the record did not enable the proposed claim to withstand summary judgment.we need not resolve that question,however,because we decline to affirm the district court ruling on the ground of futility.
based on the record before us,we are unable to conclude that the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs on summary judgment was insufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the bammel gas transaction was a sham intended,in sum and substance,to enable enron to inflate its revenues fraudulently while hiding the true extent of its liabilities and therefore did not involve a true sale of the storage gas to bgt.on the other hand,doubts have also been raised as to whether the plaintiffs proposed no true sale claim is a legally cognizable theory that would enable them to void the entire transaction and bofa corresponding security interest therewith.in particular,it is open to question whether a finding that the transaction did not constitute a true sale for accounting purposes would necessarily compel the conclusion that it did not effect a legal transfer of property rights under the parties agreements.and there is a further open issue as to whether the plaintiffs may be estopped from asserting that the transaction was a sham in light of their participation in the restructuring of the transaction and extensive due diligence in connection therewith.
we need not reach these difficult issues,however,because we conclude that the denial of aep motion to amend its pleadings was not an abuse of discretion.it would be futile to remand to the district court for it to make a discretionary ruling as to which its disposition is so clearly sound.the plaintiffs filed the motion to amend on october,three years after the commencement of the lawsuit and several months after judgment motions had been filed.as the plaintiffs concede on appeal,the resolution of their proposed no true sale claim may well have been dispositive of all other claims and counterclaims that had,until then,been the subject of extensive discovery and litigation between the parties.and at the time the plaintiffs sought to introduce this new claim,the defendants had already filed summary judgment papers,including in support of their motion and in opposition to the plaintiffs motion,consisting of thousands of pages addressing the existing claims and counterclaims at issue.in other words,the impact of the proposed new claim on the existing proceedings would have been substantial.its assertion would undoubtedly have required the defendants to expend significant additional resources to defend and would have significantly delay ed the resolution of the dispute.block,at.
the plaintiffs offer a credible reason for their delay that they were estopped from challenging bgt ownership of the gas until the reversal of the texas state court judgment in august.the fact that there may have been good reason for them to have acted as they did is not alone sufficient to discount the significant prejudice resulting from permitting them to file their amended complaint in light of the circumstances presented,the length and complexity of these proceedings,and the late stage of litigation at which the motion was made.we therefore conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the motion to amend.see ansam,cola petroleum,cir affirming denial of motion to amend as especially prejudicial given the fact that discovery had been completed and the defendant had already filed a motion for summary judgment see also krumme westpoint stevens,cir same where case was near resolution and discovery had been completed.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint to add the no true sale claim.
iii.summary judgment as to the plaintiffs declaratory claims and bofa related counterclaims 
the,hpl,and asserted six claims counts of their second amended and supplemental complaint seeking declarations that the defendants may not foreclose on or otherwise interfere with the plaintiffs right to use the storage gas in the storage facility,that bofa security interest is limited to the personal property natural gas contained in the storage facility as of may,and that the defendants released or waived their rights to the gas under the operative agreements by virtue of the enron settlement agreement.
following oral argument before it,the district court concluded that defendant bofa held a valid,presentlyenforceable security interest in billion cubic feet of gas that was not subordinated in the transaction in any way.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court further concluded that enron petition in bankruptcy constituted a default under the operative agreements,and that the enron settlement agreement that resolved bofa claims in the bankruptcy court did not affect bofa right to enforce its security against the plaintiffs,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court therefore granted summary judgment to the defendants on all of the declaratory claims.it also granted summary judgment in bofa favor on its counterclaims for conversion,breach of bailment,and replevin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at 
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court that bofa retained a valid security interest in the storage gas under the operative agreements that vested upon enron bankruptcy,and that the plaintiffs refusal to return the gas thereafter constituted conversion.we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment to bofa on the plaintiffs declaratory claims and on the counterclaims for conversion,breach of bailment,and replevin.

b.the use of extrinsic evidence 
the parties agree that the relevant transaction documents are governed by texas law they dispute,however,whether these agreements are ambiguous on their face,such that extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine the parties intent.
under texas law,whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide by looking at the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was entered.coker coker.a contract is ambiguous if it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.see union fire ins.cbi.only if a contract is ambiguous on its face or when applied to the context at hand may extrinsic evidence be considered to explain the terms of the contract.id.of course,a contract is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties disagree about its meaning.seagull energy e p,eland energy,tex.when there is conflicting extrinsic evidence,summary judgment is inappropriate.see sec.sav.ass clifton,
based on our review of the operative agreements,we conclude that there is no indication that these agreements are ambiguous on their face or in the context of this dispute,either individually or when read together.the district court therefore properly declined to consider extrinsic evidence in interpreting these contracts.
c.the scope of the parties rights under the operative agreements 
if there is no ambiguity,the construction of the written instrument is a question of law for the court.myers gulf coast minerals,see also seagull,at.the primary concern when interpreting a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties as that intent is expressed in the contract.seagull,at.to discern this intent,we examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.id.emphasis in original quoting coker,at.in doing so,n o single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect rather,all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.id.quoting coker,at.where contemporaneous documents exist,these documents should be construed together to discern the parties intent.see.commerce bank ass royalty,cir 
the plaintiffs urge us to conclude that the district court erred in deciding that the operative agreements granted defendant bofa a valid,enforceable security interest in the gas that gained priority over the plaintiffs rights upon enron bankruptcy.they point to the fact that the right to use agreement,executed between hpl and enron with bofa consent,gave hpl the right to quiet enjoyment of the storage gas free of adverse claims of third parties,of any kind or nature for the duration of the sublease.appellants br.quoting right to use agreement definition of quiet enjoyment.in order to guarantee such unfettered use of the gas,they contend,enron through leaseco agreed to use only exchange gas,not the storage gas contained in the storage facility,to satisfy any obligations to bofa that may arise under the operative agreements.id.citing right to use agreement.the plaintiffs also note that in the consent itself,bofa expressly released plaintiffs hpl and hplr from all liabilities and obligations under the operative agreements,whether now or in the future existing or arising,and agreed to enforce the obligations imposed by these agreements solely against enron.appellants br.quoting consent g.the plaintiffs argue that,together,these provisions evince an intent to give hpl and hplr unfettered use of the gas to the exclusion of any preexisting rights or security interest of bofa,and to direct all recourse in any event solely against enron.we do not think,though,that this piecemeal reading of the transaction documents accurately reflects the manifest intent of the parties.
it seems to us clear from the plain language of the operative agreements that the intent of the right to use agreement and the consent was to provide the plaintiffs with unfettered use of the storage gas for the duration of the sublease in all ordinary circumstances absent an event of same rights as hpl had under the original agreements,before hpl was sold to aep.once a default occurred when enron filed its petition in bankruptcy,see guaranty c a guaranty default shall exist if enron or any of its principal subsidiaries shall become the subject of a bankruptcy event.emphasis removed participation agreement e stating that an event of default includes when a guaranty default occurs,there is nothing in the documents that purports to negate or subordinate the defendants rights,remedies,or interest in the gas that they would otherwise have under the operative agreements.
the right to use agreement,which grants hpl the right to use the gas for the duration of the sublease,provides that notwithstanding the terms,provisions and restrictions in any of the operative agreements,leaseco will cause and allow the storage gas to be available to hpl at the storage facility for hpl right to quiet enjoyment at all times during the t erm of the sublease.right to use agreement b.the plaintiffs are correct that pursuant to this agreement,leaseco granted hpl quiet enjoyment of the storage gas free of adverse claims of third parties,of any kind or nature,in,to or with respect to the storage gas,or any part thereof,that interfere with,restrict or impede the enjoyment of the storage gas.id.definition of quiet enjoyment.but we do not read this clause as restricting the existing security interest held by bofa in the gas.the parties explicitly carved out the existing security interest from this prohibition by designating it a permitted lien under the agreement,t he existence of which shall not be a breach by leaseco of its obligation to provide hpl with quiet enjoyment of the gas.id.b see also id.permitted liens means inter alia the lien of the existing security agreement.emphasis removed.the pressurization agreement appears to reinforce this understanding by providing,in the covenants,that t he trustee shall not create any lien on the storage gas other than the lien in favor of bofa under the security agreement.pressurization agreement a.
the right to use agreement was subject to bofa consent.see consent at t he execution and delivery of this consent by each of the consent parties including bofa is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the sublease and the right to use agreement.however,the consent executed by bofa is not helpful to the plaintiffs.it makes clear that the scope of this consent extended to the use of the storage gas by hpl as contemplated by the right to use agreement and to any and all agreements related thereto,but only so long as such related agreements do not increase the obligations or reduce the rights of the trustee or bofa under the operative agreements.consent a iii emphasis added.accordingly,bofa consented to the plaintiffs right to use the gas only to the extent that this arrangement did not alter,to the defendants detriment,the defendants existing rights and obligations under the operative agreements then in place and by implication,then,bofa withheld its consent to any aspect of the arrangement that would have the effect of increasing the defendants obligations or,more importantly,reducing their rights to the gas in any way under the operative agreements.
indeed,section of the consent unambiguously forecloses the plaintiffs argument that the parties intended by these agreements to subordinate bofa security interest to the plaintiffs rights in the gas.it provides that f or avoidance of doubt,nothing herein shall impair the lien and security interest of bofa under the security agreement or,except as expressly set forth in section hereof,reduce the rights and remedies of bofa under the security agreement.consent.the only limitation set forth in section t hereof on the rights and remedies of bofa under the security agreement was that prior to exercising these rights upon an event of default,bofa and the trustee were required first to afford the plaintiffs notice of the default and an opportunity to cure it 
accordingly,we look next to the security agreement to determine the rights and remedies of bofa with respect to the gas.section of the security agreement delineates the relative priority of the parties rights and interest in the gas before and after a default with respect to the secured portion of the storage gas only,the security interest of the secured party therein until the trustee or its designee exercises its rights under section of the guaranty,shall be subordinate to the plaintiffs right to borrow and use such natural gas in accordance with the terms of the pressurization agreement.security agreement c ii emphasis added.section of the agreement,entitled remedies upon event of default,further clarifies the interplay between the parties respective rights to the gas before and after a guaranty default occurs 
notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this agreement,so long as no guaranty default shall have occurred and be continuing,neither the secured party bofa nor any note purchaser or bank lender shall exercise its remedies and the note purchasers and bank lenders shall not request the secured party to exercise such remedies under any provision of this agreement or otherwise available at law or in equity against or affecting the storage gas upon the occurrence of a guaranty default,the secured party rights and remedies with regard to the secured portion of the storage gas shall be limited to those specified in section of the guaranty.

the security agreement thus provides that the security interest of bofa in the storage gas is subordinate to hpl right to use this gas,but only until a guaranty default occurs.thereupon,bofa exclusive recourse lies in the trustee exercise of its rights and remedies under section of the guaranty or in bofa assumption and exercise of these rights itself as a representative of the trustee,see id.a ii.section of the guaranty permits the trustee,u pon the occurrence and during the continuance of a guaranty default,to exercise all rights and remedies available at law,in equity,by statue,by agreement or otherwise including,without limitation,the right to give enron the settlement notice.guaranty.upon such notice,if enron fails to cure the default by delivering exchange gas of equivalent value to the trustee,enron shall,at the trustee request at the direction of bofa,cause the trustee to have such access and rights to the storage facility to permit the trustee or its designee to withdraw storage gas from the storage facility.id.b.in addition,both the guaranty and the pressurization agreement unambiguously provide that upon the trustee exercise of its rights and remedies under section of the guaranty,the pressurization therefore the plaintiffs rights to use the.see id.b pressurization agreement b.
in sum,we conclude that the operative agreements,when read together,provided the plaintiffs with the right to quiet enjoyment and use of the gas for the duration of the sublease so long as no event of default had occurred or any default had been cured.upon an event of default,the plaintiffs right to use the gas was subordinated to bofa security interest and the defendants became entitled to exercise their rights and remedies under the operative agreements to foreclose on this interest.and we find nothing in the operative agreements that acted in the transaction to negate or subordinate the security interest that bofa was granted in the storage gas in the event of a default.
we have considered the remainder of the plaintiffs arguments based on the law of contracts and find them without merit 
summary judgment as to the declaratory claims 
we agree with the district court that enron filing in bankruptcy constituted an event of default under the operative agreements and that,following this default,bofa had a valid,security interest in the gas that was not subordinated in the transaction in any way.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the terms of the parties agreements make clear that this security interest was subordinated to the plaintiffs rights to use the gas only until the trustee exercised its rights and remedies under section of the guaranty in the event of a default.upon an event of default,however,the plaintiffs were entitled,pursuant to the consent,to receive notice of and an opportunity to cure the default before the defendants could proceed to exercise their rights and remedies under the security agreement and the guaranty to foreclose on the gas.accordingly,following the lift of the bankruptcy stay in the wake of the enron settlement agreement,the defendants sent notices of default and settlement notices to the plaintiffs,and the plaintiffs chose neither to cure the default nor as was their option under the purchase option agreement to purchase the storage gas outright.at this point,then,pursuant to the contracts,the defendants had the superior right to foreclose upon and withdraw the gas.
we also agree with the district court conclusion that the enron settlement agreement did not affect the defendants ability to enforce their rights with respect to,and security interest in,the gas.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the plaintiffs argue that as part of the enron settlement agreement,the defendants released any and all claims against enron relating to the bammel gas transaction and thereby extinguished any subsequent right of recourse they may have had under the operative agreements against the gas.but the settlement agreement provides to the contrary.
the settlement agreement allows the defendants proofs of claim against enron relating to the bammel gas transaction to be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings,but only on the condition that the defendants recovery on these claims must come solely from the proceeds of the sale of the storage the defendants were then entitled to withdraw and sell under the terms of the operative agreements in any not from any other asset controlled by enron or at issue in the bankruptcy.in order to effectuate this recovery,the order confirming the settlement agreement explicitly lifted the automatic bankruptcy stay for the sole purpose of allowing the defendants to attempt to realize upon the value of the storage gas,including by sending settlement notices and notices of default to enron and to the plaintiffs and thereafter allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to cure prior to foreclosing on the gas.order approving settlement agreement at,in re enron.in return for the allowance and settlement of these claims in this manner,the defendants agreed to release any other claims against enron relating to the bammel gas transaction that may then exist or thereafter arise.
the settlement agreement therefore does not alter or extinguish the defendants rights under the operative agreements to foreclose on and withdraw the storage gas following an event of default.nor does it release the defendants interest in or claims against the gas in any way.it does no more than limit the defendants recovery on their allowed claims against enron to the proceeds of the sale of this gas pursuant to the terms of,and in accordance with their rights under,the operative agreements.in doing so,it insulates any other assets held by enron or otherwise at issue in the bankruptcy proceedings from being the target of the defendants recovery on their allowed claims.
it may be worth noting in this connection that the plaintiffs do not own the storage gas bgt does.bgt leased the rights to use this gas to leaseco in the transaction,and leaseco in turn subleased those rights to hpl.but once enron filed for bankruptcy,the plaintiffs rights to use this gas were effectively extinguished.bgt regained the right,as owner,to control and withdraw the gas pursuant to the terms of the operative agreements.and bofa gained the right to foreclose upon its security interest in the gas.
moreover,pursuant to the enron settlement agreement,the defendants recovery on their allowed claims against enron is contingent on their exercise of these rights.the plaintiffs nonetheless continue to retain physical control over the storage gas and the storage facility.despite a continuing event of default,the plaintiffs have refused the defendants access to the gas in order to exercise their rights.thus,contrary to the plaintiffs arguments,the defendants are not now seeking to recover directly against the plaintiffs for the value of their claims against enron that were released through the settlement in bankruptcy.instead,the defendants are simply attempting to exercise their contractual rights.
finally,we agree with the district court that the gas contained in the storage facility is properly characterized as personal property natural gas and that the plaintiffs are estopped as a matter of law from claiming otherwise aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.as bofa concedes,its security interest is limited to personal property natural gas,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.and its conversion,bailment,and replevin counterclaims,as a matter of law,may only lie with regard to personal property.see int l freight forwarding,am.flange,bailment lighthouse church of cloverleaf.bank,conversion bull jones,replevin.the plaintiffs contend that the natural gas contained in the storage facility constitutes real property rather than personal property,and because the defendants interest in the gas is limited to personal property,they have no entitlement to the storage gas.
as the district court found,however,the plaintiffs have repeatedly represented,in both the transaction documents and in tax and regulatory filings,that the natural gas contained in the storage facility constitutes personal property natural gas and that no native gas or real property natural in the facility after.see,participation agreement m the entire quantity of natural gas to be sold constitutes personal property of the sellers.see also aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at from march to february,hpl filed monthly forms with the texas railroad commission,where it reported that there was no native gas present in the bammel reservoir.the plaintiffs can not now seriously claim that the storage facility contains only real property natural gas to which the defendants have no entitlement.see coffey singer asset fin,a party to a contract may not take a position inconsistent with the contract provisions,to the prejudice of another.
we further conclude that the two recently created regulatory filings,not submitted by the plaintiffs to the district court until after summary judgment motions were filed,which appear to assert that the storage facility contains mostly native gas,and the plaintiffs expert report purporting the same conclusion,are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on this question,especially in light of our conclusion regarding the inability of the plaintiffs to make such an assertion contrary to their previous representations in this regard.see generally margo weiss,cir p laintiffs can not defeat a motion for summary judgment by responding with affidavits recanting that earlier testimony.marine star trading marine,cir a party may not,in order to defeat a summary judgment motion,create a material issue of fact by submitting an affidavit disputing his own prior sworn testimony.ubs ag healthsouth,d,just as a party may not,in order to defeat a summary judgment motion,create a material issue of fact by submitting an affidavit disputing his own prior sworn testimony,so too a party can not in litigation take a position of convenience contrary to its prior statements to regulatory authorities.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the plaintiffs declaratory claims.
summary judgment as to the declaratory counterclaims 
in light of its conclusion that the defendants had a superior existing right to the gas,the district court granted summary judgment to bofa,appearing as bony representative for purposes of the counterclaims,on its counterclaims for conversion,breach of bailment agreement,and replevin based on the plaintiffs refusal to relinquish the gas to the defendants when asked.the court concluded that the plaintiffs converted the gas by refusing to turn it over to bofa when bofa requested it.aep ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
under texas law,a bailment is created when the delivery of personal property by one person to another is made in trust for a specific purpose,there is an acceptance of delivery,there exists an express or implied contract that the trust will be carried out,and an understanding exists under the terms of the contract that the property will be returned to the transferor or dealt with as the transferor directs.see int l freight forwarding,at.a plaintiff who establishes breach of a bailment contract may gain relief through an action for conversion.id.at.
conversion,in turn,is the wrongful assumption and exercise of dominion and control over the personal property of another to the exclusion of,or inconsistent with,the owner rights.burns rochon,citing waisath lack stores.to establish conversion,a plaintiff must prove that the plaintiff owned or had possession of the property or entitlement to possession the defendant unlawfully and without authorization assumed and exercised control over the property to the exclusion of,or inconsistent with,the plaintiff rights as an owner the plaintiff demanded return of the property and the defendant refused to return it.id.at.
we agree with the district court that summary judgment as to these counterclaims is appropriate.upon the occurrence of the guaranty default,the plaintiffs superior right to the storage gas was extinguished and the defendants were entitled to possession of the gas under the operative agreements,subject to the notice and cure provisions.once the plaintiffs had been provided with notice of the default and failed to exercise their option to cure,bofa became entitled,as the trustee representative,to exercise its right to take immediate possession of the storage gas.see security agreement a ii.and when bofa demanded access to the gas and aep refused,that refusal therefore constituted conversion.because wrongful intent is not an element of conversion under texas law,see winkle,condon,the plaintiffs subjective belief that bofa was not entitled to the gas does not preclude their liability.
iv.summary judgment as to damages 
the plaintiffs identify several errors that they contend the district court made in calculating the damages due to bofa in connection with the counterclaims.they assert that the district court erred as a matter of law in awarding damages to bofa in excess of the amount outstanding on its loan and without taking into account bofa obligation to mitigate these damages.they also assert an error as to the date of conversion,which the district court fixed at may,but which the plaintiffs contend should have been july.finally,they contend that the district court improperly weighed conflicting evidence when it granted summary judgment as to the value of the gas and the costs of withdrawing this gas.we find none of these arguments to be meritorious 
damages in excess of the loan amount 
the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in permitting bofa to recover damages in excess of the value of its secured loan.the plaintiffs fail to account,however,for the fact that bofa asserted the counterclaims in its capacity as bony representative,as was its right under the operative agreements.see answer,defenses and counterclaims at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ,asserting counterclaims as administrative agent and as representative of the trustee of the bgt security agreement a ii.therefore,bofa was not limited to the value of its security interest with respect to the damages for conversion.
under texas law,a plaintiff who establishes conversion is entitled to return of the property or,in the alternative,can sue for the value of the property.winkle,condon.if the plaintiff elects the latter,actual damages are determined by the fair market value at the place and time of conversion together with legal interest thereon.varel acetylene oxygen,see also burns,s.at if the plaintiff in a conversion action elects to recover the value of the property,damages are typically determined by the fair market value at the time and place of conversion.bgt,as the owner of the gas,was therefore entitled to bring suit by and through the trustee for the full value of the converted property.it was not limited to the value of bofa security interest.
as the district court explained,this case is not about bofa recovery of the value of the loan.the action was commenced to determine who has greater rights with regard to the gas,and damages are to be awarded to bofa based on the value of the converted property,not based on the amount due on the loan.aep ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis in original.we agree and conclude that bofa was entitled to recover the full market value of the converted gas as of the date on which it was converted.
obligation to mitigate 
the plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in failing to find that the defendants had a duty to mitigate damages and that they neglected to do so on two occasions.see aep ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.first,the plaintiffs contend that bofa failed to mitigate when it released its security interest in the bcf of gas sold by enron to aep during the transaction restructuring,and that bofa should have ensured that the million paid by aep to enron for this gas was thereafter given to bgt in partial repayment of the loan.second,the plaintiffs contend that bofa failed to mitigate when it ceased pursuing its claims against enron in bankruptcy and instead entered into the enron settlement agreement in satisfaction of these claims.we disagree.
at the outset,the plaintiffs fail to explain why bofa,as a secured lender in the transaction,should not have been permitted to voluntarily release part of its security in order to accomplish the restructuring,and why it would have been obligated to control the use of any proceeds from the sale of this gas paid to enron by aep.more importantly,they do not explain how bofa could have been expected to foresee and mitigate unknown future damages years before the conversion took place.see,trinity universal ins.fuller,explaining that the duty to mitigate arises only once the victim of wrongdoing has knowledge of the fact s which make avoidance of the consequences necessary,such as knowledge of the wrongdoer breach of contract prior to the occurrence of the damages.
the plaintiffs also fail to point to any authority for the proposition that an aggrieved party must mitigate damages when deprived of possession of its property through conversion.and in citing cases involving mitigation by a secured party,they continue to ignore the fact that bofa acts in the counterclaims as bony representative,and that its damages are not based upon the value of its security.see,bank of amoco oil,cir generally,the duty to mitigate is a limitation on consequential damages,and where plaintiffs do not seek such damages,but seek damages for the value of converted property,mitigation is not required.
the plaintiffs also fail to recognize that bofa did not abandon its claims relating to the bammel gas transaction against enron in the bankruptcy,but instead settled those claims for value.and it is the recovery of that the withdrawal and sale of the storage underlies the instant litigation.their argument that bofa recovery in this action should be reduced by the amount it could have recovered in the bankruptcy had it not abandoned its claims,appellants br,is therefore inapposite.
c.the date of conversion 
the plaintiffs next contend that the district court erred in determining the date of conversion to be may,the date on which bofa demanded possession of the gas by means of letter to aep and hpl following the lifting of the automatic bankruptcy stay in the wake of the enron settlement agreement and after enron,and the plaintiffs,had failed to cure the default in response to the notices of default and settlement notices.rather,the plaintiffs contend,the date of conversion should be fixed at july,when bofa first demanded possession of the gas following enron bankruptcy and aep refused,prompting the filing of the texas state court action using the july date instead of the may date,the plaintiffs assert,would reduce the ultimate damage award by approximately million.
under texas law,a cause of action for conversion accrues upon the discovery of facts supporting the cause of action,or upon demand and refusal,whichever occurs first.nelson am.bank.to establish conversion,a plaintiff must establish that at the time of conversion,he was the owner of the property,had legal possession of it or was entitled to possession.whitaker bank of el paso.
we agree with the district court that bofa was not entitled to the gas in,because bofa could not have taken possession of the gas until it served a settlement notice on enron and bofa could not serve this settlement notice until when the stay in the enron bankruptcy was lifted.aep iii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.during the pendency of the bankruptcy stay,bofa was not entitled to possession of the gas because it could not enforce its rights to take possession until after the stay was lifted.the texas court of appeals effectively echoed this view when it vacated the state court judgment in favor of bofa on the grounds that it violated the automatic bankruptcy stay.because bofa was not entitled to demand possession of the gas until after the stay was lifted in,aep refusal of its demand prior to that point did not constitute conversion.
once the stay was lifted,however,bofa was entitled to possession of the gas and to enforce its rights to gain that possession.accordingly,shortly after the order lifting the stay was issued,bofa sent notices of default and settlement notices,in conformity with the terms of the operative agreements,to enron and leaseco,with copies to aep and hpl.enron did not perform its obligations under the guaranty in response to those letters,nor did the plaintiffs exercise their options to cure the default or to purchase the gas.accordingly,on may,bofa demanded that aep withdraw and transfer custody of bcf of storage gas in the storage facility to bofa.aep refusal constituted conversion as of the date of bofa demand.the district court therefore correctly set the date of conversion as may.
d.the value of the natural gas 
the district court correctly determined that,under texas law,bofa,as the representative of bony the trustee of the owner of converted property,could elect between the return of the property and money damages.bofa elected money damages.accordingly,the district court determined that bofa was entitled to,which was the houston ship channel market value of the natural gas on the date of conversion,reduced by the reasonable costs of removal of the gas from the facility.see aep ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the plaintiffs do not dispute this calculation.nor do they dispute the use of the houston ship channel index to determine the market price of the natural gas on the date of conversion.indeed,they conceded this fact in the district court.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at aep does not dispute that the hsc price listed is an accurate reflection of the market price of natural gas on that date.the sole argument they advance on appeal is that the calculation of damages,as a general matter,is inherently inappropriate for summary judgment and that they submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to the valuation of the gas in this case.
but courts do routinely award damages that are readily calculable based on the undisputed facts on summary judgment.see,atari,games,wl,dist.lexis may,amended on reconsideration on other grounds,wl,dist.lexis may,aff,app x cir wells fargo bank,taca int l airlines,d.further,the dispute that the plaintiffs point to in this case is not one of fact,but of law whether the defendants interest in the gas was restricted,under the transaction documents,to cushion gas as opposed to working gas as a matter of law.
if the plaintiff in a conversion action elects to recover the value of the property,damages are typically determined by the fair market value at the time and place of conversion.burns,s.at.the plaintiffs argue that the defendants interest is restricted to cushion gas,as opposed to working gas.cushion gas,which has a much lower market value than working gas because it can not be withdrawn from the facility,is the amount of gas that is necessary to pressurize a facility and that must be present at all times when the facility is in use.working gas is any gas in the facility above and beyond this amount that can be withdrawn for use at any time.because cushion gas is the facility bottommost gas and is often contained within porous rock,the plaintiffs contend,the process of removing this gas from the facility would cost millions of dollars,reducing its market value drastically,and they submitted an expert declaration to this effect.
however,the assumption underlying the plaintiffs expert evidence regarding the market value of the the gas should be considered exclusively cushion gas in to be flawed.the original participation agreement,which was amended and restated in the transaction,identifies the gas at issue in the transaction as mmbtus of natural gas currently stored as recoverable cushion gas and as working gas in the storage facility.participation agreement at emphasis added.this is the gas that was pledged to bofa as security.see security agreement,a vii.when the transaction was restructured in,bofa released its security in bcf roughly equivalent to mmbtus of this gas,to be sold outright to aep,and retained a security in the remaining bcf approximately mmbtus of storage gas.see security agreement,a vii granting security interest in the pledged gas,defined as up to mmbtus of storage gas present in the bammel storage facility in houston,texas from time to time.in the event of a default,the guaranty grants the trustee the right to take custody of and withdraw the aggregate quantity in mmbtus of storage gas contained in the facility.guaranty b emphasis added.
the document signed by bofa in the transaction that references cushion gas is the consent.in addition,the right to use agreement,to which bofa was not itself a party,also refers to the gas at issue as cushion gas.see right to use agreement,b.these documents,we surmise,form the foundation upon which the plaintiffs base their argument.however,the use of the term cushion gas in these agreements does not appear to be intended to restrict the defendants interest in the storage gas.rather,the agreements apparently refer to the gas as cushion gas because this is the primary use to which it was contemplated under the operative agreements that the storage gas would be put.it is for this reason that the pressurization agreement is entitled in full,pressurization and storage gas borrowing agreement because the plaintiffs right to use the storage gas was restricted primarily to keeping it in the facility for pressurization,as cushion,from time to time,to borrowing a quantity,subject to replacement,for their own working,as working gas.see,participation agreement,at intro.to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this participation agreement,a hpl and hplr and the trustee are entering into the pressurization agreement pursuant to which the trustee will permit i hpl to use the storage gas for pressurization of the storage facility,and ii hpl and hplr to borrow,replace,and reborrow the storage gas from time to time,in accordance with the operational requirements of the storage facility.
further,the right to use agreement defines cushion gas in a manner that encompasses the entire quantity of storage gas then stored in the facility that would be dedicated to hpl exclusive quiet enjoyment,as distinguished from whatever additional quantities of working gas may be provided from outside sources to be stored in and withdrawn from the facility from time to time.see right to use agreement,a b defining cushion gas as the natural gas currently in the storage facility dedicated to hpl use,and working gas as all natural gas that,from time to time,is stored in the storage facility that is not cushion gas.while these agreements do appear to contemplate that the plaintiffs will use the storage gas as cushion,as the base on which to pressurize the facility for the storage and withdrawal of additional a use does not change the inherent nature of the secured property which is natural gas 
we further agree with the district court that the operative agreements evinced an understanding that the storage gas would be readily removable from the facility,and that this gas was intended to be valued at market rates.see aep ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the pressurization agreement provided for the entire quantity of storage gas to be withdrawn and sold in to repay the bofa loan,and the marketing agreement established that this gas was to be valued at the houston ship channel index price at the time of sale.the houston ship channel market price for natural gas on may,date of readily calculable at per mmbtu.from this,the district court calculated the value of the approximately bcf of natural gas to be.further,it is undisputed that there was,at the time of the district court decision,bcf of gas in the facility,more than enough for the storage gas to be removed without creating any pressurization problems.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in calculating the value of the natural gas on summary judgment.
e.the calculation of withdrawal costs 
the district court reduced the award of damages by the cost the defendants would have incurred had they withdrawn the storage gas in may.the plaintiffs claimed a total of million in costs,consisting of million to withdraw the gas from the facility,million to transport it to the houston ship channel,and a million capacity reservation fee.the defendants contended that the withdrawal would have been.the district court adopted the plaintiffs suggestion that it look to the storage and withdrawal contract between the storage facility and its largest unrelated commercial storage customer to determine a reasonable withdrawal fee,which was three cents per mmbtu,for a total of million.see aep iv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the defendants do not challenge this conclusion on appeal.however,the district court found the other purported costs proposed by the plaintiffs to be unreasonable and declined to credit them as a matter of law.see,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
because neither party challenges on appeal the district court determination of the withdrawal fee at three cents per mmbtu,we consider only the court conclusion as a matter of law that the plaintiffs were not entitled to reduce the award by the cost of transportation or a capacity reservation fee.see jp morgan chase bank altos hornos de,de,cir holding that arguments not made in the parties opening briefs on appeal are waived.we conclude that the district court correctly rejected an award of these costs.as the district court concluded,the fact that the court used the houston ship channel index price as a reasonable proxy for the market value of the gas does not mean that the defendants would have been required to physically transport the gas to the houston ship channel in order to sell it.the unrefuted evidence showed to the contrary that the defendants were entitled to delivery of the gas in the vicinity of the storage facility,and could have sold it there,thereby avoiding any cost of transportation.with regard to the purported capacity reservation fee,the district court properly determined that this cost was not related in any way to the withdrawal of the storage gas nor found in any contract between the parties.
federal rule f motion to permit further depositions 
finally,the plaintiffs appeal from the district court denial of their motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f to continue summary judgment proceedings in order to permit them to take the depositions of two individuals formerly affiliated with enron,including former enron cfo andrew fastow,who first became available to testify following a plea agreement finalized shortly before summary judgment.these depositions were relevant only to the plaintiffs tort and contract claims,inasmuch as the plaintiffs represented that they would be material to the question of bofa knowledge of fraud,and not to the declaratory claims.because we vacate the district court decision as to the tort and contract claims on procedural grounds,this issue is moot.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to bofa with respect to the tort and contract claims,concluding that these claims and the related counterclaims should be adjudicated in texas.we affirm the district court judgment in all other respects.
some of the transactions discussed in this opinion were undertaken by affiliates or subsidiaries of enron corporation.for ease of reference,we refer throughout to all of these entities collectively as enron.

the houston ship channel index lists the price at which natural gas is being sold in the houston ship channel at a particular point in time.it is generally regarded as reflective of the prevailing market price of natural gas.
prior to this,in november,there was another transaction in which hpl entered into a second arrangement with another special purpose entity named asset holdings,holdings,in which hpl effectively sold its interest in the storage facility and other equipment and assigned its obligations under the pressurization agreement to holdings,and holdings then leased these assets back to hpl.holdings was thus among the interested parties in the restructuring,along with hpl.because the transaction between holdings and hpl does not materially affect the issues on appeal,however,for purposes of our description of the transaction it will be largely ignored.
because we do not reach the merits of this portion of the district court decision in resolving this appeal,we do not address the district court conclusion that,in the context of this case,aep breach of contract claim count vii would require proof of reliance in the same manner in which fraud and misrepresentation claims normally require this element to be met.aep i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
we place little weight on the fact that the entire original complaint,which included the tort and contract claims,was transferred as part of the record from the texas district court to the new york district court following the initial transfer order.this purely ministerial act could not have endowed the new york district court with the ability to decide the tort and contract claims where the texas district court transfer order explicitly transferred only the declaratory claims to new york.this is especially true in light of the fact that only one operative complaint existed in the record at the time of the transfer order.
bofa also memorialized this course of events in a november,letter to the court your honor may recall that the fact that there are two separate actions pending regarding this dispute,one before your honor and the other in the federal court in texas,wherein the action before your honor purports to address contract claims and the action in the texas federal court purports to separate out and separately address other contract claims under the same contract as well as purported fraud claims arising out of the contract,was described by your honor as litigation chaos.as a result,your honor indicated that your honor could not imagine splitting the case in two,noted that it was plaintiffs themselves who had originally filed one action addressing all such claims and that plaintiffs filed one action and there will be one action here,that it,and that there should be one set of appropriate pleadings which would allow the trial of the whole case in new york.as a result,your honor directed that,if bank of america chose to do so,it could file appropriate pleadings,such as declaratory judgment claims regarding aep fraud claims or other appropriate pleadings,to get all of the issues before your honor.your honor further directed bank of america to submit such pleadings by december,or to send your honor a letter by that date indicating that it was declining to do bank of america letter to court at,aep energy servs.gas holding bank of,civ
