background 
in,ubk,under the direction of duncan smith,the head of its islamic investment banking unit,established the iibu fund ii plc the fund for the purpose of generating income in a manner compatible with islamic prohibitions on sale and lease transactions.red beginning in,ubk gave a variety of work relating to the management of the fund to richard swomley,a consultant who had previously assisted in the formation of the fund and consulted on leasing investments while employed by an investment bank.swomley formed rls to perform the work in question.
between january and june of,ubk and rls executed three consultancy agreements the consultancy agreements,in approximately identical terms,each involving a different third party as an asset manager to the fund.a the asset managers would present leasing opportunities to the fund and administer the approved leases,collecting rent and paying commissions and expenses.a the asset managers were to earn a percentage of the rental income generated and to remit the remainder to the fund.a 
each consultancy agreement set forth rls obligations to ubk to provide a variety of general consulting and advisory services,including research,analysis,and reporting on the leasing markets and opportunities in the united states,as well as monitoring the quality and performance of the fund assets.a in paragraph,the agreements also detailed a system for payments,under which the asset manager would transfer a percentage of the gross rental revenues and excess reserves to a designated account the lic account under the control of ubk,from which ubk would pay the sums due rls.the consultancy agreements,as supplemented by side letters,provided the rate of compensation rls was to receive for its services.a 
the consultancy agreements provided that they could be terminated by either ubk or rls at any time by written notice,and upon payment of any fees due up to the date of termination.a with the exception of the confidentiality and noncompetition clauses,which were to remain in effect after termination,the consultancy agreements imposed no further obligation on either ubk or rls.ubk was free to terminate at any time without obligation to pay fees for any future period,and rls had no obligation to perform services for ubk following its receipt of a termination notice from ubk.the agreements provided that they would be interpreted in accordance with english law.a 
in a document dated november,rls and ubk entered into a new agreement to amend the terms of the consultancy agreements the november amendment.the gist of the november amendment was to provide that,in the event ubk terminated the consultancy agreement,rls would continue to receive commissions for one year,provided that rls will continue to perform duties reasonably requested by ubk and may if requested by ubk provide reasonable assistance in identifying a replacement for itself.the text of this provision is set forth in the margin 
the november amendment in addition contained provisions purporting to recite consideration furnished by rls to ubk for ubk promise of an additional year of fees.it stated,
our agreement to vary the termination arrangements of the agreements is given in consideration of the following 
that rls was instrumental in establishing productive relationships between the fund,cantrip investments limited and each of the three asset managers.
that rls has undertaken to perform other similar duties in connection with the leasing industry,with other collective investment schemes which may or may not involve the three asset mangers from which rls derives directly or indirectly no financial benefit and other related matters for the benefit of ubk.for the avoidance of doubt other duties on behalf of ubk for which rls is compensated are dealt with and documented separately.
a the november amendment also provided that if rls or swomley engaged in activities which ubk reasonably deemed prejudicial to its interests,then ubk would have the right to stop immediately the payment of any and all commissions as referenced in the consultancy agreements.a 
in late,it appears that relations between ubk and rls soured.duncan smith was dismissed from ubk in november on apparently hostile terms,and swomley resigned from the fund board on february.on february,ubk notified rls and the asset managers that it was terminating the consultancy agreements,and advised the asset managers to send all commissions that would have been paid to the lic account to the fund instead.swomley wrote to ubk demanding continued commissions for one year after,as per the november amendment.when ubk refused this request,rls filed the present action to recover a year fees,as provided for in the november amendment.
following discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court granted defendant motion,reasoning that the november amendment provision granting compensation to rls was invalid for lack of consideration.rls,llc united bank of kuwait plc,wl,at.the court first addressed the two paragraphs,quoted above,which purport to recite consideration.as to the first,specifying rls work in establishing productive relationships for the fund,the court found that it did not constitute valid consideration under english law because this consideration had already been rendered prior to the november amendment,and under english law consideration previously rendered does not satisfy the consideration requirement.id.at citing in re mcardle,ch.promise in exchange for past performance is not supported by consideration.the second recitation of consideration,specifying rls agreement to undertake other similar duties in connection with the leasing industry,did not,in the court view,describe any duties not already encompassed within rls obligation under the consultancy agreements to provide general consulting and advisory services on leasing markets in the united states.id.
the court then addressed the proviso of the clause granting rls the additional year of commissions.as for the first rls will continue to perform such duties as ubk may request reasonably within the terms of paragraph of each consultancy agreement the court concluded that it provided nothing of value to ubk,because in the court view,under the preexisting agreement,ubk could have exacted these services from rls merely by delaying for a year its notice of termination.id.at.
as for the second part of the clause provided that rls may if requested by ubk provide reasonable assistance in identifying a replacement for rls the court found that the use of the word may left in rls discretion whether it would provide such assistance.the court thus found this to be illusory consideration because its terms left performance entirely to the discretion of the promisor.id.quoting chitty on contracts beale,ed.chitty and citing beswick beswick,app.cas,e.
the court concluded that rls proffered theories of consideration did not amount to even a peppercorn of consideration.id.at quoting chitty.it therefore found the november amendment invalid,and granted ubk motion for summary judgment,dismissing rls claim for a year of commissions following ubk notice of termination.
