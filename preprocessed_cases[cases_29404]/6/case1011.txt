russell lippert lippert or plaintiff appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to his former employer,community bank.lippert argues that community bank fired him in retaliation for protected whistleblowing,in violation of.we reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
patrick frawley frawley,chairman and of community bank,hired russell lippert on april,as the bank senior and director of risk management.lippert had previously worked for community bank as an independent consultant.the bank had recently hired frawley as the leader of a new management team that was working to improve the bank regulatory and financial situation after several tumultuous years under the prior management.because of these prior problems,community bank was operating under a cease and desist order and heightened scrutiny from regulatory authorities.
within a few days of beginning work,lippert sent a series of memoranda to the bank local presidents requesting certain loan information.a few weeks later,on or about may,lippert sent another series of memoranda to community bank president stacey mann mann and senior lender mark soukup about the bank loan grading.on may,frawley told lippert that we need to stop the memo writing campaign.lippert later acknowledged that he had a strained relationship with several members of the bank management.
on may,lippert sent a letter to an employee at the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and an employee of the alabama state banking department,in which he complained that the bank management was resisting his recommendations.in particular,he criticized community bank grading of delinquent loans and the level of the bank loss reserve.on may,lippert sent a letter to the same individuals,in which he complained about the same issues.lippert then met with an fdic examiner during the june visitation at the bank.he asserts that he discussed his concerns at that meeting.
lippert testified that he visited bank director and audit committee member jimmie trotter trotter at his home on the morning of august,and,in the course of a two to discussion concerning bank matters,told him that he,lippert,had communicated concerns about the bank to the fdic.trotter disputes that lippert ever told him about the disclosures.frawley and the six other board members have stated that trotter never told them about lippert communications with the fdic.according to lippert testimony,trotter was untroubled by lippert disclosures to the fdic and trotter revealed that he was considering discussing some of his own concerns with the fdic state banking authorities.
on august,lippert presented frawley with a memorandum dated august that discussed his various concerns about the bank.lippert and frawley discussed this memorandum.after this discussion,lippert created a new memorandum dated august.on august,lippert left a copy of his august memorandum in frawley office.lippert then presented the same memorandum at an audit committee meeting that day.lippert contends that the august and august memoranda were nearly identical.
after the meeting,the four members of the audit committee met with frawley and mann to ask about the issues that lippert had raised in his memorandum.frawley and mann told the members of the audit committee about the trouble they had encountered with lippert refusal to communicate personally with members of bank management,and his insistence on using written memoranda to communicate.including frawley and mann,six of the eight directors of community bank were present during the discussion after the august audit committee meeting.the directors who were present told frawley that they would support whatever action he took with regard to lippert employment.
on friday,august,and monday,august,lippert met with the fdic audit team that was at the bank.lippert was the bank point man in dealings with the fdic auditors while they were preparing for their examination,which was to take place in september.lippert asserts that he discussed with the fdic examiners the same concerns that he raised in his august memorandum.
meanwhile,on friday,august,frawley gave notice for a special board of directors meeting to be held on monday,august.under the board operating rules,frawley was required to give at least notice of a special meeting of the board of directors.on monday,august,seven members of the board of directors unanimously approved a motion to give frawley authority to take whatever action he deemed appropriate regarding lippert employment,including termination.frawley consulted the eighth director after the meeting,and that director agreed with the authority given to frawley.on tuesday,august,frawley terminated lippert.the next day ron mitchell from the fdic called frawley and expressed concern over lippert termination.
on october,lippert filed an action against community bank,alleging that he was fired in retaliation for his whistleblowing revelations to the fdic in violation of on august,community bank filed a motion for summary judgment.on september,the district court denied the motion.on september,community bank filed a motion for reconsideration.on october,the district court granted community bank motion,vacated its prior opinion,and entered judgment against lippert on all counts.in ruling against lippert on the whistleblower claim now challenged on appeal,the district court held that lippert internal reports to the bank audit committee and board of directors were not protected disclosures under the statute,even though frawley and the board knew that such reports would inevitably come to the attention of the fdic in its audits.the district court also held that,although lippert did make protected disclosures directly to the fdic lippert failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that either frawley or the board of directors had knowledge that lippert was thus communicating with the fdic,and without such knowledge,the court concluded that lippert protected conduct could not have been a contributing factor in the decision to terminate lippert.
lippert now appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the bank on his whistleblower claim.contrary to the district court,and on the basis of the totality of the evidence adduced in this summary judgment record,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the did know of lippert communications directly with the fdic thus,we reverse.before discussing that evidence,however,we first set out our standard of review in part ii,the applicable law in part,the significance of lippert internal reports in part,and finally we discuss the evidence in part.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment.rojas florida,cir.our discussion of lippert internal reports involves a question of statutory construction,which is reviewed de novo.united states frye,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
applicable law 
lippert alleges that community bank fired him in retaliation for whistleblowing in violation of a.this statute provides 
no insured depository institution may discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because the employee or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee provided information to any federal banking agency or to the attorney general regarding 
a a possible violation of any law or regulation or 
b gross mismanagement,a gross waste of funds,an abuse of authority,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety 
by the depository institution or any director,officer,or employee of the institution.
a.the statute is part of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia.
section adopted the legal burdens of proof from the whistleblower protection act wpa,e.f.under this act,an employee must prove that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the adverse personnel action.e.according to the wpa 
the employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence,such as evidence that 
a the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and 
b the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action.
once a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of retaliation under,the defendant must articulate,by clear and convincing evidence,a legitimate,reason for the termination.in this case,the parties dispute whether lippert has successfully made out a prima facie case of retaliation.community bank concedes that temporal proximity is present,but argues that lippert can not prove that the at community bank had knowledge of his protected activity.in this opinion,we address proof of such knowledge in two distinct ways.first,lippert asserts that his internal reports to community bank audit committee,of which frawley and the board were aware,were protected disclosures.second,he argues that a reasonable inference can be drawn from the totality of the evidence that the knew of his protected communications directly with the fdic.
lippert internal reports 
lippert argues that the reports he made to the audit committee and the board of directors are protected under because the fdic eventually would review these reports,especially considering that community bank was under close scrutiny by the fdic.frawley knew,or should have known,that the fdic would review these reports in the course of their examinations.therefore,lippert insists,frawley and the board knew of protected disclosures and a jury could find that lippert termination was in retaliation for these disclosures.
section a protects an employee who discloses wrongdoing to any federal banking agency or to the attorney general.the plain language of the statute sets out the particular recipients of the employee disclosure,in order for the employee to be protected from retaliation.this interpretation is bolstered when the language of a is contrasted with the more expansive language of a,which governs disclosures by employees of federal banking agencies,federal home loan banks,and federal reserve banks.section a protects disclosures by such federal employees to any such agency or bank or to the attorney general.emphasis added.by contrast,section a,governing disclosures by other bank employees,does not include the same protection for disclosures to banks.i t is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely where it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.bledsoe palm beach county soil water conservation,cir internal quotation omitted.congress appears to have made a conscious decision to protect employees of federal banking agencies including federal home loan banks and federal reserve banks who disclose information to banks,but not to protect other bank employees who disclose information to banks.moreover,granting protected status to bank employees who complain internally poses increased risks of interfering with normal workplace relations within a bank and substantially expands the notion of whistleblowing,beyond that apparently contemplated by the instant statute.
the sparse case law from other circuits supports our analysis.in taylor fdic,the circuit considered the resolution trust corporation whistleblower act rtc whistleblower act.the rtc whistleblower act provision is very similar to a.the rtc whistleblower act required a whistleblower to disclose information to the rtc,the thrift depositor protection oversight board,the attorney general,or any federal banking agency.in taylor,the rtc employees communicated their concerns to the gao and testified before the senate banking committee.neither was a recipient designated in the statute.the rtc launched its own investigation based on these reports.id.at.although the rtc was a designated recipient,the circuit held that the disclosures were not protected,because they drifted to the rtc only by happenstance.id.at.the disclosures were not made to a recipient in the first instance but,rather,reached those recipients indirectly.the employees argued that it should make no difference whether they provided the information directly or indirectly.the court held that i t seems reasonable that congress would afford special protection for communications directed to the specified entities,all ones with a capacity to remedy wrongs brought to their attention,and would withhold the protection from communications that only drift into such hands by happenstance.id.
we believe that the internal reports in the instant case are more remote from the whistleblowing contemplated by the statutory language than were the communications in taylor.such internal reports partake much less clearly of the characteristics of whistleblowing.congress may well have had some reluctance to interfere with,and potentially chill,such internal.we conclude that the language of the instant statute does not protect lippert internal reports to the audit committee,management,and board of directors 
accordingly,we hold that lippert internal reports are not protected disclosures under a,and the district court did not err in so ruling 
evidence of the knowledge 
as noted above,the district court concluded that lippert had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that the knew that lippert was making disclosures to the fdic.we conclude that this appeal turns upon the answer to a single question whether or not there are reasonable inferences from the evidence such that a reasonable jury could conclude that the knew that plaintiff was making disclosures to the fdic.after careful consideration of the evidence reflected in this summary judgment record,we conclude that there are genuine issues of fact in that regard.the following evidence leads us to that conclusion.
the knew that plaintiff was suggesting significant changes in several of the bank procedures,improvements in the loan grading procedures and increases in the loss reserves.the knew that such changes related to matters which would obviously be matters of particular interest to the fdic in view of the recent tumultuous years experienced by the bank,which had prompted the extant cease and desist order and the current close scrutiny by fdic.these problems had also prompted employment of the bank new management team.the new team was charged to work closely with state and federal regulators and restore the institution to a sound financial and regulatory footing.both lippert and frawley were a part of the new team.indeed,the knew that plaintiff occupied the position of senior and director of risk management,and was the bank point man in dealing with the fdic during its visit in june and its august visit in preparation for an examination to occur in september.there is even some evidence that the fdic perceived that lippert was performing an independent function within the bank.
the was aware of the suggestions or constructive criticism memorialized in lippert several memoranda addressed to the bank local presidents and senior management during the relevant time period the was also aware that plaintiff perceived resistance from some in the management to his efforts.thus,the was aware of the content of plaintiff recommendations to senior management contained in his memoranda in april and may.the also knew that lippert met with an fdic examiner during the latter visit to the bank in june.the was also aware of plaintiff august,memorandum to senior management,the contents of which plaintiff and frawley discussed in their meeting on august.the was also aware of a revised memo dated august,which plaintiff left at frawley office on august.that memo was also discussed that same day when lippert met with the bank audit committee.finally,the jury could find that the knew that the fdic audit team was in the ba
