we must decide whether a credit card company violates the truth in lending act when it fails to disclose potential risk factors that allow it to raise a cardholder annual percentage rate.
walter and cheryl barrer held a credit card account with chase the barrers received and accepted the cardmember agreement the agreement governing their relationship at the relevant time in late.in february,chase mailed to the barrers a change in terms notice the notice,which purported to amend the terms of the agreement,in particular to increase the annual percentage rate apr significantly.it also allowed the barrers to reject the amendments in writing by a certain date.they did not do so,and continued to use the credit card.within two months,the new,higher,apr became effective.
according to the barrers first amended complaint which is the operative complaint,they enjoyed a preferred apr of under the agreement.in a section entitled finance charges,the agreement provided a mathematical formula for calculating preferred and aprs and variable rates.in the event of default,the agreement stated that chase might increase the apr on the balance up to a stated default rate.the agreement specified the following events of default failure to pay at least a minimum payment by the due date a credit card balance in excess of the credit limit on the account failure to pay another creditor when required the return,unpaid,of a payment to chase by the customer bank or,should chase close the account,the consumer failure to pay the outstanding balance at the time chase has appointed.
another section entirely,entitled changes to the agreement,provided that chase can change this agreement at any time,by adding,deleting,or modifying any provision.the right to add,delete,or modify provisions includes financial terms,such as aprs and fees.the next section,entitled credit information,stated that chase may periodically review your credit history by obtaining information from credit bureaus and others.these sections appeared five and six pages,respectively,after the finance charge section.
around april,the barrers noticed that their apr had skyrocketed from to,the latter a rate close to a or default rate.none of the events of default specified in the agreement,however,had occurred.when the barrers contacted chase to find out why their apr had increased,chase responded in a letter citing judgments it had made on the basis of information obtained from a consumer credit reporting agency.in particular,chase wrote that outstanding credit loan s on revolving accounts were too high and there were too many recently opened accounts.the barrers do not dispute the facts underlying chase judgments.
despite the barrers surprise,the notice they had received in february contained some indication of what would be forthcoming.specifically,it disclosed that chase would shortly increase the apr to,a decision based in whole or in part on the information obtained in a report from the consumer reporting agency.
the barrers paid the interest on the credit account at the new rate for three months before they were able to pay off the balance.then they sued chase in federal district court.
the barrers filed a class action lawsuit on their own behalf and on behalf of all chase credit card customers similarly harmed and similarly situated.the complaint asserted one cause of action under the truth in lending act the act,et,and regulation z,promulgated thereunder.the barrers claim to have been the victims of a practice they now call adverse action repricing,which apparently means raising a preferred rate to an essentially rate based upon information in a customer credit report.though the barrers do not claim that the practice itself is illegal,they do claim that it was illegal for chase not to disclose it fully to them or to the other members of the putative class.
chase moved to dismiss the barrers cause of action for failure to state a claim under the act,or alternatively to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement arbitration provision.the magistrate judge recommended in favor of chase on both motions.because the district court agreed that the barrers cause of action should be dismissed,and their case with it,it never reached the magistrate judge recommendation regarding chase motion to compel arbitration,but simply entered judgment for chase the barrers timely appeal.
the truth in lending act is designed to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.a.rather than substantively regulate the terms creditors can offer or include in their financial products,the act primarily requires disclosure.see hauk morgan chase bank usa,cir.the barrers credit card is considered to be an open end credit plan,one of the products the act regulates.under the typical commercial arrangement,credit card holders pay a fee,called a finance charge,in order to draw on their credit account.the interest rate or rates used to compute the finance charge generate an apr,a number which is a typical,and therefore useful,comparative measure of the price of the credit the company sells to the consumer.see a a.
in general,the act regulates credit card disclosures at numerous points in the commercial arrangement between creditor and consumer at the point of solicitation and application,at the point the consumer and the creditor consummate the deal,at each billing cycle,and at the point the parties renew their arrangement.id.a d.specifically,creditors must disclose t he conditions under which a finance charge may be imposed,t he method of determining the amount of the finance charge,and,w here one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge,each such rate and the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate.id.a,a a.subsection a directs the board of governors of the federal reserve system the board to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of the act.
regulation z,provides the precise regulations that the barrers claim chase violated.in general,these regulations establish two conditions a creditor must meet.first,it must have disclosed all of the information required by the statute.rossman fleet bank ass n,cir.that is,disclosures must be complete.and second,they must have been,accurate representation s of the legal obligations of the parties at the time the agreement was made.id.
section lists the initial disclosures required of a creditor under a new credit agreement.the list includes each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge and the corresponding annual percentage rate.a.the board has interpreted this regulation in a staff commentary comment,which provides that i f the initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or more specific events,the creditor must disclose the initial rate and the increased penalty rate that may apply and an explanation of the specific event or events that may result in the increased rate.pt.supp.i,par.a,cmt.even if the rate itself is indeterminate at the time of the initial disclosure,the creditor must still disclose the specific event or events leading to a rate increase.id.as examples of a specific event,the comment lists a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit.id.
just as section states what must be disclosed,so section describes how to disclose it.among other things,creditors must make the required disclosures clearly and conspicuously in writing.a and,again,any disclosures must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.id.c.
creditors are not required to be clairvoyant,however,for i f a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the creditor mails or delivers the disclosures,the resulting inaccuracy is not a violation of regulation z.id.e.the board has also recognized that creditors may reserve the general right to change the credit agreement,as chase did in this case.see pt.supp.i,par.a,cmt.recognizing the use of general reservation clause.should the creditor make changes in these ways,it may have to disclose anew under c.id.
finally,although the text of the act and regulations governs,we construe that text in favor of the cardholder by strictly enforcing its regulation against the creditor.jackson grant,cir.
the barrers argue that chase consciously shielded its adverse action repricing program from its customers,deceiving them as to why their aprs might increase.to phrase it in the language of the act,they allege that chase failed to disclose completely under the act why it would change the aprs of its cardholders,in violation of subsection a of regulation 
the barrers do not argue that either the agreement or the notice failed to disclose the apr,which their complaint puts at under the agreement and under the notice.rather,they argue that chase violated the act by failing to disclose the existence of the adverse action practice the credit factors that trigger an adverse action of a customer preferred apr and that information obtained from a consumer credit report will be used for this purpose.thus,the gravamen of the barrers complaint is that chase did not disclose that if a cardholder credit report revealed certain information,what chase calls risk factors,the apr might go up.
subsection a states that t he creditor shall disclose to the cardholder each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge and the corresponding annual percentage rate.there is,again,no dispute that chase disclosed the new apr after it had calculated it and before it went into effect.comment,however,indicates that more is required.most importantly,even if the creditor could not know what a potential increased rate would be when it made the original disclosures,the creditor must provide an explanation of the specific event or events that may result in the increased rate.pt.supp.i,par.a cmt.according to the barrers,the risk factors that chase considered under its adverse action repricing program are specific events that may result in the increased rate,and chase had to disclose them.
chase counters that the risk factors are too general to fall under the meaning of specific events.it points to the examples of events comment provides late payments and credit draws in excess of the credit limit.by contrast,chase claims,the reasons the complaint alleges chase raised aprs are more like judgment calls,assessments of a cardholder risk as the credit history unfolds outstanding credit loans on revolving accounts that were too high too many recently opened accounts debts on loan finance trades that were too high or an average time accounts had been opened that was too short.chase contends that it needs flexibility to adjust the terms on which it offers credit according to such risk factors,but that it can not possibly disclose every factor it might consider because the list is potentially infinite and constantly changes as market conditions change.
we recognize that,as we noted above,neither the act nor regulation z demands clairvoyance from creditors.the comments specifically contemplate general reservation clauses,and regulation z recognizes that subsequent events,specific or not,can render inaccurate a creditor initial disclosures and require new ones.see pt.supp.i,par.c,cmt.e.but this does not dispose of the issue.at its core,the barrers complaint alleges not that chase adjusted aprs based on unknown future events that forced it to reprice the credit it offered.rather,the barrers specifically accuse chase of having a program,at the time of the agreement,whereby it planned to raise their apr if certain risk factors appeared in their credit history.
but even if chase did maintain such a program the language of comment would not require its disclosure.we agree with chase that it must be able to adjust the price of credit according to how risky it is to lend to a given cardholder.indeed,the risk of the likelihood he or she will fail to pay off credit a basic element in the price of credit.in this sense,adverse action is simply a way of describing the normal way a credit card company prices its product.not only will the facts that make a cardholder risky emerge over time,but their importance to chase may vary as market conditions fluctuate.for example,just a few years ago creditors were much less wary than they appear to be today of cardholders and other loan recipients who carry high levels of debt.as a credit card company liquidity decreases,it may suddenly decide to curb the cardholders to whom it had happily given the car keys only the previous year.these decisions do indeed reflect judgments that creditors make more than they do specific,triggering events which creditors know in advance may result in an increased apr.pt.supp,par.a,cmt.
comment,however,does not exhaust the requirements that chase had to meet.regulation z also requires that creditors disclose any apr that may be used to compute the finance charge,and that they do so clearly and conspicuously.a a emphasis added.the point is not that chase had to disclose every factor relevant to the aprs it imposed or that it reserved the right to change the agreement neither the act nor regulation z requires such disclosures.moreover,we have recently rejected the notion that credit card companies must disclose more than what the laws actually require in order to avoid liability for some type of.see hauk,at we hold that a creditor undisclosed intent to act inconsistent with its disclosures is irrelevant in determining the sufficiency of those disclosures under sections,and of regulation.rather,the question is what disclosures chase must have made in order to disclose clearly and conspicuously what regulation z does demand namely,any apr that may be used.a emphasis added.
we have yet to determine the meaning of the word may in subsection a,but one of our sister circuits has done so.in rossman fleet bank,the third circuit rejected the argument that the word means might ever be at some future date,because regulation z explicitly contemplates that creditors will make changes to an agreement that do not affect the accuracy of a previous disclosure.at.citing provisions of regulation z and the act emphasis omitted.instead,it held that may means is permitted to by the agreement at issue.id.at.rossman pointed to the board comment,albeit in reference to a different subsection of the regulation,that t he disclosures should reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound at the time of giving the disclosures.id.at quoting pt,supp.i c,cmt.emphasis added.in light of that observation,the third circuit concluded that may in this context connoted permission,not possibility.id.at.
we are persuaded by this interpretation.although our recent hauk opinion disagreed with the reasoning of rossman in some respects,see hauk,at,it confirmed that our circuit has focused on subsection c requirement that disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties,id.at.our interpretation of subsection a is consistent with full disclosure of contractual terms.creditors,including chase,therefore violate subsection a when they do not disclose in an agreement any apr that such agreement permits them to use.
chase argues that the agreement permitted it to change the barrers apr on the basis of risk factors that it discovered in their credit history,by virtue of the reservation of the right to change terms provision.furthermore,chase contends that the disclosure of that contractual right,coupled with the disclosure that chase would periodically review credit history,meets its disclosure obligation under subsection a.
we are persuaded that chase adequately disclosed the aprs that the agreement permitted it to use simply by means of the provision.that provision reserved chase right to change aprs,among other terms,without any limitation on why chase could make such a change.the provision thus disclosed that,by changing the agreement,chase could use any apr,a class of aprs that logically includes aprs adjusted on the basis of adverse credit information.apart from the gloss of comment,neither the act nor regulation z require chase to disclose the basis on which it would change or use aprs therefore the failure to disclose
