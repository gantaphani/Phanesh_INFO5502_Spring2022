after pmd defaulted on amounts it owed,and the sellers failed in their efforts to obtain repayment from pmd,the sellers sued hsbc.they claimed that hsbc retention of deposits made by pmd to offset pmd overdraft balance constituted a breach of the paca trust.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that hsbc had breached the paca trust by accepting pmd deposits of paca funds,to the extent that such funds were then paid to creditors who were not beneficiaries of the paca trust.the court then awarded the sellers in damages and interest.on appeal,both parties challenge the scope of liability.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to enter judgment for hsbc.
background 
congress enacted paca in to regulate the sale and marketing of produce in interstate commerce.see,at,reprinted in,endico potatoes,cit,cir.through paca,congress sought to encourage fair trading practices in the marketing of perishable commodities by suppressing unfair and fraudulent business practices in marketing of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables and providing for collecting damages from any buyer or seller who fails to live up to his contractual obligations,at,reprinted in.
among other things,paca requires licensing of all entities qualifying as commission merchants,dealers,and brokers buyers,see bars a variety of unfair trade practices by buyers,see id.and provides various remedies when violations occur,see id.paca requires buyers to make full payment promptly for all commodities received from produce sellers.id.if a buyer fails to make a prompt payment,a seller may seek to recover resulting damages by either filing a complaint with the secretary of the department of agriculture usda,or filing a lawsuit in any court of competent jurisdiction.id.a,b 
in the early,congress reexamined paca in the wake of a sharp increase in defaults among buyers.although it found that paca generally worked well in making the marketing of perishable agricultural commodities more orderly and efficient,congress determined that sellers needed greater protection.see,at,reprinted in.congress noted that,as a result of the exigencies of the perishable commodities business,sellers were typically required to sell their produce quickly and frequently found themselves in the position of unsecured creditors of buyers whose creditworthiness could not be verified.if buyers defaulted,sellers could look only to the commodities which would have perished or to the sales proceeds of the commodities.since sellers were typically unsecured creditors,they generally stood in line behind banks and other lenders who had obtained security interests in the defaulting purchaser inventories,proceeds,and receivables.as a result,sellers were often unable to collect monies owed to them.see c,at,reprinted in,endico potatoes,at jsg trading,cir.congress viewed this instability as a burden on commerce and contrary to the public interest.see c,at,reprinted in.
as a remedy,congress amended paca in to make the sellers interests in the commodities and sales proceeds superior to those of the buyers creditors,including secured creditors.it did so by adding section c,which requires licensed dealers to hold all perishable commodities purchased on credit,as well as sales proceeds,in trust for the benefit of unpaid sellers 
perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission merchant,dealer,or broker in all transactions,and all inventories of food or other products derived from perishable agricultural commodities,and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities or products,shall be held by such commission merchant,dealer,or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the transaction,until full payment of the sums owing in connection with such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents.
c.this provision impresses a floating trust on the commodities and their derivatives,in the sense that it permits,commingle paca trust assets with their other assets.b accord endico potatoes,at jsg trading,at,at,reprinted in.to enforce payment from the trust,paca beneficiaries may sue in an appropriate district court.c i 
through these mechanisms congress,in effect,extended a new benefit to produce sellers.to be entitled to trust protection the sellers were required to extend only credit,see,at,reprinted in,regulations under the perishable agricultural commodities act addition of provisions to effect a statutory trust,hereinafter trust regulations,and,in the event of defaults,promptly to pursue administrative and judicial remedies.see patterson frozen foods,crown foods int l,cir in re havana potatoes of,agric.the sellers prompt resort to administrative remedies was intended to isolate and to put pressure on financially insecure buyers to meet their obligations or to be forced from the business.the sellers who complied were,in turn,afforded a highly unusual trust beneficiary status that permitted them,in the case of defaults,to trump the buyers other creditors,including secured ones.but nothing in the text of paca,in its legislative history,or in its implementing regulations indicates that paca was intended to benefit sellers who dealt in other than credit in accordance with paca regulations.see patterson frozen foods,at,at,reprinted in,trust regulations,supra.at.
ii.factual background 
until its demise in september,pmd bought and sold produce at the new york city terminal market at hunts point,new york market.to facilitate its business,pmd opened a checking account at hsbc in october.all of the monies pmd deposited into its hsbc account were proceeds from the sale of produce and thus covered by paca trust provision,as hsbc knew.am.banana republic bank of,civ.ags,slip op.at,during this relationship,hsbc processed hundreds of pmd checks made payable to dozens of payees,typically produce sellers,in the normal course of business 
in january,hsbc began to provide pmd with overdraft privileges as the bank began to receive checks presented for payment against pmd account in amounts greater than the available funds in the account.on the mornings after such checks were presented to hsbc,the bank computer system automatically issued a referral report that showed pmd available funds,total funds on deposit including deposited checks that had not yet cleared,and the amount and number of checks presented for payment the previous day.hsbc then would contact mark werner,pmd owner,and request that he make a deposit to cover checks that had been presented the previous day.in this manner,hsbc would honor pmd checks by providing daylight overdraft accommodations that were covered by promised deposits within a few days.hsbc used checks deposited by pmd to reduce temporarily its overdraft balance.am.banana,supra,slip op.at.
the result of these procedures was that the sellers were paid in the ordinary course of business and that delays in payments were reduced.hsbc hunts point branch manager,joseph vessecchia,testified that because pmd was a,business,the fact that pmd used its overdraft privileges for very short periods of time did not indicate to him that pmd was in financial distress.in the period between june and september,during which most of sellers claims accrued,there was a total of forty days in which pmd exercised its overdraft privileges,and the average overdraft on those days was.id.at.
in july,several of pmd customers began slowing their payments to pmd,resulting in a tightening of pmd cash position.eventually,when pmd payables began to race ahead of payments on its receivables,werner realized that he could not sustain the company and ceased operations on september.at that time,pmd owed to the sellers for produce it had purchased on credit.id.at.
after ceasing pmd operations,werner proposed a plan to pmd trust creditors,including the sellers,asking them to forbear from enforcing their paca trust rights so that he could continue buying and selling produce,preserve his business relationships with market dealers,and pay pmd trust creditors over time.in late september,pmd trust creditors met with werner to discuss his proposal.the sellers representatives and their attorney attended the meeting.at the meeting,werner proposed to assign to the new york produce trade association association,of which the sellers were members,all of pmd accounts receivable as well as pmd interest in a cooperative unit in the market,and to make monthly payments of between and to the association to be distributed pro rata to pmd creditors.in return,werner asked his creditors to forebear from enforcing their trust rights to enable him to remain in business,in part by working for one of his creditors,armata,so he could make the monthly payments from profits he would continue to earn.after werner presented this proposal,the creditors discussed it and twenty minutes later orally informed werner that they had accepted the proposal.id.at.
werner subsequently executed the assignments and made some payments to the association,but the sellers ultimately were unsatisfied with their recovery and pursued claims against hsbc in the district court.they claimed,inter alia,that hsbc receipt of funds subject to a paca trust and retention of them in repayment of pmd overdraft balance violated paca.
following a bench trial,the district court granted judgment to the sellers.it explained that hsbc,as a third party,could be liable for receiving trust assets in breach of trust only if pmd,as the trustee,had itself breached the paca trust by transferring those assets to the bank.id.at.after examining pmd actions,the court found that pmd had not breached the trust by depositing any funds that were used to pay paca beneficiaries.id.citing boulder fruit express heger organic farm sales transp.factoring,cir,cert.denied,d.however,the court also found that pmd had breached the trust when it deposited funds that were used to pay creditors.id.the court then turned to the issue of hsbc liability and held the bank liable for receiving the latter deposits,reasoning that the overdrafts had been loans,that the deposits made by pmd constituted repayments of those loans,and that,by receiving those repayments,hsbc retained trust funds for itself which were required to be distributed to unpaid paca beneficiaries.id.at.the court also rejected each of hsbc three defenses that hsbc was a bona fide purchaser for value of the trust assets,that the agreement rendered the sellers ineligible to recover under paca,and that laches barred the sellers claims.id.at.accordingly,the district court,in a series of amended orders,entered judgment for the sellers for,including interest.see id.at am.banana republic bank of,civ.ags,am.order at,am.banana republic bank of,civ.ags,am.at.
on this appeal,the sellers seek damages from hsbc in the amount of,the full amount pmd owes them,on the theory that hsbc violated paca every time it used a deposit from pmd to offset pmd overdraft balance.hsbc,contesting its liability.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.oscar gruss son,hollander,cir.
discussion 
hsbc liability 
the sellers contend that the district court erred by limiting hsbc liability to only those deposits that were ultimately used to pay creditors.they claim that all deposits used to offset pmd overdraft balance constituted payments to a,of whether pmd later withdrew the funds to pay someone else.according to the sellers,therefore,hsbc violated paca whenever it applied pmd deposits to offset pmd overdraft balance.consequently,the sellers argue,any funds received in this fashion dissipated trust assets,regardless of whether they were subsequently paid out to paca or creditors,and are recoverable to the full extent of pmd debt to the sellers,rather than just to the extent funds were ultimately paid to creditors.hsbc contends that,with the exception of the fees and interest payments retained in consideration for the overdraft privileges extended to pmd,the bank was a mere conduit for all trust funds that were deposited in pmd account,because those funds were released by the bank freely and at pmd direction.
we previously have explained that the trust created by paca is governed by general trust principles.albee tomato,at endico potatoes,at.under such principles,as correctly noted by the district court,a third party such as hsbc can not be liable for receiving funds in breach of a paca trust unless the trustee transfer of funds to the third party constituted a breach of its duty as trustee to maintain trust assets.see restatement second of trusts.the restatement of trusts defines a breach of trust as a violation by the trustee of any duty which as trustee he owes to the beneficiary.id.federal regulations,in turn,prescribe the duties of a paca trustee 
commission merchants,dealers and brokers are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities.any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,including dissipation of trust assets,is unlawful and in violation of section of the act.
d.the same regulations define dissipation,in turn,as any act or failure to act which could result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents to recover money owed in connection with produce transactions.id.a.
in light of these principles and the facts of this case,two distinct paca trust issues are presented.the first issue is whether the trustee is liable for dissipating the trust by using trust funds to pay creditors.the second issue is whether the bank is liable for receiving funds in breach of trust in the circumstances presented.with respect to the first trustee district court concluded that pmd had breached the trust by making payments out of trust funds to creditors.with respect to the second bank district court appears to have assumed,without explanation,that hsbc automatically shared pmd liability for dissipating trust funds,apparently on the basis that the funds pmd paid to creditors were withdrawn from an account at hsbc.that is,the district court assumed hsbc liability in these circumstances without separately considering the role,if any,the bank played in pmd breach of trust.
however,concluding that pmd use of trust funds to pay creditors constituted a breach of the trust by pmd does not necessarily compel the further conclusion that such a breach is attributable to hsbc.to evaluate hsbc liability,we must examine hsbc actions,and here it appears that hsbc took no action that inhibited pmd ability to pay paca beneficiaries and,indeed,had no practical control over the payments pmd made to creditors.it merely honored checks that it was entitled to presume were validly drawn.see in the matter of knox,bischoff yorkville bank.third parties such as banks,it must be remembered,are not guarantors of the paca trust.see boulder fruit,at see also sunkist growers,fisher,cir consumers produce volante wholesale produce,cir.it seems to us that the imposition of liability on hsbc under the facts of this case would impose an impossible burden on banks to monitor each check drawn on an overdrawn paca trust account,which would be inconsistent with banking law.see knox,at bischoff,at.the imposition of liability under such circumstances would also run the serious risk of not eliminating procedures that directly benefit paca beneficiaries.
nor are we convinced that a trustee payments of commercially reasonable fees and interest in exchange for routine banking services such as check cashing services and overdraft privileges extended to facilitate payments to beneficiaries necessarily constitute a breach of the paca trust.boulder fruit,at concluding that a factoring agreement,under which trustee sold its receivables at eighty percent of face value,was not a per se breach of trust under paca and,because the discount rate had not been shown to be commercially unreasonable,did not constitute a breach under the facts of the case.
ultimately,however,we need not resolve these various issues.even assuming that hsbc did retain the funds,it has a complete defense to paca liability arising from the agreement between the sellers and pmd,which we discuss below.
ii.hsbc defense 
strict eligibility requirements accompany the extraordinary protection afforded by paca trust provision.one such requirement is that a seller seeking paca trust protection must be selling produce on a cash or credit basis.see c e endico potatoes,at patterson frozen foods,at citing greg orchards produce,roncone,cir.as noted above,paca requires buyers to make full payment promptly.instead of prescribing a specific period of time in the statute that will satisfy this requirement,congress left the definition of prompt payment to the regulatory discretion of the secretary of the usda.see id.c.the pertinent regulations promulgated by the usda in conjunction with the trust provision provide 
the times for prompt payment are set out in aa.parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement in their records,and the times of payment must be disclosed on invoices,accountings,and other documents relating to the transaction.
the maximum time for payment for a shipment to which a seller,supplier,or agent can agree and still qualify for coverage under the trust is days after receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined in dd and paragraph a of this section.
e.section aa,in turn,provides 
full payment promptly is the term used in the act in specifying the period of time for making payment without committing a violation of the act.full payment promptly,for the purpose of determining violations of the act,means 
payment for produce purchased by a buyer,within days after the day on which the produce is accepted 
parties who elect to use different times of payment than those set forth in paragraphs aa through of this section must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of the agreement in their records.if they have so agreed,then payment within the agreed upon time shall constitute full payment promptly provided,that the party claiming the existence of such an agreement for time of payment shall have the burden of proving it.
id.aa.in summary,these regulations require a buyer to pay the seller within ten days after the buyer has accepted the produce,but permit the parties to agree in writing before the transaction to other payment periods that do not exceed thirty days.sellers who offer payment periods of longer than thirty days are not entitled to paca trust protection.
hsbc claims that the sellers disqualified themselves from paca trust protection by entering into the agreement with pmd that extended the payment period well beyond the maximum allowed under the paca regulations.id.e.the sellers,on the other hand,contend that in order to waive paca trust protection,a seller must enter into a written agreement,which they did not do here.the district court agreed with the sellers and rejected hsbc defense.am.banana,supra,slip op.at.
in reviewing the district court rejection of this defense,we must first consider whether the maximum under section e applies to agreements.although hsbc argument and the district court decision assume that it does,and other circuits apparently have so held,see,greg orchards produce,at in re lombardo fruit produce,cir,we find that such a conclusion is not clear from the text of paca or its regulations,both of which discuss only agreements,c the unpaid supplier,seller,or agent shall lose the benefits of such trust unless such person has given written notice of intent to preserve the benefits of the trust to the commission merchant,dealer,or broker within thirty calendar days ii after expiration of such other time by which payment must be made,as the parties have expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction emphasis added e parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction emphasis added.we therefore turn to the legislative history of paca to discern whether congress intended to extend trust protection to sellers that enter into agreements after a buyer defaults that contain a payment period exceeding thirty days after the buyer has accepted the produce.see united states gayle,cir resort to authoritative legislative history may be justified where there is an open question as to the meaning of a word or phrase in a statute,or where a statute is silent on an issue of fundamental importance to its correct application.
the house report accompanying the amendment to paca makes clear that congress intended trust protection to extend solely to cash and credit transactions 
the committee finds that it is common practice in the produce business to extend credit for reasonable periods of time beyond the time prescribed for cash transactions in regulations issued by the secretary under the provisions of the packers and stockyards act.consequently,to be effective,the trust applies to credit transactions as well as to the straight cash transactions.however,the committee does not intend the trust to apply to any credit transaction that extends beyond a reasonable period.under the bill,the secretary is required to establish,through rulemaking,the time by which,the parties to a transaction must agree payment on a transaction must be made,to qualify it for coverage under the trust.an agreement for payment after such time will not be eligible to receive the benefits of the trust.
at,reprinted in,emphases added.the provision thus resulted from congress explicit desire to limit its extension of trust protection to reasonably credit arrangements 
congress directed the secretary to establish the maximum time by which the parties to a transaction can agree payment must be made and still qualify for coverage under the trust.an agreement for payment after such time will not qualify for trust coverage.
current payment practices,as reflected by administrative experience and industry sources,indicate that contracts calling for payment within days from receipt and acceptance of the goods should qualify for trust coverage,and that contracts that call for later payment should not qualify for trust coverage.
trust regulations,supra.at.the primary objective of securing prompt payment was to protect sellers in this volatile industry.see,at,reprinted in,producers and shippers of perishable commodities are,for the most part,small size businesses.the process of growing,harvesting,packing and shipping perishables is a real gamble costs are high,capital is tied up in farm land and machinery,and returns are delayed until the crop is sold.if the can not realize any returns on the sale of the crop when due,he may not be able to survive.congress made its intention to protect payment arrangements clear by expressly refusing to bestow trust protection upon any credit transaction that extends beyond a reasonable period,at,reprinted in.the usda regulations tying the definition of a reasonable period to its definition of full payment promptly corroborate our interpretation.e,aa.
the question becomes,therefore,whether there is a meaningful difference between and agreements in light of this legislative history.we conclude that there is not.we recognize that a agreement is often the product of a reasonable effort by a seller to recover at least some of the debt owed to it without incurring the risks and costs of litigating under paca,and that such an agreement therefore can be a useful tool for the recovery of unpaid debts.however,the result of a agreement extending the payment period beyond thirty days is no different than that of a agreement doing the same both are inconsistent with the objective,which is fundamental to paca.whether the agreement is reached before the transaction or after a buyer has defaulted,it constitutes a credit arrangement permitting a buyer to make payments that are not considered prompt by congress and the usda.
furthermore,such credit arrangements,though intended to enable buyers who are unable to make prompt payments to stay in business,can have negative,implications 
just as in the case of the savings and loan industry,if a paca licensee is in financial difficulty,not able to pay the agreed purchase prices of perishable agricultural commodities promptly,the loss to the perishable agricultural commodities industry as a whole is frequently much less if the paca licensee license is revoked promptly.allowing a paca licensee that is in financial difficulty to remain in business increases financial risks to others.frequently,a paca licensee in financial difficulty increases its volume significantly,perhaps taking imprudent risks.if the paca licensee efforts to regain financial stability are unsuccessful,many other unsuspecting persons are exposed to the risk of nonpayment.
havana potatoes,agric.this is particularly true after a buyer has demonstrated its financial instability by defaulting on its payment obligations.therefore,congress could not have intended to exempt from disqualification sellers who enter into agreements extending a payment period beyond thirty days,while specifically disqualifying sellers who enter into agreements having the same effect.sellers who are willing and able to enter into such or need nor deserve the elevated priority they receive under paca trust provision.as the seventh circuit recently observed 
another major objective of paca is to avoid large financial collapses in the produce industry.the strict time limits are purposely designed to bring a sic dealer to the attention of the usda quickly,so that it can act to resolve the problem or suspend the dealer license.if one industry member is in financial distress,not much is at stake.but if many large wholesalers work out payment plans and extensions,allowing a dealer to amass huge liabilities,that dealer eventual bankruptcy or license revocation could cause much more severe repercussions throughout the industry.one would not want to reward the wholesalers who helped create such a mess by then giving them a strong right to recover their debts through superpriority in bankruptcy or through trust suits piercing the corporate veil.
patterson frozen foods,at see also greg orchards produce,roncone,cir by disqualifying suppliers who enter into agreements that violate paca,we can ensure that the extraordinary protection provided by paca is not enlarged beyond its intended scope.wholesale produce,noting that a primary goal of paca is that only financially responsible persons should be engaged in the businesses subject to the act quoting finer foods sales,block,alteration in original.
accordingly,we conclude that congress intention in not applying the trust to any credit transaction that extends beyond a reasonable period,at,reprinted in,is best effectuated by understanding section e of the paca regulations to be applicable to as well as agreements.
having concluded that section e applies to agreements,we must next determine whether the district court correctly rejected hsbc argument that the sellers lost trust protection by entering into a agreement with pmd that extended the payment period beyond thirty days.when it rejected this defense,the district court reasoned that although there was a written proposal by werner to pay pmd debt that pmd trust creditors orally had accepted,and although werner had performed some of his obligations under the agreement,plaintiffs never signed any written agreement under which they agreed to forebear from asserting their rights under paca.am.banana,supra,slip op.at.the district court concluded,in other words,that although the sellers and pmd had,in fact,entered into a agreement,that agreement did not disqualify the sellers from paca trust protection because it was not in writing.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court followed the approach taken by the seventh and eighth circuits,which have held that a not an agreement between a seller and a dealer that extends the dealer time for payment beyond thirty days results in the loss of the seller trust protection.see patterson frozen foods,at in re lombardo fruit produce,at hull hauser foods,cir.as the seventh circuit recently explained 
if a produce supplier enters a written agreement with a dealer that extends the dealer time for payment beyond days,the supplier becomes ineligible to assert its trust rights.on the other hand,an oral agreement for an extension or a course of dealing allowing more than days for payment will not abrogate a paca trust.
patterson frozen foods,at citations omitted under this approach,all oral agreements concerning payment periods are disregarded for purposes of paca liability,resulting in imposition of the default and preservation of trust protection for the seller.
we find nothing in the text of paca or in its regulations which requires that a provable agreement extending a payment period beyond thirty days must,without exception,be reduced to writing before it will disqualify a seller from paca trust protection.the regulations merely provide that p arties who elect to use different times of payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction.aa.in view of congress clearly expressed intention to extend trust protection solely to cash and credit transactions,see c e,aa,we can not interpret this regulation to mean that parties are free to enter into agreements that violate paca prompt payment rules as long as they do not reduce their agreements to writing.
rather,we conclude that a failure to reduce to writing an agreement that violates paca,should not result in the preservation of the trust,where the same agreement,if memorialized,would have resulted in forfeiture of such protection.to hold otherwise would yield the unacceptable result of preserving trust protection for a seller who reaches an agreement containing a payment period exceeding thirty days and performs thereunder so long as the seller does not reduce the agreement to writing.accordingly,we hold that where,as here,a seller or in a payment period exceeding thirty days,it forfeits trust protection.
even if we were to assume arguendo that a writing is required,we hold that there are writings in this case that satisfy the generally applicable statute of frauds,and that such writings are sufficient to disqualify the sellers from trust protection.see patterson frozen foods,at paca rights are lost whenever the parties enter into a written agreement that satisfies the generally applicable statute of frauds.as discussed,paca does not set out specific requirements for agreements,and under the restatement of contracts,
u nless additional requirements are prescribed by the particular statute,a contract within the statute of frauds is enforceable if it is evidenced by any writing,signed by or on behalf of the party to be charged,which 
a reasonably identifies the subject matter of the contract,
b is sufficient to indicate that a contract with respect thereto has been made between the parties or offered by the signer to the other party,and 
c states with reasonable certainty the essential terms of the unperformed promises in the contract.
restatement second of contracts see also patterson frozen foods,at concluding that paca rights are lost whenever the parties enter into a written agreement that satisfies the generally applicable statute of frauds consolidation,keybank ass n,cir an ordinary statute of frauds merely requires that the party sought to be charged sign a memorandum of the parties agreement.the memorandum need be the contract itself it need only be evidence of the contract and the contract essential terms,and the other party to the
