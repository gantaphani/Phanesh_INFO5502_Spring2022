plaintiff samuel berry appeals a judgment dismissing the action entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend demurrers to his complaint for injunctive relief based on the california consumer legal remedies act clra,california civil code section et berry contends he is entitled to seek injunctive relief under clra to enjoin enforcement of an allegedly unconscionable arbitration provision in agreements between cardholders and defendants american express services company,american express centurion bank,amex bank,and american express publishing,amex publishing collectively,amex.
section,subdivision a,proscribes specified acts or practices in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer after considering clra text and legislative history,we conclude the extension of credit,such as issuing a credit card,separate and apart from the sale or lease of any specific goods or services,does not fall within the scope of the act.accordingly,the trial court did not err in sustaining amex demurrer.because berry failed to demonstrate he could amend his complaint to state a cause of action under clra,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
berry is,and for many years has been,a holder of an american express card,for which he pays an annual fee.berry uses the card primarily for his family personal and household purposes.after berry obtained the card,amex sent him a cardholder agreement which contained a clause calling for the arbitration of all disputes,except for those brought in small claims court,and prohibited the parties from pursuing class action relief.
in the latter part of,berry began to receive a magazine published by amex publishing entitled travel leisure.although berry had never ordered travel leisure,the october statement for his amex card showed a charge for a subscription to the magazine.after calling both amex bank and amex publishing,the subscription was cancelled and the charge removed.
berry sued amex on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,contending amex charged them for magazines that were never ordered.after amex removed the case to federal court,berry withdrew all damage claims,causing the federal court to remand the case to state court for failing to meet the requirement for federal jurisdiction.see.the trial court then denied amex motion to compel arbitration on berry remaining injunctive claims.following demurrers,berry amended his complaint to state a single cause of action,which alleged the arbitration clause and class action waiver in the cardholder agreement violated clra.although the amended complaint mentioned amex sending magazines to cardholders who did not order them,the only cause of action alleged sought injunctive relief against the arbitration provision.
amex filed demurrers to the amended complaint.in opposing the demurrers,berry did not request leave to amend or demonstrate how he could amend the complaint to state a cause of action.the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend,and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.berry now appeals.

an order sustaining demurrers to class action allegations is appealable to the extent that it prevents further proceedings as a class action.wilner sunset life ins.th,fn,d.in reviewing a trial court order sustaining a demurrer,we exercise our independent judgment as to whether a cause of action has been stated as a matter of law.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.a trial court denial of leave to amend,however,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.the appellant bears the burden of proving the trial court abused its discretion by demonstrating how he could amend the complaint to state a cause of action.goodman kennedy cal d.
discussion 
the issuance of a credit card is not a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer under clra 
berry complaint alleges the arbitration clause in amex cardholder agreement is unconscionable,and thus violates section,subdivision a,which provides,in pertinent part the following unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful inserting an unconscionable provision in the contract.amex contends the statute does not apply because the issuance of a credit card to berry was not a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to a consumer we agree.
this issue is one of first impression.accordingly,our duty is to construe clra provisions to discern the legislature intent.the statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator,so we start with the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.wells learning foundation cal th,d.
section,subdivision d,provides consumer means an individual who seeks or acquires,by purchase or lease,any goods or services for personal,family,or household purposes.the complaint alleges an amex card qualifies as a good or service as used in section,subdivision d.we disagree 
section,subdivision a,provides goods means tangible chattels bought or leased for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,including certificates or coupons exchangeable for these goods,and including goods that,at the time of the sale or subsequently,are to be so affixed to real property as to become a part of real property,whether or not they are severable from the real property.the extension of credit is not a tangible chattel.true,a plastic credit card is tangible.but the card has no intrinsic value and exists only as indicia of the credit extended to the card holder.berry amex card is thus not a good under clra.
we now turn to whether amex issuance of credit constitutes a service under clra.section,subdivision b provides services means work,labor,and services for other than a commercial or business use,including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.berry argues that credit furnished by amex constitutes services furnished in connection with the sale of goods because the cardholder may use the credit provided to purchase goods.berry explains after all a consumer can not hire a car,reserve airline tickets,stay in a hotel,or make purchases on the internet without a credit card.a review of clra legislative history,however,does not support the notion that credit,separate and apart from a specific purchase or lease of a good or service,is covered under the act.
