before escrow closed on the sale of a developed parcel of real property,california national bank bank sent a letter to the escrow agent handling the sale stating that it had received payoff funds for the secured promissory note that it then held.the trial court interpreted that letter as a payoff demand statement under civil code section concluded that bank had made a binding acknowledgement that its outstanding note had been paid off,and held that bank secured interest in the property had been extinguished.
in this appeal by bank from the resulting adverse summary judgment,we must determine first whether,as a matter of law,the letter actually meets the statutory requirements of a payoff demand statement.if not,we must then consider whether the parties reasonably could have relied on the contents of that letter to close escrow.as will be discussed,we conclude that,as a matter of law,bank letter was not a payoff demand statement.the use of the term payoff funds in the letter was not sufficient to transform a letter advising the escrow agent of the status of the transaction into a payoff demand statement binding on the bank.we further conclude that there exists triable issues of fact as to whether the parties could reasonably have relied on the letter to close escrow when that letter is read together with proffered evidence of contemporaneous oral communications between the parties,and the pertinent escrow instructions.we therefore reverse the judgment entered in favor of defendants steven havis et hereafter,lender defendants after the trial court granted their motion for summary judgment on bank complaint to establish and enforce its priority security interest in the subject real property.
factual and procedural background 
this case involves a dispute between bank and lender defendants over the priority of their respective liens on a parcel of developed real property located in beverly hills property.bank claims that it has a first priority secured interest in the property and filed an action against lender defendants,alleging causes of action for specific performance of its deed of trust,appointment of receiver,judicial foreclosure,breach of written contract,imposition of a constructive trust,and for money had and received.lender defendants responded,claiming that they hold the only secured interest in the property and filed a verified for declaratory relief,quiet title,cancellation of instruments,injunctive relief,and slander of title.thereafter,lender defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the complaint and on their.the evidence submitted in support of,and in opposition to,those motions for summary judgment was undisputed and revealed the following 
the original transaction and bank deed of trust on the property 
in october,bank predecessor in interest loaned joseph keyshawn johnson johnson million johnson loan to buy the property where johnson operated a restaurant.the loan was secured by a first deed of trust on the property in favor of bank bank deed of trust.a month after the purchase,johnson conveyed the property to keyshawn,a nevada corporation keyshawn.
the sale of property to icmg 
in june,johnson entered into an agreement to sell the property to investor capital management group,icmg for million and opened an escrow with wilshire escrow company wilshire escrow.icmg obtained financing for this purchase from gold mountain financial institution,gold mountain.gold mountain agreed to finance the sale on the express written condition that its loan would be a lien in first priority on the property.
gold mountain gave escrow instructions to wilshire escrow stating that b y accepting these instructions,you agree that you will follow each of the requirements and instructions set forth below.the escrow instructions provided do not record if you are aware of any liens which affect the subject property,other than liens expressly agreed to herein,which are not paid in full in escrow and which are not cleared of record.italics added.
a.the june,payoff demand statement 
on june,before escrow closed,bank prepared a payoff demand statement for johnson financial advisers.wilshire escrow also received a copy.this statement provided a breakdown of the sums owing under the johnson loan,including principal,interest,and loan fees,which totaled.it also included the required per diem interest amount and stated that it would expire in days.bank,however,did not receive funds to pay off the johnson loan within the period.
bank sent the parties a letter indicating that it had received funds outside of escrow to pay off the johnson loan 
on july,icmg delivered a check to one of bank branches in the amount of,which purported to pay off the johnson loan.five days later,on july,bank employee cleo douglas douglas sent,via facsimile,a letter to wilshire escrow stating that bank had received payoff funds outside of escrow for the johnson loan douglas letter.the douglas letter stated in pertinent part 
this letter is to verify that california national bank received payoff funds for the above referenced loan on july,in the amount of.
it is our policy to issue the full reconveyance,days after receipt of the pay off check.therefore,a full reconveyance will be sent to the county recorders on or about august.
wilshire escrow and gold mountain response to bank letter 
both the escrow agent and gold mountain responded to the douglas letter.the escrow agent testified that e veryone was totally aghast at the prospect that the buyer icmg was paying off this existing first trust deed loan,so everyone was on heightened alert.wilshire escrow agent testified that after he received douglas letter,he called her to confirm that bank had been paid off.
douglas declaration,which for purposes of summary judgment we accept as true,recalls the conversation with the escrow agent this way during that telephone conversation,i restated and to him,the escrow agent that the underlying note had not been satisfied since the check tendered to california national bank had not been cleared and good funds had not been collected.furthermore,i told him at that time that california national bank would not forward for recording a reconveyance of its deed of trust securing repayment of the note with joseph keyshawn johnson until such time as the note was paid in full with good,that the check tendered to california national bank was collected upon and monies deposited with california national bank.italics added.
on that same day,july,gold mountain also learned about the purported pay off of the johnson loan.counsel for gold mountain sent a facsimile to wilshire escrow stating its concern that the escrow agent confirm that gold mountain deed would be in first position.gold mountain counsel stated in the facsimile we have no way to verify that the if sic fact prepaid the people bank loan.normally,the title company handles loan.i am writing to inform you of the above information because my client expects to receive a policy of title insurance from your firm insuring my client loan as a first deed of trust,and my client felt it important to inform you of the above facts.
for reasons not reflected in the record,two days later,on july,gold mountain deposited million into escrow icmg executed a promissory note to gold mountain to be secured by a deed of trust on the property gold mountain deed of trust.
on august,escrow closed on the property without receiving from bank a reconveyance of its then existing first trust deed apparently in direct contradiction to existing escrow instructions from gold mountain and its counsel written restatement of those instructions,wilshire escrow recorded the gold mountain deed of trust and the grant deed transferring title to the property and restaurant from keyshawn to icmg and transferred the million received from gold mountain.
bank notified the parties that the check to pay off the johnson loan was not honored and bank had not received good funds 
the check icmg tendered to bank on july,did not clear and the funds needed to pay off the johnson loan were never collected.on august,the date on which the douglas letter stated that bank would have reconveyed its deed of trust,bank sent a letter to johnson financial advisers entitled updated demand for payoff.the august,payoff demand statement stated that the johnson loan had not been paid.wilshire escrow agent was aware of this updated payoff demand statement and understood it to mean that icmg check to pay off the johnson loan had not cleared and that bank had reopened the loan.on september,about one month after bank notified the parties that the johnson loan had not been paid off,gold mountain assigned its deed of trust to lender defendants.
on september,bank sent a letter to johnson informing him that the obligation secured by bank deed of trust had not been satisfied,that the icmg transaction was void,and that if bank did not receive funds by october,it intended to commence foreclosure proceedings.
bank initiated foreclosure proceedings and lender defendants moved for summary judgment 
on october,bank filed this action against lender defendants,who,in turn,filed a verified against bank bank also sought and obtained a receiver for the property and restaurant.the trial court issued a temporary restraining order in aid of the receiver,which prevented lender defendants from selling,transferring,disposing,encumbering,or concealing the property without a prior court order and doing any act that will impair the preservation of the property or plaintiff interest in the property.in confirming the appointment of the receiver,on december,the trial court issued a preliminary injunction continuing these restraints.
two months after bank filed its complaint,lender defendants brought motions for summary judgment on bank complaint and on their.they contended that bank could not succeed on any of its causes of action because it had no lien on the property,and that lender defendants had the only secured interest in the property.in their motions,lender defendants characterized the douglas letter as an update of the june,payoff demand statement,which,in their view,committed bank to the proposition that there was nothing due and owing on the johnson loan.lender defendants argued that bank only recourse for any mistake or misstatement in the douglas letter was to file an action against johnson as an unsecured creditor.
the trial court took the matter under submission and later granted summary judgment in favor of lender defendants.it first concluded that the douglas letter was a payoff demand statement.its written minute order states the letter from california national bank was clear,unambiguous,it came from the bank,it was a letter and constituted an unequivocal demand.the trial court further concluded that any amendment to a payoff demand statement had to be communicated in writing under section,subdivision d,and could not be changed or amended by an oral conversation,apparently referring to douglas subsequent communication with the escrow agent.therefore,absent a written amendment,according to the trial court,the parties could reasonably rely on the douglas letter showing a zero balance on the johnson loan to close escrow based on bank representation that it had received payoff funds.because the escrow agent could reasonably rely on the douglas letter,the trial court reasoned that it was irrelevant that bank had received a payoff check that was later dishonored.the trial court concluded that bank had,in effect,understated the amount owed in an amended payoff demand statement.relying on freedom financial thrift loan golden pacific bank th,d freedom financial,disapproved on other grounds in ghirardo antonioli cal th,fn,d,the trial court extinguished bank lien,holding that bank had no more than an unsecured interest and its only recourse was to recover the balance from the borrower,johnson.
thereafter,the trial court took lender defendants motion for summary judgment off calendar,and ultimately dismissed lender defendants.both parties appealed 
lender defendants unsuccessfully attempted to foreclose on the property 
following the court ruling granting summary judgment,lender defendants noticed a trustee sale to foreclose on the gold mountain deed of trust.bank filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order preventing the foreclosure sale,arguing the preliminary injunction prevented lender defendants from foreclosing on the property.lender defendants,in turn,sought ex parte relief to dissolve the preliminary injunction preventing them from foreclosing on the property.the trial court denied bank ex parte application but granted the one lender defendants submitted.the trial court dissolved the preliminary injunction,effective may.
on may,bank filed a petition for writ of supersedeas with this court to prevent the imminent foreclosure of the property.on may,we stayed all proceedings pending further order of the court.we stated the stay includes prohibition of the sale,transfer,or encumbrance of the subject property in any manner whatsoever.on july,after further briefing,we granted bank petition for a writ of supersedeas pending the outcome of this appeal 
contentions 
bank contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the douglas letter was not a payoff demand statement and therefore could not extinguish its secured interest in the property.bank asserts that based on the douglas letter,douglas declaration,and the escrow instructions,there are triable issue of facts bearing on whether wilshire escrow could rely on the douglas letter to close escrow,and whether bank holds a first priority lien on the property.
discussion 
summary judgment law and standard of review 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a triable issue of material fact exists only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fn.omitted.if a party moving for summary judgment would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.id.at,d.lender defendants,as the moving parties bear the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at,d.lender defendants also bear the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing.ibid.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.id.at,d.
in reviewing an order granting a motion for summary judgment,we independently review the record to determine whether there are triable issues of material fact.kids universe th,d.in doing so,we view the parties evidentiary submissions in a light most favorable to bank as the losing party.ibid.as we explain,based on this standard,we conclude that triable issues of fact exist precluding summary judgment on bank complaint.
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the douglas letter is not a payoff demand statement 
bank contends that the douglas letter was not a payoff demand statement and could not be the basis upon which the trial court extinguished its lien on the property.we agree.the trial court misapplied the statute the douglas letter is not a payoff demand statement.
statutory definition of a payoff demand statement 
section defines the procedures to pay off a secured loan and establish es a mechanism by which an entitled person may obtain information regarding the status of an obligation secured by a deed of trust or mortgage.freedom financial,supra,th at,d.we are concerned here with the provisions in the statute that describe the type of information that a beneficiary must provide in a payoff demand statement,how a beneficiary must communicate an amendment to a payoff demand statement,and who may rely on a payoff demand statement.while other cases have addressed the latter point and discuss the beneficiary remedies in the event of a mistake in a payoff demand statement,this case is the first,to our knowledge,that addresses the first two points,that is,what is,and is not,a payoff demand statement or an amended payoff demand statement.three subdivisions of section are relevant to this discussion.
section,subdivision a,provides in pertinent part that a payoff demand statement means a written statement prepared in response to a written demand made by an entitled person or authorized agent,setting forth the amounts required as of the date of preparation by the beneficiary,to fully satisfy all obligations secured by the loan that is the subject of the payoff demand statement.the written statement shall include information reasonably necessary to calculate the payoff amount on a per diem basis for the period of time,not to exceed days,during which the per diem amount is not changed by the terms of the note.
section,subdivision d,provides that a beneficiary statement or payoff demand statement may be relied upon by the entitled person or his or her authorized agent in accordance with its terms,including with respect to the payoff demand statement reliance for the purpose of establishing the amount necessary to pay the obligation in full.if the beneficiary notifies the entitled person or his or her authorized agent of any amendment to the statement,then the amended statement may be relied upon by the entitled person or his or her authorized agent as provided in this subdivision.
subdivision d of section sets forth the procedure for amending the payoff demand statement.it states if notification of any amendment to the statement is not given in writing,then a written amendment to the statement shall be delivered to the entitled person or his or her authorized agent no later than the next business day after notification.ibid.
b.the douglas letter informed the parties of the status of the transaction,not the amounts owing to pay off the johnson loan 
the douglas letter does not satisfy the statutory requirements of a payoff demand statement,and it can not properly be so construed,subd.a.it did not advise the borrower of the sums needed to pay off the loan,nor did it provide a per diem interest rate as required under the statute.the douglas letter states that bank had received payoff funds for the johnson loan in the amount of.it also said,in the second paragraph,that no reconveyance could be recorded an express requirement of gold mountain escrow instructions until days after receipt of the payoff check.in this context,the phrase payoff funds was not used as a term of art but was used to inform the escrow agent of an event not contemplated by the escrow instructions that is,the receipt outside of escrow of a check purporting to pay off the johnson loan.
our conclusion that the douglas letter is not a payoff demand statement is consistent with the purpose of section,subdivision a.that subdivision sets forth the necessary requirements of the payoff demand statement so that a borrower who desires to pay off a mortgage in full will know the exact amount due on the loan on a specific date.the statute permits the borrower to rely on that payoff demand statement,subd.d,and that if the amount in the payoff demand statement is understated,for whatever reason,the beneficiary recourse is to recover any sums still owing from the borrower as an unsecured debt,subd.d freedom financial,supra,th at,d see also cathay bank fidelity nat.title ins.th,d.the statute benefits the borrower.it does not state that any person can rely on a payoff demand statement for purposes of establishing whether the amount necessary to pay the obligation in full have in fact been satisfied.thus,this statutory framework,is not intended,in our view,to apply to a situation such as the one here,where the douglas letter not only did not meet the statutory requirements of a payoff demand statement but was not intended to inform the borrower of the amount necessary to satisfy his obligation.the douglas letter instead provided information to the concerned escrow agent as to an unanticipated outside of escrow development with respect to the johnson loan.
we acknowledge that by the use of the term payoff funds the douglas letter is imprecise and ambiguous,but that does not mean that we should read it as a payoff demand statement as lender defendants suggest.lender defendants assert that the use of the phrase payoff funds,followed by the amount received,indicated to the escrow agent that there was a zero balance due and owing on the johnson loan.that reading,however,is not justified given the entirety of the letter and the factual context in which it was submitted.we emphasize that the douglas letter states that bank had received a pay off check and would issue a full reconveyance of the deed of trust days after the check cleared.this is not a necessary requirement of a payoff demand statement,nor are such words normally found in a payoff demand statement.more importantly,nothing in this letter could be relied upon to justify the closing of the escrow prior to august.
for this reason,lender defendants reliance on cases discussing the remedy for an understated or mistaken payoff demand statement is misplaced.see cathay bank fidelity,supra,th at,d freedom financial thrift loan golden pacific bank,supra,th at,d.the douglas letter was not a payoff demand statement and can not be the basis for extinguishing bank lien on the property.under these circumstances,section,subdivision d,setting forth the available remedy for an understated payoff demand statement,has no application.bank remedy is not limited to an action against the borrower as an unsecured creditor 
c.the douglas declaration did not constitute an amendment to the payoff demand statement 
lender defendants moved to exclude douglas declaration in which she testified regarding her subsequent conversation with the escrow agent because,in their view,her testimony was tantamount to an attempt to make an oral amendment to a payoff demand statement,and any such amendment had to be in writing under section,subdivision d the trial court did not specifically rule on this objection but implicitly rejected the douglas declaration and relied instead on the douglas letter.douglas declaration provided relevant evidence as to the purpose and intent of the douglas letter and the fact that such information had been communicated to wilshire escrow prior to the august close of escrow.given that her declaration was offered in opposition to a motion for summary judgment,it was relevant to demonstrate the existence of unresolved issues of fact.her testimony was undisputed and it should not have been excluded.
as stated,section permits a lender to amend a payoff demand statement.if the amendment is not in writing,then a written amendment to the statement shall be delivered no later than the next business day after notification,subd.d.
douglas declaration does not memorialize an oral amendment to a payoff demand statement for the obvious reason that the douglas letter was not a payoff demand statement.moreover,douglas testimony does not attempt to amend the amount stated in her letter but simply sought to clarify bank position regarding the status of the johnson loan and to inform the parties of the procedure bank would follow to reconvey its deed of trust after confirming receipt of good funds.finally,section,subdivision d,requiring an amendment to be in writing,is not a rule of evidence upon which the testimony could have been excluded.for all of these reasons,the trial court erred in failing to consider the douglas declaration when ruling on the summary judgment motion.
there is a question of fact as to whether the parties could reasonably rely on the douglas letter to close escrow 
in granting summary judgment,the trial court concluded that the douglas letter was clear and unambiguous and that as a matter of law bank was equitably estopped from asserting that it had a first deed of trust on the property because wilshire escrow and gold mountain detrimentally relied on the douglas letter to close escrow.we disagree.
equitable estoppel requires that the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall
