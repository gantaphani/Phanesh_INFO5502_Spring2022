background 
this case arises from a conflict between two sovereigns attempts to combat poverty within their borders.native american tribes have long suffered from a dearth of economic opportunities.plaintiffs in this case,the otoe missouria tribe of indians,the lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians,and wholly owned corporations of those tribes collectively,the lenders,established lending companies in the hopes of reaching consumers who had difficulty obtaining credit at favorable rates but who would never venture to a remote reservation.the loans were made at high interest rates,and the loans permitted the lenders to make automatic deductions from the borrowers bank accounts to recover interest and principle.new york has long outlawed usurious loans.dfs aggressively enforced those laws in order to protect desperately poor people from the consequences of their own desperation.schneider phelps.thus,the tribes and new york interests collided.
it is unclear,however,where they new york or on a native american reservation.the lenders assert that the challenged transactions occurred on reservations.the loan application process took place via website s owned and controlled by the tribe s.loans were reviewed and assessed by tribal loan underwriting system s.loans complied with rules developed,adopted,and administered by tribal regulatory authorities.the loans were funded out of tribally owned bank accounts.and each loan application notified borrowers that the contract was governed only by the laws of the tribe and such federal law as is applicable under the indian commerce clause of the united states constitution and a s such,neither we nor this agreement are subject to any other federal or state law or regulation.in sum,as the chairman of the lac vieux desert tribe explained in an affidavit,t hrough technological aids and underwriting software,loans are approved through processes that occur on the reservation in various forms.
but loans approved on native american reservations and other locations flowed across borders to consumers in new york.new york borrowers never traveled to tribal lands or other jurisdictions they signed loan contracts remotely by keying in an electronic signature.borrowers listed their new york addresses on applications,and provided lenders with routing information for their personal bank accounts in new york.moreover,the lenders did more than simply transfer loan proceeds into new york bank accounts.under the terms of the loans,the lenders reached into new york to collect payments the lenders placed a hold on borrowers accounts that resulted in an automatic debit every two weeks over the course of many months the harm inflicted by these loans fell upon customers in new york dfs received complaints from residents faltering under the weight of interest rates as high as percent as one complaint explained,i am attempting to get out of a hole,not dig a deeper one.
thus,both the tribes and new york believed that the loans fell within their domain,both geographic and regulatory,and acted accordingly.the tribes profits into their communities,and new york authorities began an investigation into online payday lending.in the summer of,those initiatives clashed.
in august,dfs launched what the tribal lenders describe as a campaign explicitly designed to destroy tribal enterprises,and what new york defends as a comprehensive effort to determine how best to protect new yorkers from the harmful effects of usurious online payday loans.at issue are two related mailings.
first,dfs sent letters to online payday lenders that it had identified as having made loans to new york residents.its efforts were directed generally at such lenders,including not only tribal lenders,but also foreign lenders and lenders headquartered in states that do not cap interest rates on loans.the letters accused lenders of using the internet to offer and originate illegal payday loans to new york consumers,in violation of new york civil and criminal usury laws.the letters instructed lenders to confirm in writing within fourteen days that they were no longer solicit ing or mak ing usurious loans in new york.
second,dfs wrote to the lenders partners in the financial services industry.the lenders relied on outside banks to hold money and transfer it to customers.those banks,in turn,depended upon an electronic wire service called the automated clearing house ach to move money from their coffers into borrowers accounts,and to extract repayment from those accounts.dfs letters solicited banks and ach for their cooperative effort s to stamp out these pernicious,illegal payday loans.in the letters sent to banks,dfs warned that it was in the bank interest to take appropriate action to help ensure that it is not serving as a pipeline for illegal conduct.it urged the banks to work with the agency to create a new set of model safeguards and procedures to ach access to the payday lenders that had lent money to new york customers.doing so,the letter counseled,was in the best interest of your member banks and their customers.the letters ended with a request that the companies meet with new york officials to discuss a cooperative undertaking.
according to plaintiffs,dfs outreach had immediate and devastating effects on tribal lenders.banks and ach abruptly ended their relationships with the lenders,stymieing their transactions not just with new york borrowers,but with consumers in every other state in the union.without revenue from lending,the tribes faced large gaps in their budgets.according to the chairman of the otoe missouria tribe,proceeds from lending account for almost half of the tribe income.profits from lending have fueled expansion of tribal early childhood education programs,employment training,healthcare coverage,and child and family protection services.the chairman of the lac vieux desert tribe attested to similar fiscal reliance,noting that lending revenue supports tribal housing initiatives,youth programs,health and wellness services,and law enforcement.
faced with crumbling businesses and collapsing budgets,plaintiffs filed suit,claiming that new york efforts to curb the lenders online business violated the indian commerce clause of the federal constitution by infringing on tribes fundamental right to.plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction barring dfs from further interfering with the lenders transactions with consumers in new york and elsewhere.the district court denied the motion.the court found that the lenders had built a wobbly foundation for their contention that the state is regulating activity that occurs on the tribes lands,and concluded that new york action was directed at activity that took place entirely off tribal land,involving new york residents who never leave new york state.otoe missouria tribe of indians state dep t of fin,d.thus,the court held that new york acted within its rights to regulate business activity within the state.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
preliminary injunctions standard for granting,standard of review 
a district court denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.wpix,ivi,cir.in general,district courts may grant a preliminary injunction where a plaintiff demonstrates irreparable harm and meets one of two related standards either a a likelihood of success on the merits,or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them fair ground for litigation,plus a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party.lynch city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this rule,however,is subject to an exception a plaintiff can not rely on the alternative to challenge governmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme.plaza health,perales,cir relying on union carbide agric.prods.costle,cir and med.soc y of toia,cir.as we have explained,t his exception reflects the idea that governmental policies implemented through legislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic processes are entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined lightly.able united states,cir.
dfs attempt to curb online payday lending in new york was a paradigmatic example of governmental action taken in the public interest,plaza health,at,one that vindicated proven policies implemented through legislation or regulations.able,at.new york usury prohibitions date back to the late century.new york enacted the current cap percent interest on loans made by,unlicensed lenders decades ago.see banking law a mckinney noting original enactment date of.new york courts have consistently upheld and enforced such laws as the new york court of appeals wrote in,usury laws protect impoverished debtors from improvident transactions drawn by lenders and brought on by dire personal financial stress.schneider,at.new york regulatory authorities,both at the behest of successive attorneys general and now the superintendent of financial services have pursued businesses that lent money at interest rates above the legal limit.see,press release,new york state office of the attorney general,spitzer not preempted in suit to stop illegal payday lending scheme may,available at describing lawsuit brought by former attorney general eliot spitzer.although plaintiffs argue that new york lacks the authority to enforce its laws against tribal lenders and they may be right in the end,there is no question as to what those laws require.
for this reason,plaintiffs must establish a likelihood of success on the merits to win injunctive relief at this early stage.our decision in haitian centers council,mcnary,cir,is not to the contrary.there,we upheld an order enjoining the immigration and nationalization service ins from limiting haitian asylum applicants contact with counsel while they were detained at guantanamo bay.id.at.we did so even though the plaintiffs demonstrated only a fair ground for litigation rather than a likelihood of success on the merits.id.at.the government could not identify any specific statute or regulation that allowed it to deny counsel to applicants at their screening interviews a top official had announced the policy in a memo in response to a flood of applicants following a coup.the agency sought to moor its policy choice in the broad grant of authority in the immigration and nationality act to screen emigrants.id.we deemed that too general an authority to trigger the higher standard for a preliminary injunction.id.we believe that in litigation such as is presented herein,we explained,no party has an exclusive claim on the public interest.id.the likelihood of success prong,we held,need not always be followed merely because a movant seeks to enjoin government action.id.
this case is distinguishable from haitian centers council in two respects.first,dfs acted to enforce a rule embodied in a specific statute.in contrast,the ins enforced a much more informal policy,hastily adopted without the benefit of either specific statutory instructions or regulations issued after a public process.second,new york view of the public interest has been defined and reaffirmed by all three branches of government for many years.unlike the novel issue presented by haitian detainees seeking counsel while they awaited transfer to the continental united states,new york long ago confronted and answered the policy question posed in this case whether businesses should be allowed to make,loans to those with an acute liquidity problem but no credit with which to solve it.thus,the full play of the democratic process involving both the legislative and executive branches has produced a policy in the name of the public interest embodied in a statute and implementing regulations.able,at.that policy is entitled to a higher degree of deference than a private party position would merit,and we must be sure that,in all likelihood,new york has acted unlawfully before we substitute our judgment for that of the political branches.id.
we recognize that the plaintiffs argument that there are public interests on both sides in this case,is not without force.the tribes are independent nations,and new york regulatory efforts may hinder the tribes ability to provide for their members and manage their own internal affairs.but as we explained in oneida nation of cuomo,cir,a party seeking to enjoin governmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme can not rely on the fair ground for litigation alternative even if that party seeks to vindicate a sovereign or public interest.id.at holding that oneida nation must prove a likelihood of success on the merits to merit a preliminary injunction enjoining new york from enforcing tax scheme on the tribe cigarette sales.despite the possibly serious intrusion on tribal interests posed by this case,the plaintiffs must still meet the higher standard 
ii.likelihood of success on the merits 
plaintiffs claim that dfs infringed upon tribal sovereignty in two ways.they argue that new york had no authority to order tribes to stop issuing loans originated on native american reservations,and that new york regulated activity far outside its borders when it launched a campaign to shut down tribal lending in every state in the union.but to prove either of these claims,plaintiffs had to demonstrate that the challenged transactions occurred somewhere other than new york,and,if they occurred on reservations,that the tribes had a substantial interest in the lending businesses.as described below,the district court reasonably concluded that plaintiffs failed to do so.
a.the who,where,and what of the indian commerce clause 
indian commerce clause jurisprudence balances two conflicting principles.on the one hand,native americans retain the right to make their own laws and be ruled by them.williams lee.on the other,tribes are only their sovereign authority is an anomalous one and of a complex character,mcclanahan state tax comm of,d,because tribes remain ultimately dependent on and subject to the broad power of congress,white mountain apache tribe bracker,d.with these two principles in mind,the supreme court has held that states may regulate tribal activities,but only in a limited manner,one constrained by tribes fundamental right to,and congress robust power to manage tribal affairs id.at.that delicate balance results in an idiosyncratic doctrinal regime,one that,as the ninth circuit has described,requires careful attention to the factual setting of state regulation of tribal activity.barona band of mission indians yee,cir.
the breadth of a state regulatory power depends upon two criteria the location of the targeted conduct and the citizenship of the participants in that activity.native americans going beyond the reservation boundaries must comply with state laws as long as those laws are and otherwise applicable to all citizens of that state.mescalero apache tribe jones,d mescalero i.for example,in mescalero i,the supreme court held that new mexico could collect sales and use taxes from a ski resort owned by a native american tribe that was located outside a reservation borders.id.at.every business in the state had to pay the tax,and the indian commerce clause did not create an exception to that rule.
but once a state reaches across a reservation borders its power diminishes and courts must weigh the interests of each sovereign the tribes,the federal government,and the state in the conduct targeted by the state regulation.the scales will tip according to the citizenship of the participants in the conduct.as the supreme court explained in bracker,w hen conduct involving only indians is at issue,state law is generally inapplicable,for the state regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal is at its strongest.at.a state interest waxes,however,if the conduct of is in question.id.a court conducts a more particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake.id.at.in bracker,the supreme court engaged in that particularized inquiry and held that arizona could not impose fuel and use taxes on a hauler moving timber across a reservation.although arizona wished to raise revenue,the federal government and the tribe shared commitment to the continued growth and productivity of tribal logging enterprises outweighed arizona interest.
thus,the who and the where of the challenged regulation have significant consequences,ones that are often dispositive.wagnon prairie band potawatomi nation,u.and even when the who and where are clear,a court must still understand what a regulation targets to weigh interests appropriately.a tribe interest peaks when a regulation threatens a venture in which the tribe has invested significant resources.in new mexico mescalero apache tribe,d mescalero ii,the supreme court held that a state could not enforce its hunting laws against sportsmen who hunted and fished on a reservation.id.at.the tribe had engaged in a concerted and sustained undertaking to develop and manage the reservation wildlife and land resources,and state regulations threatened to unsettle and supplant those investments.id.
four years later,the court echoed that conclusion in california cabazon band of mission indians,d.there,the court permitted native american tribes to continue operating bingo games without complying with california gambling restrictions,even though the tribes catered their games to american customers.the tribes had built modern,comfortable,clean,and attractive facilities,and developed rules and procedures to ensure games.those sunk costs were a substantial interest that outweighed california interest in curbing organized crime infiltration of the tribal games.id.at.
in contrast,a tribe has no legitimate interest in selling an opportunity to evade state law.in washington confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation,d,the supreme court held that tribal stores had to collect a state tax on cigarettes sold to american customers.id.at.all the smokeshops offer ed to customers,that was not available elsewhere,was solely an exemption from state taxation.id.at.w hether stated in terms of,tribal,or otherwise,tribes did not have any legitimate interest in market ing an exemption from state taxation to persons who would normally do their business elsewhere.id.
factual questions,then,pervade every step of the analysis required by the indian commerce clause.a court must know who a regulation targets and where the targeted activity takes place.only then can it either test for discriminatory laws,as in mescalero i,or balance competing interests,as in bracker.and even if a court knows enough to trigger a weighing of competing interests,a court must still know what the nature of those interests are.only then can it assess whether a regulation threatens a significant investment,as in mescalero ii and cabazon,or whether a tribe has merely masked a legal loophole in the cloak of tribal sovereignty,as in colville.given the nature of these inquiries,it is no surprise that,as detailed below,plaintiffs have failed to prove a likelihood of success on the merits at this early stage of the litigation.
b.the ambiguity of internet loans and cooperative campaigns 
loans brokered over the internet seem to exist in two places at once.lenders extend credit from reservations borrowers apply for and receive loans without leaving new york state.neither our court nor the supreme court has confronted a hybrid transaction like the loans at issue here,that straddles borders and connects parties separated by hundreds of miles.we need not resolve that novel question today the answer will depend on facts brought to light over the course of litigation.on the record now before us,plaintiffs have not offered sufficient proof of the who,where,and what of the challenged loans.without knowing more facts,we can not say that the district court unreasonably concluded that new york regulated transactions brokered entirely off tribal land,or that district court erred when,relying on that conclusion,it held that new york treatment of payday lenders did not violate the indian commerce clause.otoe missouria tribe of indians,d at.
first,plaintiffs claim that new york had no authority to demand that the lenders cease and desist from extending loans to new york residents.at the outset,we note that even if these letters,which were sent to tribal lenders among other payday lenders,constitute attempted regulation of activities,plaintiffs do not allege that the letters caused them harm the damage to their business derived not from the letter,which plaintiffs appear to have ignored,but from actions discussed below that allegedly caused the tribal lenders banking partners to cease doing business with them.
in any event,plaintiffs provided insufficient evidence to establish that they are likely to succeed in showing that the internet loans should be treated as activity.as the district court noted,plaintiffs built a wobbly foundation for their contention that new york regulat ed activity that occur ed on the tribes lands.id.the lenders affidavits boldly but conclusorily assert that loans are approved through processes that occur on reservation s,but nowhere do they state what specific portion of a lending transaction took place at any facility physically located on a reservation.plaintiffs averred that loans were processed through website s owned and controlled by the tribes,but never identified the citizenship of the personnel who manage the websites,where they worked,or where the servers hosting the websites were located.loans were approved by a tribal loan underwriting system,a vague description that could refer to the efforts of native american actuaries working on a reservation,but could also refer to myriad other systems software developed and administered by an company,paid consultants located anywhere in the world,or any number of other arrangements.loans were funded out of tribally owned bank accounts,but those accounts were apparently held in,and perhaps funded by,banks the necessary involvement of financial institutions is the very basis of plaintiffs claim that their business collapsed when banks pulled out of the payday lending business after receiving new york letter.thus,even if we agreed that new york customers traveled elsewhere when they opened an internet browser,the lenders failed to establish where those customers metaphorically went,and who exactly approved their loans.
the complexities introduced by modern electronic commercial transactions also weaken plaintiffs arguments.much of the commercial activity at issue takes place in new york.that is where the borrower is located the borrower seeks the loan without ever leaving the state,and certainly without traveling to the reservation.even if we concluded that a loan is made where it is approved,the
