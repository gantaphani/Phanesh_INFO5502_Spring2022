our jurisdiction is proper pursuant to.for the following reasons,we affirm.
we review,as summarily as possible,the somewhat complicated factual background behind the deal leading up to first union receipt of the check at issue,as this background is relevant to our disposition of the case.
scadif,a french company,is a buying cooperative that purchases and supplies goods to hypermarket stores in paris,france.in the early,scadif anticipated a change in a french law that limited the retail sales of parapharmaceuticals to licensed pharmacies.scadif arranged for a company,to purchase parapharmaceuticals on its behalf by misrepresenting that the goods would be sold outside of france.through,scadif purchased more than million worth of products.
in,with no change in the law having occurred.agreed to repurchase the parapharmaceuticals and reimburse scadif for its shipping and storage costs.to facilitate this repurchase.obtained a loan from a swiss bank.the swiss bank made the loan after,at scadif request,banque francaise,a french bank with whom scadif had a previous relationship,guaranteed the loan.scadif in turn guaranteed banque francaise obligation to the swiss bank.
in order to meet its obligation to the swiss bank,inter alia.obtained a loan commitment from ameriplex group,ameriplex,a canadian corporation.however,ameriplex never funded the loan,despite its repeated promises to do so,as described below.
in november,ameriplex commenced a serious of contacts with scadif banque francaise assuring imminent funding.by letter dated january,ameriplex notified banque francaise that the promised funding had been delayed by unforeseen changes beyond our control.ameriplex copied scadif on this letter.
on january,banque francaise was forced to honor its guarantee,as.was unable to repay the swiss bank.banque francaise debited scadif account for the amount it paid.finally,on april,ameriplex sent scadif a check for check along with the check,ameriplex sent a letter providing that scadif had agreed to retain the cheque and not deposit same.scadif complied with these conditions for three and months.
during this three and month period,on april,ameriplex sent a order on the check.the record shows that the average daily balance of the account on which the check was drawn was from inception.on may,ameriplex informed banque francaise via letter that ameriplex unidentified lender had attempted to transfer funds into the account,but that the federal reserve had imposed a hold.banque francaise informed scadif of this communication.on may,ameriplex wrote banque francaise again,stating that it would exhibit proof of funds by may this did not occur.similar communications continued.on june,ameriplex sent a letter to,copying both banque francaise and scadif,stating that ameriplex president,peter giannotti giannotti,would arrive in paris on june to settle ameriplex obligations.giannotti did not appear in paris,and ameriplex never provided proof of funds to banque francaise or scadif.
on july,one month after giannotti failure to show,scadif sent the check to banque francaise via regular mail.included with the check was a letter directed to banque francaise international department providing this confirm s our telephone conversation of today whereby we instructed you to send for collection the ameriplex group,april,check in the amount of.
banque francaise did not provisionally credit the check to scadif account and never extended any credit or payment thereon to scadif.rather,banque francaise separated the check from other checks it received that were drawn on united states banks.it sent the check individually to first union via airborne express along with a form letter collection letter identifying the transaction as a collection payable abroad.
the collection letter provided that the check was being sent for collection,identified ameriplex as the drawee from whom payment should be obtained,requested payment or notice of dishonor,and requested payment of banque francaise fees.the collection letter also required first union to respond to banque francaise via swift,a telex system used for international bank communications.the collection letter recognized that first union would assess fees for the collection service,and it instructed first union to collect these fees directly from the drawee,ameriplex.banque francaise did not,as it does with most checks drawn on a united states bank,forward the check to its correspondent united states bank,citibank of new york,for processing through the federal reserve system.instead,it sent the check as a item directly to first union.
banque francaise sent the check and the collection letter addressed to first union national bank of florida,sarasota,florida,as this was the only address provided on the check.see supra.at this time,first union had two branches located in the zip code,each operating separately one in armands armands branch and one in center city center city branch.ameriplex account was held at the armands branch however,as the routing slip did not specify a branch,airborne express delivered the check to the center city branch.
the check arrived at the city center branch on july.due to human error,the check was not sent,as it should have been,to first union international operations department international operations.on july,banque francaise sent a swift inquiry to international operations,inquiring about the check.the following day,after receiving no response,banque francaise sent a second inquiry via swift.
on august,first union located the check and the collection letter and overnighted them to international operations.first union immediately informed banque francaise of this delivery.the following day,nine banking days after receipt of the check,international operations notified banque francaise that the check was being returned unpaid because of the previous order and the discrepancy between the written and the numerical amount on the check.this same day,august,first union sent banque francaise a swift message and returned the check via federal express.in this same correspondence,first union requested reimbursement from banque francaise for its cable charges.banque francaise paid these charges.
scadif filed suit,claiming that first union was strictly liable for the amount of the check,because it failed to pay or return the check within the midnight deadline.the district court entered judgment for first union,finding that the check was sent for collection rather than payment,and therefore,the midnight deadline rule did not apply.the district court also found that first union handling of the check did not cause scadif any loss or injury.
scadif also filed a motion for sanctions two months after the trial,alleging,inter alia,concealment of documents by first union,and misconduct by first union and one of its witnesses,professor barkley clark.the district court denied the motion,finding that any misconduct by first union during the trial did not merit the imposition of sanctions.scadif appeals the judgment in favor of first union and the denial of sanctions.
first,we examine whether the district court erred in finding that the check was sent for collection rather than payment,thereby holding that the midnight deadline rule was not applicable and entering judgment for first union.one question is dispositive of this issue whether the parties agreed that the check was sent to first union for coll
