we must decide whether the federal deposit insurance corporation,in its role of receiver of a closed bank,may breach underlying asset contractual obligations without consequence.
in december,professional business bank pbb sold to first heritage bank,heritage a fifty percent participation interest in a commercial loan pbb had made to al garden art.the terms of the pbb heritage participation agreement agreement imposed two contractual limitations on heritage interest in the loan.first,heritage could not transfer its interest in the loan without pbb prior written consent.second,the agreement granted pbb a right of first refusal,such that it could elect to repurchase heritage loan interest upon the latter receipt of any bona fide offer.
within one year of executing its agreement with pbb,the office of the comptroller of the currency closed heritage and appointed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to act as receiver for heritage assets.by operation of d a,the fdic became successor in interest to all of heritage assets and liabilities.six months later,and without first seeking pbb consent or providing pbb with an opportunity to repurchase heritage interest in the al garden art loan,the fdic sold heritage interest under the agreement to commerce first financial,cff.
al garden art defaulted on its loan obligations,and pbb filed suit in state court seeking to collect on the loan.shortly thereafter,cff brought a breach of contract action against pbb to enforce the rights it acquired from the fdic.in response,pbb counterclaimed against cff and filed a third party complaint against the fdic,alleging that the fdic failure to satisfy the agreement contractual provisions constituted breach of contract.
the case was removed to the united states district court for the central district of california,where the fdic filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea preempted pbb claims.in its february,order,the district court denied the motion,concluding that firrea does not permit the fdic to breach contracts without consequence.as the fdic conceded breach of contract in the absence of its statutory defense,the district court granted pbb motion for summary judgment in its october,order the fdic timely appealed 
conceding that its actions otherwise constituted a breach of the agreement,the fdic asserts that firrea frees the agency from complying with any contractual provisions related to the transfer of a failed bank assets.in relevant part,firrea provides that the fdic,acting as receiver,may transfer any asset or liability of the institution in default without any approval,assignment,or consent with respect to such transfer.d g i ii.the district court held that section d g i ii does not immunize the fdic from damage claims if it elects to breach contractual arrangements.we review a district court statutory interpretation de novo.see miranda anchondo,cir.
this case does not arise in a precedential vacuum.we have considered on two prior occasions the scope of authority granted to the fdic under d.in sahni american diversified partners,we considered whether section d preempted a california state statute requiring the consent or approval of all general partners prior to a transfer of the bulk of a partnership assets,cir.we determined that b ecause congress specifically exempted the fdic from having to obtain any consent when effectuating the sale or transfer of receivership assets pursuant to d,state statutes purporting to require prior approval or consent for fdic asset transfers are preempted by firrea.id.however,as the dispute between the fdic and bank of manhattan involves contractual rather than statutory transfer limits,sahni is inapposite.
more relevant to the fdic section d powers in the context is our analysis in sharpe fdic,cir.in sharpe,the plaintiffs sued the fdic as receiver for breaching a contract executed by pioneer bank,the fdic predecessor in interest,whereby the bank agreed to pay the sharpes a certain sum of money in exchange for a promissory note and deed of trust.id.at.
the sharpe court considered two questions pertinent to the instant case.first,we assessed whether j which precludes courts from taking any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the fdic as a conservator or receiver deprives courts of jurisdiction over breach of contract claims against the fdic.sharpe,at.determining that it does not,we noted that the statute clearly contemplates that the fdic can escape the obligations of contracts only through the prescribed mechanism of e,which allows the fdic to disaffirm or repudiate any contract it deems burdensome and pay only compensatory damages.id.at.in so concluding,we stated that firrea does not authorize the breach of contracts or preempt state law so as to abrogate state law contract rights.id.as such,the sharpe panel determined that courts retain jurisdiction over equitable claims related to contractual breaches.id.
the second question the sharpe court decided was whether parties to a contract breached by the fdic were properly considered creditors subject to firrea administrative claims process.holding that such parties are not creditors under firrea,we reasoned that to rule otherwise would effectively preempt state contract law.id.at.we so concluded because firrea does not indicate that congress intended to preempt state law so broadly.id.
the sharpe panel supported its conclusion regarding the narrow scope of the fdic powers under section d by explicitly adopting the circuit reasoning in waterview management fdic.see sharpe,at.in waterview,the circuit addressed nearly the same question presented here whether section d g i ii preempts contracts.the waterview court held that section d does not preempt such contracts because p contracts are properly governed by section e,entitled provisions relating to contracts entered into before appointment of conservator or receiver,which permits repudiation of such contracts and provides for the payment of damages.waterview,at.put differently,the circuit reasoning which we explicitly adopted in sharpe concluded that section d merely permits the transfer of a failed bank assets without prior approval,while section e governs the mechanism by which such transfers are executed if the disputed assets are burdened by contractual obligations.id.at.
the of sahni,sharpe,and waterview is clear while section d g i ii preempts state statutes requiring prior approval or consent for the transfer of receivership assets,it does not extend to the sphere of private contracts.instead,section e governs the fdic treatment of assets burdened by contractual limitations.should the fdic violate contracts rather than repudiate them under section e,sharpe and waterview make clear that section d g i ii does not afford the agency immunity from subsequent actions for breach of contract.
to rule otherwise would permit the fdic to succeed to powers greater than those held by the insolvent bank,an implausible result when firrea provides that the fdic,as receiver,shall succeed to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution.d a.it is true that some provision in the extensive framework of firrea might,in theory,afford the fdic as receiver greater powers than those possessed by a failed financial institution.myers fdic,d.however,in light of sahni,sharpe,and waterview,we conclude that section d g i ii is not such a provision.therefore,we agree with the sharpe panel that firrea does not preempt state law so as to abrogate state law contract rights,since it can not be the case that the fdic is in a better position when it breaches a contract than when it chooses to repudiate pursuant to e.sharpe,at,
despite the clear statement of the sahni,sharpe,and waterview decisions that firrea does not authorize the breach of contracts,sharpe,at,the fdic argues that subsequent case law has limited those cases such that the quoted language is no longer good law.its arguments are unpersuasive.
this court has revisited the sharpe decision on several occasions.however,our subsequent decisions have ne
