the state of california the state,through its pension obligation bond committee the committee,brought this action pursuant to government code section and code of civil procedure section et sequitur to obtain a declaration of the validity of recent legislation authorizing the issuance of bonds under certain limited circumstances to finance the state employer obligation to fund pensions.the committee argued the bonds fall within an exception to a state constitutional limitation on the creation of new debt cal.const.art.xvi,unspecified article references that follow are to the california constitution for debts incurred to meet an obligation imposed by law.according to the committee,the obligation to fund employee pensions is one imposed by law within the meaning of this exception.
the trial court disagreed with the committee,concluding the pension obligation is one imposed by the state on itself and,therefore,does not fall within an exception for obligations imposed by law.the court entered judgment against the committee.
we agree the bonds are not exempt from the constitutional debt limit and affirm the judgment.
statutory and procedural background 
iintroduction 
in,a state commission on pensions recommended the establishment of a retirement system for state employees.valdes cory d.valdes.the commission stressed the need to place such a retirement system on a sound financial basis,where liabilities are provided for as they are incurred,rather than when they mature.ibid.
the following year,the state constitution was amended to empower the legislature to create a state employee retirement system former art.iv,repealed.valdes,supra,d at.in,the legislature established the state employees retirement system,presently known as the public employees retirement system or pers.stats,ch,former.the system included a fund derived from mandatory employee payroll contributions member contributions,contributions of the state,and earnings on the investment of the fund.stats,ch.claypool wilson th,d,fn.omitted.a board of administration the pers board was created to administer the system.id.at,d.
the original enactments created a retirement benefit system commonly referred to as a money purchase plan,whereby the amount of benefits provided depended on the amount of money in the pensioner account at the time of retirement.valdes,supra,d at.see stats,ch.these enactments were repealed in but reenacted in essential part as the state employees retirement law the retirement law stats,ch.claypool wilson,supra,th at,d.
by,pers had become a defined benefit plan,with fixed benefits for pensioners and actuarially determined,fixed contribution rates for employers.stats,ch.by,the legislature had empowered the pers board to adjust the fixed rates of employer contributions in accordance with updated actuarial valuations stats,ch.valdes,supra,d at.
beginning in,both the governor and the legislature began devising means of balancing the state budget by limiting or delaying the state employer contribution obligations to pers.for example,in legislation was enacted to bar the state from making a contribution for a portion of that year and to require the shortfall to be made up from the pers reserve against deficiencies.citation.until,the state paid employer contributions on a monthly basis.citation.in,the legislature changed the payment schedule from monthly to quarterly.in,the legislature temporarily changed the payment schedule from quarterly to semiannually.in,legislation changed the schedule to semiannually,six months in arrears.legislation in changed the schedule to annually,months in arrears.citation.in,legislation was passed to repeal statutes providing for cost of living benefits to retirees,and to use these funds to meet the state employer contribution requirement.citation.also in,legislation was passed transferring the actuarial function to the governor.westly board of administration th,d.
in november,the voters adopted proposition,the california pension protection act of,which,among other things,added to article xvi,section the requirement that the pers board have sole and exclusive power to provide for actuarial services in order to assure the competency of the assets of the public pension or retirement system.cal,art.xvi,subd.e.proposition contained a statement of findings and declaration,which stated in part politicians have undermined the dignity and security of all citizens who depend on pension benefits by repeatedly raiding their pension funds to protect the financial security of retired californians,politicians must be prevented from meddling in or looting pension funds.historical notes,west ann.const.ed.art.xvi,subds.c d.proposition also contained a statement of purpose and intent,in which the voters declared their purpose and intent in passing proposition was,inter alia,to strictly limit the legislature power over public pension funds,and to prohibit the governor or any executive or legislative body of any political subdivision of this state from tampering with public pension funds.historical notes,west ann,supra,art.xvi,subd.e.board of administration wilson th,d.
in,the legislature repealed and reenacted the retirement law.stats,ch.chapter of the current law addresses employer contributions,et further undesignated section references are to the government code.section reads 
a notwithstanding any other provision of law,the state contribution under this chapter shall be adjusted from time to time in the annual budget act according to the following method.as part of the proposed budget submitted pursuant to section of article iv of the california constitution,the governor shall include the contribution rates submitted by the actuary of the liability for benefits on account of employees of the state.the legislature shall adopt the actuary contribution rates and authorize the appropriation in the budget act.
b the employer contribution rates for all other public employers under this system shall be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the july following notice of a change of rate.
in each fiscal year,the state pays to pers the employer contribution as determined by the pers board.appropriations are made from the general fund on a quarterly basis to cover the employer contribution,except where the employee is compensated from a special fund,in which case the employer contribution is taken from that special fund.
the state has never issued bonds to finance its pers contributions.
the financing act and resolution 
in,the legislature enacted the california pension obligation financing act the financing act et,added by stats,ch.the financing act authorized the issuance of bonds and the creation of ancillary obligations for the purpose of funding or refunding the state pension obligations legis.counsel,bill.see,subd.a.it also established the committee for the purpose of issuing and selling the bonds and ancillary obligations authorized by the financing act,added by stats,ch,and created the pension obligation bond fund for the deposit of funds generated through the issuance of bonds,added by stats,ch.
on may,the committee adopted resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds in an amount not to exceed to pay a portion of the state employer contribution to pers for fiscal year.
the next day,the committee filed a validation action seeking a declaration of the legality of resolution.in that action,the committee asserted bonds issued pursuant to the financing act are exempt from article xvi,section.as shall be described in more detail below,that constitutional provision prohibits the legislature from creating debts in excess of without a vote and approval of the electorate.
the trial court ruled against the committee,concluding the resolution violated the constitutional debt limit.
the bond act and resolution 
in,the legislature enacted pension reform legislation that,among other things,introduced an alternate retirement program for new state employees.stats,ch.according to the legislative counsel digest,this legislation provides that state employees who become members of the public employees retirement system after the effective date of the bill shall not make contributions to the system,nor receive service credit for their service,and the state employer shall not make contributions on their behalf,during their first months of employment.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.stats,ch.instead,those employees would be required to contribute of their monthly compensation to an alternate retirement program,to be developed by the department of personnel administration.ibid.thereafter,the employee may elect to receive service credit for that period of service and transfer his or her accumulated contributions in the alternate retirement program from that program to the retirement system.ibid.
the legislature also enacted the california pension restructuring bond act of the bond act et,which became effective as an emergency measure on august.stats,ch.according to the legislative counsel digest,the bond act authorizes the issuance,during any fiscal years after june,of up to billion of bonds and the creation of ancillary obligations,as defined,for the purpose of funding or refunding the state obligations to the public employees retirement fund.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.
the legislative intent underlying the bond act is stated in section it is the intent of the legislature,in enacting this chapter,to provide for an efficient,equitable,and economical means of satisfying certain pension obligations of the state.bonds shall be issued pursuant to this chapter only when the director of finance determines that the state pension obligations are anticipated to be reduced as a result of changes in the public employees retirement law that reduce contributions to the public employees retirement system,and it is in the best interest of the state to issue bonds pursuant to this chapter to accelerate a portion of the state anticipated lower pension obligations.

on october,the chief deputy director of finance deputy director,on behalf of the director of finance,requested the committee to authorize the issuance of bonds in the amount of million to pay a portion of the state employer contribution to pers for fiscal year.the deputy director determined that changes to the retirement law adopted in the pension reform legislation described above are anticipated to reduce the state employer contributions to pers by in excess of billion over the next years and it is in the best interest of the state to accelerate these savings by issuing bonds.this estimated savings was later revised downward to billion.

discussion 
iintroduction 
code of civil procedure section authorizes a public agency to bring an action to determine the validity of certain public agency bonds,assessments,contracts with other agencies,or the public agency itself.walters county of plumas d.within their proper scope,such validation actions serve an important function in eliminating legal uncertainty that could impair a public agency ability to operate,market bonds,or the like.id.at.
the present matter involves the validity of bonds proposed to be issued by the committee pursuant to the bond act in order to finance a portion of the state employer contributions to pers.the question presented is whether the legislation authorizing these bonds violates the state constitution.
article xvi,section reads,in relevant part the legislature shall not,in any manner create any debt or debts,liability or liabilities,which shall,singly or in the aggregate with any previous debts or liabilities,exceed the sum of three hundred thousand dollars,except in case of war to repel invasion or suppress insurrection,unless the same shall be authorized by law for some single object or work but no such law shall take effect unless it has been passed by a vote of all the members elected to each house of the legislature and until,at a general election or at a direct primary,it shall have been submitted to the people and shall have received a majority of all the votes cast for and against it at such election 
this provision prohibits the state legislature from creating any indebtedness greater than unless that indebtedness has been approved by a vote of the legislature and a majority vote of the people.
in the present matter,it is undisputed the bond act was not approved by a vote of the legislature or a majority of the people and the bonds proposed to be issued under resolution will exceed in value.the sole issue litigated by the parties in this validation action is whether the bonds proposed to be issued fall within an exception to article xvi,section for obligations imposed by law.as we shall explain,we conclude no such exception applies under the circumstances presented.
article xvi,section 
article xvi,section limits the state legislature ability to incur debt.a similar restriction applies to local governments.article xvi,section,subdivision a reads,in relevant part no county,city,town,township,board of education,or school district,shall incur any indebtedness or liability in any manner or for any purpose exceeding in any year the income and revenue provided for such year,without the assent of of the voters of the public entity voting at an election to be held for that purpose 
the underlying purpose for the foregoing provision was to put an end to the practice common at the time among local governments of incurring liabilities in excess of income in order to finance extravagance,thereby creating a floating debt to be repaid from the income of future years.city of long beach lisenby cal,lisenby san francisco gas brickwedel cal.as such,the provision is more accurately viewed as a balanced budget requirement than a debt limit.rider city of san diego cal th,d.
three exceptions have been recognized to the local debt limit of article xvi,section.one exception applies whenever debts are incurred that will be repaid from revenues held in a special fund.rider city of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.for example,in san francisco contra costa cal,the state high court found the debt limit inapplicable where the county issued bonds for the improvement of streets and the bonds were to be repaid through special assessments on the properties benefiting from the improvements.id.at.in effect,because the bonds were to be repaid from this special fund rather than the general fund,no debt had been incurred.
in city of oxnard dale cal d,the high court clarified that a debt repayable from a special fund is not a debt within the meaning of article xvi,section only if the governmental body is not required to maintain the special fund from its general fund or through the exercise of its taxing powers.id.at.
another exception to article xvi,section applies where the local government enters into a contingent obligation.a sum payable upon a contingency is not a debt,nor does it become a debt until the contingency happens.doland clark cal.this exception has been applied to uphold multiyear contracts,such as leases,in which local governments agree to pay a sum in each of succeeding years in exchange for land,goods,or services to be provided during those years.rider city of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.
for example,in city of los angeles offner cal d,the city entered into an agreement for the construction and leasing to the city of a rubbish incinerator.the court found this to be outside the scope of article xvi,section,explaining it has been held generally in the numerous cases that have come before this court involving leases and agreements containing options to purchase that if the lease or other agreement is entered into in good faith and creates no immediate indebtedness for the aggregate installments therein provided for but,on the contrary,confines liability to each installment as it falls due and each year payment is for the consideration actually furnished that year,no violence is done to the constitutional provision.id.at.
the third exception,and the one at issue here,applies to obligations imposed by law.in lewis widber cal,the state high court concluded an obligation to pay the salary of a county treasurer was exempt from the local debt limit because the office was mandated by state law.id.at.according to the court,article xvi,section refers only to an indebtedness or liability which one of the municipal bodies mentioned has itself is,an indebtedness which the municipality has contracted,or a liability resulting,in whole or in part,from some act or conduct of such municipality.such is the plain meaning of the language used.the clear intent expressed in the said clause was to limit and restrict the power of the municipality as to any indebtedness or liability which it has discretion to incur or not incur.but the stated salary of a public officer fixed by statute is a matter over which the municipality has no control,and with respect to which it has no discretion and the payment of his salary is a liability established by the legislature at the date of the creation of the office.it,therefore,is not an indebtedness or liability incurred by the municipality within the meaning of said clause of the constitution.id.at.
in county of los angeles byram cal d,the high court held the cost of constructing a courthouse was not subject to the constitutional debt limit,because the county had a legal duty,imposed by state law,to provide adequate quarters for the courts.id.at.this duty was enough to take the matter outside the constitutional debt limit,even though the county retained wide discretion regarding what kind of courthouse to construct and at what cost.
in order for state law to impose a nondiscretionary duty on a local governmental entity within the meaning of this exception,the state law must do more than impose a general duty to perform some function.it must impose a special duty on the entity to expend its money on that function.compton community college.teachers compton community college dist.d.thus,in arthur city of petaluma cal,the court concluded a debt incurred to print a city charter did not fall within the exception to the constitutional debt limit for obligations imposed by law.although state law required a city to print its charter in a local newspaper for days whenever it chose to adopt a charter,the city decision to adopt a charter was itself discretionary.in other words,the obligation to pay the printing charge came about only because the city voluntarily chose to adopt the charter.hence,this was not an obligation imposed by law.
does the exception for obligations imposed by law apply to article xvi,section 
the committee contends debt within the meaning of article xvi,section,the state debt limit,should be interpreted the same as in article xvi,section,the local debt limit,and should be subject to the same exceptions.
in dean kuchel cal d,our supreme court applied the contingency exception of article xvi,section to article xvi,section.there,the state leased land to a developer under an arrangement whereby the developer was to construct a building on the land and lease the building to the state for a period of years.the court concluded this arrangement did not create a debt within the meaning of article xvi,section,because,as in city of los angeles offner,supra,cal d,the payment of rent in future years was contingent on continued availability of the building in those years.the court indicated the same principles apply to both constitutional provisions.dean kuchel,supra,at.
in california housing finance agency elliott cal d,the court applied the special fund exception to article xvi,section.there,state law authorized the issuance of bonds to pay for housing,with the bonds to be repaid using revenues generated from the housing or,if necessary,a reserve fund appropriated at the time the law was enacted.citing city of oxnard dale,supra,cal d,the court concluded no debt had been created by this arrangement within the meaning of article xvi,section,because neither the general fund nor the state taxing authority was implicated.california housing finance agency elliott,supra,at.
the committee cites no case in which the exception to article xvi,section for obligations imposed by law has been applied to article xvi,section.we have not been able to find any either.
fact contends it is not surprising no reported case has applied this exception to article xvi,section.fact argues such exception logically applies only in the context of lower levels of government where the government is constrained to make a certain expenditure by legal mandates from above.according to fact,this exception does not fit logically with the nature of state government,while it is precisely applicable to local government.fact further argues that,because article xvi,section contains express exceptions,this court is precluded from creating new ones.
fact arguments read the exception for obligations imposed by law too narrowly.even assuming there is no higher governmental authority,such as the federal government or international law,that could impose a financial obligation on the state,the exception is not limited to obligations.as the state high court explained in lewis widber,supra,cal.at page,the purpose of the local debt limit is to restrict the power of the municipality as to any indebtedness or liability which it has discretion to incur or not to incur.in lisenby,supra,cal,the city issued bonds to pay tort judgments that had been entered against it.although the aggregate amount of the bonds exceeded the city income for the year,the court concluded the local debt limit did not apply,because this was not an obligation voluntarily incurred by the city.id.at.
the same purpose underlies the state debt limit of article xvi,section restrict the power of the state legislature to incur debt voluntarily.consequently,it may be argued that a debt incurred involuntarily,such as one to satisfy a tort judgment against the state,would be outside the scope of article xvi,section.furthermore,it may be noted that all of the exceptions recognized under article xvi,section are just restatements of the general principle that the local debt limit applies only in circumstances where the governmental entity has created a debt.the contingency exception applies because no debt is created until the contingency occurs.the special fund exception applies because no debt has been established,inasmuch as the obligation will be repaid from the earnings of the project and not the general fund.the exception for obligations imposed by law applies because a debt already exists and,hence,has not been created.because article xvi,section,like article xvi,section,limits the power of the governmental entity to create debt,that limitation should not apply if no debt has been created.
at any rate,it is unnecessary to decide here if the exception for obligations imposed by law applies to article xvi,section.as we shall explain in the next section,the legislation at issue here does not fall within the scope of such an exception.
does the exception apply here 
the committee contends that,because the amount of the state contribution to pers is within the sole discretion of the pers board,and the legislature has no choice but to fund at the level dictated by the board,the obligation to pay the pension obligation at issue in this action constitutes an obligation imposed by law.the committee cites as support proposition,the california pension protection act of,which,as briefly described above,added to article xvi,section the following provisions 
a the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of the public pension or retirement system.the retirement board shall also have sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the system in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits and related services to the participants and their beneficiaries.the assets of a public pension or retirement system are trust funds and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the pension or retirement system and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.
e the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system,consistent with the exclusive fiduciary responsibilities vested in it,shall have the sole and exclusive power to provide for actuarial services in order to assure the competency of the assets of the public pension or retirement system 
the committee argues that,through proposition,the voters created a unique state employer pension obligation with which neither the legislature nor the governor can tamper and,therefore,the pension obligation is an obligation imposed by law.
the committee further cites section,which reads notwithstanding any other provision of law,neither the state,any school employer,nor any contracting agency shall fail or refuse to pay the employers contribution required by this chapter or to pay the employers contributions required by this chapter within the applicable time limitations.
finally,the committee cites section,where the legislature declared t he state obligations to make payments to certain public retirement systems are obligations imposed by law not subject to section of article xvi 
the trial court rejected the committee arguments,explaining plaintiff attempts to bring this case within the reach of the local government cases by arguing that pension obligations have been imposed upon the state by the public employees retirement system acting as the actuary for the state pension system under the authority granted to it by the state constitution in article xvi,section.the court finds this argument to be unpersuasive,as it is based on an artificial distinction in status between enactments of the legislature and those of the voters,in which the latter are somehow viewed as separate from,and superior to,the former.such a view is not in harmony with the concept of the state legislative power as set forth in the constitution.article ii,section of the constitution states the basic concept that all political power is inherent in the people.article iv,section states that the legislative power of the state is vested in the legislature,but the people reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum.under article ii,section a,initiative is the power of the electors to propose and adopt or reject statutes and amendments to the state constitution.thus,statutes enacted by the legislature and statutes and constitutional provisions enacted by the electorate through the initiative process are equally exercises of the legislative power of the state.accordingly,the pension obligations of the state,whether created by the legislature through statute or by the people enacting constitutional provisions through the initiative process,both ultimately derive from the legislative power of the state.in essence,the state has chosen to impose pension obligations upon itself,which is inconsistent with the concept of an obligation imposed by law by a separate and higher legal authority,as that concept has been set forth in the case law.
the committee contends the trial court analysis is flawed because it fails to recognize the fundamental limit on article xvi,section it expressly applies only to actions of the legislature,not the people.in this way,article xvi,section differs from article xvi,section.the latter applies to any action of the local government,not just its legislative body.
the committee argues article xvi,section does not restrict the power of the people to adopt legislation or amend the state constitution and thereby create binding obligations.the committee asserts the people represent a separate and higher power to the legislature.according to the committee,once the people have created such an obligation,it is one imposed by law,and the legislature is not prohibited by article xvi,section from incurring debt to satisfy that obligation.the committee asserts the people authorized the creation of a pension system in.the committee further asserts the people created a binding obligation to fund the system when they empowered the pers board to determine how much the state must pay in any given year.
the committee argues the trial court also ignored the difference between statutory and constitutional provisions.according to the committee,the state constitution is a separate and higher power and the constitutional empowerment of the pers board to determine the amount of the state annual employer contribution acts to create an obligation imposed by law.
finally,the committee argues the issuance of bonds under the bond act is not the creation of a debt within the meaning of article xvi,section but the conversion of a preexisting obligation to fund the various retirement another form.
fact counters that the language of article xvi,section is clear and prohibits the creation of any debt greater than without voter approval.fact further argues there can be no doubt the bonds proposed to be issued under the bond act are a debt subject to the constitutional debt limit.
however,the question here is not whether the bonds represent a debt as that term is commonly understood.the question,as posited by the committee,is whether the d
