plaintiffs,a group of investors defrauded by the millennium ponzi scheme,seek recourse against jpmorgan chase bank jpmorgan.they allege that washington mutual,wamu aided and abetted the ponzi scheme by providing banking services to several companies controlled by the scheme principals despite actual knowledge of the fraud.jpmorgan,they argue,is liable as successor in interest of wamu,having purchased most of wamu assets and liabilities from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.the fdic had taken wamu into receivership pursuant to the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.firrea.plaintiffs further claim jpmorgan is liable because it continued wamu problematic practices following assumption.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaints for failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies.see d d ii barring any claim relating to any act or omission of a failed bank or the fdic as receiver unless such claim is first presented to the fdic.plaintiffs contend,however,that firrea jurisdictional bar is limited to claims against a failed bank or the fdic and thus has no application to claims asserted against a purchasing bank with assets that passed through fdic receivership.they further argue that portions of their claims are based on jpmorgan independent,conduct,which is not governed by firrea.
we reject plaintiffs first contention.litigants can not avoid firrea administrative requirements through strategic pleading.accordingly,we join three other circuits in concluding that a claim asserted against a purchasing bank based on the conduct of a failed bank must be exhausted under firrea.see am.ins.fdic,village of oakwood state bank trust,cir am.first,lake forest park,cir.
the same is not true,however,with respect to claims based on a purchasing bank actions.such claims are not governed by firrea.they could not,and accordingly need not,be exhausted before the fdic.see henderson bank of new england,cir firrea applies only to claims that are susceptible of resolution through the claims procedure.
although we agree with plaintiffs legal argument on this score,we conclude it has no application to the case at bar.plaintiffs did not adequately plead a claim based on jpmorgan independent conduct they relied instead solely on conclusory allegations.the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims,along with its subsequent denial of plaintiffs federal rule of civil procedure b motion,was therefore proper.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
we draw the following facts from plaintiffs complaints in,canadian attorney william wise initiated the millennium ponzi scheme.wise formed the millennium bank and trust company,later renamed the millennium bank,in vincent and the grenadines.he began selling what he claimed were certificates of deposit cds issued by subsidiaries of the united trust of switzerland.in fact,the cds sold by wise and his associates were fraudulent,the millennium bank was not affiliated with any swiss banking company,and the company was not licensed to sell securities.the millennium bank originally obtained financial services from several banks in north carolina,but those institutions closed wise accounts due to suspicious activity.
in july,wise and two of his associates,jacqueline and kristi hoegel,formed three nevada business entities with names similar to united trust of switzerland ut of s,llc united t of s,llc and sterling,llc collectively,the nevada llcs.the hoegels used these entities to operate the banking side of the scheme from napa,california.they would regularly deposit large checks in bulk at the napa wamu branch and immediately wire large sums to known banking and tax havens.most checks that the hoegels deposited had handwritten notations that indicated they were tendered in exchange for cds.however,based on paperwork submitted at the time the accounts for the nevada llcs were opened,wamu was aware that the companies were not licensed to sell securities in the united states.
two wamu employees provided substantial assistance to the hoegels branch manager tamara miller and commercial banking officer bianca greeves.greeves recommended in february that the nevada llcs install a cash management transfer cmt system at the nevada llcs office.cmt systems,which allow outgoing wire transfers to be sent without the direct assistance of bank staff,are usually provided to large institutions with multinational operations.before providing the cmt system,wamu was required to conduct a detailed audit.jennifer blevins,a business treasury services senior specialist for wamu,approved the use of a cmt system for the nevada llcs after investigating the nature of their business,their financial strength,the number of their employees,and the amount of money coming in and out of their accounts each month.in september,greeves further recommended that the nevada llcs obtain a remote deposit capture rdc system,which allows companies to scan and deposit checks without presenting them to a bank.installing this system required a second and more detailed audit,which was again conducted by blevins.
on september,the federal deposit insurance company fdic seized wamu pursuant to its authority under firrea.three days later,jpmorgan acquired most of wamu assets and liabilities under a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic.
the millennium ponzi scheme came to an end several months later.on march,the securities and exchange commission filed an action against wise.it alleged that wise,the hoegels,and their associates had raised at least million by selling fraudulent cds.a receiver took control of the nevada llcs assets and those of the millennium ponzi scheme principals.all suits against those individuals and entities were enjoined.
in november,two similar complaints involving the millennium ponzi scheme were filed against jpmorgan.the first was filed by kimberly benson,karimdad baloch,and neerja gursahaney,and the second by john lowell.the first set of plaintiffs purchased what they believed were cds from the nevada llcs between may and august.lowell did not state when he purchased fraudulent cds.both complaints asserted claims for aiding and abetting fraud,aiding and abetting conversion,and violating california banking law.the complaint by benson,baloch,and gursahaney also asserted claims for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,and conspiracy to commit fraud and conversion.both complaints sought certification of a class of similarly situated victims of the millennium ponzi scheme.the two cases were consolidated below.
the district court dismissed the conspiracy claims on jpmorgan federal rule of civil procedure b motion,but denied that motion as to plaintiffs remaining claims.jpmorgan then filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies under firrea.the district court granted that motion and ordered the clerk of the court to close the file for the case.no separate judgment was entered.
plaintiffs then filed a rule b motion seeking reconsideration of the district court order and an opportunity to amend their complaints.they argued that even if their claims based on wamu conduct could be dismissed,the complaints alleged independent misconduct on the part of jpmorgan.although the complaints do not detail any specific actions taken by jpmorgan,an introductory paragraph states that despite actual knowledge of the millennium ponzi scheme,wamu continued to provide substantial assistance to wise illegal enterprise and promoted the continued success of that enterprise for a period in excess of four years and that t hese practices continued after jpmorgan acquired wamu in september of.the district court denied reconsideration.

following the savings and loan crisis of the,congress passed firrea to give the fdic power to take all actions necessary to resolve the problems posed by a financial institution in default.sahni am.diversified partners,cir quoting.i,at,reprinted in.the statute grants the fdic authority to act as receiver or conservator of a failed institution for the protection of depositors and creditors.sharpe fdic,cir.it provides detailed procedures to allow the fdic to consider certain claims against the receivership estate,see d,to ensure that the assets of a failed institution are distributed fairly and promptly among those with valid claims against the institution,and to expeditiously wind up the affairs of failed banks,mccarthy fdic,cir quotation omitted.
firrea requires that a plaintiff exhaust these administrative remedies with the fdic before filing certain claims.henderson bank of new england,cir.the statute provides 
limitation on judicial review.except as otherwise provided in this subsection,no court shall have jurisdiction over 
i any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver,including assets which the fdic may acquire from itself as such receiver or 
ii any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the fdic as receiver.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims under d d ii,holding that the claims related to acts or omissions of wamu and had not been presented to the fdic.plaintiffs argue the district court erred in construing firrea to preclude their claim against jpmorgan as wamu successor in interest.they argue the jurisdictional bar does not apply to claims asserted against purchasing banks such as jpmorgan.in the alternative,plaintiffs contend that portions of their claims were based on jpmorgan own,misconduct and were thus not related to the acts or omissions of wamu.finally,they argue that the district court improperly dismissed their complaint without allowing them leave to amend.
plaintiffs assertion that firrea jurisdictional bar does not apply to purchasing institutions is undermined by the plain text of d d ii.that provision distinguishes claims on their factual bases rather than on the identity of the defendant it asks whether claims relate to any act of omission of a failed institution or the fdic.notably,the provision does not make any distinction based on the identity of the party from whom relief is sought.
in their uphill argument against the statutory text,plaintiffs rely heavily on henrichs valley view development,cir,in which this court stated that firrea requirement to exhaust administrative remedies applies only in an action against the fdic as receiver.id.at.in context,however,it is clear that henrichs discussed only the first prong of firrea jurisdictional bar contained in d d i.
the henrichs case concerned a collateral attack on a judgment quieting title in a parcel of land that had passed through fdic receivership.a plaintiff argued that firrea vests exclusive federal jurisdiction over any dispute regarding property once held by the fdic as a receiver.see henrichs,at.the henrichs plaintiff cited to j,which bars any court from restrain ing or affect ing the exercise of powers or functions of the fdic as a conservator or a receiver,and to d d.we rejected reliance on j,holding that a quiet title action brought by the purchasers of property once held in receivership did not restrain or affect the fdic,which had relinquished any interest in the parcel at the time of suit.henrichs,at.
as to d d,we expressed some confusion as to the nature of the plaintiff argument.if,by citing this provision,the plaintiff means to imply that the statute bars the state court adjudication of the dispute with the property owner,he is mistaken.henrichs,at.we concluded that d d does not confer exclusive federal jurisdiction.henrichs,at.the court further stated that the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies applies only in an action against the fdic as receiver.id.
although the court cited d d without specifying a subsection,context establishes that the statement concerned only subsection i,which requires exhaustion of administrative remedies for any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to the assets of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver.the court described only the first prong of d d,which states that individuals seeking to make claims that affect assets acquired by the fdic in its capacity as a conservator or receiver must exhaust the fdic administrative claims process before seeking judicial review.henrichs,at.the quiet title action at issue in henrichs arguably qualified under this prong as one seeking the determination of rights as to an asset formerly held by the fdic as receiver for a failed bank.in contrast,nothing in henrichs suggests that the quiet title action could have been related to the acts or omissions of a failed bank or the fdic the subjects of subsection ii 
because henrichs did not consider subsection ii,the provision at issue in this case,it does not control our analysis 
we are similarly unpersuaded by plaintiffs citation to other ninth circuit authority.plaintiffs focus on a statement in mccarthy indicating that firrea jurisdictional bar applies to claimants who challenge conduct by the fdic as receiver.at.but the mccarthy court did not hold that only such claims are covered.to the contrary,mccarthy recognized that firrea exhaustion requirement applies to any claim or action respecting the assets of a failed institution for which the fdic is receiver.id.furthermore,mccarthy plainly did not deal with the statutory subsection at issue here the jurisdictional bar on claims relating to any act or omission of a failed bank.d d ii.
by the same token,henderson,does not excuse exhaustion in this case.we explained in henderson that firrea bars judicial review of any claim,monetary or nonmonetary,which is susceptible of resolution through the claims procedure.id.at quotation omitted.although plaintiffs assert that their claims are not currently susceptible to the claims process,plaintiffs give us no reason to believe that firrea exhaustion would have been futile had they submitted them within the appropriate time frame.further,to the extent plaintiffs assert they currently lack a remedy,that result can only be attributed to their failure to exhaust.bueford resolution trust,cir since the language of the statute expressly provides for judicial review after exhaustion of the administrative procedures,plaintiff can not prevail on her claim that firrea administrative procedures deny her due process by making judicial review unavailable.
thus,this court has not decided the precise issue pressed by plaintiffs in their first claim of error whether firrea jurisdictional bar can apply to claims against parties other than failed banks or the fdic.some of our sibling circuits,however,have addressed the question.
in village of oakwood state bank trust,cir,the court considered an argument that firrea did not apply because plaintiffs sued only the bank that purchased a failed institution,rather than the fdic and thus the claims fall completely outside of the framework of firrea administrative process.id.at.the court flatly rejected this line of reasoning 
the problem with this novel argument is that all of plaintiffs claims against the purchasing bank are directly related to acts or omissions of the fdic as the receiver of the failed bank.as the district court explained,accepting the plaintiffs argument and permitting claimants to avoid the provisions of d and d by bringing claims against the assuming bank would encourage the very litigation that firrea aimed to avoid.
