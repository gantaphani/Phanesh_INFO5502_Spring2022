the american bankers association challenges a national credit union administration rule governing chartering and membership standards for federal credit unions.according to the aba,the rule violates the credit union membership access act of,pursuant to which the administration issued the rule.except for one claim that we dismiss as moot and another as unripe,we find the aba arguments without merit and affirm the district court dismissal of the case.
the federal credit union act fcua,provides for the establishment of federal credit unions and governs their operations.a credit union is a cooperative association organized in accordance with the provisions of the fcua for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes.id.the national credit union administration may prescribe rules and regulations for the administration of the fcua,id.a,and charters,examines,and supervises federal credit unions,see id.
as originally enacted,the fcua limited credit union membership to groups having a of occupation or association,or to groups within a neighborhood,community,or rural district.fcua,stat,codified at former amended.starting in,the administration began permitting multiple occupational groups,groups with different common bonds,to combine into one multiple credit union.interpretative ruling and policy statement irps.in,the supreme court,affirming a decision of this court,held that the fcua prohibited such credit unions.see credit union admin.first bank trust,d.later that year,however,congress amended the fcua to authorize multiple credit unions.credit union membership access act,stat,amending b.
as amended,the fcua permits three types of credit unions,each defined by a different membership field single credit unions,comprised of one group having a common occupational or associational bond multiple credit unions,comprised of more than one such group and community credit unions.b.pursuant to what the parties call a grandfather clause,the fcua exempts certain previously existing members and groups from the new membership field provisions.id.c.the fcua also imposes several limitations and conditions on multiple credit union formation and growth,including restricting multiple credit unions to groups with less than members,id.d,unless certain exceptions apply,including where a larger group could not feasibly or reasonably form its own credit union,id.d a directing that the administration encourage a group seeking to join an existing credit union to form its own separately chartered credit union instead,id.f a requiring that in order to be added to an existing credit union a group be within reasonable proximity of that credit union,id.f b and requiring that where an existing credit union seeks to include an additional group,the credit union must satisfy certain approval criteria concerning its financial soundness and administrative capabilities,and that any harmful effect the expansion will have on any other credit union must be clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion,id.f.finally,the amendments added the word local to the community credit union definition,thus confining such credit unions to local communit ies,neighborhood s,or rural district s.id.g.
following notice and comment,the administration issued a final rule implementing the amendments.see irps.several of the rule provisions regarding multiple credit unions are at issue in this case.first,although the rule allows the immediate family and household of a group member,as well as p ersons retired as pensioners and annuitants,to join the group multiple credit union,the rule does not count these persons toward the limit.id.at.second,in determining whether a group with or more members could not feasibly or reasonably form its own credit union,d,the administration considers the group desire and intent.at.third,while the rule requires groups with or more members to demonstrate why they can not satisfactorily form a separate credit union if they want to be added to another credit union,it requires groups with fewer than members to demonstrate why they can successfully operate a credit union in order to be separately chartered.id.at.fourth,the rule permits healthy multiple credit unions comprised of groups with fewer than members to merge with each other without regard to the statutory analysis that is required when such groups seek to join an existing credit union.id.at.
also at issue in this case are the rule provisions implementing the fcua grandfather clause,reasonable proximity requirement,and local community standard.see.at.under the rule,the grandfather clause covers not just individuals who were members of a group at the time the fcua was amended,but also those who subsequently become members of the group.id.at.the rule provides that a group is within reasonable proximity of a credit union if it is within the service area of a service facility of the credit union a service facility includes a credit union owned electronic facility other than an automated teller machine.id.at.finally,the rule establishes criteria to implement the statute local community standard and adopts a presumption that certain areas,defined by political jurisdiction and population,meet that standard.id.at.
alleging that these provisions of the rule violate the fcua,appellant,the american bankers association aba,filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia pursuant to the administrative procedure act.see.underlying all of the aba claims is its belief that the rule is too permissive with respect to credit union formation and growth.except for the provision regarding pensioners,which the district court found the aba amended complaint failed to challenge,the district court concluded that each of the challenged provisions reflects a reasonable interpretation of the fcua and dismissed the amended complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
renewing the arguments it made in the district court,the aba appeals.three organizations representing credit unions intervened to defend the rule.we review the district court rule b dismissal de novo.see,brown plaut.
before considering the merits of the aba claims,we must deal with its preliminary argument that the district court erred by failing to direct the administration to produce the administrative record.according to the aba,the district court needed the administrative record in order to consider its claims under the apa,challenging ncua rule and certain expansions on the ground that the agency actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.appellant opening br.at quoting amended complaint.having reviewed the amended complaint,however,we agree with the district court that the aba argument that the challenged provisions violate the fcua can be resolved with nothing more than the statute and its legislative history.see am.bankers ass credit union,d,see also sierra club united states fish wildlife,cir although the administrative record for the regulation is not before this court,that is of no moment.our review is limited to interpreting the extent to which the regulation is consistent with the task which we are competent to perform without the administrative record.citing ins,d.although the aba now hints that it also asserted a challenge to the administration process,we can find no such claim in the amended complaint.nor,and again contrary to what the aba says,can we find any challenge to the manner in which the administration has applied the rule in specific cases that does not depend entirely on the argument that the rule itself violates the statute.should the aba have concerns about the administration application of the rule to specific cases,it remains free to bring an challenge.
because the aba argues that the provisions of the rule it challenges violate the fcua,a statute the administration is charged with enforcing,we proceed in accordance with chevron familiar test.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.although chevron step one analysis begins with the statute text,we must not confine ourselves to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.we must also exhaust the traditional tools of statutory construction,natural res.def.council,browner,internal quotation marks and citation omitted,including examining the statute legislative history to shed new light on congressional intent,notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear,id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and,of course,we must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which congress is likely to delegate a policy decision to an administrative agency.brown williamson,at.if,applying these principles,we find that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.
only if we find the statute either silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise question at issue do we proceed to chevron second step,asking whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.but not in this case.although the district court resolved all issues on the basis of chevron step two analysis,am.bankers,d at,the aba rests its appeal entirely on chevron step one.throughout its opening brief,the aba uses only chevron step one language the district court misapplied chevron by upholding actions that are contrary to the clearly expressed intent of congress,appellant opening br.at the language of the fcua expressly rejects ncua policy choice,id.at congress makes plain,it is clear that congress did not intend,id.at the administration decided it could evade the plain meaning of the statute,id.at the rule is unlawful as a matter of simple english,id.at.moreover,the brief never uses the word unreasonable nor any other language suggesting a chevron step two argument.even after the administration and intervenors responded with chevron step one and two defenses,the aba confined its reply brief to straightforward chevron step one arguments policy considerations can not trump the clearly expressed intent of congress,appellant reply br.at the administration argument is contrary to the plain language,id.at congress did express an intent,id.at there is no basis to believe that congress concern did not apply,id.at.accordingly,we will evaluate the aba claims under chevron step one standards alone.
we begin with the aba challenge to the administration method for calculating the size of a group.under the statute,the membership field of a multiple credit union is limited to groups comprised of persons sharing a common bond,b,and only a group with fewer than members shall be eligible to be included in the field of membership category of a multiple credit union d.under the rule,the administration counts only primary potential members.at,persons sharing the occupational or associational bond that defines the group,toward the limit.although by virtue of their close relationship to a commonbond group,certain other persons may be included in the field of membership of a credit is,they may join the credit persons are not counted toward the limit.id.at.these persons include immediate family and household members of primary potential members,as well as pensioners and annuitants.id.we consider each category in turn.
family members 
calling the rule failure to count family members toward the limit a serious misreading of the act,appellant opening br.at,the aba argues that individuals are eligible to join a credit union only if they share the common bond.therefore,the aba claims,if family members are eligible for credit union membership,then they are necessarily group members and must be counted.the aba also points out that subsection c contains two e xceptions to subsection b,the membership field for grandfathered members and groups and another for underserved areas neither of which pertains to family and household members.c.
the aba focuses too narrowly.subsection b expressly states that it is subject to the other provisions of section,b,and section contains a provision relating to family and household members the additional membership eligibility provisions,e.this subsection states 
no individual shall be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the relationship of the individual to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union,unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household of the other person.
e.though phrased as a limitation,subsection e links credit union membership eligibility for family and household members to the personal relationship between such persons and group members or other persons eligible for credit union membership,rather than to group membership.moreover,the fact that this provision speaks of individuals eligibility for credit union membership,while the limit provision,d,speaks of group eligibil ity to be included in a multiple credit union,indicates that credit union members and group members do not entirely overlap.under these circumstances,we have no basis for concluding that the fcua unambiguously requires the administration to count family and household members toward the limit.
the aba insists that the history of the statute supports its view that section e provides no basis for family and household credit union membership eligibility other than sharing the common bond.appellant opening br.at.specifically,it argues that prior to the amendments,the administration treated family and household members as part of the group,and that in the district court the administration conceded that congress merely endorsed the agency longstanding policy regarding these persons.appellant opening br.at quoting admin.mem.in supp.motion to dismiss at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although the aba cites some evidence that supports this characterization of the administration prior policy,see,july,proposed rule characterizing family members as additional persons who share a common bond with the basic group cited in appellant opening br.at,other evidence indicates that the matter is not so clear.for example,a final interpretive ruling and policy statement describes family members as secondary or derivative members included in the field of membership by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group,june,cited in intervenors br.at.such conflicting evidence can not clarify ambiguous statutory language.see ayuda,thornburgh,e ither the plain language of the statute must be clear,or the legislative history and design of the act must illustrate a specific intent despite arguably ambiguous statutory language.citations omitted,vacated on other grounds,d.
pensioners 
unlike the fcua express provision for family and household members,the statute never mentions pensioners or annuitants.according to the aba,this silence means that its argument that anyone eligible for multiple credit union membership must be counted toward the limit applies even more forcefully in the case of pensioners.the district court concluded that the aba had failed to raise this claim because the amended complaint mentions only family and household members in the relevant count.am.bankers,d at.we agree.
in its original complaint,the aba made only one allegation with respect to the administration method for calculating group size that the rule unlawfully fails to count family and household members.see complaint.the complaint never mentioned pensioners.in its amended complaint,the aba continues to focus on family members,although pensioners are mentioned.the amended complaint describes how the rule permits certain persons whom the administration does not count as group members persons in the immediate families or households of the credit unions sic members pensioners and annuitants of a qualified business spouses of persons who died when in the credit union field of membership and employees of the credit union to be eligible for credit union membership,amended complaint,and alleges that if the persons l
