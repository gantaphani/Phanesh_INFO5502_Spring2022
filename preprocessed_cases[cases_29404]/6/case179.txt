this appeal presents the recurring issue of whether relevant documents are ambiguous,precluding their interpretation on a motion to dismiss,but the issue arises in the unusual context of an agreement for a loan from a lender to himself and his partner.a minor though intriguing issue,rarely if ever encountered in a judicial opinion,is whether the character i identifying a subparagraph in one of the documents is a lower case letter i or a lower case version of a roman numeral i,sometimes referred to as a romanette 
plaintiffs appellants shahab karmely and sk greenwich llc appeal from the august,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert patterson,district judge,granting the motion to dismiss by defendants appellees eitan wertheimer,ezra dagmi,greenwich llc,greenwich partners,llc,family,w d group lp,w d group,llc,and john does.
we conclude that in two respects the documents are ambiguous,precluding dismissal of the amended complaint,and we therefore remand for further proceedings.
background 
the following facts are taken from the amended complaint and assumed to be true for purposes of the motion to dismiss.
people and entities.appellant karmely is an experienced new york city real estate developer.appellee eitan wertheimer is an israeli citizen,and appellee ezra dagmi is a dual citizen of israel and the united kingdom.dagmi and werthheimer are close friends and partners in real estate ventures.dagmi and his family have had a close personal relationship with karmely and his family for more than years.dagmi has repeatedly referred to this relationship as a family relationship of trust.
the entities involved are 
appellant sk greenwich,llc sk greenwich a delaware limited liability company,of which karmely is the sole member 
appellee w d group lp w d lender,an israeli limited partnership,controlled by wertheimer and dagmi 
appellee w d group llc w d partner,a delaware limited liability company,of which w d lender is the sole member 
appellee greenwich partners llc partners or the company,a delaware limited liability company,of which sk greenwich and w d partner are the sole members 
appellee greenwich llc greenwich owner,a delaware limited liability company,of which partners is the sole member 
anglo irish bank corporation plc anglo irish bank.
in,wertheimer and dagmi approached karmely about developing a dollar real estate portfolio.karmely agreed to act as a developer for this venture,and instead of requiring a customary development fee,agreed to accept a percentage of the profits on each development as compensation for his services.in september sk greenwich agreed with w d partner to form the company to purchase and develop a building at greenwich street,new york,the property.sk greenwich,karmely,contributed approximately million and w d partner,wertheimer and dagmi,contributed approximately million of capital to the company,for which they received percent and percent ownership interests,respectively,of the company.
in september,the company created greenwich owner,which purchased the property for million.to fund the purchase and development of the property,two loans were obtained.the company obtained an million mortgage loan from anglo irish bank corporation plc the anglo senior loan,with a maturity date of october.sk greenwich and w d partner obtained a million mezzanine loan the mezzanine loan from w d lender,with a maturity date of october,
the documents.several documents are relevant to this litigation.we only identify them at this point and set forth their relevant terms in the paragraphs that follow 
an operating agreement to govern the operation and management of the company,signed,as member,by w d partner and sk greenwich 
a mezzanine loan agreement,signed,as lender,by w d lender and,as borrower,by w d partner and sk greenwich 
a promissory note,signed,as borrower,by w d partner and sk greenwich,in favor of w d lender 
a pledge and security agreement pledge agreement,signed,as pledgor,by w d partner and sk greenwich,and,as lender,by w d lender.
a subordination and intercreditor agreement intercreditor agreement,signed,as senior lender,by anglo irish bank and,as mezzanine lender,by w d lender.
all five documents are dated september.
the mezzanine loan was senior to the equity investments of sk greenwich and w d partner in the company,but subordinate to the anglo senior loan.the mezzanine loan agreement gave w d lender,upon an event of default,the remedies provided by the loan documents,which included the pledge agreement.the pledge agreement gave w d lender the right to foreclose on the interests of either sk greenwich or w d lender in the company hence in the property upon an event of default.the mezzanine loan agreement provided several definitions of an event of default.a major issue on this appeal,discussed in detail below,is which of two of these definitions applied to nonpayment of the mezzanine loan.one definition identified nonpayment of the promissory note as an event of default only if there was available net cash flow.
the promissory note,evidencing the mezzanine loan,stated that it would mature on october.it was secured by percent of the ownership interests of w d partner and sk greenwich in the company,their shares in the company,which owned the property through greenwich owner.
the pledge and security agreement obligated sk greenwich and w d partner to pay or satisfy all of the obligations including the full amount of the promissory note.
the intercreditor agreement recited the agreement of anglo irish bank to lend million to greenwich owner.paragraph d of the intercreditor agreement provided 
until all of borrower,the company obligations under the anglo senior loan documents have been paid and performed in full,no payment whatsoever shall be made to mezzanine lender,w d lender by or on behalf of borrower,the company,mezzanine borrower,w d partner and sk greenwich,or any guarantor for or on account of any amount due under the mezzanine loan documents.
despite the prohibition on payment of the mezzanine loan prior to the full payment of the anglo senior loan,the intercreditor agreement also provided that upon the occurrence of an event of default under the mezzanine loan documents,w d lender could commence an enforcement action to enforce the mezzanine pledge or conduct a sale of the ownership interests pursuant to the mezzanine pledge.id.b.the intercreditor agreement also stated,this agreement is for the sole benefit of the anglo senior lender,mezzanine lender,and their respective successors and permitted assigns.id.
extension of the anglo senior loan.in the summer of,a few months before the anglo senior loan was to mature,the company was preparing to spend more than developing the property.the company still needed to remove tenants,develop architectural and design plans,obtain proper building and zoning permits,and secure construction financing.in anticipation of these steps,karmely and dagmi,as the company,negotiated an extension of the anglo senior loan from a maturity date of october,to december,a date ninety days after the stated maturity of the mezzanine loan.there was no discussion,however,about extending the mezzanine loan maturity date past october.in exchange for the extension,the company had to an interest and carry reserve of several million dollars,provide million in personal security for the loan,and give a million personal completion guaranty.relying upon dagmi alleged statements that the w d entities would fund the project to completion,sk greenwich posted million in cash,representing its share of the required capital contribution.in a meeting on december,wertheimer reaffirmed dagmi commitment to fund the project to completion.
throughout,sk greenwich continued its efforts to redevelop the property by meeting with designers,architects,and contractors.the company again requested an extension of the anglo senior loan.the anglo irish bank agreed,but the extension was conditioned upon the company paying million as an interest and carry reserve.sk greenwich paid approximately of that amount.in july,anglo irish bank again extended the maturity date of the loan,this time to december.
default and sale of sk greenwich interests.on september,w d lender sent a letter to sk greenwich and w d partner,stating that the principal and interest on the mezzanine loan,due on october,had not been paid and that an event of default had occurred under the mezzanine loan agreement and the pledge agreement.on october,w d lender sent another letter to sk greenwich,stating that w d lender intended to sell sk greenwich percent interest in the company at a public auction on october.
on october,sk greenwich filed a complaint in new york state supreme court,seeking a declaratory judgment that sk greenwich was not in default,and that no event of default could occur until payments to w d lender were permitted under the anglo senior loan documents,and there was available net cash flow under the operating agreement.sk greenwich also sought an order barring w d lender from selling sk greenwich interest in the company.appellees removed the case to the southern district of new york.the court denied the appellants motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.after the district court order,w d lender auctioned sk greenwich interest in the company.the only participant in the auction was w d lender representative,who successfully bid for sk greenwich interest in the company.
on january,anglo irish bank declared the company in default for failure to pay the anglo senior loan on its extended maturity date of december.shortly thereafter,a wertheimer family company purchased the anglo senior loan from anglo irish bank.the w d entities eventually sold the property for million,realizing profits of more than million,and without providing compensation to sk greenwich for its capital contributions or work as an operating member.
the appellants filed an amended complaint seeking monetary damages for breach of the mezzanine loan documents tortious interference with contract breach of the operating agreement account stated breach of fiduciary duty and promissory estoppel.the essence of their claims was that the appellees were not entitled to foreclose on sk greenwich interests in the company,thereby extinguishing sk greenwich interest in the property.the appellees filed a motion to dismiss under.b.the district court granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety and dismissed the amended complaint.karlemy,cv,wl.the court ruled that the language of the mezzanine loan agreement was unambiguous and that an event of default had occurred within the meaning of subparagraph.c of that agreement,entitling the appellees to foreclose on sk greenwich interest in the company and the property.
discussion 
two aspects of the transaction at issue should be noted at the outset.first,karmely,the party complaining of the foreclosure of its interests,and dagmi,who,along with his partner wertheimer,control the entity that foreclosed on karmely interests,have been close friends,in a family relationship of trust,for more than years.second,unlike a typical loan transaction between a bank and a borrower,the mezzanine loan underlying the foreclosure of karmely interests was made by a lender to itself and the lender partner.the lender was w d lender the borrowers were sk greenwich,karmely,and w d partner,acting by w d lender,the sole member of w d partner we do not doubt that an entity can make a loan to itself and its partner,but the unusual nature of such an arrangement prompts close scrutiny of the documents purporting to provide the lender with a right to foreclose on the partner interests for an alleged default on the loan.
availability of a foreclosure remedy 
the ultimate issue is whether the relevant documents unambiguously accord w d lender a right to foreclose on sk greenwich percent interest in the property for failure to pay the promissory note at maturity.w d lender did not sue the appellants for nonpayment of the mezzanine loan,but instead foreclosed on sk greenwich collateral securing the loan.sk greenwich pending lawsuit seeks damages for what it contends was an unauthorized foreclosure mellon bank,united bank of new york,cir neither party disputed that breach had occurred question was whether an event of default had occurred permitting the remedy of acceleration of a loan.
in considering whether the appellants amended complaint was properly dismissed,we do not decide whether the relevant documents accord w d lender a right to foreclose.our concern at this preliminary stage of the litigation is only whether there is sufficient ambiguity,either in the phrases of any one document or between conflicting language in any of the documents,to preclude granting a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
the promissory note itself does not contain a foreclosure remedy in the event of nonpayment of the principal.its one reference to an event of default is in section,which provides that the failure of the borrower sk greenwich and w d partner to pay w d lender any equity distributions while the note remains outstanding is an event of default.the pledge agreement and the mezzanine loan agreement both provide foreclosure remedies upon an event of default.subparagraph i ii of schedule d of the pledge agreement includes as an event of default failure to make timely payment of any amounts due under the loan.section of the mezzanine agreement includes a more detailed list of eleven items each of which is an event of default and some of which are subject to limitations.
we focus on the items in the section list for two reasons.first,specific language in a contract will prevail over general language where there is an inconsistency between two provisions.paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir.as we discuss below,the repayment obligation,failure of which constitutes an event of default,is more restrictive in the mezzanine agreement than in the pledge agreement.second,the appellees notice of default to sk greenwich asserted that an event of default had occurred under one of the default provisions of section of the mezzanine agreement,specifically,paragraph c.
section of the mezzanine agreement contains two definitions of an event of default,the choice of which is at the heart of the current controversy.
paragraph a provides 
the failure by the borrower to pay any installment of principal,interest,or other payments required under the note when due,provided however that at the time such payment is due i payments to the lender are permitted under the senior loan documents referring to the anglo irish loan,and ii there is available net cash flow or capital events proceeds as defined in the operating agreement of partners.emphasis in original.
paragraph c provides 
the failure of the borrower or any other party to any loan document other than this agreement to observe or perform any agreement,covenant or obligation of it contained in such loan document,which failure continues beyond the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period if one is provided.
a principal issue is whether a,with its available net cash flow limitation on the borrower payment obligation,or c,without such a limitation,applies,not to sk greenwich repayment obligation,but to w d lender right to foreclose as a remedy for nonpayment,in other words,whether an event of default permitting foreclosure occurred.
the appellees argue that they were entitled to foreclose by virtue of the definition of an event of default in subparagraph c of the mezzanine agreement.the appellants argue that subparagraph a controls and prevented w d lender from deeming nonpayment an event of default permitting foreclosure because net cash flow was not then available.
the district court rejected the appellants argument for two reasons.first,judge patterson read subparagraph a to apply only to timely nonpayment of any installment of principal and not to the obligation to pay the principal amount at maturity,leaving subparagraph c to apply to nonpayment of the principal amount at maturity.see karmely,wl,at.he cited the black law dictionary definition of installment as a periodic partial payment of a debt.id.at citing black law dictionary ed.second,he reasoned that the appellants argument,precluding default for nonpayment in the absence of available net cash flow,could lead to the perpetual nonpayment of the principal amount if the project did not generate revenue,a prospect he thought sophisticated parties would not have agreed to.id.at.
although the terms of subparagraph c itself are not ambiguous,we see several ambiguities in the mezzanine loan agreement,starting with an initial ambiguity as to whether subparagraph a or subparagraph c applies to the determination of whether an event of default had occurred.comparison of the wording of a and c reveals a textual argument favoring application of a,or,at least creating ambiguity as to whether c applies.a defines an event of default as the failure of the borrower to pay any installment of principal,interest,or other payments,whereas c defines an event of default as the failure of the borrower to observe or perform any agreement,covenant,or obligation.mezzanine loan agreement,a,c emphases added.this variation in the emphasized wording suggests that a applies to all requirements to pay money and c applies to requirements to do things other than pay money.the loan documents impose on the borrower many requirements other than the payment of money,to furnish financial data,mezzanine loan agreement,to give the lender prompt notice of damage to the property,id,to comply with environmental laws,id.c,and to deliver to the lender copies of insurance policies,pledge agreement b.having separately stated requirements to make payments and to perform obligations not requiring payments is not unusual.see,abundance partners lp quamtel,d,greystone bank skyline woods realty,llc,d,in re cabrini medical center,wl,at.july,
even if a comparison of the wording of a and c favors making a the applicable definition of an event of default,the wording of a itself creates a further ambiguity as to its applicability.there is an ambiguity in the phrase of a requiring the borrowers to pay any installment of principal,interest,or other payments required under the note when due.one interpretation of that phrase is that installment applies to each of the three items in the series,principal,interest,and other payments.a second interpretation is that installment applies only to principal,and does not apply to interest or other payments.the district court ruled that the first interpretation applied and also ruled that payment of the entire principal of the mezzanine loan would not be payment of an installment.see karmely,wl,at.from these rulings,the court concluded that a was not the relevant provision defining event of default,leaving c,the provision without the available net cash flow limitation,as the applicable provision defining a default warranting foreclosure.see id.at.
courts encountering the issue whether an adjective modifying the first word of a series modifies all the words in the series have yielded varying results several courts have ruled that the adjective modifies all the words in the series.see,washington education national right to work legal defense foundation,fed.appx,cir united states fidelity guaranty fireman fund insurance,cir.at least one court has ruled that the adjective modifies only the first word of the series.see clarkson town of florence,d.some courts have ruled that the adjective modifies all the words in the series unless another adjective modifies a word in the series,see village of hobart tcgc,llc,mc,wl,at,ward general insurance services,employers fire insurance,as when the word other modifies the last word in the series,see kelley dahle,c,wl,at.july,which is true of the wording of a.encountering the problem in the context of statutory language,the ninth circuit observed that the text alone was unclear.see united states lacy,cir 
in the pending case,the arguments for not reading an installment of to modify other payments are that a principal is often repaid in installments,and partial repayments of principal were explicitly contemplated,see promissory note c b interest was specified to be paid quarterly,see id.first,and installment payments of quarterly interest payments would be unusual and c there is nothing in the documents to suggest that other payments required under the note when due were to be paid in installments 
under the appellants interpretation,limiting installment to partial payments of principal,payment of the entire principal at maturity would be an example of other payments required under the note when due.judge patterson expressed the view that the other payments phrase applied to any equity distributions that the mezzanine borrower received,distributions that it was obliged to turn over to the mezzanine lender.see karmely,wl,at.even if that is so,the phrase could also have applied to the mezzanine borrower obligation to pay the principal of the note at maturity.
the appellants cite a delaware district court decision that lends considerable support to their interpretation of.a.see falco alpha affiliates,no,wl.a lease provided for immediate termination i n the event of any default of tenant in paying any installment of basic rental,additional rent or other sums payable hereunder.id.at.for other defaults,the tenant had days to cure.see id.the dispute concerned failure to pay a security deposit.the court ruled that all monetary defaults entitled the landlord to immediate termination and that failure to pay the security deposit was a monetary default.see id.at.the court implicitly applied the word installment only to the first of the three listed items.there was no claim that the security deposit was to be paid in installments.by reading the phrase other sums payable not to be modified by the word installment,the court favored the reading advanced by the appellants in our case.the appellees here attempt to distinguish falco by pointing out that the document in that case was a lease,rather than a loan,but they offer no reason why that should make any difference.the delaware district court interpretation of similar language gives the appellants here at least sufficient support to render the wording of a ambiguous.
even if the phrase other payments in.a is modified by installment,that interpretation would not necessarily carry the day for the appellees.such an interpretation would create a tension between the unlikelihood that payment of the entire principal at maturity would be considered an installment and the comparison of the wording of a and c that makes only a applicable to obligations to pay money.judge patterson resolved that tension by deeming c applicable.that is one way but not the only plausible way to resolve the ambiguity.
judge patterson offered an additional reason for rejecting the possibility that a,with its available net cash flow limitation,applied to sk greenwich payment obligation and consequent exposure to the foreclosure remedy.he reasoned that sophisticated parties would not agree to a loan agreement that might never be paid although that may be true of traditional transactions such as loans by a bank,it is not necessarily true of a lender and a borrower who,as partners,both put up capital in a real estate venture.the lender partner might well have required the loan to be repaid at maturity,but,at the time the documents were drafted for the parties joint real estate development,it might also have been willing to defer foreclosure of its partner interests as a remedy for nonpayment until cash flow from their development project was available.that seems likely,and at least plausible,where the partners have enjoyed a family relationship of trust for more than years.this likelihood is enhanced by the assurance that the appellees gave karmely that they would fund the project to completion,an assurance on which karmely relied to advance fresh funds 
an appellate division decision has noted that the most persuasive evidence of the agreed intention of the parties in those circumstances where agreements are not clear is what the parties did when the circumstances arose.webster red seal publications,gilberton world wide publications,aff.the appellants contend that after october,at a time when the appellees say that an event of default permitting foreclosure had occurred,the appellees continued to deal with karmely as an operating member of the partnership,insisted that he help obtain extensions of the anglo senior loan,that he make additional capital contributions,and that he extend his million personal guarantees of the anglo senior loan,and that these dealings with karmely continued after the alleged event of default.
in view of all of these considerations,we believe that on appeal of a ruling dismissing the amended complaint there is sufficient ambiguity to require a remand.the ambiguities are sufficient to let the appellants present whatever extrinsic evidence they might offer on remand to resolve these ambiguities and show,at summary judgment or trial,that the appellees foreclosure remedy as distinguished from a suit on the promissory note was not intended to be used in the absence of available net cash flow to pay the note such evidence would include at least the appellees continued dealings with karmely after the maturity date of the note,as alleged in the amended complaint.discovery might well lead to other relevant evidence.
ii.whether the intercreditor agreement benefits the appellants 
a second issue,distinct from the issue whether the available net cash flow limitation of a applies to limit w d lender foreclosure remedy,is whether any provisions of the intercreditor agreement benefit the appellants.that issue turns initially on whether all of the documents,including the intercreditor agreement,can be looked at as one set of integrated transactions.the documents were all executed on the same date,september,and relate to the same real estate development,and they should be construed together.see tvt records island def jam music group,cir this is me,taylor,cir.doing so,however,does not necessarily carry the day for the appellants unless language in the intercreditor agreement benefits the appellants.
the appellants begin their invocation of the intercreditor agreement by citing section of the mezzanine loan agreement,which states that its terms and those of the mezzanine loan are expressly made subject to the terms and provisions of the intercreditor agreement,and section of the pledge agreement,which contains virtually identical language.from the intercreditor agreement itself the appellants rely primarily on paragraph d,which provides that until the anglo senior loan has been paid,no payment whatsoever shall be made to mezzanine lender by mezzanine borrower the appellants argue that this prohibition on payment of the mezzanine loan insulates them from having to pay the mezzanine loan at maturity because the anglo senior loan was then unpaid.
judge patterson rejected the appellants reliance on paragraph d for several reasons.first,he interpreted it not to prohibit payments by the mezzanine borrower to the mezzanine lender.see karmely,wl,at.although the prohibitory language of paragraph d seems clear,he pointed out that paragraph d also contains language obliging the mezzanine borrower to hold in trust and pay to the anglo senior lender any payments received by the mezzanine borrower on the mezzanine loan.see id.from this language he concluded that the terms of the intercreditor agreement contemplated that w d lender might receive payments from the borrower,and outlined w d lender obligations if such a situation came to pass.id.
judge patterson also ruled that nothing in the intercreditor agreement could benefit the appellants because they were neither parties to that agreement nor beneficiaries of it,and because,as he interpreted the agreement,several of its provisions preserved the obligation of the borrowers of the mezzanine loan to repay the loan at maturity and also preserved w d lender enforcement remedies in the event of nonpayment.see karmely,wl,at.he cited paragraphs c,b,h i,and section.we consider each of these provisions separately.
paragraph c provides 
u ntil all of the obligations of the mezzanine lender set forth in the anglo senior loan documents have been paid and performed in full 
c mezzanine lender shall not exercise any rights or remedies available to mezzanine lender upon the occurrence of a breach or default under the mezzanine loan documents provided,however,that the foregoing shall not prohibit mezzanine lender from exercising its rights under the mezzanine pledge subject to the limitations set forth herein 
paragraph c is not entirely clear.it first bars the mezzanine lender from exercising its remedies upon default under the mezzanine loan,then permits the mezzanine lender to exercise its rights under the mezzanine pledge,never defines default by or otherwise,and finally makes the permission to exercise rights subject to the limitations set forth herein,which might well include paragraph d if herein means the entire document.
paragraph b also does not resolve the controversy.it appears to contemplate an enforcement action against the appellants as long as five days notice is given to the senior lender,but its precise meaning is to specify that,as long as notice is given,no consent of anglo irish bank shall be required for mezzanine lender to institute or enforce an enforcement action upon the occurrence of an event of default under the mezzanine loan documents that language,however,does not authorize an enforcement action,nor override paragraph d.and even if paragraph b implies the availability of an enforcement action by mezzanine lender,such an action is tied to an event of default under the mezzanine loan documents,which brings into play the ambiguities of the mezzanine agreement,discussed in part i above.
what judge patterson referred to as paragraph or section h i is set forth in an unnumbered and unlettered subparagraph placed within paragraph h of the intercreditor agreement.that subparagraph provides 
the foregoing provisions are solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holder or holders of the mezzanine loan and the holder or holders of the anglo senior loan,and nothing herein shall impair,as between the mezzanine borrower and mezzanine lender,the obligation of the mezzanine borrower,which is unconditional and absolute,to pay the mezzanine loan in accordance with its terms,nor shall anything herein prevent mezzanine lender from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law or under the mezzanine note,mezzanine pledge or other mezzanine loan documents,subject to the provisions of this agreement.
whether this subparagraph precludes application of paragraph d turns initially on the coverage of the words foregoing and herein,and resolution of the coverage issue requires,regrettably,an elaborate examination of the structure of the intercreditor agreement and the numbering and lettering of its sections,paragraphs,and subparagraphs.the agreement has numbered sections,most of which include several paragraphs designated with a letter.the language quoted by judge patterson is the second of two subparagraphs placed within paragraph h of section.the first subparagraph is designated i the second subparagraph is not designated at all.
judge patterson referred to this second subparagraph as paragraph h i,karmely wl,at,or section h i,id.at,and ruled that the words foregoing and herein in that subparagraph applied to the entirety of the intercreditor agreement.this is apparent because he ruled that what he called h i denied the appellants the benefit of paragraph d of the agreement,a paragraph appearing in the document several pages before section.by repeatedly citing the subparagraph as h i,judge patterson obviously thought that the provision was a subparagraph within paragraph h of section,and he read i,the character designating that subparagraph,as a lower case version of the roman numeral i a romanette,rather than a lower case letter unfortunately,just looking at the i provides no way of telling whether it is a lower case roman numeral or a lower case letter most,possibly all,type fonts use the character i for both the lower case letter i and the lower case version of roman numeral 
however,from the face of the agreement and in the absence of extrinsic evidence of intent,we conclude,at this stage of the litigation,that there is no ambiguity i
