steamship is a mutual insurance association that provided protection and indemnity insurance to vessels owned by owc,including the voyager.under the terms of the voyager insurance policy,the vessel yearly premium was assessed in six installments,four of which were invoiced during the policy year and two of which were invoiced in years thereafter.but if the vessel did not renew its insurance with steamship,all obligations for previously provided insurance came due.this acceleration of payments upon cancellation was known as a release call.
when the vessel was arrested on january,steamship had invoiced premiums for the voyager equaling.in addition,owc owed further premium amounts for insurance that had not yet been invoiced.according to steamship,the entire amount of insurance premiums owc owed for insurance provided to the voyager during policy years,and,exclusive of premiums for insurance provided after the vessel arrest,totaled.
on march,steamship intervened in this action and filed a verified complaint in rem against the voyager asserting a maritime lien for unpaid insurance premiums or,in the alternative,an administrative claim and right of priority payment under the doctrine of custodia legis.the plaintiff banks,pursuant to the district court order requiring them to defend the voyager,answered steamship complaint on the vessel behalf.thereafter,in october,the district court conducted a bench trial to adjudicate the claims of all the intervening plaintiffs against the voyager.
at trial,steamship presented the testimony of a fact witness,jonathan andrews,steamship underwriter for the voyager account,and an english law expert,charles brown.the plaintiff banks presented no rebuttal witnesses and submitted no evidence.on november,the district court entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law,including these

steamship maritime lien takes priority over the preferred ship mortgage held by plaintiff banks.
steamship provision of insurance to the vessel after the marshals arrested it does not give rise to a maritime lien because no new maritime liens may arise after the vessel is actually arrested.nor is steamship entitled to recover for its provision of insurance under the doctrine of in custodia legis,because the vessel arrest was actual,notice of arrest was published,and steamship did not obtain permission from the court to provide the voyager with insurance.
steamship witness jonathan andrews testified that is the correct amount owed by the vessel at the time of arrest.since no further lien accrued after the arrest,the total amount of steamship preferred maritime lien equals.
following entry of final judgment,on january,steamship timely filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment or to correct a clerical error in the judgment,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure e and a the motion contained a typographical error in one of its tables,causing steamship to file an amended motion on february.the district court denied steamship motion as being untimely because the amended motion rendered steamship original motion of no legal effect and the amended motion was filed outside rule e ten day window.
accordingly,the district court converted steamship rule e motion into a rule b motion for relief from judgment and considered it along with steamship rule a motion to correct a clerical error in the judgment.in its march,order,the district court denied steamship motions.steamship then appealed to this court on april.
before reaching the merits of steamship appeal,we are obliged to address the plaintiff banks argument that steamship untimely notice of appeal deprived us of appellate jurisdiction.n otice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within days from the entry of judgment,and a timely filed notice of appeal is prerequisite to this court jurisdiction.see wright preferred research,cir accord fed.a a.but

the plaintiff banks assert steamship filed its notice of appeal later than days after entry of judgment.although they concede that steamship original rule and motions were filed within ten days of the final judgment,which tolled the period for filing a notice of appeal,see,they contend that steamship amended rule and later than ten days after the district court supersede the original motions.thus,they say,filing the amended motions nullified the tolling effect of the original motions,rendering untimely steamship notice of appeal,which was filed less than thirty days after the district court decision on the amended motions,but more than thirty days after final judgment.
plaintiff banks thus posit that an amended motion supersedes the original entirely,even as to timeliness and tolling,and cite two cases for that proposition pinion dow chem,cir,and young city of mount ranier,cir.both are inapposite.in pinion,a panel of this court considered whether the district court could extend the deadline for filing original motions.at.and in young,the fourth circuit considered whether a litigant could challenge the dismissal of claims asserted in the original complaint but not in an amended complaint.at.neither case decided whether an amended rule or motion destroys the original motion tolling effect.instead,this question is controlled by pate seaboard,cir.in pate,following an adverse judgment,appellants timely filed a rule motion for new trial,then,seven months later,amended their motion,asserting new grounds.the district court denied the motion.appellee challenged this court jurisdiction and the district court power to grant a new trial on grounds raised only in the amended rule motion filed outside the mandatory and jurisdictional time constraints of.b.id.at.we squarely rejected that argument,reasoning that o nce an effective new trial motion has been made,and the finality of the judgment for purposes of appeal has been thereby suspended,there is no reason for foreclosing amendment of the motion when this would be justified according to the usual standards for permitting amendments.id.at.thus,we concluded that a district court may,in its discretion,allow an amendment to a timely motion for a new trial prior to its decision on the merits of the motion and that the court may consider new grounds raised in the amended motion.id.at.
because the ten day period for filing a rule motion is jurisdictional and can not be extended,and pate grants district courts the discretion to consider amendments to timely filed rule motions,it follows that an amended motion does not supersede the original for purposes of timeliness or,by extension,tolling.simply put,steamship amended rule and motions did not affect the tolling of the original,motions and thus steamship notice of appeal was timely filed.plainly,we have jurisdiction over the appeal.
steamship argues that two substantive errors require us to reverse the district court order.first,the district court erred in denying it recovery for insurance provided to the voyager after the vessel arrest.and second,the district court miscalculated the amount of steamship lien for insurance provided before the vessel arrest.
we reject the first argument for two reasons steamship is not entitled,under the doctrine of custodia legis,to equitable prioritization of its claim for the value of insurance it provided to the vessel after its arrest because it did not first seek or receive the district court permission to provide such insurance and the mere fact that steamship provided insurance pursuant to an ongoing contract does not mean steamship possessed a unitary lien for the value of pre and insurance,because the vessel arrest stopped the lien accrual.we accept steamship second argument,however,because it is clear the district court improperly calculated the amount of steamship lien by including only the value of insurance steamship invoiced to owc before the vessel arrest.the proper calculation should have included the value of all insurance steamship provided to the vessel before its arrest,regardless of whether it had yet been invoiced.
as for the first argument,steamship claims that the obligation for the entire insurance premium arose at the inception of the policy year,as did the priority fmla lien,therefore the custodia legis doctrine was invalidly invoked to cut off steamship lien for the insurance provided for the days after the arrest.we disagree.

here,the district court determined that equity and good conscience counseled against giving priority to steamship claims for insurance provided.the district court acknowledged the general rule against accrual of liens after arrest and the equitable principle of awarding priority for certain claimants who provide services to a vessel after its arrest.the trial court noted that the voyager arrest was actual,rather than nominal,and notice of the arrest was published in various newspapers.moreover,the voyager ceased normal operations during its arrest.the district court also found that steamship did not apply for,and did not obtain,permission from either this court or the bankruptcy court to render insurance services in custodia legis.and,as the district court noted,it was the responsibility of the vessel court appointed custodian to obtain insurance for the vessel during the period following arrest.accordingly,the district court declined to exercise its equitable power to grant a priority to steamship claims for insurance provided.
steamship argues,however,it possesses a maritime lien for insurance because it provided the insurance pursuant to an ongoing contract that began.in such a case,steamship contends,the vessel arrest can not stop the lien accrual.
steamship is right that some courts have held that all performance under an ongoing contract acquires a single attachment date for purposes of according priority among competing liens.but it does not follow that a maritime lien continues to accrue after the vessel arrest.for example,steamship cites to bank one.v.dean mv,cir.there,bargecarib sued the dean asserting a lien for breach of a charter party.bank one acquired a mortgage against the vessel after bargecarib charter began,but before breach of the charter party occurred.bank one mortgage claim took priority over all other claims against the vessel except for preferred maritime liens,and bargecarib lien for breach of a charter party was preferred only if it arose before the mortgage was filed.the case presented a question of priority among competing liens whether the lien attached when the charterer took control of the vessel,or whether the lien attached only at the moment of breach.id.the court held that a maritime lien for breach of a charter attaches when the owner places the vessel at the charterer disposal and remains inchoate until perfected by a breach or discharged by the undisturbed end of the charter.id.at.
bank one is uninstructive for several reasons.first,it involved a maritime lien for breach of a charter party,not provision of necessaries,so its discussion of whether the lien arose at the start of performance or at breach is wholly inapposite.a lien for necessaries arises,pursuant to clear statutory language,when the claimant provides necessaries to the vessel.see.second,bank one merely established the date of first performance as the attachment date for a lien arising from breach of an ongoing contract it said nothing about whether such a lien continues to accrue after a vessel arrest.
steamship also relies on caterpillar financial services aleutian chalice,wl,which is likewise unavailing.there,an insurer contracted with the vessel to provide necessaries insurance for one year.nine days after the policy year began,a financial firm acquired a mortgage against the vessel that took priority over all subsequent maritime liens.the mortgagor argued that the fmla creates a lien only for necessaries that are actually provided to a vessel,and a year insurance is provided incrementally rather than in a lump sum.since the vessel was insured for only nine days before the mortgage attached,the mortgagor contended that the insurer possessed a preferred maritime lien for only nine days premium the remainder of the unpaid premium would give rise to a maritime lien,but without priority over the mortgage lien.the district court rejected this argument,holding that insurance is provided on a continual basis rather than episodically,and therefore the insurance contract gave rise to a single lien for unpaid premiums with an attachment date of the first day of performance.id.at.thus,the entire lien acquired priority over the mortgage because performance began before the mortgage attached.id.
caterpillar financial,bank one,and the other cases steamship cites,however,stand merely for a rule of priority ranking ongoing performance under a single contract gives rise to a single lien,and the first day of performance establishes the lien attachment date for priority ranking purposes.those cases have nothing to say about whether the quantum of a maritime lien for unpaid insurance,having attached at the outset of the policy period,continues to accrue after the vessel arrest.
steamship has failed to cite any authority and we can find none establishing that ongoing contracts present an exception to the general rule that providing necessaries creates no lien.in other contexts,such as the collection of seamen wages,we have applied the custodia legis doctrine to cut short the accrual of a maritime lien.see,the astoria agencies,cir moreover,the exception steamship advocates would be contrary to the doctrine underlying policy controlling custodial expenses and preserving the res for valid lienholders.see the poznan,at.priority should be accorded to claims for expenses only where the expense is for the common benefit and which,in equity and good conscience,should be satisfied before the libelants may enjoy the fruits of their liens pyne oil screw fishing vessel chrisway,admiralty courts must maintain some sort of control over custodial expenses which are incurred in the protection of property while in the marshal custody.they can not be determined or measured by the voluntary action of parties at interest and the latter act at their risk in the absence of express authorization.
thus,we hold that steamship continued provision of insurance after the voyager arrest did not give rise to a lien.moreover,since steamship concedes that it provided insurance without seeking the court imprimatur and no other piece of evidence establishes that the equities somehow favor steamship,we are fully satisfied that the district court acted well within its discretion by declining to award steamship a priority claim for provision of insurance.
as for the amount of its lien for insurance provided,steamship argues that the district court erred by calculating the quantum of its maritime lien as the sum of premiums invoiced,rather than the total amount of insurance provided.we agree.
in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court held that b ecause insurance is essential to keep a vessel in commerce,insurance is a necessary and unpaid premiums give rise to a maritime lien under the fmla a ll elements of the fmla are satisfied and steamship holds a maritime lien.the district court noted that steamship witness jonathan andrews testified that is the correct amount owed by the vessel at the time of arrest,and without further explanation concluded that steamship total preferred maritime lien is.

the evidence at trial clearly established that the voyager owed steamship unpaid premiums for insurance.steamship presented a corporate representative,andrews,who testified as to the billing arrangement by which member ships yearly premiums came due 
q and are you familiar with how the premiums were assessed or debited for this roc fleet entries for year 
a yes,they were debited in six installments,four of which were debited within the policy year,two of which were debited in the subsequent two years.so there is a very long lead time into the payment of the full hundred percent premium.
q given that it there are two debited premiums outside the policy year,what occurs if a member decides not to renew the policy for the following year 
a well,they are brought forward so as to insurer sic that the owner that is leaving the club does leave an outstanding debt that would have to be made up by the members of the club that remain.
steamship followed the same pattern of billing in the preceding years as well.this meant that at the end of a policy year,the vessel would still owe two of six premium payments.as andrews testified because of the installment program that the club operates,there will be premiums debited for payments in relation to the and policy years,as i described earlier,that would fall due for payment in the next two calendar years.indeed,after the end of the policy year,when owc did not renew insurance on the voyager,steamship brought forward all premium payments owing for policy years.
the evidence adduced at trial is clear and uncontradicted that on the date of the vessel arrest,steamship had provided insurance coverage to the vessel for which steamship received no payment.the evidence also clearly established that,while was the amount currently due when the vessel was arrested,steamship had provided insurance to the vessel that had not come due before the vessel arrest.thus,owc actually owed a larger sum in unpaid premiums 
nevertheless,the district court held that steamship lien equaled only.in reaching this conclusion,the district court apparently made the legal determination that steamship maritime lien was limited to premiums invoiced before the voyager arrest.this was error.the fmla provides that a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner has a maritime lien on the vessel.the statute language states clearly that one acquires a maritime lien by providing necessaries to a vessel,id.emphasis added,not by issuing an invoice.thus,the federal courts have consistently held that a maritime lien arises when the necessary is provided to the vessel.see,piedmont george creek coal seaboard fisheries.explaining that a maritime lien arises immediately and secretly when necessaries are provided to the vessel container applications int l,lykes.steamship,in re container applications int,cir explaining that a maritime lien claimant must have provided necessaries to a vessel,by order of the owner or an authorized agent foss launch tug char ching shipping,cir same riffe petroleum cibro sales,cir under the fmla,a lien arises automatically upon the furnishing of necessaries ports auth.barge,cir same thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed same.
in view of this principle of law,the district court judgment to the contrary is plainly wrong.steamship possessed a maritime lien for the insurance it provided before the vessel arrest,the timing of invoices notwithstanding.the amount of steamship lien should equal the total value of insurance steamship provided to the vessel before its arrest.accordingly,we are required to vacate the district court judgment as to steamship,and remand for further proceedings to the amount of steamship lien in light of the principles set forth herein
