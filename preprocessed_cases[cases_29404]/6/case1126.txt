background 
the history and circumstances surrounding the thrift crisis of the early and the enactment of firrea,have been extensively discussed in the original winstar cases and will be revisited only as necessary to the present case.see united states winstar,d winstar iii.the savings and loan industry in the southwestern united states in the late was in a state of crisis hundreds of thrifts were either insolvent or on the verge of insolvency,and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic lacked sufficient funds to liquidate all the troubled thrifts.in response,the federal home loan bank board fhlbb approved the southwest plan on february,to provide government assistance to induce private capital investors to bail out failed savings and loans in the southwestern united states.under this program,fhlbb grouped insolvent thrifts into packages for sale to investors,and offered a wide variety of incentives,including guaranteed assistance payments,regulatory forbearances,and shared tax benefits.the goal of the southwest plan was to attract new capital and management to the thrift industry,eliminate branch redundancies,and reduce the operating expenses of failing thrifts.
james fail,on behalf of lifeshares group,lifeshares,an insurance company he owned,and sidney steiner,on behalf of the acquisition group,entered into a partnership the fail group to acquire a group of fifteen insolvent thrifts that eventually became bluebonnet savings bank.the majority of the negotiations between the fail group and fslic were conducted by harry carneal,executive vice president of lifeshares,and robert roe,an employee of the southwest plan office and fslic main negotiator for the bluebonnet thrifts.in response to a request by fslic that fail identify the source for a portion of his funding for the acquisition,fail and carneal each wrote letters to stuart root,executive director of fslic discussing the plans for capitalization and fail commitment to infuse million into the newly formed thrift.the fail letter was dated december,and the carneal letter was dated december.root provided a memorandum to fhlbb recommending that it accept the fail group bid and approve the acquisition on december.that same day,fhlbb approved the fail group bid to acquire bluebonnet,but conditioned its approval on fail and cfsb identifying the source of a portion of the funding for the acquisition as recommended by the corporate and securities division casd of the office of general counsel in its review of the proposed bid casd memo.
bluebonnet and fslic entered into the following agreements an assistance agreement,pursuant to which,fail and cfsb agreed to recapitalize bluebonnet by infusing million over a two year period and fslic agreed to provide assistance to bluebonnet that exceeded billion,including fslic promissory notes,asset coverage and yield maintenance a capital maintenance agreement cma which imposed a number of conditions upon cfsb and bluebonnet concerning certain ownership and operation issues a capital forbearance that allowed bluebonnet to maintain capital levels lower than those required by regulation but at levels which would increase each year and a dividend forbearance,which permitted bluebonnet to pay cash dividends of up to of its net retained earnings beginning december,if it met the capital levels contained within the cma and if declaring common stock dividends would not cause it to fall below these capital levels.in connection with the cma,cfsb agreed to purchase and at all times own of the common stock of bluebonnet,and fslic obtained the right to seize bluebonnet in the event cfsb failed to timely make the capital infusions or to maintain capital compliance.
pursuant to the assistance agreement,fail and cfsb agreed to recapitalize bluebonnet by infusing million over a period,with million due the day the assistance agreement was signed,and an additional million due on the first and second anniversary dates.the assistance agreement required that of the total infusion be raised through the sale of capital notes and consist of equity.with respect to the initial million,cfsb agreed to infuse million into bluebonnet through the purchase of bluebonnet common stock.the remaining million would be infused in the form of subordinated debt issued by bluebonnet and to be purchased by lifeshares or one of its affiliates.the assistance agreement also required that cfsb purchase million of bluebonnet common stock on each of the two successive anniversaries of the effective date,while lifeshares would either purchase or place with an unaffiliated third party million of subordinated debt each year.
to meet the initial capital infusions required under the assistance agreement,mutual security life insurance company msl,a company owned by fail,purchased million of subordinated debt issued by bluebonnet and cfsb purchased million in bluebonnet common stock funded by a loan in that amount from bankers life and casualty company bankers life,an insurance company affiliated with robert shaw.fail common stock shares in lifeshares and cfsb were used as collateral for the bankers life loan.the final million was raised on december,when fail and cfsb entered into a loan agreement with bankers life to allow fail to purchase the remaining million of bluebonnet common stock.on march,fhlbb issued a technical amendment to its initial approval of the acquisition,which permitted bluebonnet to treat certain subordinated debt as regulatory capital subordinated debt forbearance.
during,considerable efforts were made by fail to secure capital sources that either were willing to invest in bluebonnet or to provide financing.he sent john kirchhofer,a business representative of steiner,and carneal to meet with potential capital sources.kirchhofer focused on finding a partner.a partner is an investor with substantial net earnings capable of utilizing the net operating losses generated by bluebonnet.between february and august,kirchhofer met with three potential partners and two investment banking firms,but was unable to obtain financing.in early,carneal met with several new york investment banking firms,in an effort to find investors willing to provide either equity or debt financing,but also was unsuccessful.fail also utilized accounting firms,consultants,and law firms to help search for candidates willing to provide financing or to be a partner.
on august,firrea was signed into law.firrea and its implementing regulations changed the capital requirements applicable to thrifts,imposing core capital,tangible capital,and capital requirements.the most important of these changes for bluebonnet was the new requirement to maintain core capital equal to at least of assets.t a supp.i.firrea also altered the then existing regulatory regime,replacing fhlbb and fslic with a new agency,the office of thrift supervision ots.a thrift deposit insurance fund was also created which the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic would oversee.finally,firrea prohibited bluebonnet from treating subordinated debt as regulatory capital,which decreased bluebonnet regulatory capital level by million,the amount of the subordinated debt note issued to msl.as a result,bluebonnet core capital ratio dropped to of assets,which failed to comply with firrea new core capital requirement.
concerned with a threat of seizure and because neither fail nor cfsb had sufficient funds to infuse capital into bluebonnet,the board of directors of bluebonnet board of directors informed robert brick,caseload manager of ots,of firrea impact on bluebonnet existing capital structure.after rejecting a series of proposals by the board of directors,ots ultimately approved a plan,which called for bluebonnet to issue,and cfsb to purchase,million of perpetual preferred stock in place of the subordinated debt.on december,cfsb infused million into bluebonnet which it obtained from consolidated national successor corporation cnc,a holding company owned in part by shaw.cnc also agreed to refinance the bankers life loan.in exchange,cnc obtained,among other things,a right to contingent interest amounting to of the profits of cfsb,together with the right to acquire bluebonnet,or,alternatively,of the net proceeds of a potential sale of bluebonnet.
when this infusion proved insufficient to restore capital compliance,bluebonnet management took additional steps to adequately capitalize the thrift.these efforts included shrinking bluebonnet in size by selling approximately million in assets and retaining all of its net earnings to date for use as regulatory capital,despite the provision of the dividend forbearance,which permitted the distribution of of its net retained earnings on december.as a result of management efforts,bluebonnet was able to achieve capital compliance by december.
again in,carneal and kirchhofer individually met with several potential capital sources.although some of these investors expressed interest,none chose to finance the infusion.throughout may,the board of directors sought to declare dividends,but ots denied these requests,reasoning that bluebonnet was only marginally compliant with its capital requirements and that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain whether bluebonnet would remain compliant.on september,the board of directors sought approval to declare a common stock dividend of million to cfsb,which cfsb would then use to purchase million in common stock and million in subordinated debt.ots denied this request.when on october,the board of directors again sought regulatory approval to declare a dividend,ots officially objected to the board of director notice to declare dividends,and informed them that bluebonnet could not declare dividends until it provided fdic with a satisfactory commitment to infuse the remainder of the million in capital and subordinated debt.by the end of november,no new financing had been secured and fail and cfsb were unable to provide fdic with a satisfactory commitment.on november,ots deemed bluebonnet to be an institution requiring more than normal supervision,pursuant to ots regulatory bulletin.this prohibited bluebonnet from engaging in certain business activities,including declaring dividends,without first receiving approval from ots.
with less than one month remaining before the infusion was due,and with approximately million in outstanding debt to bankers life and cnc,fail and cfsb returned to shaw for help.on december,fail and cfsb entered separate loan agreements with marquette national life insurance company marquette,a company owned by shaw,under which marquette loaned cfsb million for the final infusion and refinanced the and loans from bankers life and cnc.on that same date,fail entered the stock acquisition agreement with bluebonnet interests,bbi,another company owned by shaw,which gave bbi the right to seek and obtain regulatory approval to purchase cfsb from fail by december.the loan agreement with marquette included a provision that gave it the right to accelerate the due date on the loans to thirty days after it determined bbi would not acquire bluebonnet.soon after bbi entered this agreement,shaw undertook efforts to acquire bluebonnet.
on march,ots downgraded bluebonnet classification from a tier to a tier institution,which barred bluebonnet from making any capital distributions without receiving ots approval.ots denied all of the board of directors requests in to declare common stock dividends,and approved only one request to declare a preferred stock dividend of.on june,bluebonnet filed suit against the fdic in the district court for the northern district of texas,seeking a declaratory judgment as to the proper application of the assistance agreement,damages,and other relief.bluebonnet and the fslic settled portions of that case,but bluebonnet reserved its right to bring an action in the court of federal claims for claims of breach relating to capital forbearances,dividend forbearances,and dividend payments.
in september,shaw abandoned his efforts to acquire bluebonnet.fail and cfsb began negotiations with him concerning the repayment of their outstanding loans,which amounted to approximately million and were due on december.shaw and fail eventually reached a verbal agreement,which they memorialized in an exchange of letters dated october.shaw,through cnc,agreed that upon fail and cfsb reduction of their existing debt to million,cnc would execute loans of not more than that amount to them.in exchange,fail agreed to give cnc a economic interest in cfsb.at the time,fail and cfsb did not have sufficient funds to reduce their debt to the required levels.consequently,bluebonnet sought an injunction in the district court for the northern district of texas to force ots to permit,among other things,bluebonnet to distribute common stock dividends.ots subsequently rated bluebonnet as a tier institution and approved outstanding requests to declare dividends,but required that the funds be used solely to pay down acquisition debt held by fail and cfsb.
on january,fail,cfsb,and cnc executed the economic benefits agreement,eba which further detailed the agreement discussed by fail and shaw in their october,letters.pursuant to the agreement,cnc reduced the amount of debt held by fail and cfsb and provided financing for that debt,in exchange for fail essentially giving cnc a interest in the future profits of cfsb.cnc also obtained the right to receive a percentage of the proceeds from a sale of bluebonnet.the eba was amended in amended and restated economic benefits agreement areba and second amended and restated economic benefits agreement sareba without material change.
bluebonnet ultimately brought suit in the united states court of federal claims against the government for breaching the contractually assured forbearances by enacting firrea.in bluebonnet i,the court determined that the assistance agreement,cma,the fhlbb resolution,the fail letter,and the carneal letter constituted a contract,which it referred to as the transaction agreement.at.the court also held on summary judgment that the passage of firrea and its implementing regulations and related agency actions,breached the cma,dividend forbearance,and subordinated debt forbearances because the passage of firrea fundamentally altered the nature of the transaction,and changed the premises under which fail had made the deal.id.at.following a trial on the merits,however,the court of federal claims entered judgment for the government because bluebonnet failed to prove the quantum of damages to a reasonable certainty.this appeal followed.
