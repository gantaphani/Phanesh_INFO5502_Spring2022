eight sets of plaintiffs filed a discrimination lawsuit against flagstar bank.although the district court granted flagstar summary judgment against three of these sets,the claims of the other five sets proceeded to trial.a jury verdict was ultimately returned in favor of two sets of plaintiffs.these plaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney fees,expert witness fees,costs,and interest.the district court awarded a total of,plus interest,for these items.flagstar objects to several components of this total award.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court calculations of these various items,but vacate the award and remand the case for the court to reduce the attorney fees and interest to account for the fact that only the edwardses have ultimately prevailed in this litigation,and to consider whether this fact will affect its award of expert witness fees and miscellaneous costs.
background 
the jury found that two sets of the plaintiffs,the edwardses and the paschals,had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that flagstar racially discriminated against them when they applied for mortgages.a verdict of in compensatory damages was awarded to the edwardses,and in compensatory damages and in punitive damages was awarded to the paschals.
after the verdict was entered,these plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney fees,expert witness fees,costs,and interest.their motion requested in attorney fees in expert witness fees and costs consisting of a for martin wing,who testified as an expert in econometrics and provided a statistical analysis of flagstar lending practices,b for calvin bradford,who testified as a mortgage underwriting expert,c for george galster,a testing expert who was prepared to rebut flagstar expert witness,and d in miscellaneous costs interest and such other and additional relief that the court deems just and appropriate.as the district court noted,this final request is the traditional way in which an enhancement is requested.the district court granted the plaintiffs requests,including a enhancement.this timely appeal followed,with flagstar challenging all the components of plaintiffs request other than the award of interest.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court will not disturb a district court determination regarding the award of attorney fees and costs unless it concludes that the lower court has abused its discretion.perotti seiter,cir.abuse of discretion is defined as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.logan dayton hudson,cir citation omitted.an abuse of discretion exists when the district court applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard,or relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact.first tech.safety depinet,cir.
attorney fees 
flagstar claims that the district court abused its discretion in failing to review the complete billing records of the plaintiffs counsel in order to determine whether the requested fee improperly included payment for hours that the attorneys spent working on the claims of the losing plaintiffs.as the district court noted,however,flagstar does not directly take issue with the hours detailed by the plaintiffs attorneys or their hourly rates.rather,flagstar says that insufficient detail has been furnished in support of the hours of work.
the primary concern in evaluating a request for attorney fees is that the fee awarded be reasonable.reed rhodes,cir.a reasonable fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel,but does not produce windfalls to attorneys.id.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.in determining a reasonable award,the district court must calculate the lodestar amount by multiplying the reasonable number of hours billed by a reasonable billing rate.id.as noted above,this court will not overturn an award unless we conclude that the district court abused its discretion.
the district court found that the billing statements and affidavits of the plaintiffs attorneys adequately support the hours claimed.as part of their request for attorney fees,the plaintiffs submitted pages of descriptive billing entries for attorney tomkowiak and pages of descriptive entries for attorney stanton.each of the entries in these billing statements includes a detailed description of how the attorney spent the hours that he billed.some descriptions include as many as ten lines of text.the plaintiffs submitted the affidavits of three detroit lawyers who have experience litigating cases to confirm that a hourly rate for attorney tomkowiak and a hourly rate for attorney stanton were reasonable.as noted above,flagstar did not challenge the reasonableness of the requested hourly rates.
in his affidavit,attorney tomkowiak confirms that the billing statements only include attorneys fees and costs incurred on behalf of the paschals and the edwardses he specifically declares that t ime entries and costs pertaining solely to the claims of other plaintiffs and former plaintiffs have been excluded from the itemized entries for attorneys fees and costs.flagstar has failed to point to any specific entries which would cause it to doubt the veracity of attorney tomkowiak sworn statement.after reviewing the entries ourselves,we find no reason to doubt the accuracy of the billing statements or the reasonableness of the number of hours billed.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the plaintiffs in attorney fees.because,however,we have reversed the district court denial of flagstar motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the paschals claim,the attorney fees will have to be recalculated on remand.
enhancement 
flagstar claims that the district court abused its discretion in granting the plaintiffs an enhancement of.in particular,flagstar contends that two of the district court reasons for granting an arduous and time consuming nature of the litigation and the fact that the plaintiffs attorneys did an excellent job at trial are improper under supreme court precedent.flagstar also disputes the district court conclusion that the hourly rates used to calculate the lodestar award were modest.
in johnson georgia highway express,cir,the fifth circuit enunciated factors that trial courts may consider in calculating reasonable awards.the supreme court has determined that johnson list of provides a useful catalog of the many factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of an award of attorney fees blanchard bergeron,d.these factors are 
the time and labor required the novelty and difficulty of the questions the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case the customary fee whether the fee is fixed or contingent time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances the amount involved and the results obtained the experience,reputation,and ability of the attorneys the undesirability of the case the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client and awards in similar cases.
this court has held that a trial court may apply the johnson factors during its initial calculation of the award or when the court is considering a request for an enhancement.united slate,tile composition roofers g m roofing sheet metal,cir stating that the trial court should first conduct the initial evaluation,then examine the award against several factors,including the johnson factors,but also noting that trial courts usually subsume the analysis of those factors within the initial calculation.the district court should also provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for its conclusions regarding an award.hensley eckerhart,d.
in support of their request,the plaintiffs emphasized that the following factors justify an enhancement under johnson this was a relatively novel and difficult case,the issues were complex,and their attorneys incurred a significant risk in undertaking the representation.the district court began its analysis by correctly noting that the plaintiffs third reason,the contingency risk involved in this case,is not a valid ground
