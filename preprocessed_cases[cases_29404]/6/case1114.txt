this case,like others that have reached this court in the wake of the supreme court decision in united states winstar,d,involves a claim of breach of contract based on the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea,stat.in the,in the midst of the savings and loan crisis,the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic arranged for various healthy financial institutions to acquire failing savings and loan associations or thrifts.fslic settled on the acquisition strategy to minimize the number of outright failures among savings and loan associations and the consequent financial burden on fslic,as insurer of the deposits of many of those thrifts.because the failing thrifts were unattractive investment prospects on their own,fslic had to offer substantial incentives to the acquiring institutions to induce them to acquire the failing thrifts and take on their liabilities.the inducements frequently consisted of promises regarding the manner in which the acquiring institutions would be permitted to treat the acquired thrifts assets and liabilities for accounting purposes.in many instances,fslic promised the acquiring institutions that they would be allowed to include the acquired thrifts net liabilities as supervisory goodwill in their calculation of regulatory capital and to amortize the supervisory goodwill over a lengthy period of time.
in and,appellant california federal bank calfed acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of six failing thrifts in acquisitions supervised or approved by fslic or its parent,the federal home loan bank board the fhlbb.as part of the acquisition transactions,fslic and the fhlbb promised calfed that it could include more than million in supervisory goodwill in calculating its regulatory capital and that it could amortize that supervisory goodwill over an extended period.after the enactment of firrea in and the promulgation of conforming regulations,however,acquiring institutions such as calfed were no longer permitted to include supervisory goodwill as part of their regulatory capital,and they were required to write down their supervisory goodwill over a period.
based on the new restrictions on the use and amortization of supervisory goodwill,many acquiring institutions sued the government in the court of federal claims contending that the new requirements resulted in a breach of the acquisition contracts.in the winstar case,the supreme court held that the breach of the promises regarding the maintenance of regulatory capital and the depreciation of supervisory goodwill could constitute a breach of contract by the government for which acquiring institutions could recover damages.
calfed was one of the institutions that filed a breach of contract action based on the firrea provisions regarding supervisory goodwill.the trial court granted summary judgment for calfed on the issue of liability.cal.fed.bank united states.calfed then sought to recover damages on several theories,including a lost profits theory.with regard to that theory,calfed contended that the statutory and regulatory changes associated with the enactment of firrea forced it to sell certain assets,including a large number of adjustable rate mortgages arms in order to meet the new regulatory capital requirements.those arms,according to calfed,would have produced substantial profits if calfed had been able to retain them.the trial court,however,granted summary judgment for the government on that theory of recovery.cal.fed.bank united states.after a trial on the remaining claims,the court denied reliance damages and restitution,but it awarded calfed million to compensate calfed for the cost of replacing the regulatory capital lost because of the accelerated of supervisory goodwill under firrea.
both parties appealed to this court.we affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the issue of liability,but reversed the grant of summary judgment on calfed lost profits theory,holding that there were genuine issues of material fact with respect to foreseeability,causation,and the measurement of damages.cal.fed.bank,fsb united states.accordingly,we remanded for trial on damages based on calfed lost profits theory.
following a trial,the court of federal claims declined to award calfed lost profits damages.cal.fed.bank united states.the court based its ruling on three general findings that calfed had failed to prove its loss of profits from the sale of the assets,including the arms,was foreseeable that calfed had failed to prove that the arms and other assets were sold because of the breach and that the method of calculating damages advocated by calfed was too speculative to serve as the basis for a damages award.
calfed has appealed from the trial court denial of damages on a lost profits theory.the government has with respect to the issue of liability,contending that fslic did not have the authority to bind the united states contractually with respect to the acquisition transactions.
contract remedies are designed to make the nonbreaching party whole.one way to achieve that end is to give the nonbreaching party expectancy damages,the benefits the nonbreaching party expected to receive in the absence of a breach.glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,citing restatement second of contracts a.in order to be entitled to expectancy damages,which include lost profits,the plaintiff must satisfy three requirements.first,the plaintiff must show that the lost profits were within the contemplation of the parties because the loss was foreseeable or because the defaulting party had knowledge of special circumstances at the time of contracting.la van united states,energy capital united states,citing restatement second of contracts.second,the plaintiff must establish that there would have been a profit but for the breach.rumsfeld applied.third,the measure of damages must be reasonably certain,although if a reasonable probability of damage can be clearly established,uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery.glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,quoting locke united states.
for the reasons set forth below,we uphold the trial court judgment based on its ruling on the issue of causation.because that issue is dispositive of calfed appeal,we need not address the issues of foreseeability and the measurement of damages on which the trial court also ruled against calfed.
calfed first argues that the trial court used the wrong standard in determining whether calfed proved that the government breach caused the bank to sell the arms.the court relied on myerle united states,for the standard of causation that lost profits must inevitably and naturally,not possibly nor even probably flow from the defendant breach.citing bluebonnet savings bank,united states,calfed argues for a less exacting standard it contends that the breach need only be a substantial factor contributing to the loss.the court of federal claims stated that it would reach the same conclusion regardless of which of the two standards is applied.
the passage from the bluebonnet case on which calfed relies does not state or imply that the causation requirement is satisfied any time the breach is a substantial factor in causing the claimed lost profits.the court in bluebonnet noted that the trial court had found that the breach was a substantial factor in bluebonnet increased financing costs,at,reflecting the way the trial court characterized its finding.see bluebonnet sav.bank,fsb united states.importantly,however,the court upheld the trial court ruling on causation only after concluding that t he government various arguments regarding alternative causes for the damages lack merit.at.that statement is consistent with the standard applied by this court and our predecessor court in numerous cases,including the previous appeal in this case,that the causal connection between the breach and the loss of profits must be definitely established.la van united states,at tech.united states,energy capital united states,cal.fed.bank,fsb united states,neely united states.the standard set forth in those cases ensures that the nonbreaching party will not be awarded more than it would have received if the contract had been performed.applied,at.thus,the court of federal claims correctly rejected the substantial factor test advocated by calfed.
that is not to say that the breach must be the sole factor or sole cause in the loss of profits.the existence of other factors operating in confluence with the breach will not necessarily preclude recovery based on the breach.see,allan farnsworth,contracts,at ed.however,lost profits are a measurement of what a party would have received absent the breaching party action,cienega gardens united states,those losses that would not have occurred but for the breach,see san carlos irrigation drainage dist.united states.the inability to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that profits would have been made but for the breach will therefore preclude recovery on a lost profits theory.
at trial,calfed based its lost profits case on three theories of loss that the government breach forced it to shrink the size of the bank by selling nearly arms,which would have proved highly profitable if calfed had retained them that the breach forced calfed to sell california thrift loan ctl,an automobile financing company,which also would have proved profitable if calfed had retained it and that the breach forced calfed to forgo making various other highly profitable loans that it would have made if it had not had to satisfy the more exacting capital requirements following the enactment of firrea.in its opinion entered following the trial,the trial court rejected each of those theories on factual grounds.
with respect to the arms,the trial court rejected calfed assertion that the breach caused it to dispose of the arms that it claimed to have sold in order to meet the more exacting capital requirements imposed following firrea enactment.the court concluded that it was the recession in the california real estate market in the early that caused calfed to shrink the bank,not the changes in regulatory requirements that resulted from the enactment of firrea.as to calfed argument that firrea precipitated a massive of arms,the court noted that calfed had sold a roughly similar number of arms prior to the breach and that the bank business was selling loans,before and after the breach.contrary to calfed contention,the court found that the evidence at trial showed that originating mortgage loans and selling them into the secondary market was an integral part of calfed operations and that its business plan of originating and selling mortgage loans did not change after the breach.
based on the evidence at trial,the court found that calfed likely would have sold most of its adjustable rate mortgages irrespective of the breach.the court noted that at the time calfed was selling the arms,it was investing in higher risk loans,which required higher capital ratios.from that evidence,the court concluded that calfed chose to sell the arms,rather than cease acquiring assets,because it preferred to continue lending.the court also noted that the evidence showed that calfed had good reasons to sell the arms the sale satisfied management desire to generate a higher ratio of tangible net worth to tangible assets,and the bank recorded capital gains of million on the sales,which it used to offset losses.based on all the evidence,the court concluded that calfed could have remained in capital compliance without selling the arms in the aftermath of the breach and that the bank likely would have sold many or most of its adjustable rate mortgages had the breach not occurred.
with respect to the sale of ctl,the trial court similarly rejected calfed argument that the breach forced it to sell.instead,the court found that calfed sold ctl because it did not fit into calfed chief executive officer jerry dennis plan for the company.the court explained that dennis wanted to return the bank to traditional lending strategies that had made it successful.he did not view the automobile finance company as such a business.moreover,the court found that at the time calfed sold ctl,calfed capital obligations had already been satisfied,so it was not necessary for calfed to sell ctl.based on the evidence,the court concluded that dennis wanted to sell the automobile financing business calfed was not forced to sell ctl because of the breach.
with regard to the other forgone assets,calfed claimed that it suffered damages because the capital maintenance requirements forced it to forgo making other highly profitable loans and that it is entitled,as damages,to an award of the profits that it would have made on those other investments.in particular,calfed claimed that over time it would have replaced the maturing arms with other profitable loans and investments.as to the forgone assets claim,the trial court found that calfed had failed to explain credibly how it would have supported these highly profitable loans if it could have made them,or why they would have been highly profitable.the court explained that its finding on that issue was based on its discrediting the testimony of calfed expert as to the profitability of these unidentified assets.the court found persuasive the testimony of one of the government experts,who pointed out that the bank was operating in a highly competitive environment at the time and that the acquisition of additional assets would not necessarily have yielded additional profits.in fact,as the court noted,calfed return on assets during the period was actually negative.
summarizing its findings on the issue of causation,the trial court stated that the facts developed at trial did not support the basic premise of calfed provisions such as the increased capital maintenance requirements and the reduction of supervisory goodwill,which forced the bank to shrink,necessarily cost the bank money.for example,the court pointed out,calfed lost million in with billion in assets,while it earned a profit during with only billion in assets.the court concluded that s hrinking the bank in the midst of a serious recession in fact was a very good idea for calfed and that calfed therefore failed to prove with the requisite certainty that the breach caused it to lose profits that it would have obtained in the absence of the breach.thus,as the court put it,calfed did not prove that losing goodwill or replacing it with tangible capital affected its profits adversely.
on appeal,calfed focuses on the sale of the arms and on the profits that it asserts it lost by being forced to sell those assets.calfed contends that the trial court committed clear error in finding that it failed to prove a sufficient causal connection between the breach and calfed loss of profits on the arms that it claims it would have made in the absence of a breach.calfed task in challenging this intensely factual determination on appeal is an exacting one.first,calfed faces a daunting standard of review in asking us to overturn factual findings made by the trial court after hearing six weeks of sharply conflicting evidence.see bluebonnet sav.bank,at causation is a question of fact reviewed under the clear error standard.moreover,calfed theory of expectancy damages is one that we have characterized as impractical for these winstar cases,and generally not susceptible to reasonable proof,noting that given the speculative nature of such a damages claim,such a claim has yet to be successfully established in any winstar case and that experience suggests that it is largely a waste of time and effort to attempt to prove such damages.glendale fed.bank,fsb,at.after a detailed review of the evidence on which the court based its finding,we are not persuaded that calfed has demonstrated that the trial court committed clear error.
calfed asserts that the best evidence as to the critical question whether calfed would have retained the arms in the absence of a breach is the testimony of calfed officers,who testified that if calfed had not had to meet the capital maintenance requirements,it would have retained the arms.calfed argues that on the question of why the arms were sold,it was improper for the court to rely on the testimony of the government experts rather than the testimony of calfed fact witnesses,who testified about their own intentions.
the freedom to consider,credit,and discount various items of evidence is not as narrow as calfed suggests.the court,sitting as finder of fact,was entitled to weigh the credibility of calfed fact witnesses,taking into account their interest in the outcome of the litigation.at the same time,the court was entitled to consider the government expert testimony to the extent that it shed light on the economics of finance and banking and thus helped explain why calfed sold the arms following firrea enactment.although expert testimony lacking a sound scientific basis should be excluded,see daubert merrell dow,d,the expert testimony offered by the government in this case did not lack a sound scientific basis and therefore it did not constitute an abuse of discretion for the trial court to consider it,see seaboard lumber united states.
the expert testimony on which the court relied in this case provided an explanation of why a bank such as calfed might well have chosen to dispose of the arms,even in the absence of the breach,rather than retaining them,and why the sale of the arms did not necessarily result in a loss to calfed.the expert testimony thus satisfied the requirement of rule of the federal rules of evidence,which permits expert testimony to be admitted to assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.accordingly,it was not improper for the court to rely on the government expert testimony to assist it in making its factual findings on the causation issue.
one of the government experts,professor daniel fischel,testified extensively about the economics of capital requirements and the economic consequences of shedding assets in order to comply with capital requirements.with regard to calfed argument that the phasing out of supervisory goodwill deprived calfed of the ability to leverage its assets,professor fischel stated that the idea that leverage creates wealth is a fallacy 
you lose the stream of income that you would have had if you held on to the asset,but at the same time you avoid the interest expense that you also would have had if you held on to the asset.and unless there some reason to believe that you know something about these assets that the party on the other side of the transaction does know,which is really very likely in a case of something like a mortgage loan or security,the asset will sell for its fair value and the income that you lose will exactly offset,certainly as a first approximation,the interest expense that avoided.
moreover,professor fischel explained that calfed behavior was inconsistent with its theory that the sale of the arms deprived it of the ability to leverage its assets in a way that would generate large profits.in particular,he found it highly significant that for periods both before and after the enactment of firrea,calfed sold roughly the same number of arms.he explained that if the bank less leverage,less profits hypothesis were true,calfed would have stood to lose just as much from the sale of arms before the breach as it claimed to have lost afterwards.
in light of the evidence that selling arms was part of calfed normal business strategy,professor fischel concluded that calfed explanation at trial for why it sold arms before the enactment of it sold the arms as a means of controlling not provide a rational basis for distinguishing the arms sales from the sales.professor fischel explained that if calfed had regarded the arms as highly profitable,as calfed expert contended,it would have made more sense for calfed to have originated fewer loans and to have purchased fewer assets,rather than selling the arms.
finally,professor fischel,together with another government expert,william hamm,criticized the analysis of calfed expert,professor christopher james,who testified in support of calfed claim for lost profits.professor fischel and hamm criticized various details of professor james model,as well as professor james assumptions about what calfed would have done with the profits it would have earned from the arms,which did not comport with what calfed was,in reality,doing at the time.professor fischel stated that professor james model depended on calfed investing much of its capital in securities because those assets were very profitable.but professor fischel said that those securities were not in fact highly profitable.instead,he explained that they were used to strengthen the bank regulatory capital position because they had a lower risk weighting and thus would not be used to make a high profit.in fact,at that time calfed was not investing in the securities but instead was investing in loans.thus,professor fischel concluded,professor james model of causation simply did not conform to the reality of what calfed was doing at the time firrea was enacted.he explained that it is more likely that,in the absence of a breach,calfed would have continued to invest in high risk loans and not the safer securities that professor james assumes it would have invested in and profited from.
in addition to the testimony of its officers and its expert,calfed relied on certain documentary evidence to support its claim that the breach forced it to sell the arms,which it otherwise would have retained.on appeal,calfed points in particular to its quarterly report to shareholders,which stated that calfed reduc ed the level of interest earning assets as the bank continues to downsize and that t he decrease in interest earning assets is primarily the result of the sale by the bank of certain securities and loans.the report continued the reduction in the bank assets was part of the bank continuing efforts to comply with its regulatory capital requirements.as discussed in the section capital requirements,the regulatory capital required of the bank is scheduled to increase over the next three years.while that report is evidence that calfed was downsizing during that period,at least in part because of regulatory capital requirements,the report does not support calfed contention that it was required to sell the arms and that absent the breach it would have retained those assets.
other documentary evidence on which calfed relies fails to provide support for calfed basic thesis on causation.for example,calfed report stated that calfed had sold certain securities and that this reduction of calfed assets was one of the contributing factors that enabled it to meet the increased regulatory capital requirements of firrea.those statements,however,do not refer to the arms and do not suggest that the breach compelled calfed to sell the arms.moreover,the evidence indicated that the recession and increases in capital requirements that were not related to the breach were responsible for the vast bulk of the deterioration in calfed regulatory capital position.documentary references to the need to sell assets in order to achieve capital compliance therefore do not establish that the breach forced calfed to sell the arms.
the contents of certain other documents,and the absence of documentary support for calfed thesis that the breach forced it to sell the arms,buttress the trial court conclusion on causation.for example,the court referred to a lengthy statement made by a calfed a year after the breach in an effort to explain to shareholders why calfed stock price was dropping.the court found it significant that throughout the lengthy and detailed statement,the calfed representative made no reference to the sales of arms,whether because of the of supervisory goodwill or otherwise.
moreover,circulars that were published in and when calfed was seeking to sell shares in this litigation contained detailed accounts of calfed theory of recovery.yet those circulars did not specify the required sale of arms as being among the grounds for calfed claim of damages,even though the circulars identified other injuries that allegedly flowed from the breach and other specific assets that calfed had allegedly sold as a result of the breach.more generally,as the trial court noted,there was a paucity of documentary support for calfed contention that the breach compelled it to sell
