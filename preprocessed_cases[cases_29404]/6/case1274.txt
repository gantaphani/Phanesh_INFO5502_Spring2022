the question presented is whether the limitations period for a legal malpractice action under code of civil procedure section is tolled as to an attorney former law firm and one of its partners while the attorney continues to represent the client in the same subject matter at his new firm.we hold that it is tolled and therefore reverse the judgments of dismissal in favor of the former law firm and its partner following demurrers sustained without leave to amend.

allegations in the first amended 
in,beal bank acquired certain loans from another bank,which had been placed into conservatorship by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.the loan documents contained default interest clauses,which provided that in the event of default,the entire balance of principal and interest would become due and thereafter bear interest at an increased rate over and above the contract rate.the debtors missed payments on some of the loans.by the time beal bank acquired the loans,the debtors had negotiated discounted payoffs of the remaining loans with the fdic,but had failed to make those payments as well.beal bank sent notices of acceleration and default to the debtors and recorded notices of default that were based on the increased default interest rate.
in march,beal bank retained arter hadden to handle its collection efforts.dean was the attorney primarily responsible for the representation.counsel for the debtors repeatedly advised arter hadden,through correspondence and other means,that beal bank had no legal or factual basis for attempting to collect the default interest.in the first amended complaint,beal bank alleged that arter hadden failed to conduct any legal research on the issue,advise beal bank that its position was unlikely to prevail,or inform it of the risks involved in continuing to maintain its position.
in june,the collateral for the outstanding loans was transferred by the debtors to an entity the debtors controlled.on the following day,that entity filed for bankruptcy protection.gubner,an associate at arter hadden,then began representing beal bank in the bankruptcy court.on beal bank behalf,arter hadden filed a motion for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court,arguing that beal bank was entitled to recover the default interest rate.the bankruptcy court ruled against beal bank and entered its final order on may.beal bank appealed the matter to the district court,represented by arter hadden.
on december,gubner left the employ of arter hadden and formed gubner associates,which later became ezra,brutzkus gubner.in turn,gubner new firms took over representation of beal bank.in april,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling,and beal bank,represented by ezra,brutzkus gubner,appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals.on september,the ninth circuit issued its opinion,affirming the rulings of the lower courts.
in the first amended complaint,beal bank alleged that none of the defendants ever advised it of the risks associated with its legal position,thereby causing damages as follows beal bank was deprived of an opportunity to settle its disputes with the debtors on favorable terms beal bank was named as a by the debtors in an action filed in state court,which settled on terms causing economic loss to beal bank and beal bank incurred unnecessary legal fees in litigating the question of default interest before the bankruptcy court,the district court and the ninth circuit.beal bank alleged that it has suffered damages totaling more than million.
procedural history 
on september,beal bank filed an action for professional negligence against arter hadden,dean,gubner and gubner two law firms.two days later,gubner filed a notice of withdrawal as counsel for beal bank in the bankruptcy court.in november,beal bank and the defendants entered into a written tolling agreement,which provided that the period between september,and december,would not be included in determining the applicability of any statute of limitations.beal bank dismissed its complaint without prejudice on november.
on december,beal bank commenced the instant action for professional negligence dean and arter hadden separately demurred to the first amended complaint,arguing that beal bank suffered an actual injury on may,the date the bankruptcy court entered an adverse ruling against beal bank,which commenced the running of the statute of limitations under section on beal bank malpractice claim.they argued that the statute of limitations was tolled only until december,when gubner left arter hadden taking beal bank with him as a client and when arter hadden ceased representing beal bank.they further argued that the statute of limitations was not tolled as to them by any continuous representation of beal bank by gubner and his new firms,so that the limitations period expired on december,nearly four years prior to the filing of the instant action.
in opposition,beal bank argued that the statute of limitations did not commence until the ninth circuit opinion was issued on september,and that by virtue of the parties tolling agreement,its malpractice action was timely filed.
the trial court recognized that there was a conflict of authority between crouse brobeck,phleger harrison th,d crouse and beane paulsen th,d beane on the application of the tolling provision to an attorney prior firm.the trial court found crouse to be more persuasive and sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.judgments of dismissal were entered as to the claims against dean and arter hadden.this appeal followed.
