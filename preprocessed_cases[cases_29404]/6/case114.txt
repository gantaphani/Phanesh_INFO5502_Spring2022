in this case we set forth our standards for review of unpreserved claims of sentencing errors in the aftermath of united states booker,d.
defendant stelios antonakopoulos was convicted by a jury on august,on one count of bank fraud,under and,and one count of by a bank officer,under.he defrauded the national bank of greece nbg in november,and embezzled funds from the mercantile bank and trust company mbt in boston,in july of.antonakopoulos had been branch manager of the boston branch of nbg from march to july,at which time he became president and a member of the board of directors of mbt.he was sentenced to months imprisonment,largely based on the calculation of loss amount under the sentencing guidelines.he was also ordered to pay in restitution.
antonakopoulos has appealed his sentence,arguing that the district court erred on both amount of loss was lower and so his sentence should be shorter and the restitution was excessive.on appeal he also argues for the first time that a jury,not a judge,should have calculated the loss amount.from this he argues he is entitled to a remand for resentencing under booker.
the government now concedes that a portion of the restitution amount ordered was in error under the statutory scheme in place at the time of the offense.it requests that the restitution amount be reduced from to.we order the reduction in the restitution amount accordingly.we reject all of antonakopoulos other claims,including his booker claim as it is presented,but leave one door open under booker.
the district court calculation of loss attributable to the defendant and the amount of restitution is described herein.the details of how the frauds were perpetrated are not described,other than to say defendant kept helping himself to money to which he was not entitled in order to buy stocks on the athens stock exchange ase and then,as the stock prices fell,to pay off previous loans obtained by fraud.the defendant thought that athens would be named to host the olympic games,and that as a result,the stocks would soar in value.he had hoped to get himself half a million dollars for his retirement fund.when athens was not named as host and the stock prices fell,his fraud became a sort of ponzi scheme covering up his victimizing of banks and bank customers.
the scheme,in count one,was executed in july when antonakopoulos caused the nbg wrongly to advance a loan of in the name of michael mavris,a relative of antonakopoulos who lived in california.antonakopoulos actually deposited the loan proceeds into an account that he had opened in the name of his brother nikolaos,and not michael mavris.these funds were used to purchase stocks on the ase.neither nikolaos nor marvis was aware of these machinations.
from november,to november,the defendant caused nbg to wrongly advance in the name of his brother,nikolaos count two.antonakopoulos deposited the funds in the account he opened in his brother name.the funds were used in part to pay off the previous loan then in default.on november,antonakopoulos created a loan for from mbt to the name of nondas lagonakis,using lagonakis name without his permission or knowledge.the proceeds from this loan were used to pay off an earlier loan the defendant had obtained by fraud and to continue to buy stocks on the ase.although the loan was not charged in the indictment,evidence of it was admitted by the district court at trial under.b.
in july,in an effort to cover up his previous fraud by paying off those loans,antonakopoulos embezzled from the account of an mbt customer,maurice frances,without frances knowledge or permission count three.antonakopoulos was able to hide this transaction from frances because he arranged for frances monthly statements to be held at mbt,and not sent directly to frances in greece.
after eight days of trial,the jury convicted the defendant on counts two and three and deadlocked on count one.
the pre sentence report 
applying the november,sentencing guidelines manual,the report psr calculated antonakopoulos offense level alternatively under the embezzlement and theft guideline,which has a base offense level of,and under the fraud guideline,which has a base offense level of.under both,if the loss exceeds a certain amount,the guidelines required an upward adjustment the psr concluded that under either guideline the amount of loss was more than,but less than.in calculating loss,the psr found that the convictions on counts two and three meant the defendant was responsible for the loss resulting from the nikolaos antonakopoulos loan in november,and the embezzlement of from the account of maurice frances in july.this loss figure was coupled with the loss associated with other fraudulent loans made by the defendant those loans met the relevant conduct definition because they were part of the same course of conduct and have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.a.the psr added the outstanding balance of each of those loans and determined that the total loss was.this calculation of loss enhanced the defendant sentence a by levels under and b by levels under.this produced a total offense level of under either guideline,subject to further enhancements.in fact the psr may have understated the loss because it considered only the outstanding loan balances.united states walker,cir.
the psr also recommended enhancing antonakopoulos offense level by a total of six additional levels,including two levels for more than minimal planning,under b or b two levels for obstruction of justice,under and two levels for role in the offense,under.the psr concluded that antonakopoulos total offense level under either the fraud or embezzlement guideline was,his criminal history category was i,and his guideline sentencing range was to months imprisonment.
court sentencing 
the district court calculated the defendant guideline range under,finding that the defendant crimes were most analogous to embezzlement.as for calculation of loss,the court considered only what it deemed to be the three transactions fully developed at trial the loan to nikolaos in november of,the loan to lagonakis in november of and the embezzlement from frances account.these produced a total loss of.with the exception of the loan to lagonakis,the district court did not consider the other relevant conduct in its calculation.had it done so,the loss amount would have been greater and,most likely,the sentence would have been greater.
the district court rejected the defendant request to reduce the amount of loss based on any repayments made by the defendant on these loans,relying on walker,at.based on loss between and,the district court enhanced the defendant base offense level from to,as the psr recommended.
the district court declined the government request to enhance the defendant sentence for obstruction of justice.the other two more than minimal planning and for role in the not directly addressed by the court at the sentencing hearing,but they were clearly included in the court final determination of the offense level,which was.
the court did not grant the defendant motion for two downward departures the first based on rehabilitation and the second based on family circumstances.as to the first,the defendant argued that since his illegal conduct he has been unblemished and free from incident,and cited his exemplary work record,his constant and committed caring for his son,and his active participation in his church.the district court replied,the first one based on rehabilitation i do think is a difficult one.presentence rehabilitation would even be an issue in this case had it not taken so long to bring this case to trial from the time of the original offense.the court conclusion on this point was made irrespective of the fact that this is a rare ground of departure under the guidelines 
although not presented to us as part of the defendant booker argument,our own review of the record shows that the defendant also asked for a downward departure based on family circumstances under argued that he was an irreplaceable care taker for his adult son who suffered serious and permanent brain injuries as the result of a automobile accident.the court considered and rejected the request,stating 
what is difficult about this case is obviously the situation with the defendant son,which anyone would have a compassionate reaction to.and i do understand the government not to have that reaction.
i am however persuaded,by wild memorandum that there are adequate alternative means of care.therefore,i do not believe that the very high standard established by united states pereira,cir permits a departure for that ground in this case either.
i do think the situation of the son is an adequate ground actually to impose a sentence at the minimum that the guideline range otherwise calls for,which by my calculation i believe to be to months.
the court correctly determined that the appropriate offense level was,with a criminal history category of i,resulting in a guideline range of to months.the court sentenced the defendant to months imprisonment,the bottom end of the range.
in an entirely different calculation,one which does not affect the defendant sentence of imprisonment,the district court ordered restitution in the amount of to be paid to mbt and to be paid to lagonakis as mandated by.
effect of unpreserved booker error on sentences 
oral argument in this case was heard on february,after the supreme court decided united states booker,d.we address for the first time this circuit standards for unpreserved claims of booker error in cases on direct appeal 
to summarize our position at the outset,we intend to apply,in accordance with justice breyer admonition,conventional doctrine where a booker error exists but has not been preserved.see id.at united states olano,d.the booker error is that the defendant guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.the error is not that a judge by a preponderance of the evidence determined facts under the guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory guidelines system.a mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required by a statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by a defendant is not a candidate for booker error.the first two olano an error exists and that it is plain at the time of satisfied whenever the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory at the time of sentencing.but to meet the other two this error affected defendant substantial rights and would impair confidence in the justice of the think that ordinarily the defendant must point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory guidelines booker regime.we follow the more flexible standard for plain error articulated in united states dominguez benitez,d.we engage in case by case review and we reject certain automatic reversal rules.
we explain our position,starting by describing what we regard as the booker error,and what is an unpreserved booker error,and then address in turn the content of review in a booker situation,the standard to be used at the third and fourth prongs,and our rejection of automatic reversal rules.
booker reaffirmed the principle of apprendi new jersey,d,that a ny fact other than a prior conviction which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,but did so only insofar as the sentence resulted from a mandatory system imposing binding requirements on sentencing judges.booker.at.justice stevens opinion for the court stressed that it was the mandatory nature of the guidelines which raised constitutional concerns 
if the guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended,rather than required,the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts,their use would not implicate the sixth amendment 
the guidelines as written,however,are not advisory they are mandatory and binding on all judges.
id.at.and justice breyer opinion stated 
w ithout this the provision that makes the relevant sentencing rules mandatory and impose s binding requirement on all sentencing statute falls outside the scope of apprendi requirement.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court,as part of its remedy,struck two provisions from the sentencing reform act.id.at.it excised from the statute the provision which had mandated that judges sentence within the guidelines range.see b t he court shall impose a sentence of the kind,and within the range,referred to in subsection a which in turn referred to the guidelines.it also excised the provision which gave the courts of appeals de novo review over certain aspects of sentencing.e.the remainder of the sentencing reform act is intact and the guidelines must be considered by the district courts in sentencing.booker.at.
justice breyer opinion in booker directly addressed the issue of how the courts of appeals should address unpreserved claims of booker error,holding w e expect reviewing courts to apply ordinary prudential doctrines,determining,for example,whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the test.id.at.under the approach,district courts,while not bound to apply the guidelines,must consult those guidelines and take them into account when sentencing,subject to review by the courts of appeals for unreasonableness.id.at.
forfeited error 
we briefly address what a forfeited error is as to booker,so as to raise review.
the error under booker is,as we have said,that the defendant was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system.a variety of arguments led the supreme court to that conclusion,wending from apprendi,through ring arizona,d and blakely washington,d,to booker.the argument that a booker error occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued apprendi or blakely error or that the guidelines were unconstitutional.this is broader in scope than the argument that the mandatory guidelines system was unconstitutional.generally,there is no booker argument if the sentence imposed was a statutory mandatory minimum sentence resulting from facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant 
here the defendant agrees that the booker issue was not preserved,so at most he is entitled to review.the government,for its part,concedes that the booker issue was forfeited and not waived like many other choices criminal defendants make,there may be some risks to defendants in seeking booker remands 
content of review 
under olano,for the court of appeals to notice and correct an error not objected to in the district court,t here must be an error that is plain and that affect s substantial rights.olano,at.if those three factors are all met,the court of appeals then has discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.olano also makes it clear that under analysis i t is the defendant rather than the government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.id.at.
the first two prongs of the olano test as to booker error are satisfied whenever defendant guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory guidelines system.there was error and it was plain at least at the time of appellate consideration.see johnson united states,d.so far,all circuits have reached the same conclusion.
the more significant questions arise as to application of the third and fourth prongs to unpreserved booker claims.in olano,the court gave some definition to the phrase affecting substantial rights in the third prong by requiring a defendant to make a showing of prejudice.olano,at.the olano court stressed that n ormally the defendant must make a specific showing of prejudice to satisfy the affecting substantial rights prong of the test.id.
choosing among third prong standards 
the supreme court has used different formulations,varying with context,as to the content of the defendant burden to show his substantial rights have been affected.clearly,the prejudice alleged from the mandatory guidelines system must relate to some degree of likelihood of the error having affected his sentence.the supreme court has articulated at least four assertedly different standards of probability relating to the assessment of whether the outcome of trial would have been different if error had not occurred.dominguez benitez.at,d scalia,concurring emphasis in original.this poses the question of which is the most appropriate standard to apply to booker errors.
a booker error strikes us as qualitatively different from an inquiry into the likely effect of a trial error on a verdict of conviction.the different articulated standards for prejudice which justice scalia cited all involve trial error the question was what degree of effect was required on the outcome of a verdict of guilt.see brecht abrahamson,d assessing prejudice standard for overturning conviction based on trial error on collateral review strickland washington,d assessing prejudice standard for overturning conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims united states agurs,d assessing prejudice standard for overturning convictions based on brady violation claims chapman california,d assessing prejudice standard for overturning conviction on direct review for constitutional errors.on trial error claims,because there is a record of all evidence introduced or excluded at trial,it is often easier to determine whether there was any likely effect on the verdict of guilt,than it is to predict the effect here of a possible new and more lenient sentence under the booker regime.
in claims of sentencing error in cases,the supreme court has addressed the question of review,but only as to the fourth olano prong.in united states cotton,d,the court applied analysis to an apprendi error.the apprendi attack was on an enhanced statutory maximum based on drug quantity which was not specified in the indictment.cotton reversed the court of appeals ruling which had vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.id.at.cotton did not address whether the defendant substantial rights were affected.it skipped to the fourth prong and said the error did not seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings where the evidence as to quantity of drugs was overwhelming.id.at.cotton does not itself address the third prong of the test.
for booker purposes,the supreme court most recent articulation of the third prong of the plain error test,in dominguez benitez.at,strikes us as most apt.the court extended,to an unpreserved claim of a rule violation,the general tethering of the prejudice requirement to an effect on outcome.id.at.the court adopted a standard that 
a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.a defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court,informed by the entire record,that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.dominguez benitez also held that t he standard is not the same as,and should not be confused with,a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for error things would have been different.id.at.
the court in dominguez benitez formulated its standard by noting the contrast between the rule problem it addressed and the trial error claims presented in strickland,supra,and brady maryland,d.both strickland and brady claims,inter alia,may be presented in proceedings,at which evidence may be taken.by contrast,the defendant presenting a rule claim will rarely,if ever,be able to obtain relief in proceedings.dominguez benitez.at.without today deciding the issue of whether booker may be raised in relief,the dominguez benitez reasoning seems more apt here.
rejection of automatic rules 
we need not discuss the exact relationship between the reasonable probability of a different outcome third prong standard of dominguez benitez and olano fourth prong.but we reject two per se arguments,whether made under the third or fourth prong.we reject a per se remand rule solely on the basis that a defendant sentence was enhanced by judicial fact finding beyond that authorized by facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant a blakely error,and we reject a per se remand rule solely on the basis that the guidelines are no longer mandatory.
blakely error 
for several reasons,we reject the view that a blakely error automatically requires a booker remand.this is a necessary consequence of our view of the nature of the booker error.at least two circuits view the nature of the error as we do.see united states rodriguez,wl,cir,united states crosby,cir.as judge newman said in crosby as a result of the remedy opinion in,the maximum lawful sentence is the statutory maximum sentence,and because judicial under advisory guidelines can not increase that lawful maximum,judicial now encounters no sixth amendment difficulties.at,wl,at.
it may be that other circuits view this differently.earlier,of course,under blakely,the possible error was thought to be that the judge,based on facts found by him,had increased the sentence beyond that authorized solely by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.some circuits may have found such situations sufficient unto themselves to constitute booker error and to warrant remand under booker.see,united states milan,cir united states oliver,cir united states hughes,cir that situation standing the judge found additional facts which raised the sentence authorized solely by the jury verdict or guilty our view is insufficient to meet the third and fourth olano prongs on review.we explain why.
it is far from necessarily true,as a per se remand rule assumes,that a judge who found the facts underlying an enhanced sentence would have reached a different result under a regime.in these situations a judge factual findings,unless they were found to be clearly erroneous,are far more likely than not to be the same if the case were remanded.the fact that the judge initially did the fact finding on a certain factor is surely a different matter than what the judge would have done with that factor if the guidelines were not mandatory.the use of judicial fact finding,then,ordinarily can not alone meet the reasonable probability standard of the third olano prong.
a second reason for rejecting such an automatic rule in blakely situations is that there is nothing inherently unreliable about judicial fact finding that raised a sentence beyond that authorized solely by the jury verdict or guilty plea.under booker,a judge may do such fact finding in determining the guidelines range.nothing in booker requires submission of such facts to a jury so long as the guidelines are not mandatory.that judicial fact finding was used certainly,in our view,can not itself mean that the fourth prong of olano is met more is needed 
further,to find plain error automatically in blakely situations would be inconsistent with law.even before booker,and after blakely,this circuit had rejected any such automatic rule of reversal and remand for resentencing when a judge engaged in fact finding that raised the defendant sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or guilty plea.see united states morgan,cir.so did the supreme court in cotton,at.
we also do not adopt the contrary per se rule that a blakely type situation can not meet the standard of a reasonable probability of a different sentence.the burden is on the defendant to convince us on specific facts.
guidelines 
the standard is not met by a simple assertion that the defendant was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system,and so is entitled to remand.in our view,one can not possibly say that all sentences imposed before booker threatened the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,or undermined our confidence in the outcome of the sentence,simply because the guidelines were mandatory.as to the reasonable probability test
