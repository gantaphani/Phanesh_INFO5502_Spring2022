discussion 
this case was tried on a stipulated evidentiary record that included stipulations of fact as well as excerpts from various deposition transcripts,transcripts of hearings before the bankruptcy court,correspondence,and other writings.the court found that the purchase of the building by the bank with the approval of the bankruptcy court did not operate to extinguish the lease and that the bank conduct after the sale created an attornment whereby the bank became the landlord under the lease.accordingly,the court concluded that pursuant to the terms of the lease,the bank owed cheg a commission on the sale.the trial court also found that the release signed by rivendell and the bank did not release any claims by cheg against the bank.the bank contends that,contrary to the trial court ruling,cheg was not entitled to a commission because the bankruptcy order transferred building a to the bank free and clear of cheg interest in the property and the bank did not thereafter assume rivendell obligation to pay cheg a broker fee under the lease.moreover,the bank argues that even assuming the broker fee provision was enforceable,any claims by cheg against the bank were expressly released in the bankruptcy proceedings and that cheg unreasonable delay in filing this lawsuit estops it from pursuing this claim.

the terms of the lease 
the lease,originally entered into by rivendell and imp,was for a term of years,expiring at the end of july.the broker fee provision contained therein provides in pertinent part a upon execution of this lease by both parties,lessor shall pay to wall street properties licensed real estate broker s per exhibit e for brokerage services rendered by brokers in this transaction.b lessor further agrees that if lessee exercises any option which is granted to lessee under this lease lessor shall pay said broker s a fee in accordance with the schedule of said broker s in effect at the time of execution of this lease.c any transferee of lessor interests in this lease,whether such transfer is by agreement or by operation of law,shall be deemed to have assumed lessor obligation under this paragraph.said broker shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions of this paragraph.exhibit e to the lease provides in pertinent part should the tenant purchase or enter into contract to purchase the leased property or any portion thereof during the term of the lease then a sales commission shall be paid at such time as the purchase is consummated the lease also contained an attornment clause which provides in part that l essee agrees to execute any documents required to effectuate an attornment lessee failure to execute such documents within ten days after written demand shall constitute a material default by lessee hereunder 
the bankruptcy court order terminated cheg rights under the lease 
the bankruptcy court order states that building a is sold to the bank free and clear of all liens,encumbrances and interests.the bank asserts that the lease was terminated when it purchased building a from rivendell pursuant to this order.cheg,however,asserts that the lease was not terminated because the order specifically lists seven liens that were terminated but does not list the lease,and that in any event,a lease is not an interest that can be terminated by a bankruptcy sale.
