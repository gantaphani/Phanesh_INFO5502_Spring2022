the parol evidence rule protects the integrity of written contracts by making their terms the exclusive evidence of the parties agreement.however,an established exception to the rule allows a party to present extrinsic evidence to show that the agreement was tainted by fraud.here,we consider the scope of the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule.
as we discuss below,the fraud exception is a longstanding one,and is usually stated in broad terms.however,in this court adopted a limitation on the fraud exception evidence offered to prove fraud must tend to establish some independent fact or representation,some fraud in the procurement of the instrument or some breach of confidence concerning its use,and not a promise directly at variance with the promise of the writing.bank of america.pendergrass cal d,pendergrass.the pendergrass rule has been criticized but followed by california courts,for the most part,though some have narrowly construed it.the court of appeal in this case adopted such a narrow construction,deciding that evidence of an alleged oral misrepresentation of the written terms themselves is not barred by the pendergrass rule.
plaintiffs,who prevailed below,not only defend the court of appeal holding but,alternatively,invite us to reconsider pendergrass.there are good reasons for doing so.the pendergrass limitation finds no support in the language of the statute codifying the parol evidence rule and the exception for evidence of fraud.it is difficult to apply.it conflicts with the doctrine of the restatements,most treatises,and the majority of our jurisdictions.furthermore,while intended to prevent fraud,the rule established in pendergrass may actually provide a shield for fraudulent conduct.finally,pendergrass departed from established california law at the time it was decided,and neither acknowledged nor justified the abrogation.we now conclude that pendergrass was,and should be overruled.
background 
plaintiffs lance and pamela workman fell behind on their loan payments to defendant fresno madera production credit association credit association or association.they restructured their debt in an agreement,dated march,which confirmed outstanding loans with a total delinquency of,in the new agreement,the credit association promised it would take no enforcement action until july,if the workmans made specified payments.as additional collateral,the workmans pledged eight separate parcels of real property.they initialed pages bearing the legal descriptions of these parcels 
the workmans did not make the required payments.on march,the credit association recorded a notice of default.eventually,the workmans repaid the loan and the association dismissed its foreclosure proceedings.the workmans then filed this action,seeking damages for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,and including causes of action for rescission and reformation of the restructuring agreement.they alleged that the association vice president,david ylarregui,met with them two weeks before the agreement was signed,and told them the association would extend the loan for two years in exchange for additional collateral consisting of two ranches.the workmans further claimed that when they signed the agreement ylarregui assured them its term was two years and the ranches were the only additional security.as noted,the contract actually contemplated only three months of forbearance by the association,and identified eight parcels as additional collateral.the workmans did not read the agreement,but simply signed it at the locations tabbed for signature.
the credit association moved for summary judgment.it contended the workmans could not prove their claims because the parol evidence rule barred evidence of any representations contradicting the terms of the written agreement.in opposition,the workmans argued that ylarregui misrepresentations were admissible under the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule.relying on pendergrass,supra,cal d,the trial court granted summary judgment,ruling that the fraud exception does not allow parol evidence of promises at odds with the terms of the written agreement.
the court of appeal reversed.it reasoned that pendergrass is limited to cases of promissory fraud the court considered false statements about the contents of the agreement itself to be factual misrepresentations beyond the scope of the pendergrass rule.we granted the credit association petition for review.
ii.discussion 
a.the parol evidence rule and the pendergrass limitation 
the parol evidence rule is codified in code of civil procedure section and civil code section.it provides that when parties enter an integrated written agreement,extrinsic evidence may not be relied upon to alter or add to the terms of the writing casa herrera,beydoun cal th,d,casa herrera.an integrated agreement is a writing or writings constituting a final expression of one or more terms of an agreement.rest d contracts,subd.see alling universal manufacturing th,d.there is no dispute in this case that the parties agreement was integrated.
although the parol evidence rule results in the exclusion of evidence,it is not a rule of evidence but one of substantive law.casa herrera,supra,cal th at,d.it is founded on the principle that when the parties put all the terms of their agreement in writing,the writing itself becomes the agreement.the written terms supersede statements made during the negotiations.extrinsic evidence of the agreement terms is thus irrelevant,and can not be relied upon.casa herrera,at,d.t he parol evidence rule,unlike the statute of frauds,does not merely serve an evidentiary purpose it determines the enforceable and incontrovertible terms of an integrated written agreement.id.at,d,sterling taylor cal th,d,explaining evidentiary function of statute of frauds.the purpose of the rule is to ensure that the parties final understanding,deliberately expressed in writing,is not subject to change.casa herrera,at,d.
section,subdivision f establishes a broad exception to the operation of the parol evidence rule where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute,this section does not exclude evidence relevant to that issue.this provision rests on the principle that the parol evidence rule,intended to protect the terms of a valid written contract,should not bar evidence challenging the validity of the agreement itself.evidence to prove that the instrument is void or voidable for mistake,fraud,duress,undue influence,illegality,alteration,lack of consideration,or another invalidating cause is admissible.this evidence does not contradict the terms of an effective integration,because it shows that the purported instrument has no legal effect.witkin,cal.evidence ed.documentary evidence,see also.the fraud exception is expressly stated in section,subdivision g this section does not exclude other evidence to establish fraud.
despite the unqualified language of section,which broadly permits evidence relevant to the validity of an agreement and specifically allows evidence of fraud,the pendergrass court decided to impose a limitation on the fraud exception the facts of pendergrass are similar in certain respects to those here.borrowers fell behind on their payments.they and the bank executed a new promissory note,which was secured by additional collateral and payable on demand.soon after it was signed,the bank seized the encumbered property and sued to enforce the note.in defense,the borrowers claimed the bank had promised not to interfere with their farming operations for the remainder of the year,and to take the proceeds of those operations in payment.they alleged that the bank had no intention of performing these promises,but made them for the fraudulent purpose of obtaining the new note and additional collateral.pendergrass,supra,cal d at.
the pendergrass court concluded that further proceedings were required to determine whether the lender had pursued the proper form of action.pendergrass,supra,cal d at.however,the court also considered whether oral testimony would be admissible to establish the lender alleged promise not to require payment until the borrowers sold their crops.this promise is in direct contravention of the unconditional promise contained in the note to pay the money on demand.the question then is is such a promise the subject of parol proof for the purpose of establishing fraud as a defense to the action or by way of cancelling the note,assuming,of course,that it can be properly coupled with proof that it was made without any intention of performing it id.at.
our conception of the rule which permits parol evidence of fraud to establish the invalidity of the instrument is that it must tend to establish some independent fact or representation,some fraud in the procurement of the instrument or some breach of confidence concerning its use,and not a promise directly at variance with the promise of the writing.we find apt language in towner lucas exr.gratt,in which to express our conviction it is reasoning in a circle,to argue that fraud is made out,when it is shown by oral testimony that the obligee contemporaneously with the execution of a bond,promised not to enforce it.such a principle would nullify the rule for conceding that such an agreement is proved,or any other contradicting the written instrument,the party seeking to enforce the written agreement according to its terms,would always be guilty of fraud.the true question is,was there any such agreement and this can only be established by legitimate testimony.for reasons founded in wisdom and to prevent frauds and perjuries,the rule of the common law excludes such oral testimony of the alleged agreement and as it can not be proved by legal evidence,the agreement itself in legal contemplation,can not be regarded as existing in fact.pendergrass,supra,cal d at.
reactions to pendergrass 
despite some criticism,pendergrass has survived for over years and the courts of appeal have followed it,albeit with varying degrees of fidelity.see casa herrera,supra,cal th at,d,duncan v.the mccaffrey group,th,d reviewing cases price wells fargo bank d.discussing criticism sweet,promissory fraud and the parol evidence rule cal.sweet criticizing pendergrass.until now,this court has not revisited the pendergrass rule 
the primary ground of attack on pendergrass has been that it is inconsistent with the principle,reflected in the terms of section,that a contract may be invalidated by a showing of fraud.coast bank holmes d.sweet,supra,cal.at note,parol evidence admissibility to show that a promise was made without intention to perform it cal,note see also pacific state bank greene th,d.evidence is deemed admissible for the purpose of proving fraud,without restriction,in the restatements.rest d contracts,subd.d,and coms.c d,see also,com.c,rest d torts,com.c.most of the treatises agree that evidence of fraud is not affected by the parol evidence rule,corbin on contracts ed.a,ii farnsworth on contracts ed,williston on contracts ed.the majority of other jurisdictions follow this traditional view.see airs,perfect scents distributions,fn.touche ross,filipek,pinnacle peak developers trw investment,collecting cases sweet,supra,cal.at.
underlying the objection that pendergrass overlooks the impact of fraud on the validity of an agreement is a more practical concern its limitation on evidence of fraud may itself further fraudulent practices.as an oregon court noted oral promises made without the promisor intention that they will be performed could be an effective means of deception if evidence of those fraudulent promises were never admissible merely because they were at variance with a subsequent written agreement.howell oregonian publishing,see sweet,supra,cal.at promises made without the intention on the part of the promisor that they will be performed are unfortunately a facile and effective means of deception.corbin observes the best reason for allowing fraud and similar undermining factors to be proven extrinsically is the obvious one if there was fraud,or a mistake or some form of illegality,it is unlikely that it was bargained over or will be recited in the document.to bar extrinsic evidence would be to make the parol evidence rule a shield to protect misconduct or mistake.corbin on contracts,supra,a.
pendergrass has been criticized on other grounds as well.the distinction between promises deemed consistent with the writing and those considered inconsistent has been described as tenuous.coast bank holmes,supra,d at.see simmons cal.institute of technology cal d,note,supra,cal.at discussing simmons sweet,supra,cal.at any attempt to forecast results in this area is a hazardous undertaking.the distinction between false promises and misrepresentations of fact has been called very troublesome.sweet,supra,cal.at.it has also been noted that some courts have resisted applying the pendergrass limitation by various means,leading to uncertainty in the case law.see duncan v.the mccaffrey group,supra,th at,d sweet,supra,cal.at id.at the california experience demonstrates that even where a restrictive rule is adopted,many devices will develop to avoid its impact note,the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule necessary protection for fraud victims or loophole for clever parties,fraud exception reviewing cases,and concluding that inconsistent application of the fraud exception undermines the belief that the pendergrass rule is clear,defensible,and viable.
in,the california law revision commission ignored pendergrass when it proposed modifications to the statutory formulation of the parol evidence rule.the commission advised the legislature to conform the terms of section with rulings handed down by this court,observing as the parol evidence rule exists in california today,it bears little resemblance to the statutory statement of the rule.recommendation relating to parol evidence rule,cal.law revision com,supra.the commission identified three opinions for consideration in designing revisions to the statute.id.at,fns,citing delta dynamics,arioto cal d,pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d,and masterson sine cal d.
conspicuously omitted was any mention of pendergrass and its nonstatutory limitation on the fraud exception.the commission discussion of the parol evidence rule set out the fraud exception without restriction,citing coast bank holmes,supra,d,which was strongly critical of pendergrass.recommendation relating to parol evidence rule,cal.law revision com,supra.the commission proposed revisions were adopted by the legislature.they included no substantive changes to the statutory language allowing evidence that goes to the validity of an agreement,and evidence of fraud in particular.recommendation,at see stats,ch.
on the other hand,pendergrass has had its defenders.its limitation on evidence of fraud has been described as an entirely defensible decision favoring the policy considerations underlying the parol evidence rule over those supporting a fraud cause of action.price wells fargo bank,supra,d at.accord,duncan v.the mccaffrey group,supra,th at,d banco do brasil,latian,d.the price court observed that a broad doctrine of promissory fraud may allow parties to litigate disputes over the meaning of contract terms armed with an arsenal of tort remedies inappropriate to the resolution of commercial disputes.price,supra,at.see also banco do brasil,at.
we note as well that the pendergrass approach is not entirely without support in the treatises and law reviews.wigmore,in a comment relied upon by the bank in pendergrass and referred to indirectly by the pendergrass court,has opined that an intent not to perform a promise should not be considered fraudulent for purposes of the parol evidence rule.ix wigmore,evidence chadbourn,see sweet,supra,cal.at pendergrass,supra,cal d at.a recent law review comment,while critical of pendergrass,favors limiting the scope of the fraud exception and advocates an even stricter rule for sophisticated parties.fraud exception,supra.at.
pendergrass reconsidered 
there are multiple reasons to question whether pendergrass has stood the test of time.it has been criticized as bad policy.its limitation on the fraud exception is inconsistent with the governing statute,and the legislature did not adopt that limitation when it revised section based on a survey of california case
