preemption under the hola and agency regulations 
the hola was originally enacted after the great depression in the,primarily to provide home financing.de la cuesta,supra,at.at,d at.the hola created a system of federal savings and loan associations,which would be regulated by the federal home loan bank board fhlbb,to promote the thrift of the people in a cooperative manner,to finance their homes and the homes of their neighbors.citations.id.at.at,d at.the hola provided the fhlbb with plenary authority to issue rules and regulations for the federal savings and loan associations.ibid.indeed,the language of the hola expressed no limits on the fhlbb authority to regulate the lending practices of federal savings and loan associations.id.at.at,d at.t he statutory language suggests that congress expressly contemplated,and approved,the fhlbb promulgation of regulations superseding state law.id.at.at,d at.it would have been difficult for congress to give the fhlbb a broader mandate.id.at.at,d at.
the fhlbb exercised this congressional mandate,comprehensively regulating the operations of every federal savings association,including its lending practices,from its cradle to its corporate grave.de la cuesta,supra,at.at,d at,quoting people coast federal sav.loan.according to the ninth circuit court of appeals,the fhlbb regulations were so pervasive as to leave no room for state regulatory control.conference of federal sav.loan ass ns stein cir.
in congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,amending the hola,a,stat,et the fhlbb was replaced by the office of thrift supervision ots.the director of ots was given the authority to prescribe such regulations and issue such orders as the director may determine to be necessary for carrying out the hola,subd.b see,subd.a.section of the hola now authorizes the director to provide for the organization,incorporation,examination,operation,and regulation of federal savings associations i n order to provide thrift institutions for the deposit of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and other goods and services giving primary consideration of the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states,subd.a,italics added,subd.b.
as relevant here,the hola expressly authorizes federal savings associations to invest t o the extent specified in regulations of the director in consumer loans for personal,family,or household purposes,subd.c d see.in the thrift activities regulatory handbook update of,the ots defines consumer loans as credit extended to individuals for personal,family,or household purposes,including the financing or refinancing of automobiles.ots lexis.according to the ots consumer loans may be secured or unsecured,or,direct or indirect.ots lexis.when an institution originates the loan,it is a direct loan.if a seller of retail goods dealer originates the loan and then sells it to the institution,it is an indirect loan.ots lexis.
the preemptive effect of the regulations adopted under the hola was formerly expressed in part of title of the code of federal regulations as follows the regulations in this part are promulgated pursuant to the plenary and exclusive authority of the office to regulate all aspects of the operations of federal savings associations,as set forth in section a of the hola.this exercise of the ots authority is preemptive of any state law purporting to address the subject of the operations of a federal savings association.former.ots moved the lending regulations in to part and replaced section with part section,lopez world savings loan th,d lopez.
in issuing the amended regulations ots commented that section restates preemption principles applicable to federal savings associations,as reflected in earlier regulations,court cases,and numerous legal opinions issued by ots and the fhlbb,ots predecessor agency.in those opinions,ots has consistently taken the position that,with certain narrow exceptions,any state laws that purport to affect the lending operations of federal savings associations are preempted.none of the changes implemented today should be construed as evidencing in any way an intent by ots to change this long held position ots still intends to occupy the field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.as a result,instead of being subject to a hodgepodge of conflicting and overlapping state lending requirements,federal thrifts are free to originate loans under a single set of uniform federal laws and regulations.this furthers both the best practices and safety and soundness objectives of the hola by enabling federal thrifts to deliver credit to the public free from undue regulatory duplication and burden.at the same time,the interests of borrowers are protected by the elaborate network of federal statutes applicable to federal thrifts,including the truth in lending act,the real estate settlement procedures act,the equal credit opportunity act,the fair housing act,the home mortgage disclosure act,the fair credit reporting act,the consumer leasing act,the fair debt collection practices act,the community reinvestment act,and the federal trade commission act,fn.omitted.
section,subdivision a provides,in part,ots hereby occupies the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.ots intends to give federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation.accordingly,federal savings associations may extend credit as authorized under federal law,including this part,without regard to state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit activities,except to the extent provided in paragraph c of this section or of this part.italics added.
subdivision b of section provides a list of illustrative examples of the types of state laws preempted by paragraph a of section the list was not meant to be exhaustive and failure to mention a particular type of state law that affects lending was not meant to indicate such types of state laws were applicable to federal savings associations.
subdivision c of section then lists the types of state laws that are not preempted to the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph a of this section.
ots commented that w hen confronted with interpretive questions under,we anticipate that courts will,in accordance with well established principles of regulatory construction,look to the regulatory history of for guidance.in this regard,ots wishes to make clear that the purpose of paragraph c is to preserve the traditional infrastructure of basic state laws that undergird commercial transactions,not to open the door to state regulation of lending by federal savings associations.when analyzing the status of state laws under,the first step will be to determine whether the type of law in question is listed in paragraph b.if so,the analysis will end there the law is preempted.if the law is not covered by paragraph b,the next question is whether the law affects lending.if it does,then,in accordance with paragraph a,the presumption arises that the law is preempted.this presumption can be reversed only if the law can clearly be shown to fit within the confines of paragraph c.for these purposes,paragraph c is intended to be interpreted narrowly.any doubt should be resolved in favor of preemption.
these statutes,regulations,and comments of the ots make abundantly manifest and clear the congressional intent to expressly preempt state law in the area of lending regulation of federal savings associations.there is no issue of implied preemption here.gibson world savings loan th,d gibson.

de la cruz alleges in his answer and class action the notice given by wfs was defective under section.although his pleadings did not specify the nature of the alleged defect,de la cruz informed the trial court at the hearing on wfs demurrer his claim is that the notice failed to set forth exactly where he should send either the reinstatement or redemption amount.wfs demurrer contended its notice did not need to comply with section as it was a federally regulated financial institution whose automobile finance operations were governed exclusively by federal law.
the trial court overruled wfs demurrer to the,stating de la cruz claims are not federally preempted as alleged,because the debt collection activities alleged in the pleading are not part of wfs financial lending operations.we disagree.section is very much directed at the lending operations of companies providing automobile financing,including wfs,specifically conditioning their exercise of their security rights.
we begin by rejecting the argument of de la cruz that consumer protection policy requires section apply to federal savings associations.in determining whether a state statute is by federal law,our sole task is to ascertain the intent of congress.guerra,supra,at.at,d at.the laudatory purpose of the state statute is not the point and does not preclude preemption.abel keybank usa d.a state law may be even if it was enacted by the state to protect its citizens or consumers,quoting of banks in ins.duryee cir.
de la cruz also claims preemption would unfairly tilt the playing field in favor of wfs and against those companies that are not federal savings associations because the latter would still have to comply with.actually,section itself already exempts certain lenders those licensed under the california finance lenders law from compliance with its requirements,subd.d.the inequity de la cruz fears already exists by virtue of the statutory language of section.federal preemption would only add an additional category of lenders to which section will not apply.
we also reject the suggestion of de la cruz that there can be no federal preemption here because he negotiated the purchase of a vehicle,not a mortgage,and signed the conditional sale contract with the dealer,who then assigned the contract to wfs.according to de la cruz,wfs can not then magically strip the contract of its protection.it is clear,however,federal savings associations are authorized to engage in indirect vehicle financing,subds.a and c d ots lexis,which was what occurred here,and there is nothing in the hola or ots regulations indicating any intention to limit the broad express preemption of state laws affecting the operations of federal savings associations,subd.a to specific forms of lending or to only home loans.
to the contrary,the ots has taken the position preemption is not limited to direct loans on homes.even indirect vehicle finance leases that are the functional equivalent of loans brings the full force of ots lending regulation on preemption into play.ots lexis,application of wisconsin motor vehicle consumer lease law to federal savings bank preempted.congress intended the federal scheme to be exclusive,leaving no room for state regulation,conflicting or complementary.ots lexis.an agency interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d.given the authority of federal savings associations to make consumer loans and the unlimited language of section,such construction is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
moreover,a number of courts have found federal preemption under section outside the direct loan and mortgage context.wfs,dean,supra,d at wisconsin laws governing sales finance companies preempted and could not be applied to wfs,whose business in wisconsin was percent indirect automobile loans lockyer,supra,d at imposing requirements on credit card issuers preempted under.if section falls within the scope of federal preemption intended by the hola and ots regulations,the statute may not be applied to wfs vehicle lending operations,whether direct or indirect.
section falls within the scope of section,subdivision b.such subdivision preempts state laws purporting to impose requirements regarding terms of credit.here,the provisions of section,inter alia,read into each vehicle conditional sale contract a right of redemption of a repossessed vehicle upon statutorily provided conditions,a right to a statement as to whether there is a conditional right to reinstate the contract and if not,the provision of a statement of reasons why not,a right to an extension of the redemption or reinstatement time period upon written request,and a right to an accounting regarding disposition of the vehicle.persons liable on the contract must be given a statutorily prescribed notice of all of these rights with specifically included statements and information in precise compliance with the statute or the borrowers obtain a defense to any attempt to collect a deficiency after disposition of the vehicle,subd.a.in essence,section adds terms to a vehicle conditional sale contract for the event of a default,limiting the lender right to enforce its security interest in the vehicle and obtain a deficiency judgment.these imposed terms of credit clearly impact the lender ability to collect on its delinquent loans.in this way section impermissibly regulates and affects the lending or credit activities of federal savings associations,subd.a see also,abel keybank usa,supra,d at finding federal preemption of ohio statute which essentially imposed credit terms concerning defenses to repayment on national banks under regulation analogous to but see blanko keybank usa.lexis disagreeing with abel.the application of section to federal savings associations is preempted by subdivision b of section 
section also falls within the scope of section,subdivision b.such subdivision preempts state laws purporting to impose requirements regarding d isclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in credit application forms,credit solicitations,billing statements,credit contracts,or other documents.italics added.section clearly imposes detailed requirements regarding the statements,information,and content of a creditor notice of intent to dispose of a vehicle.such notice is a document.it is sent by the creditor lender to persons liable the borrowers on a vehicle conditional sale contract a loan,at a time when the loan is in default and the collateral the vehicle has been repossessed,but not yet sold.the notice informs the borrowers of the right to redeem the vehicle by paying off the loan and of any right to reinstate the loan.the notice informs the borrowers of their right to seek an extension of time to exercise these options.the notice informs the borrowers how to go about exercising these options.the notice informs the borrowers of their right to an accounting regarding the disposition of the vehicle if it is sold and of their potential liability for any deficiency.at the point this notice is given there is still an ongoing credit relationship between the lender and the borrowers,which is directly affected by this notice,especially since any defect in the notice cuts off the lender right to a deficiency judgment.
we reject the claim section,subdivision b does not apply to documents.the language of subdivision b does not support such a narrow construction as it lists not only documents related to when credit is being solicited,offered,or extended,but specifically lists billing statements,a kind of document sent in the course of an credit relationship,and other documents.see lockyer,supra,d california law requiring minimum payment warnings and disclosures in monthly bills preempted under,subd.b.
our conclusion is supported by an opinion of the ots in which the ots concluded preemption applied not just to laws purporting to regulate the documents generated during the formation of the credit relationship,but also to state law provisions triggered upon default on the loan.specifically,the ots issued a legal opinion in advising that a federal savings association was not subject to new mexico home loan protection act.ots lexis.such act included provisions triggered upon default on home loans rather than at loan origination.ots lexis,at.the provisions required creditors to accept any partial payment made or tendered in response to a default notice,to reinstate the borrower to the same position as if a default had not occurred and nullify an acceleration of an obligation and prohibited charges,fees or penalties for curing a loan default.ots lexis,at.the opinion of the ots stated,all of these nm act they are triggered at loan origination or upon to regulate the terms of credit,fees,disclosures,mortgage processing,origination,refinancing,and servicing,and disbursements.thus,they are preempted from applying to federal savings associations ots lexis,at.the new mexico act provisions preempted included those allowing borrowers to bring civil actions for violations and to assert claims,defenses,counterclaims,and actions against creditors or subsequent holders or assignees in foreclosure actions,as well as the provisions making violations unfair or deceptive trade practices.ots lexis,at.
as we conclude section falls within the kind of state laws preempted by section,subdivision b and subdivision b,we need not consider whether the statute might also be preempted by subdivision b of section,which lists regulations regarding p rocessing,origination,servicing,sale or purchase of,or investment or participation in,mortgages.italics added.our analysis could end here without reaching the question of whether section is the type of law that comes within subdivision c of section.
nevertheless,we find it useful to note section is expressly directed at vehicle financing lenders and that it more than incidentally affects their lending operations so as not to come within subdivision c of section.this easily distinguishes this case from several cases relied upon by de la cruz.
in gibson,supra,th,d,plaintiffs brought a class action suit against world savings and loan association alleging world financially benefited from purchasing expensive replacement hazard insurance for borrowers who failed to maintain hazard insurance on their real property and charging the borrowers the full price of the replacement insurance,instead of simply reinstating the borrowers insurance policies.plaintiffs alleged this practice violated the terms of the borrowers deeds of trust,which authorized world to advance funds on behalf of the borr
