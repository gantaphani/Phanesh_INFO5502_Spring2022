factual and procedural background 
mary richtenburg and kathleen sipes are beneficiaries of personal trusts maintained by the bank.they commenced the underlying action on behalf of themselves and the following class all persons and their successors who are or were beneficiaries or successor trustees of trusts whose principal income is or was managed by wells fargo as a corporate trustee,in which trusts wells fargo collected fees,proceeds or similar compensation or benefits for services provided by affiliates of wells fargo in connection with wells fargo investment or management of trust assets,collected fees,proceeds or similar compensation or benefits from third parties in connection with wells fargo investment or management of trust assets.
plaintiffs allege the bank violated california law by investing trust assets in proprietary mutual funds in order to collect various fees for itself and its affiliates,including investment and advisory fees investing trust assets in nonproprietary mutual funds from which the bank and its affiliates receive undisclosed compensation implementing a securities lending program by which it places trust assets in a common trust fund so that it can lend securities held in the fund to third parties,charge the third parties fees and interest,and misappropriate from plaintiffs percent of the fees and interest received and charging unreasonable fees for the preparation of tax returns.plaintiffs allege that by engaging in these acts,the bank has violated its duties as trustee to avoid conflicts of interests,to make investments solely in the interests of the beneficiaries,and to charge only a disclosed trustee fee for administering the trust.plaintiffs further allege the bank failed to provide full disclosure of its actions,including disclosure of payments received from its investments,the nature and extent of any conflicts of interests,and other material facts.
the above allegations are incorporated into and realleged in all of the causes of action,as though fully set forth t herein.the complaint alleges six causes of action breach of fiduciary duty concealment violation of the consumers legal remedies act conversion violation of business and professions code section et and common count for misappropriation.
the bank filed a general demurrer to each of the six causes of action in the second amended complaint,asserting,among other things,that the entire action was preempted by slusa.after the trial court overruled the demurrer,the bank filed a petition for a writ of mandate in this court,seeking a ruling that the action was preempted by slusa.we summarily denied the petition.the bank petitioned to the supreme court,which granted review and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief sought by the bank should not be granted.we did so,and set a date for filing a return.
discussion 
writ relief is proper.
plaintiffs preliminary contention is that writ relief is not appropriate where,as here,the parties are in the pleading stage.while it is true that in most cases,the parties must be relegated to a review of an order overruling a demurrer on appeal from the final judgment citation,babb superior court cal d,a purely legal issue of preemption is properly raised by demurrer and an order overruling a demurrer on that ground is properly reviewed by petition for a writ of mandate,washington mutual bank superior court th,footnote d washington mutual.
the sole issue before us in this writ proceeding is whether,assuming the facts alleged by plaintiffs are true,slusa applies although slusa,often called a preemption provision,is actually a preclusion provision we nonetheless apply the rule set forth in washington mutual and conclude that writ review is proper here because the bank demurrer and petition similarly involve a purely legal issue that can be resolved on the record and briefing before us at this time.courts have routinely invoked slusa to dismiss class actions at the pleading stage,and we,too,find it appropriate to make an early determination.see,sofonia principal life ins.cir,granted motion to dismiss on slusa grounds after case was removed to federal court behlen merrill lynch cir,same.
ii.slusa applies to plaintiffs second amended complaint.
plaintiffs second amended complaint involves misrepresentations or omissions in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
when reviewing a demurrer,appellate courts generally assume that all facts pleaded in the complaint are true.cantu resolution trust th,d.we independently construe statutory law,as its interpretation is a question of law on which we are not bound by the trial court analysis.city of morgan hill bay area air quality management dist.th,d.
slusa provides in relevant part limitations on remedies class action limitations.no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f.congress enacted slusa in response to the marginal success the private securities litigation reform act of pslra had in achieving its goal of combating strike suits and securities class actions.see slusa,stat.f.in enacting pslra,congress targeted perceived abuses of the vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded securities.dabit,supra,d.however,r ather than face the obstacles set in their path by pslra,plaintiffs and their representatives began bringing class actions under state law,alleging violations of state statutory or common law.id.at.subsequently,congress passed slusa to prevent plaintiffs from frustrating the objectives of pslra.ibid.
an action will be dismissed under slusa if it is a covered class action is based on state law involves a covered security and alleges a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact or use of any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f see,behlen merrill lynch,supra.a covered class action is a lawsuit in which damages are sought on behalf of more than people.f b.a covered security is one traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange.f e.in determining whether an alleged misrepresentation or omission coincides with a securities transaction,courts look at the gravamen whether the complaint,as a whole,involves an untrue statement or substantive omission of a material fact,and whether that conduct coincides with a transaction involving a covered security.kutten bank of america,civ.pam,wl.lexis,at pp.kutten.the court focuses on the substance of the claim,not the plaintiffs characterization of it.miller nationwide life ins.cir,whether slusa applies hinges on the context of the on the label affixed to the cause of action.
the supreme court recently addressed the scope of slusa in dabit,in which a former broker and other former or current brokers of an investment banking firm filed class action complaints alleging that the firm biased investment recommendations induced them to retain or delay selling certain securities.dabit,supra,d.in concluding that slusa applied to the action,the supreme court in dabit,supra,at page,reviewed similar language from part b of the securities exchange act of part b,which provides it shall be unlawful for any person b t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the sec may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.noting that cases discussing part b and rule,including blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d blue chip stamps,limited the availability of private actions brought under rule to purchasers and sellers of securities,and acknowledging that slusa in connection with language is to be interpreted consistently with parallel language in part b and rule,dabit nonetheless held that slusa applied more expansively to actions brought by holders in addition to purchasers and sellers of securities.dabit,supra,at.
in so holding,dabit emphasized that the limitation in blue chip stamps came primarily from policy considerations,and not from an interpretation of the in connection with language.dabit,supra.dabit explained blue chip stamps relied chiefly,and candidly,on policy considerations in adopting the limitation.citation.the blue chip stamps court purported to define the scope of a private right of action under rule to define the words in connection with the purchase or sale.citation.any ambiguity on that score had long been resolved by the time congress enacted slusa.id.at,citing blue chip stamps,supra,d see also united states naftalin,d dabit merrill lynch,pierce,fenner cir,the limitation on standing to bring a private suit for damages for fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities is unquestionably a distinct concept from the general statutory and regulatory prohibition under part b on fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.thus,dabit held that in interpreting the term in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,it was not bound by the limitations set forth in blue chip stamps.dabit,supra,d.
dabit also noted that cases interpreting part b in connection with language have defined it broadly.dabit,supra,d.dabit cited with approval united states,d,and which held that the in connection with requirement in rule is satisfied so long as the alleged misrepresentation coincides with a securities transaction whether by the plaintiff or by someone else.dabit,supra,at,italics added.it also cited sec zandford,d zandford,which noted that the sec has consistently adopted a broad reading of the part b phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.dabit stated congress can hardly have been unaware of the broad construction adopted by both this court and the sec when it imported the key phrase in connection with the purchase or sale into slusa core provision.dabit,supra,at.a narrow reading of the statute would undercut the effectiveness of pslra,and thus run contrary to the slusa stated purpose of prevent ing certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of pslra.id.at.
here,it is undisputed that both the class and the mutual funds at issue are covered as defined by slusa.it is also clear from the complaint that the action is based on state law.thus,the key question is whether the gravamen involves a misrepresentation or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of mutual funds we conclude it does.
the essence of plaintiffs second amended complaint is that the bank made misrepresentations and omitted material facts,including conflicts of interests and fees relating to the transfer of trust assets into proprietary and nonproprietary mutual funds.the complaint is replete with allegations that the bank failed to disclose,omitted details regarding fees and conflicts of interests,and that these omissions caused injury to the plaintiffs.for example,plaintiffs allege the bank invested trust assets in proprietary mutual funds in order to collect fees for itself and its affiliates,and failed to disclose these payments and its conflicts of interests.they also allege the bank invested trust assets in nonproprietary mutual funds without disclosing material details about fees and financial gain retained by the bank as a result of these investments.
further,each of the six causes of action hinges on harm caused by the bank misrepresentations.see rowinski salomon smith barney cir,misrepresentation prong was satisfied where the allegations of misrepresentation served as the factual predicate of state law causes of action.the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty includes an allegation that plaintiffs suffered injury as a result of the bank failure to provide full,candid disclosure.plaintiffs allege in their second cause of action for concealment that they were harmed because the bank did not honestly and fairly disclose all material facts regarding any misappropriation of trust assets and all fees and similar charges it collects from trust assets.the third cause of action for violation of the consumers legal remedies act and the fifth cause of action for unfair business practices contain allegations that the bank engaged in deceptive practices in connection with its investments and trust services.the remaining causes of action for conversion and misappropriation are laid out in general terms and contain no specific references to misrepresentation,but the bank failure to provide full disclosure regarding its investments provides the bases for these claims as well whether plaintiffs alleged omissions are couched in terms of a fiduciary duty or claims of fraud,they are,in essence,claims that the bank misrepresented or omitted key information about the securities transactions in which they were involved,thereby causing plaintiffs injuries.
cases decided after dabit,which have interpreted slusa in connection with language broadly to apply to actions alleging breaches of fiduciary duties in the context of relationships,provide further support for our conclusion that slusa applies in this case.see kutten,supra,wl.lexis rabin jpmorgan chase bank,wl.lexis rabin spencer wachovia bank,may.wl.lexis spencer siepel bank of america,siepel.in all of these cases,the plaintiffs,as in this case,were beneficiaries of fiduciary accounts for which the defendant banks were trustees.kutten,wl,at rabin,wl,at spencer,wl,at siepel,at.the plaintiffs alleged the banks wrongfully transferred trust assets into proprietary mutual funds without considering other alternatives,and failed to disclose the conflicts of interests and the fees resulting from those securities transactions.kutten,wl,at rabin,wl,at spencer,wl,at siepel,at.the courts uniformly concluded that slusa applied because the alleged misrepresentation or omission coincided with a securities transaction kutten,wl,at rabin,wl,at spencer,wl,pp,siepel,at.
while the above cases are not binding on this court,see forsyth jones th,d state courts not bound by federal district and circuit court decisions,their reasoning and analyses are consistent with dabit broad construction of the in connection with language,and with slusa stated purpose of prevent ing certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of pslra.slusa,stat.in addition,given the marked factual similarities between the above cases and the present case,we find them persuasive 
plaintiffs cite gavin v.at t cir gavin,a case,to support their position,but it is distinguishable from the allegations before us.in gavin,shareholders of mediaone,a company that was acquired by at t,brought a state court action against at t and its consultant defendants,alleging defendants fraudulently failed to inform mediaone shareholders that they had the option of exchanging mediaone shares with at t shares,free of charge.gavin,supra,at.according to the complaint,defendants only informed mediaone shareholders of a option for exchanging the shares.ibid.gavin held slusa did not apply because the alleged fraud of failing to inform mediaone shareholders of the free option occurred long after the securities transaction,the merger,took place.id.at.gavin concluded that the connection between the defendants
