background 
the thrift crisis of the early is a backdrop to winstar litigation.an account of the devastating collapse of the savings and loan industry,culminating in the enactment of firrea,has been extensively recounted in opinions of both the supreme court and this court.see,united states winstar,d winstar iv anderson united states,castle united states,landmark land,fdic,glendale fed.bank,fsb united states.a brief summary of this history may provide context for this particular dispute.
rising interest rates during the led to the insolvency of many savings and loan institutions thrifts.to attract new deposits,thrifts had to offer interest rates that far exceeded the income the thrifts were receiving from mortgage agreements previously entered into at lower rates.castle,at.this deficit cash flow predictably undermined the stability of many thrifts.the growing number of troubled thrifts threatened to exhaust the funds of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic that had been set aside for the reimbursement of depositors.to deal with this crisis,the federal home loan bank board fhlbb or bank board,the agency charged with channeling funds to the thrift industry,winstar iv,at,solicited private investors to purchase failing thrifts in supervisory merger transactions.landmark,at.in exchange for investors assuming the liabilities of a failing thrift,the bank board would permit the acquiring investors to allocate any shortfall between liabilities and real assets to an intangible asset known as supervisory goodwill.id.the acquiring investors benefited from two aspects of supervisory goodwill it could be used to meet a new or restructured thrift regulatory capital requirements,and it could be amortized over an extended period of time.glendale,at.
despite the superficial appeal of supervisory mergers,these arrangements could not rescue the industry and the fslic from a worsening crisis.anderson,at.in,congress intervened by enacting firrea.as part of an extensive reformation of the savings and loan industry,firrea mandated minimum capital requirements and prohibited the use of supervisory goodwill.id.no longer able to rely on supervisory goodwill,many thrifts could not comply with firrea capital requirements and were seized by regulators.
these events gave rise to hundreds of lawsuits by the acquirers of ailing thrifts.plaintiffs alleged that,by enacting firrea,the government breached contracts with the thrifts in which it had promised particular accounting treatment in connection with regulatory capital requirements.id.in united states winstar,the supreme court ruled that the terms of supervisory merger agreements were indeed enforceable against the government.winstar iv,at.the court left the extent of the government liability under each agreement to be determined on a basis.id.at.limiting the court holding to liability for breach of contract.
the hansens were among the many private investors who negotiated supervisory merger agreements with the fslic.in,the hansens submitted a successful bid to merge raritan,the bank they owned,with a severely insolvent thrift,first federal savings and loan of hammonton hammonton.hansen i.at.raritan was then a healthy thrift institution,allegedly with real assets of approximately million and positive capital of roughly million.hammonton,at that time,had a negative net worth of approximately million.
a may,agreement between the hansens and the fslic called for the merger of raritan and hammonton into a new thrift,hansen savings.hansen savings would be owned by an intermediary company,hansen bancorp,which,in turn,would be wholly owned by the hansens.the agreement was embodied in several integrated documents an assistance agreement,dated may,signed by representatives of the fslic,raritan,hansen bancorp,and by the hansens as individuals the assistance agreement a forbearance letter,dated may,from the fhlbb to joseph paparatto,president and chief executive officer of raritan the forbearance letter fhlbb resolution,dated may,approving the supervisory merger the fhlbb resolution and an opinion letter,dated september,from peat marwick main to the supervisory agent of the federal home loan bank of new york.id.these documents were integrated into a single binding contract.id.the integration clause of the assistance agreement,section,incorporated by reference contemporaneous documents and letters issued by the bank board and the fslic.
the hansens were required to commit both cash and stock to the raritan hammonton merger.thus,under the assistance agreement,the hansens were obligated to contribute,either directly or through hansen bancorp,million to the merged entity,hansen savings.at the same time,the fhlbb resolution required that the hansens execute a stock transfer stipulation as a condition of the agreement.this was accomplished through an agreement the stock exchange agreement that required the hansens to exchange the entirety of their holdings in raritan for shares in hansen savings,at a rate of exchange hansen ii.at.
in return for this performance by the hansens,the fslic agreed to infuse million into hansen savings.id.taking into account hammonton extensive liabilities,this contribution would leave hansen savings with a net liability of.hansen i.at.a deficit of this size would render hansen savings immediately insolvent.the terms of the agreement,however,avoided this result hansen savings was permitted to write off the million as supervisory goodwill,amortizing the asset via depreciation over years.id.pursuant to the forbearance letter,the fhlbb promised that it would forbear from regulatory action that would disallow this special accounting treatment or enforce regulatory capital requirements against hansen savings.the fslic also agreed to reimburse hansen savings for losses in excess of million on the required sale of certain of hammonton covered assets.hansen ii.at.
firrea prevented hansen savings from amortizing the supervisory goodwill from the hammonton transaction and from meeting its minimum capital requirements hansen savings ultimately became insolvent in january of,it was placed in receivership by the government.id.
on december,the hansens and hansen bancorp filed suit in the court of federal claims.in the action,the hansens sought to recover the million they contributed to hansen savings under the assistance agreement.they also sought to recover the value of the raritan stock they exchanged for shares of hansen savings under the stock exchange agreement according to their complaint,the enactment of firrea breached the government contractual commitment to forbear from certain regulatory action,to recognize supervisory goodwill for all regulatory capital purposes and to permit amortization of supervisory goodwill over years compl.
like all cases similarly situated,the hansens suit was stayed pending the decision of the supreme court in winstar iv.in winstar iv,the court affirmed the decision of this court in winstar united states,en banc winstar iii,that the united states was liable to respondents three thrifts for breach of contract.at.the contracts at issue in winstar permitted three thrift institutions to meet regulatory capital requirements by using a fictional asset called supervisory goodwill that represented the excess of the thrift liabilities over its assets,and to amortize that asset over a substantial period.fdic united states,quoting landmark,at.when the winstar iv stay was lifted,proceedings in this case were limited to whether a contract existed between the parties,and whether the government was properly liable for breach of that contract.hansen i.at.this limited disposition complied with the omnibus case management order instituted after the winstar iv decision.id.at.to establish both the existence of a contract and a breach,the hansen i court relied on close parallels between our facts and those in winstar iv.id.at.on motions for partial summary judgment,the court of federal claims ruled that a contract existed between the hansens and hansen bancorp,on the one hand,and the united states,on the other hand.id.at.the court also ruled that the enactment of firrea and its implementing regulations breached that contract.id.at.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment of liability in favor of the hansens and hansen.id.at.
the parties then for summary judgment on the issue of damages.hansen ii,fed.cl.at.relying on restitution and reliance damages theories,the hansens sought to recover the million they contributed to hansen savings under the assistance agreement,as well as the value of the raritan stock they exchanged for shares of hansen savings stock pursuant to the stock exchange agreement.for its part,the government moved for summary judgment barring any restitution.in the alternative,it urged that if any restitution was awarded,it be offset by a million stock dividend paid by hansen savings to the hansens after the merger.
the court of federal claims refused to decide the issue of reliance damages on summary judgment because it determined that there were genuine issues of material fact surrounding the causation component of such damages.on the other hand,because causation is not an element of restitution,the court determined that the hansens claims for those damages were amenable to summary judgment resolution.
as discussed below,the remedy of restitution is available only if the breaching party conduct amounts to a total breach of its contractual duties.in hansen ii,the court of federal claims did not discuss or refer to the particular facts of the hansen savings transaction.rather,it relied on the general implications of winstar to assess the materiality of the government breach 
although this court heretofore has not been called upon to characterize the government breach,it nevertheless has found that the supervisory goodwill promise was essential to that agreement.similarly,although the supreme court in winstar did not have occasion to characterize the breach according to any particular damages theory,it also held that the goodwill treatment was essential to supervisory merger transactions of the type at issue in that case 
winstar held that the repudiation of the supervisory goodwill promise breached an express agreement to allow such goodwill,or,at least,to carry the risk of loss with respect to the plaintiffs goodwill accounting treatment.the result of the government repudiation of goodwill accounting treatment was substantial and devastating,characterized by the court as swift and severe.indeed,the court observed that congress express intent in passing firrea was to abrogate or renege on the contracts entered into by fslic.firrea had the substantial effect of releasing the government from its own contractual obligations.the federal circuit also has described the contractual obligation of goodwill accounting treatment as one of substantial value for plaintiffs.although eschewing the term total or substantial breach,the supreme court and federal circuit in winstar effectively ruled that the government abrogated its responsibility to allow supervisory goodwill,that this abrogation made it impossible for the government to perform its duty under the contract,and that the government thereby breached essential or critical provision s of the assistance agreements.the court therefore concludes that the government conduct in this case constituted a total breach of the assistance agreement.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.
having determined that there had been a total breach of contract,the court of federal claims proceeded to consider whether principles of restitution permitted recovery for the hansens.under landmark,the court noted,entitlement to restitution turns on the express content of the parties written agreement.id.at citing landmark,at.in landmark,we held that restitution is proper only where the contribution that the party is seeking to recover was made in exact conformity with the literal terms of the contract recovery may not be had where the plaintiff acted voluntarily,even if the action was taken with the intent to effectuate the spirit of the agreement.landmark,at.
because the hansens million dollar capital contribution was explicitly required by section b of the assistance agreement the court of federal claims granted summary judgment awarding restitution in that amount to the hansens.the court rejected the government argument that the million dollar dividend received by the hansens approximately one year after the merger should be offset against the restitution award.relying on landmark,the court stated that an offset was not proper,regardless of what defendant proved at trial,as the government actions were simply not relevant to the dividends.hansen ii,fed.cl.at quoting landmark,at.thus,the court concluded that the hansens were entitled to recover the full million.
the court of federal claims ruled against the hansens,however,on their claim for restitution of the value of the raritan stock they exchanged for shares of hansen savings stock pursuant to the stock exchange agreement.in the court view,recovery based on the raritan stock transfer depended on whether,as a matter of law,fhlbb requirement that plaintiffs exchange their stock in raritan constitutes a contribution of that stock under the assistance agreement.id.at.the court held that it did not.the court stated that it had no basis to find that the exchange of stock was a transaction that caused either a loss to plaintiffs or a benefit to defendant.id.the court again reasoned from landmark.because plaintiffs were already subject to a duty under new jersey law that required the exchange of shares to complete a merger,the mere repetition of that requirement in the fhlbb resolution did not elevate it to a contractual term compensable by restitution.id.at.while the hansens may have been acting in the spirit of the agreement,they were not strictly performing a duty set forth in the assistance agreement.therefore,the court ruled the hansens were not entitled to restitution of the value of their raritan stock.
the court articulated several additional arguments against restitution,all supporting the conclusion that neither a loss to plaintiffs n or a benefit to defendant,id.at,arose from the stock exchange.the court analogized to tax law,which provides that no gains or losses shall be recognized from an exchange of stock accomplished pursuant to a plan of corporate reorganization.the court also was persuaded by the continuity of the hansens ownership they had owned all outstanding stock in raritan prior to the merger and maintained that full ownership control in the new entity,hansen savings.the court interpreted the stock exchange requirement as a transfer that did not diminish the hansens ownership,rather than as a contribution,which would have necessitated some surrender of the hansens controlling interest.this characterization affected the availability of recovery any claim for the loss of raritan value thus is actually a claim for the loss of value of hansen bancorp shares.such a claim is not a claim for restitution,but a claim for loss of share value as the consequential damages of defendant breach.id.
following the hansen ii decision,the plaintiffs withdrew all claims for reliance damages to expedite entry of a final judgment and this appeal.in due course,the court entered final judgment pursuant to its rule,and this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
we review a grant of summary judgment by the court of federal claims de novo to determine whether the summary judgment standard has been correctly applied.summary judgment can only be entered if there remains no genuine issue of material fact.fed.cl.c castle,at.a court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party and then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
on appeal,the hansens argue that the court of federal claims erred in rejecting their claim in restitution for the value of the raritan stock they exchanged for hansen savings stock pursuant to the stock exchange agreement.for its part,the government.in so doing,it challenges the court of federal claims ruling that there was a total breach,the predicate for an award of damages based on restitution.the government further argues,however,that assuming the court of federal claims correctly decided that there was a total breach of contract,the court properly rejected the hansens claim for the value of the raritan stock,but erred in ruling that the government was not entitled to have offset against the award of the hansens million capital contribution the million dividend the hansens received from hansen savings.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the court of federal claims erred in ruling on summary judgment that the government breach of contract was total.accordingly,we vacate and remand.
a review of the basic principles relating to remedies for breach of contract may be helpful to an understanding of the issues in this case.when parties enter into a contract,and promise each other that they will perform in accordance with the terms of their agreement,they retain a choice when the time comes they can perform,and accept whatever benefits and losses the contract gives them,or they can refuse to perform and pay the consequences.glendale,at.in the event of a breach,contract law recognizes that the promisee has three enforceable interests expectation,reliance,and restitution.restatement second of contracts 
compensation of a party expectation interest attempt s to put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed,that is,had there been no breach.id.cmt.a.this is commonly referred to as giv ing the injured party the benefit of the bargain.id.an award of lost profits is one way of compensating the promisee,or the party,expectation interest.see energy capital united states,citing glendale,at.
reliance damages provide another way for a party to recover losses suffered as the result of a breach of contract.restatement second of contracts b.as reliance damages,the party may recover expenses of preparation of part performance,as well as other foreseeable expenses incurred in reliance upon the contract.john calamari joseph perillo,the law of contracts ed cited in glendale,at.
it is the third type of damages,restitution damages,which are at issue in this case.restitution has been characterized as a position for the injured party who is unable to prove expectancy damages.glendale,at.we explained in glendale that t he idea behind restitution is to restore that is,to restore the party to the position he would have been in had there never been a contract to breach.id.in other words,t he objective is to return the parties,as nearly as practicable,to the situation in which they found themselves before they made the contract.restatement second of contracts cmt.significantly,relief in restitution is available only if the breach gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach and not merely to a claim for damages for partial breach.id.a total breach is defined as one that so substantially impairs the value of the contract to the injured party at the time of the breach that it is just in the circumstances to allow him to recover damages based on all his remaining rights to performance.id.against this background,we turn to the government.we address the first because it presents a challenge to the court of federal claims finding of total breach.it was that finding that provided the predicate for the court award of restitution damages.absent a total breach,there can be no such damages.
as seen above,in holding that the government conduct amounted to a total breach of contract,the court of federal claims pointed to the decision of the supreme court in winstar iv,as well as decisions of this court.thus,it noted the court statement that goodwill treatment was essential to supervisory merger transactions of the type at issue in that case.hansen ii,fed.cl.at quoting winstar iv,at.it also noted the court statement that firrea had the substantial effect of releasing the government from its own contractual obligations.id.at quoting winstar iv,at.after observing that in glendale we described the contractual obligation of goodwill accounting treatment as one of substantial value,id.citing glendale,at,the court of federal claims reasoned that in winstar iii and winstar iv both the federal circuit and the supreme court effectively ruled that the government abrogated its responsibility to allow supervisory goodwill and that this abrogation made it impossible for the government to perform its duty under the contract.id.the court therefore concluded that the government had committed a total breach of contract when firrea prevented hansen savings from amortizing the supervisory goodwill from the raritan hammonton transaction and from meeting its minimum capital requirements.id.
in arguing that the court of federal claims erred in ruling that there was a total breach in this case,the government asserts that the court failed to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the contract and the breach of contract at issue.according to the government,the court mistakenly relied upon what the government characterizes as dicta from winstar iv and neglected to account for what the government refers to as its performance of many of its more substantial contractual obligations.the government also urges that the court failed to address the fact that the hansens substantially altered the character of hansen savings after acquiring control.
the hansens respond that the court of federal claims did properly conclude that the enactment and implementation of firrea amounted to a total breach of contract.they first point to the supreme court statement in winstar iv that t he principal inducement for these supervisory mergers was an understanding that the acquisitions would be subject to a particular accounting treatment that would help the acquiring institutions meet their reserve capital requirements imposed by federal regulations.at.next,the hansens state that the contract at issue in this case contained the same key provisions as the contract at issue in winstar.they assert that the government obligations with respect to the treatment of supervisory goodwill were essential and that,but for those obligations,hansen savings would have been insolvent the moment it came into existence upon the merger of raritan and hammonton.according to the hansens,the central issue is whether the enforcement of firrea implementing regulations,which were contrary to the government contractual obligations,particularly the obligation to allow supervisory goodwill,materially breached the contract.whether or not the government fulfilled its other obligations under the contract and whether or not hansen savings would have failed anyway because of mismanagement,a matter relating to causation,are irrelevant considerations,say the hansens.
we agree with the government that,insofar as the issue of total breach is concerned,the winstar cases do not control this case.in winstar united states.winstar i,the court of federal claims found an contract to exist between the plaintiffs and the united states,but ordered further briefing on various contract issues.in winstar united states.winstar ii,the court of federal claims granted the plaintiffs motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability,concluding that the government had breached contractual obligations to permit the plaintiffs to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward their regulatory capital requirements.see statesman sav.holding united states.granting summary judgment on liability to glendale federal bank,fsb and the statesman group,two other acquirers of failed thrift institutions.in winstar iii,this court,sitting en banc,affirmed the court of federal claims rulings on liability.we concluded that the fslic had made express contracts with the several plaintiffs,including a promise that supervisory goodwill and capital credits would be counted toward satisfaction of regulatory capital requirements.id.at.the supreme court granted certiorari and affirmed our en banc decision.winstar iv,at.
the supreme court took winstar to consider the extent to which special rules,not generally applicable to private contracts,governed enforcement of the contracts at issue in the case.id.at.the court stated that it was deciding whether the united states could assert four special defenses to the plaintiffs claims for breach the canon of construction that surrenders of sovereign authority must appear in unmistakable terms,bowen public agencies opposed to social security entrapment,d the rule that an agent authority to make such surrenders must be delegated in express terms,home telephone telegraph los angeles.the doctrine that a government may not,in any event,contract to surrender certain reserved powers,stone mississippi,otto.and the principle that a government sovereign acts do not give rise to a claim for breach of contract,horowitz united states.winstar iv,at.the court affirmed our en banc decision after rejecting each of these defenses.significantly,the court did not mention,let alone address,the question of whether the government breach of contract was total,so as to make the plaintiffs eligible for awards of restitution damages.rather,the court concluded,because the court of federal claims has not yet determined the appropriate measure or amount of damages in this case,we remand for further proceedings.id.at.emphasis added.under these circumstances,the government is correct that the several statements from winstar iv that were cited by the court of federal claims in hansen ii,see.at,are not apposite.in short,while winstar serves as the starting point in this case,it does not answer the question of whether the actions of the united states amounted to a total breach of contract,so as to entitle the hansens to the remedy of restitution.it is to that question that we now turn.
we start from the premise that a total breach is a breach that so substantially impairs the value of the contract to the injured party at the time of the breach that it is just in the circumstances to allow him to recover damages based on all his remaining rights to performance.restatement second of contracts.for our purposes,the critical part of this formulation is the statement that the breach substantially impairs the value of the contract to the injured party at the time of the breach.for all intents and purposes,this is a way of saying that the breach must be of a relatively high degree of importance.george palmer,the law of restitution.section of the restatement lists five circumstances that are significant in determining whether a breach is material 
a the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected 
b the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived 
c the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture 
d the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure,taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances 
e the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.
the comment to section explains that the standard of materiality is necessarily imprecise and flexible.restatement second of contracts cmt.thus,it is not to be expected that,in every case,each of the five listed circumstances will be pertinent.for example,it is difficult to see how circumstance c the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture could apply to the united states in this case.it is to be expected,however,that circumstance a the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected will always be a pertinent consideration in deciding whether the breach is essential enough to justify restitution,a court should be concerned primarily with the objective of the plaintiff in seeking the performance promised by the defendant.palmer,the law of restitution see also mobil oil,at.u nder the contracts,the incorporated procedures and standards amounted to a gateway to the companies enjoyment of all other rights.to significantly narrow that gateway violated material conditions in the contracts.the breach was substantial,depriving the companies of the benefit of their bargain.restatement.with an eye to section,we have stated that the determination of whether a breach was material depends on the nature and effect of the violation in light of how the particular contract was viewed,bargained for,entered into,and performed by the parties.stone forest,united states.
as noted,the government argues that the court of federal claims erred in its total breach analysis because it looked solely to winstar and failed to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the contract and the breach at issue,as required by law.the government emphasizes that if the hansens received a substantial part of what they bargained for,the breach can not be characterized as total.as evidence that the hansens enjoyed substantial benefits from the contract,the government points to the hansens operation of hansen savings from to without interruption.in addition,the government argues that,during that time,fslic contributions eliminated more than million of hammonton million deficit.the government also disputes whether enforcement of firrea capital requirements was indeed inconsistent with the original agreement.according to the government,under the agreement,it was entitled to enforce minimum capital requirements if capital losses occurred for reasons unrelated to hansen savings acquisition of hammonton.in sum,the government urges that,apart from firrea termination of favorable accounting treatment for supervisory goodwill,it satisfied all its contractual obligations.that being the case,the government argues that the breach can not be viewed as total.
the hansens respond that the court of federal claims extensive analysis of winstar iv supports its holding that there was a total breach in this case.the hansens explain that the court of federal claims was presented with,and indeed did consider,all of the arguments about materiality of breach that the government now raises on appeal.it would be speculation,say the hansens,to presume that the court did not fully consider the government position before rejecting it.
we can not overlook,as the hansens urge,the absence in the court of federal claims decision of consideration of the government argument that the breach in this case was partial,rather than total.the degree to which the government fulfilled its obligations under the merger agreement remains sharply contested between the parties.the court acknowledged as much,stating that to the extent that the financial position of the thrift is found to be relevant to plaintiffs claims for restitution damages,summary judgment is inappropriate because virtually every fact involving causation is in dispute.hansen ii,fed.cl.at.the character of the government breach,dispositive of the issue of restitution damages,requires further consideration and resolution of disputed factual issues.
we therefore hold that the court of federal claims erred in ruling on summary judgment that the government breach of contract was total,so as to make the hansens eligible for an award of restitution damages.accordingly,the judgment awarding the hansens million in restitution damages is vacated.the case is remanded to the court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
if a court determines that a breach of contract was total,the case proceeds to the next stage where the injured party seeks to establish that the particular damages it is seeking qualify as proper restitution.see mobil oil,at.thus,in this case,after finding that the government breach of contract was total,the court of federal claims addressed the hansens several claims for restitution.on appeal,both the hansens and the government challenge certain of the court rulings on the items of restitution that were sought.if,on remand,the court of federal claims determines that the government breach was not total,these challenges will become moot because the hansens will not be entitled to any restitution.if,however,the court determines that the government breach was total,it is reasonable to expect that the court will do one of two things decide anew the question of what restitution is appropriate,or simply enter the same judgment that it entered following its decision in hansen ii.under these circumstances,although technically the proper measure of restitution damages is not before us,we believe that the interest of judicial economy makes it appropriate for us to state our views on this issue for the benefit of the parties and the trial court.see.coast ry.united states,although the trial judge had ruled only on the issue of liability and the determination of quantum was reserved for further proceedings,the court addressed quantum because it thought it appropriate to comment for the further guidance of the parties and the trial judge,and to underscore its judgment as to a controverted important issue central to the case.we state our views in the context of the arguments already presented to us by the parties.first,however,we note certain principles applicable to restitution damages.
section of the restatement provides in relevant part as follows 
subject to the rule stated in subsection,on a breach by that gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach the injured party is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance.
the injured party has no right to restitution if he has performed all of his duties under the contract and no performance by the other party remains due other than payment of a definite sum of money for that performance.
restatement second of contracts.thus,when faced with a claim for restitution following a total breach,a court must determine whether the claimant,or party,conferred a benefit upon the breaching party.if a benefit was conferred,and the exception in subsection of section does not apply,the court must determine the measure of restitution.
the restatement further provides that i f a sum of money is awarded to protect a party restitution interest,it may be measured by either a the reasonable value to the other party of what he received in terms of what it would have cost him to obtain it from a person in the claimant position,or b the extent to which the other party property has been increased in value or his other interests advanced.id.
we have stated that restitution may be measured by either the value of the benefits received by the defendant due to the plaintiff performance or the cost of the plaintiff performance,which includes both the value of the benefits provided to the defendant and the plaintiff other costs incurred as a result of its performance under the contract.landmark,at emphases added.the party is not limited to recovering the particular value of its services to the defendant rather,it may recover in restitution the reasonable market value of those services,measured at the time of performance.acme process equip.united states,rev on other grounds,d.however,the party may be compensated only for the net loss that results from the defendant breach.see landmark,at because the purpose of restitution is to restore the plaintiff to its status quo ante,the award to the plaintiff must be reduced by the value of any benefits that it received from the defendant under the contract,so that only the actual,or net,loss is compensated.finally,if the value of the benefit conferred upon the breaching party is not ascertainable through some usable measure of damages,restitution may not be possible.lasalle,at.
restitution may be inappropriate in two circumstances.the first is where relief would result in an unfair windfall to the party.while an award of restitution should seek to return the party to as good of a position as it would have been in if the contract had never been entered into,the party should not be placed in a better position through the award of damages than if there had been no breach.bluebonnet sav.bank,united states.courts should avoid bestowing an unfair windfall on the plaintiff by compensating him or her above and beyond the losses suffered under the breached agreement.see lasalle,at noting the general principle that the party is not entitled,through the award of damages,to achieve a position superior to the one it would reasonably have occupied had the breach not occurred.
finally,section of the restatement precludes restitution when the party can not return any interest in property that he has received in exchange in substantially as good condition as when it was received by him thus,if the party has used,destroyed or substantially altered in character property received from the breaching party so that return is not feasible,restitution is generally not available.restatement second of contracts cmt.a.we turn now to the question of restitution in this case.
we turn first to the court of federal claims decision not to offset the hansens recovery of their million capital contribution with the million dividend they received from hansen savings.we see no error in this decision.the government correctly argues that,generally,any award of restitution to a plaintiff should be offset by the benefits he or she already has received from the defendant.see id.a party who seeks restitution of a benefit that he has conferred on the other party is expected to return what he has received from the other party.however,this proposition does not come into play here.landmark makes clear that offset is only proper where the benefits at issue were received directly from the breaching party.here,the dividend was not received from the government,nor pursuant to any requirement of the contract.the dividend from hansens savings can not be fairly attributed to the government accordingly,it should not detract from any recovery by the hansens of their capital contribution.landmark,at stating that because the government was not responsible for the dividends paid offset would not be proper.
we turn next to the hansens claim for restitution of the value of the raritan stock they exchanged for stock of hansen savings.as we explain,we think that if,on remand,the court of federal claims determines that the government breach of con
