plaintiff golden pacific bancorp bancorp or plaintiff appeals from a judgment filed on june,by the united states district court for the southern district of new york naomi reice buchwald,judge,golden pac.bancorp ex rel.golden pac.bank fdic,civ,wl,at june,granting summary judgment to defendant federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or defendant on the grounds that plaintiff claims brought in are barred by a release entered into between plaintiff and defendant,or alternatively,by new york statute of limitations for claims of unjust enrichment,breach of fiduciary duty,and corporate waste under.id.at.on appeal,plaintiff asserts,inter alia,that the release does not bar its claims because the language of the release does not cover them and that the statute of limitations does not bar its claims because it runs from the termination of the receivership on november.for the reasons stated below,we vacate and remand the cause to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
bancorp owned more than of the stock in golden pacific national bank the bank,which was closed on june,by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ after the occ had determined that the bank was insolvent.the fdic immediately placed the bank into receivership and proceeded to pay the bank depositors.the fdic also charged its legal and office expenses to the estate of the receivership.after it completed payment to the bank depositors,the fdic paid itself interest to which it believed itself entitled,with its first payment on march.the fdic ended the receivership on november.
substantial litigation between the present parties followed in the wake of the occ decision to close the bank.in september,soon after the bank was closed,the fdic brought a civil action the september action against a number of the bank officers seeking to recover million in assets from those who allegedly owe d funds to the bank either as borrowers or guarantors.fdic chuang.the defendants in that action counterclaimed for breach of fiduciary duty,misappropriation of funds,and loss of business opportunities in connection with some of the fdic actions as receiver.the fdic brought a second action in,seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the status of certain of the bank liabilities,in which it ultimately prevailed.
in addition,beginning in,bancorp twice tried unsuccessfully to sue the occ,contending that the occ had erroneously determined that the bank was insolvent at the time of its closure.in these two related,successive actions,bancorp claims were held meritless under the administrative procedure act and the federal tort claims act,golden pac.bancorp clarke,and held not to constitute a taking under the fifth amendment,golden pac.bancorp united states.
then,in may,bancorp former president and chief executive officer,joseph chuang,brought an action the may action against the fdic,among others,claiming that it had appropriated his law offices in connection with the seizure of the bank.as part of the combined settlement of the may action and the september action,the parties agreed to exchange certain releases not a party to either a release on june,the release,stating in relevant part 
bancorp hereby releases the fdic,in its corporate capacity and in its capacity as receiver of the bank c from any and all claims which bancorp has or may have arising from or with respect to the decision of the occ to close the bank on june,
bancorp commenced the instant action in the southern district of new york on october,one day before the fdic terminated the receivership.it asserted four claims that the fdic was liable for unjust enrichment for paying itself interest that the fdic breached its fiduciary duty to bancorp in its actions relating to the closure of the bank,including its sale of certain bank assets for an amount far below true franchise value that the fdic wasted corporate assets of the bank when it charged various legal and office expenses to the receivership estate for its own benefit and that the fdic provided an inadequate accounting of the receivership estate.first am,filed.in may,the fdic moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,pursuant to the federal tort claims act,a,and the administrative procedure act,a.the district court allen schwartz,judge denied defendant motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,but referred to a magistrate judge the question of whether plaintiff claims were.
on december,after the parties completed discovery,the fdic filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that bancorp action was barred by the release of june,and by the applicable statute of limitations.on june,the district court naomi reice buchwald,judge concluded that plaintiff claims were barred by the release or,in the alternative,by new york statute of limitations.golden,wl,at.accordingly,it granted summary judgment for the fdic.

recall that the may release stated in relevant part 
bancorp hereby releases the fdic,in its corporate capacity and in its capacity as receiver of the bank c from any and all claims which bancorp has or may have arising from or with respect to the decision of the occ to close the bank on june.
the district court found that the release was unambiguous and covered all of plaintiff claims 
we find the language of the june release to be unambiguous,and to encompass plaintiff claims that the fdic improperly managed the bank receivership.the text specific reference to the fdic in its capacity as receiver of the bank clearly demonstrates the parties intent to include the fdic handling of the receivership within the scope of the release.the claims at issue here,the hksb asset transfer,payment of fdic office expenses and legal fees from the receivership estate,and payment of interest to creditors,are unambiguously claims that bancorp ha d or may have had against as of june when the former released the lat t er.bancorp present attempt to argue that it had not intended to release defendant from the claims it now asserts simply can not be reconciled with the unambiguous text of the release.

we do not find the contractual language to be as clear as the district court did.we recently recalled that t he language of a contract is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement.krumme westpoint stevens,cir internal quotation marks omitted applying new york law.here,one could reasonably interpret the contract differently than the district court did.the natural meaning of the contract was an agreement to release the fdic from claims based on the occ decision to close the bank,not on claims of independent wrongdoing thereafter.the release specifies claims arising from or with respect to the decision of the occ to close the bank.emphasis supplied.it is far from clear whether claims of wrongdoing by the fdic in its management of the receivership of the bank aris e from or with respect to the decision to close the bank.
to be sure,the district court held that because the receivership was the direct result of the occ decision,and can be said to have arisen therefrom,the release includes claims based on the fdic mismanagement of the receivership.golden,wl,at.but,in our view of the matter,the district court interpretation stretches the language arising from beyond its normal limits.bancorp agreed to release claims arising from the decision of the occ to close the bank,emphasis supplied,not from each and every event that followed thereafter.if one were to adopt the district court interpretation,then any act,no matter how far down the chain of causation and remotely related to the decision of the occ to close the bank,would fall within the scope of the release.this sort of causal reasoning would be analogous to finding that a patient,who signed a release with similar language to that in the instant case,had relinquished all claims relating to a second negligent operation performed to correct the negligence of the first operation,since the second operation was the direct result of and can be said to have arisen from the first.it is hard to believe that the parties intended the release to be so broad.nor is it clear from the rest of the language of the release that their intention was so.had the parties intended the release to include claims based on the fdic management of the receivership,it would have been simple enough for them to adopt language that made clear their understanding.
we are not persuaded by the district court position that t he text specific reference to the fdic in its capacity as receiver of the bank clearly demonstrates the parties intent to include the fdic handling of the receivership within the scope of the release.golden,wl,at second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.even though the release refers to the fdic capacity as receiver,the release notably makes no mention of the fdic management of the receivership.one could reasonably conclude that the release mentioned the fdic in its capacity as receiver not to foreclose all possible claims by bancorp against the fdic as receiver,but rather because that was the capacity in which the fdic brought suit in the september action and was sued in the may action.indeed,the release specifically refers to the claims and counterclaims in the september action.in any case,the contract wording requires us to conclude that the release did not unambiguously relinquish bancorp claims against the fdic for its alleged mismanagement of the bank.
where an agreement is ambiguous,a court may resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intent.stage club realty,dep t.the parol evidence rule will not bar admission of evidence that clarifies the ambiguity,so long as the evidence is not inconsistent with the express terms of the contract.id.there is ample extrinsic evidence in the instant case supporting bancorp argument that it did not intend to release the fdic from all claims of wrongdoing relating to the receivership.bancorp presented affidavits from two witnesses to the negotiation and execution of the release joseph chuang,who signed the release,and thomas brooks,to bancorp.chuang testified in his affidavit that when he executed the release he had no intention of releasing the fdic from any claims stemming from its role in managing the receivership.chuang aff.moreover,brooks attested to bancorp rejection of an earlier draft release proposed by the fdic.brooks aff.that draft release was far broader in scope than the release ultimately executed.it provided in relevant part 
bancorp hereby releases the fdic from any and all disputes and claims with and against the fdic the bank which bancorp any of bancorp successors or assigns now has,ever had,or which may hereafter accrue,based on acts,omissions or transactions occurring prior to.without limiting the foregoing bancorp releases the fdic and the bank from any dispute or claim arising from or in respect of the closing of the bank or any act taken by,or omission of,the fdic as receiver of the bank.
emphasis supplied.that rejected by have barred bancorp claims here,which indeed arise from act s taken by the fdic as receiver of the bank.that bancorp rejected draft contract language which explicitly released the fdic from any act taken or omitted as receiver of the bank strongly suggests that bancorp did not intend to relinquish such claims in the final release.
the district court,in an alternative holding,concluded that,even if the release were to be considered ambiguous,necessitating an examination of extrinsic evidence,bancorp proffered parol evidence would not have altered its decision that the release barred bancorp claims.golden,wl,at.first,the district court discounted brooks statement made in that bancorp should not execute a release as it was not a party to the september action brought by fdic.id.the district court found that this statement alone was unavailing because,in any event,bancorp ultimately executed the release.id.second,the district court gave no weight to brooks statement that he had rejected an earlier draft of the release.id.it concluded,h aving reviewed both versions,that the earlier version differs from the one ultimately signed,but it was unable to infer from the change that the parties intended to exclude plaintiff claims against the receiver from the release ambit.id.
we disagree with the district court conclusions.to be sure,brooks statement that he had advised bancorp not to execute any release does not help one interpret the scope of the release actually executed.still,the district court did not give due weight to the chuang affidavit,which bears directly on bancorp intention in signing the release.nor did it give adequate consideration to brooks statement describing rejection of the first draft release.moreover,the court failed to give sufficient weight to the presence in the first draft release of a provision expressly releasing the fdic from any act or omission taken as receiver and the absence of any such clause in the final,executed release.taken together,the evidence from chuang affidavit,brooks statement describing the rejection of the first draft release,and the first draft release itself,raises a genuine issue of material fact as to the parties intentions in executing the final release.accordingly,the release should not have been the basis for summary judgment in favor of the fdic.see mangini mcclurg,holding that summary judgment based on release should not have been grante
