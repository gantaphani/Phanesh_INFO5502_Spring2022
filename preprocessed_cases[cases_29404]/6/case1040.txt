when a purported deal to develop affordable housing in cameroon fell apart,mbi group,and atlantic group,sci,sued the government of cameroon and a mortgage finance corporation,crédit foncier du cameroun.concluding it would be more appropriate for this case to be heard in cameroon,the district court dismissed the suit on the ground of forum non conveniens.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal as well as the district court denial of their motion for reconsideration,and we affirm.
in,mbi group,a delaware corporation,and atlantic group,mbi cameroonian affiliate,brought suit in the district court seeking damages from crédit foncier du cameroun cfc and the government of cameroon for breach of contract and various commercial torts.plaintiffs allege they had an agreement with cfc to construct housing in cameroon,but that government officials there quashed the project when roger tchoufa,mbi representative in cameroon,rebuffed their demands for bribes.according to defendants,the project was only an illegal ploy to enable by a crooked official of cfc.
the district court decided that the cameroonian courts were better suited to sort out what actually happened,and,on june,granted defendants motion for a forum non conveniens dismissal.mbi group,credit foncier du cameroun mbi i,d.i n an abundance of caution and to avoid any potential undue prejudice to plaintiffs,the court conditioned the dismissal on the cameroonian courts acceptance of the case.id.at.
plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the dismissal two weeks later,styling their motion both as one to alter or amend a judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e and as a one for relief from a final judgment under rule b.their primary contention was that they could not possibly make the prohibitively steep deposit required for a court in cameroon to consider their case.unwilling to accept plaintiffs claims about the deposit,the district court dismissed their motion for reconsideration without prejudice pending a ruling from a cameroonian court specifying what that nation law required.see mbi group,credit foncier du cameroun mbi ii,slip op.at.
after the court in cameroon dismissed their suit,plaintiffs renewed their motion for reconsideration in the district court,which was denied on june.the district court concluded that the ruling of the cameroonian court did not support plaintiffs claims about the deposit,and that plaintiffs offered no other ground for overturning the dismissal.see mbi group,credit foncier du cameroun mbi iii,d,d.
plaintiffs noticed an appeal.there is some confusion as to whether that appeal is limited to the june,order denying reconsideration or includes the june,order dismissing their suit as well.compare notice of appeal,mbi group,credit foncier du cameroun,july,indicating an intent to appeal both rulings,with appellants br.at i listing the district court denial of reconsideration as the only ruling under review.little turns on this.two of the three arguments plaintiffs press before us involve events occurring after the dismissal of their suit in the district court,and thus implicate only their request for reconsideration.to the limited extent the original dismissal is concerned,defendants have had the opportunity to respond to plaintiffs arguments and suffer no prejudice by our consideration of that ruling.we therefore proceed under the assumption that plaintiffs properly appealed both the denial of reconsideration and the underlying dismissal.
we have jurisdiction to review these rulings under.see ciralsky cia,dismissal order and denial of a rule e motion servants of paraclete does,cir denial of a rule b motion.we review the forum non conveniens dismissal as well as the denial of relief under rules e and b for abuse of discretion.see agudas chasidei chabad russian fed n,forum non conveniens dismissal firestone firestone,per curiam denial of a rule e motion twelve john does district of columbia,d.denial of a rule b motion.
there is a substantial presumption in favor of a plaintiff chosen forum.agudas chasidei chabad,at.a court may nonetheless dismiss a suit for forum non conveniens if the defendant shows there is an alternative forum that is both available and adequate and,upon a weighing of public and private interests,the strongly preferred location for the litigation.id.in this case,the district court found a viable forum in cameroon and rejected plaintiffs concerns that they would be incapable of getting a fair trial there.mbi i,d at.weighing the private and public interests,the court concluded that the scale tipped heavily in favor of adjudication in cameroon.id.at.
as noted above,two issues plaintiffs raise on appeal concern only their motion for reconsideration.they argue that,upon reconsideration,the district court should have determined that an exorbitant court deposit effectively blocked the prosecution of their suit in cameroon and concluded that cameroon was an inadequate forum in light of the default convictions roger tchoufa and his wife sustained there.plaintiffs final contention is that the public and private interests favored trial in the united states.we consider each argument in turn.
after the district court conditionally dismissed this suit,plaintiffs sued defendants in cameroon.upon the filing of that action,the court clerk requested a deposit of roughly five percent of the judgment sought.because plaintiffs complaint claimed million in damages,the bill approached million.seeking reconsideration in the district court,plaintiffs argued that they could not pursue their claims in cameroon on account of this prohibitively expensive deposit.they claimed that the subsequent dismissal of their cameroonian suit definitively established that the deposit was unavoidable and,as such,an insurmountable obstacle to satisfaction of the district court condition that the cameroonian courts accept their case.
the district court determined that not a deposit the real obstacle to the success of their cameroonian suit because they at every step of the way impeded the cameroonian courts ability to consider their case.mbi iii,d at.on appeal,plaintiffs contend the district court should have concluded that the courts in cameroon,by demanding an exorbitant filing fee,were effectively unavailable to them.
the district court was within its discretion in denying reconsideration if in fact plaintiffs sabotaged their own suit.see in re,cir explaining that if the plaintiffs did not act in good faith and manipulated the dismissal of their case in mexico,the district court should regard itself as free once again to dismiss this complaint.a conditional forum non conveniens dismissal protects a plaintiff against the possibility that the foreign forum will not hear his case.it does not give the plaintiff license to deliberately prevent his suit in the foreign court from going forward in order to render an alternative forum defective.the only question we face,then,is whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the blame for plaintiffs case being dismissed by the cameroonian court must be placed on plaintiffs themselves.mbi iii,d at.we find no abuse of discretion in this conclusion.
to begin with,the district court reasonably determined that potential alternatives to making the million deposit were available to plaintiffs.see id.although plaintiffs legal experts said the deposit was unavoidable,defendants vigorously disagreed.they submitted that all but about of the million deposit reflected a tax that plaintiffs would owe only if they recovered the amount sought.defendants experts identified at least three ways by which plaintiffs could avoid this payment they could omit the amount sought from their complaint,obtain a deferral of the payment until the entry of judgment,or seek judicial review of the amount requested on the theory that no tax payment is required in a suit against the government and a government corporation.defendants even secured successive hearings in a cameroonian court to argue for a lower deposit.plaintiffs failed to appear.
in light of these alternatives,the district court instructed plaintiffs to pursue ways of reducing,waiving,or at least postponing the deposit.mbi group credit foncier du cameroun,slip op.at.in particular,the court warned plaintiffs they could not ignore the opportunity to contest the deposit amount and then expect the court to find the cameroonian forum unavailable.id.at.
chided by the district court,plaintiffs finally appeared in the cameroonian proceedings.but once there,they argued that the amount of the deposit could not be altered.they also highlighted a second procedural defect in their case they had failed to return the original copy of the summons for their lawsuit,which is a threshold requirement to bring an action in cameroon.they even objected to the proceedings altogether,arguing it was their exclusive right to seek a hearing on the deposit,and that defendants could not request one on their behalf.for their part,defendants argued that no tax payment was needed in a suit against the state and a entity.
the cameroonian court issued an opinion declaring plaintiffs suit inadmissible for failure to make a deposit and to file the original of the summons.mbi group,crédit foncier du cameroun,civil judgment,higher court of yaoundé,translation at.plaintiffs claimed victory,arguing that the cameroonian court had adopted their position that the million deposit was obligatory,thereby making the prosecution of their claim in cameroon infeasible.
the district court disagreed.it determined that the dismissal was effectively for failure to prosecute.see mbi iii,d at.in the court view,plaintiffs chose not to satisfy the threshold procedural requirements to suit in a deposit and returning the summons.they also chose not to seek relief from those requirements.what more,they essentially asked that their procedural defaults be enforced against them.see id.the district court found no reason to suppose that a cameroonian court,any more than an american one,would compel plaintiffs to pursue advantageous procedural alternatives they consciously eschewed.see id.a lthough courts permit filing fees to be reduced for plaintiffs without adequate financial means,a court can not require a plaintiff to file the application needed for in forma pauperis status.the district court concluded that the possibility of success was not so remote as to excuse plaintiffs duty to proceed in good faith in cameroon in an attempt to reduce the clerk initial determination of a million deposit.id.at.accordingly,the district court adhered to its prior determination that the cameroonian courts offered an available alternative forum.
plaintiffs maintain the district court abused its discretion because the decision of the court in cameroon,properly understood,established that the million deposit was mandatory.we disagree.the cameroonian ruling did not address defendants arguments concerning the deposit.perhaps,as plaintiffs contend,this omission amounts to an implicit rejection of defendants position that the deposit amount was set in error.but this silence could just as easily reflect acceptance of plaintiffs argument that the court should not permit defendants to challenge the deposit on plaintiffs behalf.or it could reflect a position defendants have advanced that without the return of the summons,the court could not adjudicate the deposit amount.had plaintiffs argued for a reduction in or deferral of the deposit or had they returned the summons,we might know whether the deposit was the insuperable hurdle they make it out to be.but plaintiffs took none of these courses,and we remain in the dark.
though plaintiffs bristle at the notion that their actions suggest bad faith,we fail to see how they could be characterized otherwise.the district court specifically instructed plaintiffs to seize the opportunity to be heard on the deposit issue and pursue the alternatives defendants had identified.plaintiffs did just the opposite.the bottom line is simple plaintiffs consistently worked to undermine their suit in cameroon,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that their efforts succeeded.
an alternative forum is inadequate if the plaintiff will be treated unfairly there.piper aircraft reyno,see,tuazon reynolds tobacco,cir noting that the prevalence of corruption,delay or bias may render a forum inadequate.plaintiffs argue that the district court should have granted reconsideration in light of new evidence strengthening their previously unsuccessful claim that cameroon was an inadequate forum because plaintiffs could not receive a fair trial there.we do not reach the merits of this argument because plaintiffs failed to preserve it below.
in opposing defendants motion to dismiss,plaintiffs argued that they would not be treated fairly in a cameroonian court.the problem lay in the supposed desire of the cameroonian executive to retaliate against plaintiffs for roger tchoufa going public with the bribery demands made of mbi.this animus drove an alleged campaign of harassment against tchoufa that included prosecuting him and his wife for their purported role in the corruption at cfc.plaintiffs maintained that the executive would be able to further its vendetta by ordaining an adverse result against them in the courts.in granting defendants motion to dismiss,the district court rejected this argument because plaintiffs produced insufficient evidence to rebut defendants showing that the judiciary in cameroon was independent from executive influence.mbi i,d at.
in their first motion for reconsideration,filed on june,plaintiffs did not contest the district court conclusion that the courts in cameroon were independent.then,on july,a cameroonian court convicted tchoufa and his wife in absentia on what plaintiffs claim were bogus charges of misappropriating public funds.in their reply to defendants opposition to their motion,plaintiffs pointed to the convictions as new evidence of the inability of cameroon judiciary to withstand executive pressure.
the district court,without addressing the convictions or any other issue plaintiffs raised,dismissed plaintiffs motion without prejudice pending the result of the cameroonian proceeding on the deposit issue.mbi ii,slip op.at.this left plaintiffs free to raise in a renewed motion for reconsideration their previous arguments in favor of vacating the dismissal of their suit.
plaintiffs filed that renewed motion on april,but it said nothing of the tchoufas convictions.indeed,they raised no argument at all about the independence of the cameroonian judiciary.they argued instead that the district court should vacate the dismissal on account of the prohibitive court deposit or,i n the alternative,because of its allegedly erroneous conclusions concerning the public interests implicated by this suit,as well as the impact of the unavailability of mbi representative tchoufa in cameroon.memo.in support of pls.renewed mot.for reconsideration at.this last point did not address any shortcoming in cameroonian justice,but stressed instead the disadvantages that would result from tchoufa reluctance to attend a trial in cameroon.only at the end of their reply to defendants opposition to the renewed motion did plaintiffs even mention the convictions.
the district court did not address whether the convictions gave support to plaintiffs concerns about the cameroonian forum.nor do we.we root this decision in our discretion not to consider claims that litigants fail to raise sufficiently below and on which district courts do not pass.cruz am.airlines.though t here is no rule to determine whether a matter has been properly raised below,edmond postal serv.counsel,district courts,like this court,generally deem arguments made only in reply briefs to be forfeited,donovan.we see no reason to deviate from that principle here.r eply briefs reply to arguments made in the response do not provide the moving party with a new opportunity to present yet another issue for the court consideration.novosteel sa united states.
