lippman,chief judge 
the primary issue presented is whether a bank and its customer may agree to shorten from one year to days the statutory time period under ucc within which a customer must notify its bank of an improperly paid item in order to recover the payment thereon.in two opinions issued over years ago,this court declined to decide this issue because it was not presented directly,but questioned whether a day period could be reasonable and observed that the question raise d policy considerations putnam rolling ladder v manufacturers hanover trust,sos oil norstar bank of long.we now hold that,at least in this case,the parties agreement to shorten the period was permissible.
in april,plaintiff clemente brothers contracting opened three corporate operating accounts at north fork bank which subsequently merged with defendant capitalone,na collectively capitalone and took out a loan and a line of credit,each backed by a promissory note.clemente brothers could draw money on the line of credit by sending a signed drawdown request to capitalone.as a condition precedent to opening the accounts at capitalone,plaintiff jeffrey clemente,the company principal,executed a personal guaranty with respect to the loan and line of credit,and clemente brothers passed a corporate resolution,which provided that jeffrey clemente was the only authorized signatory on the accounts and the only one authorized to sign drawdown requests on the line of credit.
the corporate resolution also provided,
that unless clemente brothers shall notify the bank in writing within fourteen calendar days of the delivery or mailing of any statement of account and cancelled check,draft or other instrument for the payment of money hereinafter referred to as instrument of any claimed errors in such statement,or that clemente brothers signature upon any such returned instrument was forged,or that any such instrument was made or drawn without the authority of clemente brothers or that it was raised or otherwise altered said statement of account shall be considered correct for all purposes and said bank shall not be liable for any payments made and charged to the account of clemente brothers or for any other errors in the statement of account as rendered to it 
capitalone mailed statements of account for all three of the operating accounts to the business address provided by clemente brothers.the monthly statements included copies of cancelled checks drawn on that account.
as for the line of credit,capitalone mailed a statement to clemente brothers each month showing the principal balance and the monthly interest payment,which was automatically debited from the primary operating account.capitalone has not offered any evidence that it included copies of the drawdown requests on the line of credit with the monthly statements.but the drawdowns appeared as credits on the operating account statements.
defendant aprile hafner milazzo worked as a secretary and bookkeeper for clemente brothers until it was discovered that she had been forging clemente signature on certain capitalone bank documents,including drawdown requests on the line of credit and checks paid from one of clemente brothers accounts.according to plaintiffs,hafner milazzo embezzled approximately over the course of approximately two years,from january through december.
in february,clemente brothers notified capitalone of hafner milazzo thefts.thereafter,capitalone determined that an event had occurred that adversely affected clemente brothers ability to repay its debts and,pursuant to a clause in the two promissory notes,declared all amounts due and payable.
plaintiffs subsequently commenced this action against hafner milazzo and capitalone to recover damages resulting from hafner milazzo forgeries and to prevent capitalone from forcing repayment on the loans.in its answer,capitalone interposed several counterclaims to recover amounts due under the loans and clemente personal guaranty.
capitalone moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against it and on its counterclaims.supreme court granted capitalone motion in its entirety and awarded it the principal sum of on its counterclaims clemente.contracting v hafner milazzo,slip op u sup ct,county.according to the court,capitalone was entitled to the protection afforded by ucc,which precludes liability for a bank to its customer when it pays a check on a forged signature but makes statements of the account and the allegedly forged items available to the customer,and the customer fails to report the alleged forgery to the bank within one year.here,the court observed,clemente brothers and capitalone,by agreement,properly abbreviated the period to days,within which plaintiffs failed to report each of the alleged forgeries.
the appellate division affirmed clemente.contracting v hafner milazzo,dept.this court granted plaintiffs leave to appeal.
new york version of the uniform commercial code hereinafter ucc imposes strict liability upon a bank that charges against its customer account any item that is not properly payable ucc monreal fleet bank.an item is any instrument for the payment of money even though it is not negotiable but does not include money ucc g.black law dictionary defines instrument as a written legal document that defines rights,duties,entitlements,or liabilities black law dictionary edition.put another way,a bank may not charge a check,or other written document defining a right to or liability for payment,bearing a forged signature against its customer account monreal,at.
the ucc nevertheless limits banks exposure by imposing obligations on customers that,if unfulfilled,may preclude a customer suit against the bank.when a bank sends to its customer statements of account and copies of the items paid,the customer must review those documents promptly and notify the bank of any irregularities 
w hen a bank sends to its customer a statement of account accompanied by items paid in good faith in support of the debit entries or holds the statement and items pursuant to a request or instructions of its customer or otherwise in a reasonable manner makes the statement and items available to the customer,the customer must exercise reasonable care and promptness to examine the statement and items to discover his unauthorized signature or any alteration on an item and must notify the bank promptly after discovery thereof 
ucc see also monreal,at.
if the customer fails to fulfill its obligation,then the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank his unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item if the bank also establishes that it suffered a loss by reason of such failure and an unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank after the first item and statement was available to the customer for a reasonable period not exceeding fourteen calendar days ucc a and b.these bars to recovery do not apply if the customer establishes lack of ordinary care on the part of the bank in paying the item s ucc.
an additional limitation,pertinent here,is found in ucc,which creates something akin to a statute of repose that bars a customer claim for recovery on a wrongfully paid item when the customer fails to report the irregularity within one year after the bank provides the statement and item,regardless of either party failure to exercise reasonable care 
w ithout regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank a customer who does not within one year from the time the statement and items are made available to the customer subsection discover and report his unauthorized signature is precluded from asserting against the bank such unauthorized signature or indorsement or such alteration 
here,the parties shortened the period to days by agreement.
capitalone argues that ucc defeats plaintiffs claims with respect to both the operating accounts and the line of credit.but the application of ucc is contingent upon the bank providing the customer with account statements and copies of the items paid under ucc.the parties do not seriously dispute that capitalone complied with ucc with respect to the operating accounts by providing monthly statements and copies of cancelled checks.but they do dispute whether the line of credit is subject to ucc article at all,and,if it is,whether capitalone complied with ucc.
plaintiffs argue that the drawdown requests on the line of credit do not qualify as items within the meaning of ucc article.we disagree.the requests are written instruments formally exercising a contractual right to the payment of money from the line of credit.we do agree with plaintiffs,however,that,at least on this motion for summary judgment,capitalone can not avail itself of ucc.capitalone argues that the drawdown requests should be treated as items and that it is entitled to the protections of ucc,but it conspicuously has not offered evidence showing that it complied with the threshold requirements of ucc quoted above.
the language of the new york statute tracks the language of the original model uniform commercial code model ucc,and has not been amended by the legislature since adoption in.section of the model ucc was amended in to require that the bank must provide a statement of account and shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid model ucc a maintaining language emphasis added.
the model ucc official commentary explains that under the new language 
i f the bank supplies its customer with an image of the paid item,it complies with this standard.but a safe harbor rule is provided.the bank complies with the standard of providing sufficient information if the item is described by item number,amount,and date of payment.this means that the customer duties under what was model ucc are triggered if the bank sends a statement of account complying with the safe harbor rule without returning the paid items 
model ucc,comment.
many states have adopted some form of the revised model ucc.ohio and illinois,for example,require only that a bank provide an account statement with information sufficient to identify an item paid see ohio rev code ann a il st ch a.but new york has not adopted the revised model ucc.
banks in new york,as elsewhere,must comply in good faith with ucc to seek the protections of ucc see elden v merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,wl,dist lexis,sd,civ rjs holding that bank did not send copies of the items and did not otherwise reasonably make them available,thus precluding relief under ucc.again,they may do this in one of three ways supply the items to the customer with the statement of account,hold the items for the customer,or otherwise in a reasonable manner make the statement and items available ucc.the official commentary explains that this third option is to be used only in unusual situations ucc,comment.but one treatise author has noted that literal compliance with this triggering event seem s impossible,and argues that the bank practice of sending or posting simple account statements should be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section see hawkland ucc series at,accord barkley clark barbara clark,the law of bank deposits,collections and credit cards a at.
here,the record does not show that the drawdown requests were provided to clemente brothers.absent any record evidence or discussion in the briefs about relevant banking practice or applicable regulations on this point,we do not hold that capitalone failed to comply with as a matter of law.but neither has the bank demonstrated its compliance with the statute.consequently,capitalone is not entitled to summary judgment on the claims under ucc,and,on remittal,the judgment in its favor must be amended accordingly pending further proceedings on these claims.
capitalone argues in the alternative,and the lower courts also reasoned,that the wrongfully paid drawdown requests did not harm plaintiff.capitalone contends that paying the drawdown requests merely effectuated a transfer of funds from one of plaintiffs accounts to another.but this is not an accurate description of the transactions the funds did not come from plaintiffs account,but from the bank itself.
the line of credit was,in effect,a loan upon which plaintiffs could draw at will.plaintiffs did not possess any borrowed funds or owe anything in repayment in the absence of a drawdown request.upon such a request,capitalone would transfer funds to one of plaintiffs accounts,interest immediately would begin to accrue and plaintiffs would be liable to repay the principal.therefore,when capitalone wrongfully paid the drawdown requests at issue in this case,plaintiffs suffered financial harm.
turning to the application of ucc,the ucc permits parties to alter the provisions of article by agreement see ucc.the official comments go so far as to say that there exists a blanket power to vary all provisions of the article id.at comment.but that power is not boundless 
n o agreement can disclaim a bank responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or can limit the measure of damages for such lack or failure but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which such responsibility is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable 
the application of these limitations raises two issues first,whether parties can vary the period by agreement we hold that they can and second,whether shortening the period to days is manifestly unreasonable we hold that it is not,at least under these facts.
the argument that modification is not allowed is that by shortening the period,the bank is disclaiming its obligation to act with care or that it is limiting the measure of damages for a failure to act with care in violation of ucc.this argument finds some slender support in our decision in regatos north fork bank.
regatos involved the funds transfers provisions of ucc article banks are liable under article a for improper funds transfers,similar to how they are liable under article for improperly paid items.as for funds transfers,ucc a provides that the obligation of a receiving bank to refund payment may not otherwise be varied by agreement.
ucc a contains a notice period similar to that found in ucc.this court held that parties could not shorten the period in ucc a by agreement regatos,at.the court reasoned that shortening the period effectively would var y the bank obligation to refund payment in violation of the plain language of ucc a id.at.
plaintiffs would have us apply regatos to this case.they rely on two appellate division decisions that could be read as extending the logic of regatos to ucc see aikens constr.of rome simons,dept herzog,engstrom koplovitz union bank,dept.but this result neither follows from the provisions of article nor is it desirable as a policy matter.
unlike ucc a,ucc does not prohibit a bank from altering its obligation to refund payments made in good faith.and shortening the period does not violate any of the prohibitions in ucc.capitalone did not disclaim its responsibility to act with care by requiring its customer to notify it of an improperly paid item within days of receiving the account statement.while shortening the period certainly affected capitalone liability for improperly paid items,whether paid in good faith or not,it did not exclude all liability for negligence.nor did the modification affect the measure of damages it merely limited the time within which plaintiffs must provide notice of the improper charge.
courts around the country have permitted parties to shorten the one year to various periods,from as short as days to more than days see gluck jpmorgan chase bank,dept days peters riggs bank,dc days borowski v firstar bank milwaukee,days.and the record and case law suggest that most banks do shorten the period.
to apply regatos logic to this case would be to hold not only the day period impermissible,but every other longer period used in the industry,be it days or months.we perceive no good reason for creating such an inconsistency in the banking laws of the various states.we therefore hold that parties may modify by agreement the period in ucc,as long
