a largely settled feature of state and federal procedure is that trial courts in class action proceedings should decide whether a class is proper and,if so,order class notice before ruling on the substantive merits of the action.see green obledo cal d,green fed.rules,rule c a,hickey duffy cir.the virtue of this sequence is that it promotes judicial efficiency,by postponing merits rulings until such time as all parties may be bound,and fairness,by ensuring that parties bear equally the benefits and burdens of favorable and unfavorable merits rulings.the rule stands as a barrier against the problem of intervention,whereby absent plaintiffs may elect to stay in a class after favorable merits rulings but opt out after unfavorable ones.
here,over class defendant fireside bank objections and to class representative sandra gonzalez surprise,the trial court ruled on the substantive merits concurrent with deciding that a class could be certified and before class notice had gone out.the court of appeal denied writ relief,concluding the rule we endorsed in green governing the order of operations in class action proceedings was largely a matter of discretion and was not violated by the trial court,and also rejecting fireside bank substantive challenges to class certification.
we reverse.while the green rule is subject to exceptions,leaving trial courts vested with a certain degree of discretion in its application,no such exception is applicable here and thus the trial court abused its discretion in acting as it did.on the merits,however,its class certification order was correct.accordingly,we leave in place the trial court class certification order,direct that the trial court entry of judgment on the pleadings in favor of gonzalez be vacated,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in early,gonzalez purchased a used van under a conditional sales contract obligating her to make monthly payments and to keep the van insured.the dealer assigned the contract to fireside bank,then known as fireside thrift.gonzalez purchased the van for her father,guadalupe gonzalez,with the intention that he use and pay for it.when certain sums claimed by fireside bank allegedly became overdue,it repossessed the van.on september,it sent a notice to gonzalez,stating that she could redeem the van by paying the full amount due under the contract within days.the notice correctly itemized the elements of the outstanding debt,a contract balance of,late charges of,repossession cost of,a credit for unearned finance charges of,and a credit for unearned insurance premiums of.however,the notice stated the total amount due the amount gonzalez had to pay within days to avoid having the van sold,when the actual sum of the itemized charges,less credits,was.the total amount due thus overstated the amount actually due by,the amount of the credit for unearned finance charges.fireside bank attributes this discrepancy to a computer error and concedes that similarly inaccurate notices were sent to almost other borrowers.
in october,fireside bank filed a complaint against gonzalez alleging that it had sold the van for and seeking a judgment for the remaining contract balance of.gonzalez answered the complaint and asserted as an affirmative defense that recovery was barred by fireside bank failure to comply with the motor vehicle sales and finance act act.see.
thereafter,gonzalez filed a alleging that fireside bank notice of intent to sell failed to comply with the act notice requirements and that fireside bank thereby lost its right to pursue a deficiency judgment.she asserted causes of action for conversion,in that fireside bank had repossessed the van before the loan was in default violations of the rosenthal fair debt collection practices act,et and illegal,unfair,and deceptive business practices in violation of the act and the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.the challenged business practices included serving notices that did not comply with the act,thereby forfeiting the right to claim deficiencies,yet nonetheless pursuing meritless collection actions against borrowers.
in april,gonzalez filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on fireside bank complaint.she argued that the act required fireside bank to include in its notice of intent to sell both the amount owed on the contract,which could be paid within days to avoid sale of the vehicle,and an itemization of how that amount was arrived at see,subd.a the notice attached to the complaint overstated the amount due by because it failed to properly credit unearned finance charges and because fireside bank had failed to provide a proper notice,it could not pursue a deficiency judgment.fireside bank opposed this motion both on the merits and procedurally.procedurally,it argued that before obtaining a ruling on the motion gonzalez must seek or forswear certification of a class,a potential remedy to which her counsel had alluded,and the trial court should take the motion off calendar or deny it without prejudice until class issues,if any,were resolved.
at the initial april,hearing on the motion,the trial court asked whether the action might proceed as a class action,in which case ruling on the motion would be premature.gonzalez counsel advised the court that fireside bank had just provided discovery disclosing for the first time that the problem affected nearly notices.gonzalez counsel further indicated that a decision on whether to seek class treatment was awaiting fireside bank responses to newly propounded discovery.the trial court continued the hearing for approximately three months.
gonzalez subsequently filed an amended.the amended added a class claim under the act and the ucl on behalf of all persons who had received postrepossession notices from fireside bank on accounts started in california in which the listed redemption amount failed to subtract the credit for unearned finance charges.gonzalez moved for class certification fireside bank opposed the motion.
the hearing on class certification was continued to july,the date already set for a status conference and for the continued hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings.at the hearing,the trial court expressed an initial inclination to certify the class and,after hearing argument on the issue,said it would have a ruling by the end of the week.
the parties then turned to the motion for judgment on the pleadings.fireside bank counsel again objected to any ruling on the merits until certification issues were resolved.the trial court assured counsel that it was not going to rule on the motion for judgment on the pleadings until i decide the issue of certification.counsel clarified that fireside bank opposed any ruling on the motion until notice had been given to the class,if any,and the time for members to opt out had expired.the court replied i do disagree with that gonzalez counsel concurred i f the defendant objects and does want a ruling prior to class certification,then the defendant is entitled to have a ruling deferred.the trial court declined argument on the motion for judgment on the pleadings,indicating the motion was in effect going to go off calendar pending a ruling on certification,but that a further hearing would be set if it denied certification.
on august,despite these assurances,the trial court issued formal orders granting class certification,and granting gonzalez motion for judgment on the pleadings against fireside bank complaint on the basis that fireside bank had failed to comply with the notice requirements under the act,thus barring any recovery of a deficiency judgment.see.
fireside bank sought writ relief.it argued that,by ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings before notice had been given to the class,the trial court had impermissibly provided class members an opportunity for intervention.although gonzalez had acceded to fireside bank request for a deferred ruling in the trial court,she opposed writ relief,arguing that the trial court ruling created no risk of intervention because it did not resolve the merits of the class action.
the court of appeal denied relief.after analyzing state and federal authorities at length,it concluded any support for a rule against intervention was tenuous at best,and the trial court retained broad discretion to issue merits rulings before deciding class issues even if such a rule existed,it did not apply to rulings on a class defendant claims against the class representative and in any event,fireside bank had not demonstrated it was prejudiced by the trial court rulings.the court of appeal further rejected fireside bank objections to the merits of the class certification order.
we granted review to address the ongoing validity,scope,and application of the rule against intervention.
discussion 
interventiona.the rule against intervention 
the class action is a product of the court of in section of the code of civil procedure.it rests on considerations of necessity and convenience,adopted to prevent a failure of justice.citation.but while section was designed to foster justice,class actions may create injustice.the class action may deprive an absent class member of the opportunity to independently press his claim,preclude a defendant from defending each individual claim to its fullest,and even deprive a litigant of a constitutional right.city of san jose superior court cal d.
as originally adopted,the class action device included no rules governing when to resolve merits and class issues.see code civ,fed.rules,former rule,as adopted in,one resulting potential injustice was the possibility for intervention,a consequence of actions for damages in which a decision for or against one member of the class did not inevitably entail the same result for all.one party could style the case a class action,but the missing parties would not be bound.a victory by the plaintiff would be followed by an opportunity for other members of the class to intervene and claim the spoils a loss by the plaintiff would not bind other members of the class.it would not be in their interest to intervene in a lost cause,and they could not be bound by a judgment to which they were not parties.citation.so the defendant could win only against the named plaintiff and might face additional suits by other members of the class,but it could lose against all members of the class.this came to be known as intervention,which had few supporters.premier electrical construction national electrical contractors,cir,see also american pipe construction utah,d.intervention left a defendant open to being pecked to death by ducks.one plaintiff could sue and lose another could sue and lose and another and another until one finally prevailed then everyone else would ride on that single success.this sort of sequence,too,would waste resources it also could make the minority and therefore presumptively inaccurate result the binding one.premier electrical construction,at.
in the federal courts,this problem provisionally was solved by amending federal rules of civil procedure rule.in,the rule was rewritten to end intervention by requiring that class issues be resolved a s soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action.fed.rules,former rule c,as amended in,see fed.rules,rule,advisory com.note on amendments under proposed subdivision c,intervention is excluded the action will have been early determined to be a class or nonclass action,and in the former case the judgment,whether or not favorable,will include the class,as above stated american pipe construction utah,supra,at.amendments were designed to end intervention.under the revised rule,potential class members retain the option to participate in or withdraw from the class action only until a point in the litigation as soon as practicable after the commencement of the action when the suit is allowed to continue as a class action and they are sent notice of their inclusion within the confines of the class.thereafter they are either to the suit and ineligible to participate in a recovery or to be bound by a judgment,or else they are full members who must abide by the final judgment,whether favorable or adverse.american pipe construction,at.
while the federal system dealt with the problem of intervention by amending its rules of procedure,california responded judicially,beginning with a pair of decisions in the,home sav.loan superior court d.home savings i and home sav.loan superior court d.home savings ii collectively home savings.
in home savings i,the plaintiffs filed a putative class action challenging late charges.the trial court proposed to try first the issues whether the late charges were invalid penalties and whether the defendant bank affirmative defenses barred recovery,and only then to resolve class issues.the court of appeal issued a writ of prohibition restraining the trial court from proceeding to trial on the substantive merits of the cause without prior adjudication of the procedural issues,viz.suitability of the action as a class action,determination of the composition of the class,and appropriate notification of members of the class.home savings i,supra,d at.
the problem with the trial court procedure,the court of appeal explained,was that it exposed the defendant to intervention.prompt and early determination of the class was necessary so that class members might receive notice.home savings i,supra,d at.in contrast,t he vice in the procedure followed by the trial court is that it allows intervention,a procedure under which potential members of the class can reserve their decision to become part of the class until the validity of the cause asserted by the named plaintiffs on behalf of the class has been determined.while intervention has obvious attractions for members of the class on whose behalf an action has been brought in that it creates for them a situation,for a defendant it holds the terrors of an lawsuit that can not be defeated,can not be settled,and can not be adjudicated.to him it presents a classic option.id.at.moreover,in home savings i,intervention was no mere chimera seven other class actions involving the same issues were already pending.id.at.
on remand,the plaintiffs sought summary adjudication that the defendant bank late charges were a void penalty.once again,the court of appeal granted writ relief precluding a ruling on the motion until class issues had been resolved.it rejected any distinction between permitting trial before class certification and permitting adjudication of substantive issues by motion.home savings ii,supra,d at.
other courts of appeal thereafter generally followed the home savings rule precluding merits rulings before resolution of class issues.see hypolite carleson d.holding t he rule should still the class issues tendered in a complaint filed as a class action should ordinarily be resolved before the cause is tried on its merits travelers ins.superior court d.concluding that under home savings,t he law is now firmly established that the trial court in a class action should first try the issue of identity of the class and designate the appropriate form and manner of notice to such class before trying the issue of the defendant liability kass young d.vacating default judgment entered before class certification in violation of home savings rose city of hayward d.holding class defendants have right to have class issues resolved before merits but see lowry obledo d.declining to follow home savings in a case primarily seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
we first noted and discussed at length the home savings rule in people pacific land research cal d.we assume d,for the purposes of the present proceeding,that the reasoning in the home savings cases was sound.id.at.however,because the case involved a public action,not a private class action,we had no occasion to test that assumption and left open the question of the rule validity and scope.
thereafter,we formally adopted the home savings rule in green,supra,cal d,in the context of a belated motion to decertify a class.in an action challenging aid to families with dependent children afdc regulations,the trial court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment and certified a class.it subsequently partially granted the defendants motion to decertify the class,limiting the class to present and future afdc recipients and excluding past recipients.id.at.
we reversed.we cited the home savings rule with approval o ur courts have held that procedural the composition of the ordinarily be resolved before a decision on the merits.green,supra,cal d at,citing home savings i,supra,d at,and home savings ii,supra,d at.we explained the rule rationale u nless a decision on the merits is postponed until after the class issues are decided,a defendant is subject to intervention,which would allow potential class members to elect whether to join in the action depending upon the outcome of the decision on the merits.thus,if the merits were decided favorably to the class,and notice followed such determination,most class members would join in the action,whereas they would decline if the determination was against the class.from a defendant viewpoint,this is said to result in an lawsuit that can not be defeated,can not be settled,and can not be adjudicated.citation.green,at,quoting people pacific land research,supra,cal d at.we then extended the rule,holding that it should apply not only to protect defendants from a belated motion for certification,but also to protect plaintiffs from a belated motion for decertification a defendant should not be allowed to sandbag a plaintiff,withholding its best case against certification and then seeking decertification if it suffered an unfavorable merits ruling.green,at.thus,whether the motion to certify or decertify be made by the plaintiff or the defendant,it must be determined before the decision on the merits.id.at,citing fed.rules,rule c,
however,we also decline d to fashion an standard removing all jurisdiction from a trial court to decertify a class or part thereof after such a decision on the merits.green,supra,cal d at.instead,we allowed belated decertification in limited instances it would be both unduly rigid and unjust to force the maintenance of a class action even when there is a proper reason for decertification after judgment.citation.before judgment,a class should be decertified only where it is clear there exist changed circumstances making continued class action treatment improper.citation.a fortiori,a similar showing must be made to warrant decertification after a decision on the merits.this standard will prevent abuse on the part of the defendant while providing the trial court with enough flexibility to justly manage the class action.ibid.of course,just as we recognized in green that there was no reason not to apply the general home savings rule to decertification motions,so there is no reason not to apply this limited green exception to certification motions.thus,under green,postmerits certification may be permitted when there is a clear showing of changed circumstances.
elsewhere,we have had occasion to consider the application of the home savings rule in the slightly different context where a defendant either fails to object or itself initiates a merits motion before class certification and notice have been resolved.in civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,civil service employees ins,the plaintiff sought class certification and,one week later,partial summary judgment of certain affirmative defenses.as in this case,the trial court granted both motions simultaneously.by way of a writ,the defendant challenged the grant of partial summary judgment solely on procedural grounds,arguing that it violated the home savings rule.we found no error because the defendant had failed to object to the motion as premature before the trial court ruled on it,holding that a defendant waives whatever due process rights it may possess when it voluntarily accedes to a trial court decision on the merits of an issue before notice is provided to absent class members.civil service employees ins,at.by failing to object,the defendant assumed the risk that it might win and be unable to bind unnotified class members,or lose and face the prospect of intervention.id.at.
in employment development superior court cal d,before class certification or notice had been addressed,the defendant successfully demurred to an action challenging an unemployment benefits statute as discriminatory.the court of appeal reversed,holding the statute was in fact unconstitutional,and on remand the trial court certified a class over the defendant home savings objection.following the principles set out in civil service employees ins,supra,cal d,we denied writ relief.because the defendant had filed a demurrer and sought early resolution of the merits,it could not complain that resolution of the merits preceded any class determination.employment development,at,see also linder thrifty oil cal th,fn,d,defendants are free to bring precertification dispositive motions rose city of hayward,supra,d at.where a defendant voluntarily accedes to a trial court hearing on the merits prior to determination of the class issue,he thereby waives his right to a class certification prior to hearings on the substantive merits.
from these precedents we glean the following rules governing the parties and trial court orderly conduct of putative class action cases.first,a defendant must actively preserve its protection against intervention by objecting.if it fails to timely object,or affirmatively seeks resolution of the merits before certification,it will be deemed to have waived its rights.see civil service employees ins,supra,cal d at,employment development superior court,supra,cal d at.second,plaintiffs should seek certification before moving for any resolution of the merits.cal.rules of court,rule b a motion for class certification should be filed when practicable.if they seek certification after seeking resolution of the merits then,in the absence of a defense waiver,they must demonstrate changed circumstances or other good cause justifying the belated motion before the trial court may consider it.see green,supra,cal d at.third,though trial courts generally have broad discretion to manage and order class affairs in the absence of a defense waiver they should not resolve the merits in a putative class action case before class certification and notice issues absent a compelling justification for doing so.
these rules are the logical consequence of the need to protect against the harms of intervention,harms sufficiently real that the federal courts amended rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,to counter them.indeed,in dicta we have gone so far as to attribute to defendants a due process right to avoid intervention.see people pacific land research,supra,cal d at,accord,rose city of hayward,supra,d at.home savings i,supra,d at.to prevent intervention,courts must ensure that affected parties are bound before the merits are decided to bind absent plaintiffs,courts must give them notice and to give plaintiffs notice,courts must first resolve whether and on what scale a class is appropriate.
the court of appeal read green as establishing no more than a weak general preference for deciding class issues first and held that trial courts retain broad discretion to depart from that order of operations.this overstates matters considerably.while it is true we declined to strip trial courts of all authority to certify or decertify a class after a decision on the merits,we confined the trial court authority to do so to situations involving a clear showing of changed circumstances.green,supra,cal d at.we further recognized that it is desirable for the trial court to retain some measure of flexibility in handling a class action ibid.consequently,in an individual case compelling justifications may exist that will support a trial court decision to depart from the usual order.absent a finding of a compelling justification,however,for the trial court to refuse the defendant request to resolve class issues before merits issues is an abuse of discretion.
conversely,fireside bank depicts the rules governing the order of operations in class action proceedings as mandatory in the absence of a defense waiver.they are not.as class actions are originally creatures of equity city of san jose superior court,supra,cal d at,so the rules for administering them must be equitable.by leaving open a narrow exception for cases presenting compelling justifications,we intend the trial courts to retain sufficient discretion to avoid inequitable outcomes in a given case 
thus,the rules are neither as flexible as the court of appeal would have them nor as rigid as fireside bank portrays them.contrary to the court of appeal intimation,the rules have clearly defined parameters contrary to fireside bank argument,they are not sacrosanct,in recognition of the broad discretion trial courts rightfully possess to order class action proceedings.the rules provide flexibility,but not infinite,flexibility trial courts may not depart from the usual order of decision for simply any reason that seems appropriate at the time.
we next consider the range of motions that implicate the rules governing intervention.here,gonzalez argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that her motion for judgment on the pleadings on fireside bank claim against her is not such a motion.
we begin with the recognition that the scope of any rule should be coextensive with its rationale.that is,the interest in postponing a substantive ruling in a case until after resolution of class issues depends precisely on the extent to which the ruling gives rise to concerns about intervention.in turn,the extent to which a given ruling gives rise to such concerns depends not on the form of the ruling but on its substance.the home savings ii court effectively recognized as much in concluding that precertification summary adjudication,as much as precertification trial,should be disapproved the key words in home savings i are substantive merits,not trial.the controlling factor is not the way the superior court determines the substantive merits of the cause,but whether it does so prior to adjudication of the procedural class issues and prior to notification of the members of the class for whose benefit the action has been brought.home savings ii,supra,d at.
thus,the relevant question is whether a given ruling affects the merits of the class claims in a way that would create a risk of intervention.decisions reached after trial,or on summary judgment or summary adjudication,or on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,all may do so to varying extents,depending on the subject matter of the ruling thus,the fact the ruling here resolved fireside bank claim against gonzalez,and not gonzalez claim against fireside bank,does not alone immunize it from green requirements.
in justifying its refusal to apply home savings and green here,the court of appeal noted that many rulings may offer substantial hints as to the likely substantive outcome of a given case.we agree.but this is no reason not to require trial courts to postpone such rulings until after certification and class notice,if any.the interest in postponing bringing or ruling on any motion until after class issues have been resolved is directly proportional to the extent to which a ruling would implicate intervention concerns.the greater the concern,the more compelling a contrary justification will be needed to support immediate resolution the lesser the concern,the more slender a contrary justification will suffice.in each instance where a defendant asserts its home savings rights,the trial court should consider the degree to which the given motion poses intervention problems,balanced against the compelling justifications proffered by the moving party for nevertheless deciding the given motion in advance of resolving class issues.the greater the concerns,the more compelling the countervailing justification must be.that intervention concerns can not always be avoided offers no reason not to avoid them when to do so is possible and no more compelling interest justifies disregarding them.
gonzalez further argues that the rules governing intervention should not come into play because the trial court decision leaves unresolved fireside bank various affirmative defenses.we reject the argument.
in home savings ii,supra,d,the court of appeal addressed a parallel situation.the plaintiffs there sought partial summary judgment of the key legal issue in the the defendant late charges violated civil code section.resolution of that issue would leave other questions unresolved,but because the issue was the principal one in the case,the court of appeal correctly recognized that its resolution would create a significant risk of intervention.home savings ii,at.
notably,in civil service employees ins,supra,cal d,the plaintiff brought a motion for summary adjudication of only two affirmative defenses.however,there again,a s a practical matter the motion requested the court to resolve the principal legal issue presented by the case.id.at.the defendant invoked its home savings rights on appeal,and we implicitly recognized the rule would otherwise apply before concluding on the facts that the defendant had waived its rights.what was implicit in civil service employees ins,we make explicit here it matters not the form of a motion or whether it may leave some issues unresolved.what matters is the extent to which a motion impacts the principal legal issue or issues in a case and thereby poses for the defendants the risk of intervention depending on its outcome.
application 
here,gonzalez brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings on fireside bank individual claim against her.she thereafter filed a motion for class certification fireside bank timely raised a home savings objection.the trial court granted both motions.
although the trial court ruling on gonzalez motion on the pleadings leaves unresolved fireside bank affirmative defenses,it squarely resolves the central issue in gonzalez and the putative class claims against fireside fireside bank notices violated the act and thus whether they were unlawful for purposes of the ucl.it matters not that the substantive motion was brought by gonzalez as a defendant,while the motion for class certification was brought by her as plaintiff in her.as a practical matter,because the motion for judgment on the pleadings involves determination of substantive issues common to both actions,it presents the same intervention concerns a ruling on gonzalez affirmative claims would.as such,it is subject to the rules governing intervention.the trial court was warranted in deciding the issue before a class had been notified only if it found a compelling justification existed.
given a trial court broad discretion to structure and streamline class action proceedings,the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.here,there was no compelling justification for resolving the merits issue first indeed,there was no justification at all.the trial court could have held the motion for judgment on the pleadings in abeyance,as it indicated to the parties it would,and thereby eliminated any conceivable harm to fireside bank interests.gonzalez did not argue delay of her motion for judgment on the pleadings would materially prejudice her.to the contrary,she openly acceded to the proposed delayed ruling on her motion.thus,the trial court abused its discretion by reversing the order of operations and ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings simultaneously with its ruling on class certification,before sending out class notice.
the court of appeal nevertheless thought no relief was warranted because it concluded fireside bank could show no prejudice from the trial court adverse ruling granting gonzalez motion for judgment on the pleadings.it is true that,had the motion been denied,the premature attempt to resolve the merits might have resulted in little prejudice a ruling that declined to decide whether gonzalez was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because factual issues remained would have left open the possibility that either side might prevail on the principal issue in this case.but the grant of gonzalez motion prejudiced fireside bank by necessarily exposing it to the problem of intervention.where,as here,the trial court has issued a ruling on the merits,the effect is to weight against opting out the metaphorical coin that potential class members receiving notice of the action might toss to decide whether
