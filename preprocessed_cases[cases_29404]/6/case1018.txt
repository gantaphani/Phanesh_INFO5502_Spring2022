this appeal stems from the financial woes of premier operations,premier cruise lines premier,a pleasure cruise company,and involves a cast of four main characters premier the passengers whose vacation plans were thwarted by the cruise line financial troubles and who for their cruise with their visa or mastercard the credit card processing company,nova information systems,nova,which ultimately reimbursed disappointed passengers who paid with their visa or mastercard and the surety company,greenwich insurance company greenwich,which was ultimately responsible for reimbursing disappointed passengers who paid with either credit card,cash,or check.nova argues,in two claims based on contract and four claims based on equity,that it should not bear the financial loss of customers as a result of premier bankruptcy and that,instead,greenwich should be the financial fall guy.the district court disagreed with nova and granted summary judgment to greenwich on all six claims.after review,we affirm.
background 
when an individual purchased a berth on one of premier cruise ships with his visa or mastercard,a series of financial transactions took place.first,premier accepted the passenger reservation and generated a transaction receipt for the cruise.second,premier forwarded the receipt to its merchant bank which would then credit premier account for the amount charged.in this case,first union bank first union was premier merchant bank,but first union subcontracted all of its credit card processing to nova.accordingly,first union would credit premier account with the charged amount,and then nova would reimburse first union.third,nova forwarded the charges to the appropriate bank finally,the bank would pay nova,and then the passenger,upon receipt of his credit card bill,would pay his bank directly.thus,premier was paid by first union,first union by nova,nova by the bank,and the bank by the passenger.
in the event that a purchased cruise did not take place,the parties to the series of financial transactions would be reimbursed in essentially the opposite order in which they were paid.the passenger would be reimbursed first by his bank,pursuant to the fair credit billing act and the visa and mastercard regulations.a and b a.the bank would then seek a chargeback,or reimbursement,from first union.a e.under their contractual agreement,nova would then reimburse first union and nova,in turn,would normally seek reimbursement from premier.in re thomas hamilton,cir.
because passengers ordinarily paid for their cruises substantially in advance of the departure date,the risk existed that premier would become insolvent in the interval between receiving full or partial payment from a passenger and providing the cruise.accordingly,premier,operating its cruise ships out of a port,was required by federal law and the federal maritime commission to provide evidence that it could refund any unearned passenger deposits.a.to fulfill this requirement,premier contracted with amwest to post a passenger vessel surety bond amwest bond to protect any premier passengers whose cruise did not set sail,ex.
despite the existence of the amwest bond,nova would face substantial financial risk in the event that premier was unable to cover its chargebacks.accordingly,nova sought reassurance from premier regarding its financial condition.to ameliorate nova concerns,premier urged nova to remember that it was protected from any chargeback losses under the amwest bond.at.unsatisfied with premier representation alone,nova asked premier to obtain more specific assurances of beneficiary coverage under the amwest bond.premier,in turn,asked the general counsel of the federal maritime commission fmc for a legal interpretation of whether a credit card company could seek subrogation for the passenger reimbursements protected by a surety bond.although the response was tempered,the fmc general counsel replied in the affirmative still not satisfied,nova sought assurance from amwest directly that its chargeback claims would be covered under the amwest bond.amwest,however,would not provide nova with the assurance it sought.
in its ongoing effort to provide nova with adequate financial protection,premier then contracted with the fourth main character,greenwich insurance company greenwich to post a new surety bond,which inure d to the benefit of any and all passengers to whom the principal premier may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described,ex.greenwich agent prepared a proposed letter of assurance,addressed to nova,expressing that nova would be covered under premier new surety bond in exchange for this proposal and the financial protection it purported to offer,premier requested a reduction in the fees it paid to nova,but nova never agreed to the reduction.as a result,the proposal reflected in the draft letter was never finalized.nevertheless,because of its contractual arrangement with first union,nova continued to process premier credit card transactions.
in september of,premier ceased operating.to alert premier passengers that future cruises would not take place,both the fmc and greenwich issued press releases encouraging passengers to contact their banks for a refund and then the refund process began passengers were reimbursed by their banks,the banks by first union,and first union by nova under their contractual arrangement.because premier,now bankrupt,could not reimburse nova,nova was left without apparent recourse.
after receiving and paying the chargebacks,nova sent assignment forms to those passengers who had initiated chargebacks through their banks.these assignment forms asked the recipients to assign their rights to receive refunds under the surety bond to nova,but also said that making the assignment did not affect the passenger right to reimbursement from his bank,ex.nova also contacted greenwich to confirm that it was covered under the bond,but greenwich contended that only individual passengers were covered.the fmc has since confirmed greenwich position that nova was not protected under the bond.notice of proposed rulemaking,fed.reg.at,to be codified at pt.
unhappy to be left,nova filed a complaint against greenwich alleging six claims,based on its position that greenwich,instead,should bear the financial burden breach of contract,contractual subrogation,promissory and equitable estoppel,equitable subrogation,contribution,and unjust enrichment.the district court granted summary judgment to greenwich on all six claims,and nova now appeals.
ii.discussion 
in this section,we will a state the proper standard of review,b discuss and reject nova two legal claims,and c discuss and reject nova four equitable claims.

we review the trial court grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo,viewing the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.patton triad guar.ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
nova legal claims 
nova asserted two legal claims against greenwich based on its position that greenwich should bear the financial loss resulting from premier bankruptcy breach of contract and contractual subrogation.we discuss and reject each claim in turn.
breach of contract 
nova incorrectly argues that it is a beneficiary to the surety bond contract between premier and greenwich.to maintain an action on a contract as a beneficiary,nova must clearly show that either a the contract itself or b both contracting parties primarily and directly intended to provide a benefit to nova.vencor hosps.blue cross blue shield of,cir,kemper group,cir caretta trucking,cheoy lee shipyards,so d.we hold that the district court correctly concluded that neither the contract itself nor the contracting parties expressed any intent to directly benefit nova as a third party.at.
a.the contract 
the contract on which nova maintains its claim is the surety bond issued by greenwich to protect premier passengers the surety bond provides protection for premier passengers whose cruises did not take place,ex.passengers are defined in fmc have remained any person who is to embark on a vessel at any port and who has paid any amount for a ticket contract entitling him to water transportation.g.person is defined as individuals,corporations,partnerships,associations,and other legal entities.id.a.
nova argues that including corporations in the definition of person indicates the fmc intent to include credit card companies in the bond protection for passengers.the corporations protected by surety bonds,however,are those that purchase tickets on cruise vessels i f a corporation purchases all of the available berths for a particular voyage,that corporation or its designated are entitled to the benefits afforded by the ticket contract.fed.reg.at,to be codified at pt.in this case,nova has not purchased any only reimbursed first union for chargebacks according to its contractual obligation.although,in essence,nova has paid for a cruise because,in the chain of reimbursements,the money it paid first union was eventually used to compensate disappointed passengers,we hold that the district court correctly concluded that the legislature intended to cover purchasers of passenger fares in advance of the cruise,not processors who honored chargebacks after the fact of.at emphasis in original.thus,nova is not a passenger entitled to protection under the surety bond issued by greenwich.
b.the contracting parties 
despite nova contention,there is no evidence in the less clear that either premier or greenwich intended for nova to be protected under the bond.nova argues that both the draft letter,written by greenwich agent and intended to placate nova fears about premier financial condition,and the negotiations conducted between premier and greenwich,provide evidence that nova was an intended third party beneficiary to the bond.the draft letter,however,is just proposal in draft form that was never finalized.and the negotiations between greenwich and premier show only that they negotiated over expanding the bond coverage,not that the parties ever agreed to such an expansion.even if premier made representations to nova that nova would be covered under its surety bond,there is no evidence in the record showing that greenwich possessed a similar,finalized intent.thus,because there is no clear evidence that both parties intended to benefit nova,nova may not maintain an action on the contract as a beneficiary.
contractual,or conventional,subrogation 
nova wrongly argues that greenwhich should reimburse nova for the chargebacks it has paid to first union under the doctrine of contractual,or conventional,subrogation.conventional subrogation depends upon a lawful contract,and occurs where one having no interest in or relation to the matter pays the debt of another,and by agreement is entitled to the securities and rights of the creditor so paid.dade county sch.bd.radio station wqba,so d.nova argues that it should step into the shoes of the premier passengers who assigned their rights to reimbursement under the surety bond to nova.
nova argument is misplaced because an assignee can acquire no greater rights than those possessed by the assignor himself.pulte home,ply gem.the evidence in this case shows that nova received the assignments from premier passengers after nova had already reimbursed first union for those means that the passengers who assigned their rights to nova had already been reimbursed by their banks,thereby extinguishing their claims.because double recovery would be prohibited,those passengers had no right to reimbursement under the greenwich bond and,thus,no rights to assign to nova.as a result,nova claim based on conventional subrogation must fail 
nova equitable claims 
nova asserted four claims against greenwich based on its position that greenwich should bear the financial loss resulting from premier bankruptcy promissory and equitable estoppel,equitable subrogation,contribution,and unjust enrichment.we consider and reject each claim in turn.
promissory and equitable estoppel 
based on both promissory and equitable estoppel nova erroneously asserts that greenwich should reimburse it for the credit card chargebacks nova has paid.neither version of estoppel,however,may be invoked to enlarge or extend the coverage specified in a contract,unless the oral representations or promises are interpretations of ambiguous contract terms.kane aetna life,cir.
that exception does not exist in this case because any representations greenwich may have made either to premier or to nova regarding nova coverage under the bond were not interpretations of ambiguous terms.the fmc has defined passenger and person in its regulations,and the surety bond issued by greenwich was intended to protect premier passengers.because credit card processing companies do not fall within the definition of passenger,any intent on the part of greenwich or premier to include nova as a protected passenger would have enlarged or extended the coverage specified in the bond.
furthermore,even if estoppel were applicable in this case,nova can not satisfy the elements of estoppel.although nova may have detrimentally relied on the draft letter or the negotiations between greenwich and premier regarding nova coverage under the bond,nova must show that greenwich reasonably expected to induce nova reliance based on the promises or representations greenwich made.pinnacle port cmty.ass orenstein,cir.the district court correctly concluded that greenwich could not reasonably expect that an unsigned draft letter would induce nova into action or forebearance,especially where greenwich did not officially accept the letter.at.moreover,the negotiations between greenwich and premier over whether the surety bond included nova as a claimant were never concluded premier never accepted greenwich draft proposal to extend coverage to nova because nova refused to lower premier fees in return.thus,nova claims based on estoppel must fail.
equitable subrogation 
nova wrongly claims that greenwich should reimburse nova based on the doctrine equitable subrogation.to maintain a claim based on equitable subrogation,nova must prove five elements that it made the payment at issue to protect its own interests,the payment was,it was not primarily liable for the debt paid,it paid the entire debt,and subrogation would not work any injustice to the rights of a third party.dade county sch.bd.radio station wqba,so d.subrogation,however,is not available to a party who pays his own debt.in re munzenrieder.
essentially,nova argues that it qualifies for equitable subrogation because it paid greenwich debt to premier passengers.under the doctrine,nova now claims an equitable right to stand in the shoes of premier passengers who were entitled to reimbursement under the greenwich bond and,hence,claim compensation from greenwich.see dade county sch,so d at.nova claim fails,however,because nova paid its own debt,not a debt obligated by greenwich.
greenwich was obligated to pay premier passengers who made a claim for reimbursement under the surety bond.nova,on the other hand,was obligated to reimburse first union as a result of reimbursements filed by premier passengers with their banks.although,in essence,both nova and greenwich were ultimately responsible for reimbursing premier for those passengers who requested reimbursement from their banks,and greenwich for those passengers who requested reimbursement under the obligations were,as the district court correctly noted,separate and distinct.at.nova was contractually obligated to reimburse first union regardless of whether any passengers ever made a claim for reimbursement under greenwich surety bond moreover,nova was not responsible for directly reimbursing any premier passengers.as the district court noted,t he fact that passengers could make a claim under the bond or through their credit card company reinforces the fact that the liabilities of nova and greenwich ran side by side,not vertically.at emphasis in original.thus,nova has not paid any debt belonging to greenwich and can not maintain a claim for equitable subrogation 
contribution 
nova incorrectly argues that it is entitled to equitable contrib
