this case proceeded to trial on counts i battery,ii iied,and iii assault against each individual defendant,and on count iv sex discrimination and count v sexual harassment against the bank.the jury found in farfaras favor on counts i,ii,iii,and iv,but returned a verdict in favor of the bank on count on march,the district court denied the defendants motions to set aside the verdict and to prevent the recovery of attorneys fees.on april,the district court granted attorneys fees to farfaras.
farfaras worked for twelve years in the banking industry as a branch manager and teller before being hired by citizens bank.the bank is located across the street from michael realty,which is owned by defendants robert and george michael.the michael brothers are also majority shareholders of citizens bank.robert is chairman of the board and ceo george is a director.defendant nicholas tanglis is the president of citizens bank and recruited farfaras.
farfaras began working for the bank on april.her employment continued until october.evidence adduced at trial showed that throughout this time,farfaras was subjected to a steady stream of inappropriate comments and actions by each of the three individual defendants.farfaras testified about her encounters with robert,
he asked what my ethnic background was i told him i was of greek descent,and at that point he asked me if i cried when i found out 
a bout a month and a half into my employment robert asked me if i was married or if i had a boyfriend,and he said that he did understand why i was married or why i did have a boyfriend.he asked me if i was on drugs an alcoholic or if i was shopping at the malls too much h e said to me,i do understand why you not married,you like an angel.and he just kind of stared at me for a while,and he looked at me,and he said,you know what,if only i was a little younger and greek.
farfaras also testified about her relationship with tanglis and robert brother george.farfaras stated that george also asked her about her greek heritage and whether she would have to marry a greek boy 
farfaras further testified that on several occasions,tanglis asked me if i would be able to stay late,alone,in the closed bank.she told the jury that after talking about business tanglis stopped,stared at her,sat down next to her,
and he proceeded to put his hand on my knee and rub my knee,and he would put his hand on my shoulder and rub it,and he would tell me that we needed to go out to dinner and get to know each other better 
i told him that i did appreciate him putting his hands on me i grabbed my purse,and i got up to leave he met me at the door,and he was trying to block my way out i asked him to please move out of my way.he did i had to push him out of the way so i could leave i felt v ery humiliated and scared and afraid that i was going to go to work the next day and not have a job the next day,s ame thing i got up,and i asked him not to do that anymore he got up,and again he went to the door,and he blocked my way.i asked him to please move out of the way,and this time he positioned himself sideways so i would have to turn my body sideways in order to exit that doorway.so depending on how i was positioned to exit,i would either be rubbing up against him,my front or back 
after about five or six times,i believe,i had enough,and i know that i was scared about losing my job,but at that point i did feel comfortable,safe,nor did i want to stay after work and be touched,so the last time he asked me to stay i told him that i was not going to be staying any longer.
the bank opened to the public on january.farfaras would answer the phone at every day when george would call.farfaras testified that she began these conversations,good morning.citizens bank.this is jennifer.can i help you and george would answer,good morning jennifer.why do you come over to my office and sit on my face in addition,farfaras testified that george would call throughout the day,often telling farfaras that he wanted to lick her like an ice cream cone or birthday cake and that he wanted to fuck her.farfaras testified that george just laughed when she told him,please do talk to me like that.that disgusting.i do appreciate it.
farfaras stated that she was often required to visit george michael in his office and that during these visits he would give her a perverted look and make grunting,mumbling,sucking noises put his hand on her butt and start laughing,or he would put his hand on her leg,and he would run it up to lift her skirt.
additionally,farfaras described telephone conversations with george.
h e would often tell me that he wanted to see me naked and that he wanted to fuck me and that he wanted his brother robert to join in,he wanted to videotape the session so he could view it at a later date.
he told me that if he was married that he would make me marry him whether my father wanted it or not even though he was greek,and we would have a big greek wedding and we would be dancing in a circle with scarves in the air 
a fter i had told him to stop talking to me like that,he would laugh,and he said to me,you know what,my brother bob and i have had so many sexual harassment complaints against us already that one more is not going to make a difference.
farfaras related that these conversations continued throughout her employment.
farfaras testified that in april of,george cornered her in the bank downstairs vault,grabbed her right arm,pinned her against the wall,and tried to kiss her.
when i saw his face coming at me,i turned my head,and instead of catching my lips,he caught half my cheek and half my lips 
i screamed for him to get away from me,and i told him not to ever do that again he laugh ed.
farfaras also testified about george actions on july,after george ordered farfaras to come to a party at his house.
e verything was going okay until it was time for us to leave he had a sandwich in one hand and he grabbed me with his other hand by my arm,and he pinned me up against the wall and while he had food in his mouth he kissed me i was thoroughly disgusted as usual,and i pushed him really hard,and i believe he fell,and i ran out.
farfaras described to the jury the moaning,slobbering noises she claimed george made at her desk and told the jury that sometimes she would have to clean george saliva off her desk after he left.she testified that after handing farfaras deposits,george would follow her to the teller station,then use his elbow to hit her breasts and place his hand on her backside.farfaras further testified about her feelings after these incidents.
it was very degrading and very embarrassing.i felt humiliated.i felt that he just was controlling me,i did have a right to speak up and say stop it and do do it.and i did appreciate the fact that he was putting his hands on me when i did ask him to,and i did appreciate the fact that he was listening to me when i said no.
farfaras also testified about her interactions with robert michael.
h e stated to me that first time he saw me he said that he knew that i would be trouble for him but he did care because he already had enough trouble anyway so he did mind h e would begin to tell me that i was the most beautiful greek girl he had ever seen and that normally greek women are not beautiful,they look like greek men,and he asked me why i proud of being greek,there really nothing to be proud of.
the defense objected,claiming that the district court had already ruled out ethnic comments,but the district court found these comments,as well as other comments concerning farfaras heritage,to be related to the ongoing sexual harassment.farfaras testified that robert went on to ask why greeks are proud of greek town,which he described as just a bunch of little restaurants and stated that the jews have something to be proud of because of the magnificent mile.she also testified that robert told her that,
h e knew that i liked him because he could see it in my eyes and that he just wanted to let me know that he liked me too.and he told me that we needed to get to know each other better he told me that he had a boat and that it a beautiful boat and i should consider spending the weekend on his boat fucking under the stars.
farfaras claimed that in order to protect her job,she was cautious in how she answered these comments and that she often felt ready to cry after speaking with robert.
farfaras told the jury that all three men,tanglis,robert,and george had a habit of putting their body against hers and brushing against her,frequently in the small kitchen area,where they would block the single doorway to make her walk past them.
in october of,farfaras was fired.although she could have begun a new job in december,farfaras did not begin her new employment until january.the salary in her new position was equivalent to her previous income.
beata blaszczyk worked at the bank from to september of as a teller.she testified that she heard george michael making moaning noises once or twice a day at farfaras desk and saw george grab or fondle farfaras in the presence of tanglis and robert.
farfaras and other witnesses testified that as a result of the defendants actions,farfaras lost,gained weight,had problems sleeping,changed demeanor,and became nervous.although farfaras never consulted a medical professional about her unhappiness,farfaras friend yonia yonan testified that farfaras had been very depressed beginning early in the year.the defendants objected to the use of the word depressed.the district court overruled this objection.
on september,the jury awarded farfaras for loss of dignity,humiliation,and emotional distress,for pain and suffering,and in punitive damages against the three individual defendants.on count iv,the jury awarded in damages against the bank for emotional distress and humiliation.pursuant to b a,the district court reduced the award under title vii to the statutory maximum of for a business the size of citizens bank.the plaintiff proved in lost wages.the district court reduced this award to on defendants oral motion.in all,the damage award on september,totaled.
on september,defendants filed a motion for a new trial or remittitur of damages.four days later,farfaras filed a motion to reinstate lost wages of.defendants motion was denied and plaintiff motion was granted on february.
the district court extended the deadline for filing a joint submission regarding attorneys fees under local rule e.despite this extension,no joint statement was ever filed.the parties did,however,communicate their arguments regarding attorneys fees and costs to the district court.in an unsigned statement,the plaintiff requested in attorneys fees and costs the defendants suggested that the total amount should be.although the defendants failed to comply with the local rules,the district court allowed them to submit their objections and evaluated the arguments as to the propriety of specific fees and costs.farfaras attorney submitted a statement with leave of the district court,reiterating his request for in attorneys fees and costs.

ii.discussion 
admission of evidence at trial 
this court reviews claims of improperly admitted evidence for abuse of discretion.united states hernandez,cir.trial judges have greater familiarity with the witnesses and evidence as a whole,
consequently,we will reverse a decision on admissibility of evidence only if the trial court has clearly abused its discretion,which typically occurs only where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.further,where the alleged error of admission occurred during the trial we will grant a new trial only if the error had a substantial influence over the jury,and the result reached was inconsistent with substantial justice.

statements concerning ethnicity nationality 
discrimination based upon ethnicity,race,or country of origin is not a necessary element for a claim of sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.see visteon auto,cir describing the elements necessary to create a hostile work environment see also bryson chi.state,cir describing the elements necessary to demonstrate that quid pro quo sexual harassment has occurred.
in the instant case,however,the comments concerning farfaras greek ancestry were intertwined with sexual harassment.the defendants used her heritage as a qualifier in the course of their harassment h e would tell me again about me being the most beautiful greek woman that he ever met,and he told me that,again,most greek women like greek men,as a method of belittling farfaras and leaving her susceptible to sexual attacks insulting greek town directly before crudely propositioning farfaras to have sex on the defendant boat,and claiming that her country of origin was the only thing keeping her from him i f only i was a little younger and greek.we find that the district court acted properly in allowing this testimony.
in addition,given the large body of evidence presented at trial demonstrating the defendants discriminatory conduct,there is no evidence to suggest that hearing the defendants comments had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.see united states hanson,cir citation omitted.given the egregious nature of the defendants sexual comments,we do not believe that the defendants less severe,discriminatory comments had an injurious effect or prejudiced the jury verdict.see williams pharmacia,cir.
it is the appellants burden to show that,without this testimony,a different outcome would be likely.the appellant has admitted,it is impossible to gauge the subject testimony prejudicial impact on the jury.where the impact of a statement is impossible to gauge,the district court admission of the statement is not an abuse of discretion.
regardless of whether a motion in limine originally barred the presentation of evidence concerning the defendants discriminatory conduct,the district court may adjust a motion in limine during the course of a trial.luce united states,d.the district court found that when a conversation that began with comparisons and insults continued into a sexual conversation,the jury should be allowed to hear the context of the sexual harassment.this decision was not an abuse of discretion.
finally,the testimony regarding farfaras national origin was relevant to the intentional infliction of emotional distress alleged by farfaras.see figueroa city of chicago,wl,at.
