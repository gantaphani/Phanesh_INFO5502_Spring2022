and dee bangerter,its president collectively,appeal from a judgment for wells fargo bank minnesota,national association wells fargo in this action for breach of a finance lease they argue that lessee and bangerter guarantor have valid defenses against wells fargo assignee despite a lease clause that waived all defenses against an assignee.one argument raises an issue of first the applicable law is california uniform commercial code,section waiver of defenses against assignee enforceable or california uniform commercial code,section lease only enforceable upon delivery of goods we conclude section governs and affirm.
operates a nursing home and care service in bountiful,utah in october,it sought financing to acquire computer equipment and entered into negotiations with crocker capital,a company that acquires and leases equipment to businesses.in november,while the parties were still negotiating,crocker sent lease documents to bangerter for signature.a company representative assured bangerter it was common industry practice to execute documents in advance,but not date them,and said crocker would hold the documents in escrow until a deal was reached.
bangerter signed the documents on november,and returned them to crocker.they included an equipment lease,an acknowledgment and acceptance of equipment acceptance certificate,equipment schedule a,and bangerter personal guaranty of the lease.the parties stipulated the documents were not dated when sent to crocker.
the lease recites it was entered into on november,and bangerter signature is dated the same day.crocker signature is dated december.the lease states the parties intend it to qualify as a statutory finance lease under california uniform commercial code,article paragraph provides the lease is assignable,and l essee shall not assert against the assignee any defense,counterclaim or that l essee may have against l essor.the lease further provides it is to be governed by california law,and suit may be brought in the county of crocker principal place of business,identified in the lease as newport beach.
the acceptance certificate describes the leased equipment as that shown on attached schedule it states received the equipment in good condition and accepted the equipment unconditionally.bangerter signature on the acceptance certificate is undated.next to it appear the typewritten words date of acceptance,and below that december,is filled in.below the date the following warning appears important this document has legal and financial consequences to you.do not sign this document until you have actually received all of the equipment and are completely satisfied with it.
equipment schedule a,which lists the leased equipment,states it is attached to,and a part of,the lease between and crocker.it is signed by both parties.bangerter signature is dated november,and crocker bears the date december.
on december,crocker assigned the lease and guaranty to a third party,for approximately.it was stipulated that the lease documents were dated by crocker without the knowledge or permission of we understand that to mean crocker unauthorized act was affixing its signature,and the date of december,to the documents.
the lease was included in a pool with other leases and used in a securitization transaction.in brief,securitization involves issuing negotiable notes secured by a pool of leases,with the leases assigned to a third party trustee for the benefit of the holders of the notes.on december,the lease was included in a pool delivered to wells fargo,as trustee,for review.it found nothing amiss.on december,the lease and guaranty were assigned to wells fargo as trustee.
meanwhile,and crocker were unable to come to terms.on january,the parties rescinded the lease,with crocker returning first and last month lease payments,which had been paid at the time the documents were signed.no equipment was ever delivered to,or accepted by,
two years later,in january of,wells fargo brought suit alleging causes of action for breach of the lease against,and for declaratory relief establishing the enforceability of both the lease and bangerter guaranty.in an answer,and bangerter raised the affirmative defenses of failure to state a cause of action,cancelation of the lease,and failure of consideration,among others 
the case was tried on stipulated facts and several declarations setting forth the facts related above.in a statement of decision,the trial judge found the waiver of defense clause in the lease was enforceable under section,and wells fargo took the assignment free of the defenses raised by and bangerter.the judge found wells fargo was entitled to recover,plus interest,from and declared bangerter guaranty was valid and enforceable.judgment was entered accordingly.
argues section does not apply for several reasons.we in turn.
contends section controls leases,and the lease is unenforceable under section because never accepted the goods.but,as we shall explain,when a lease is assigned,it falls under the rubric of section.that section governs the rights of an assignee who meets its requirements and allows enforcement of a waiver of defenses clause that would not otherwise be enforceable under section.
section provides,in relevant part,as follows 
b except as otherwise provided in this section,an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by the assignee that takes an assignment that satisfied all of the following conditions it is taken for value.it is taken in good faith.it is taken without notice of a claim or a property or possessor right to the property assigned.it is taken without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under subdivision a of section.
c subdivision b does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under subdivision b of section.
account debtor means a person obligated on an account,chattel paper,or general intangible,subd.a.account means a right to payment of a monetary obligation,whether or not earned by performance,i for property that has been or is to be sold,leased,licensed,assigned,or otherwise disposed of,subd.a,emphasis added.
the official comment to section explains this section is designed to put the assignee in a position that is no better and no worse than that of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under article.cal.com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll.equico lessors,mines d.reached the same conclusion.in an action by the assignee of an equipment lease,the court held the only defenses available to the lessees were those available to a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument,and failure of consideration was not such a defense 
section provides in relevant part 
a in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease,the lessee promises under the lease contract become irrevocable and independent upon the lessee acceptance of the goods.
b a promise that has become irrevocable and independent under subdivision a is effective and enforceable between the parties,and by or against third parties including assignees of the parties and is not subject to cancellation,termination,modification,repudiation,excuse,or substitution without the consent of the party to whom the promise runs.
at first glance,sections and appear to conflict.section provides that lease promises do not become irrevocable until acceptance of the goods,and only then may the promises be enforced by an assignee.on the other hand,section provides an assignee who meets its requirements may enforce a waiver of defenses clause and is subject only to defenses good against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument.
but closer analysis reveals that section was meant to govern even if another law would not permit an assignee to enforce the waiver of defenses.comment to section provides that such other law,and not this article,determines the effectiveness of an account debtor undertaking to pay notwithstanding,and not to assert,any defenses or claims against an,a hell or high water provision in the underlying agreement that is assigned if other law prevents the assignor from enforcing the undertaking,this section nevertheless might permit the assignee to do so.the right of the assignee to enforce would depend upon whether,under the particular facts,the account debtor undertaking fairly could be construed as an agreement that falls within the scope of this section and whether the assignee meets the requirements of this section.cal.com,reprinted at west ann,supra,foll.
comment to section addresses the scope of section.it provides that subdivision b generally validates an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor that the account debtor will not assert against an assignee claims and defenses that it may have against the assignor.these agreements are typical in installment sale agreements and leases.cal.com,reprinted at west ann,supra,foll.
thus,we have unmistakable direction that section was intended to apply even where other law prevents an assignee from enforcing a waiver of defenses clause,so long as the agreement is within its scope and the assignee meets its requirements.here,the lease is within the scope of section,subdivision b.it is an agreement between as account debtor and an assignor crocker not to assert against an assignee wells fargo claims and defenses it has against the assignor.and this is the type of transaction to which section,subdivision b is intended to apply as the comment recognizes,waiver of defense clauses are typical in leases.the assignee,wells fargo,has met all four of section requirements.so we have little doubt the lease is governed by section.
so read,sections and may be seen as consistent.section governs relations between parties to a finance lease prior to acceptance of the goods.but once the lessee accepts the goods,or,as here,the lessee executes documents that on their face say he has accepted the goods,his rights against not are governed by section.it is only the assignee who,in effect,qualifies as a holder in due course who enjoys the benefits of section.those who do not have recourse only to section.in other words,once there is an assignment to one who qualifies for holder in due course status under section,that section imposes additional rules beyond those of section.
sound policy also supports our understanding that section must govern the instant dispute between an assignee with holder in due course status and an account debtor lessee.securitization is the modern version of the historical practice of financing by factoring,in which a factor bought a creditor accounts by paying a percentage of the face value and receiving an assignment of the accounts.see generally,white and summers,uniform commercial code ed.enforcing a waiver of defenses,save for those that would be good against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument,promotes the transfer of accounts by allowing a purchaser to rely on the face of the documents.thus,the lessee,like the maker of a negotiable instrument,bears the risk of putting into the stream of commerce documents that appear regular on their face but have underlying flaws.
argues california uniform commercial code section applies under the general principal of statutory interpretation that a specific statute controls over a more general one.code civ.it also relies on general provisions of division that state division is intended to apply to leases.but we are not persuaded.
this case involves not the creation of a finance lease,or a dispute between lessor and lessee.rather,it involves a security transaction,where an account has been sold to a third party and the dispute is between the account debtor and the assignee.section specifically covers this situation,and it also covers the situation where other law prohibits the enforceability of a waiver of defenses clause.that is not to say section controls as the more specific statute,only that the general canons cited do not provide any useful guidance,let alone compel the conclusion argued for by 
no more convincing is argument that the later enactment of section stats,ch,operative,supersedes the earlier decision in equico lessors,mines,supra,d.we take the thrust of the argument to be that the rule of equico,which enforced a waiver of defenses clause under the predecessor of section,was abrogated by the later enactment of section.we do think so.nothing in section,or the accompanying comments,mentions equico,and nothing in the statute compels the conclusion it was promoted by equico.indeed,if we were to go by date of enactment,we would have to find section controlling,since it was the later adopted of the two statutes,having been most recently reenacted in.stats,ch,operative july.
also contends it would be unfair to enforce the lease because it is the party who acted reasonably,believing crocker would hold the documents in escrow.that to put too fine a point on.
as between the two innocent parties before us,is the one that had the ability to protect itself and prevent the instant loss.it took a substantial risk in signing documents that reflected a completed transaction when it was still negotiating for a deal that ultimately fell through.the simple expedient of refusing to do so would have prevented the loss.in signing the key acceptance certificate,bangerter ignored a printed warning right next to the line where he signed,which told him not to sign until you have actually received all of the equipment and are completely satisfied with it.wells fargo,on the other hand,had no way of knowing the lease and guaranty were other than what they appeared to be.so,far from being unfair,enforcing the waiver of defenses is the only just result on the facts before us.
argues wells fargo can not take advantage of section because schedule a was not attached to the acceptance certificate,so wells fargo had notice of a failure of consideration defense.we disagree.the trial judge found there was no notice and,in any event,failure of consideration is not a defense under section.
the trial judge found schedule a was intended to be an attachment to at least three of the various transaction documents and it accompanies all of them in the file but is not physically attached to any of them.this state of the transaction documents is not unusual and did not give wells fargo notice of the potential existence of such a claim or defense which would deprive it of commercial code section.there is no suggestion the finding is unsupported by the evidence,so there is no merit to insistence the finding was factually incorrect.
is also mistaken on the law.the only defenses against an assignee who satisfies section are those available against a holder in due course,subd.c equico lessors,mines,supra,d.the settled law is that failure of consideration is not a defense against a holder in due course.see,ibid.so,wells fargo did not take with notice of any defense to the lease.
raises three further defenses under section that we consider together.they are the lease is unenforceable because there was no meeting of the minds material alteration voided the lease and the lease was canceled.none are available under section.
under section,the only defenses against an assignee who takes for value,in good faith,without notice of a property or possessory right to the property in question,and without notice of certain claims or defenses in recoupment,are those defenses that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under section,subdivision b.section,subdivision b provides that,with exceptions not relevant here,a holder in due course is subject to defenses set out in section,subdivision a.those defenses are infancy,duress,lack of legal capacity,illegality of the transaction which,under other law,nullifies the obligation of the obligor,fraud in the inducement,and discharge in insolvency proceedings,subd.a.
as can be concluded from the preceding paragraphs,lack of mutual assent is not a defense against a holder in due course.contends that makes no sense,because it means anyone name could be forged on any contract that would become enforceable in the h
