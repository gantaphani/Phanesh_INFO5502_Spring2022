bank of new york melon appeals from the judgment of dismissal of its lawsuit against respondent citibank.the case arose out of the simultaneous refinancing of a home equity line of credit by two different lenders in,which resulted in a dispute over the priority of their recorded deeds of trust.appellant challenges the orders sustaining respondent demurrers to appellant first and second amended complaints.the demurrers alleged that all of appellant causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section hereafter,section.we reverse the judgment because appellant has stated a claim for equitable subrogation,which is not subject to that statute.
factual and procedural summary 
in may,respondent predecessor in interest,citibank west fsb hereafter,citibank west issued a home equity line of credit of up to hereafter,first line of credit to james and cathleen lima and recorded a deed of trust securing that line of credit against the limas home in pacific palisades.
in january,the limas simultaneously negotiated a refinancing of the first line of credit with both citibank west and appellant predecessor in interest,countrywide home loans,hereafter,countrywide first american lenders advantage hereafter,first american was countrywide escrow agent for the refinancing.the agreement with the limas was that countrywide would pay off citibank west first line of credit,obtain a reconveyance of citibank west deed of trust,and receive a second deed of trust on the property as security for its loan unbeknownst to countrywide,on january,the limas signed loan documents to refinance the first line of credit with a new line of credit from citibank west hereafter,second line of credit.the second line of credit had a limit of up to and was secured by a deed of trust recorded on january.
on january,citibank west issued a payoff statement for,without disclosing that the first line of credit was being refinanced.the payoff statement indicated that the account on the first line of credit had been frozen.the instruction sheet accompanying the statement specified that an enclosed letter was to accompany the payoff funds in order to acquire a release of lien.if this letter is not returned with the payoff funds,the line will remain open and will be considered a paydown only.the termination letter similarly directed the borrowers to request that the account be closed and the lien released along with your payoff to ensure proper processing of your transaction.
the limas february,loan application to countrywide sought a line of credit of up to million.it disclosed citibank west first,but not its second,line of credit.the second line of credit was not picked up in the preliminary title report on which countrywide relied.also on february,the limas executed a line of credit agreement and deed of trust in favor of countrywide.countrywide recorded its deed of trust on the limas property on february,the day escrow closed on its line of credit.the next day,first american disbursed the payoff to citibank west,in cash to the limas,and the remaining funds to other creditors of the limas.first american transferred the limas signed termination letter to citibank west.the letter instructed the bank to close the first line of credit,which was identified by its account number.
in march,citibank west returned the payoff amount to first american,notifying it that the first line of credit had been closed.at first american request,citibank west issued a payoff statement for the second line of credit in the amount of.like the first,the second payoff statement indicated that the relevant account was frozen and warned that the line of credit would remain open unless the limas submitted a signed termination letter with their payoff.after negotiating down the amount due on the second line of credit,first american obtained a partial refund from the limas and disbursed to citibank west as a result,citibank west reduced the account balance on the second line of credit to zero.the limas did not sign the termination letter that accompanied citibank west payoff statement as to the second line of credit,and citibank west did not close that account and did not reconvey the deed of trust by which it was secured.
in,the limas borrowed on their second line of credit with citibank west.in january,citibank west trustee issued a notice of default and election to sell the limas home.in march,appellant filed this action against citibank west and the limas.the first amended complaint substituted respondent as citibank west successor in interest.against respondent,appellant asserted claims for declaratory relief based on violation of statute or statutory subordination civ.code,equitable subordination or subrogation,unjust enrichment,and constructive fraud against the limas,it asserted a claim of actual fraud.
respondent demurred on the sole ground that all causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations in section,subdivisions a violation of duty imposed by statute and d fraud or mistake.appellant opposed the demurrer,arguing that citibank west lien was discharged by operation of law,that there was no actual controversy until respondent claimed priority in and appellant discovered its claims for fraud and unjust enrichment,and that the or statute of limitations for enforcing a power of sale in a deed of trust civ.code,applied to its equitable subrogation and subordination claims.
the court,judge allan goodman,ruled civil code section did not apply because appellant claims were not based on the power of sale in a deed of trust,and the first amended complaint did not plead facts consistent with delayed discovery.the court sustained the demurrer as to all causes of action and allowed amendment only as to the causes of action for unjust enrichment and fraud.
accordingly,the only causes of action asserted against respondent in the second amended complaint were for unjust enrichment and constructive fraud.for the first time in that complaint,appellant alleged that first american and its escrow officer were not agents of countrywide in undertaking actions to pay off the second line of credit,without countrywide knowledge and authorization,after the countrywide loan closed and after the countrywide deed of trust was recorded.once again,respondent demurred on statute of limitation grounds,and the court,judge chester horn,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court rejected appellant attempt to plead around its original allegations in order to bring its claims within the delayed discovery rule.
this appeal followed the entry of judgment dismissing respondent from the action.
discussion 
we review a ruling on demurrer de novo to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action under any legal theory.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th.in doing so,we are not bound by the trial court reasoning and may consider new legal theories or pure questions of law presented by undisputed facts for the first time on appeal.pierce san mateo county sheriff th,b p development city of saratoga d.
we construe the complaint liberally,take all properly pled facts as true,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.coleman medtronic,th,berg berg enterprises,llc boyle th.inconsistent allegations in amended complaints are disregarded unless the inconsistency is explained.holland morse diesel,th.exhibits attached to the complaint take precedence to the extent they contradict allegations in the complaint.ibid.
to determine which statute of limitations applies to a particular action,we consider the gravamen of the action rather than its form or the relief demanded.yee cheung th.the gravamen of an action depends on the nature of the right sued upon or the principal purpose of the action.davies krasna cal d.
contrary to respondent perception,appellant has not abandoned the claims in its first amended complaint,to which respondent first demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.appellant opening brief makes clear that it challenges the sustaining of both demurrers on the ground that the statute of limitations in section does not apply to any of its claims.we,therefore,consider whether section applies to the claims for declaratory relief asserted in the first amended complaint.
a claim for declaratory relief is subject to the same statute of limitations as the legal or equitable claim on which it is based.mangini d.appellant argues that because it seeks a declaration of its interest in the limas property,the claims for declaratory relief in effect seek to quiet title to that property and are not subject to a statute of limitations.it derives that proposition from the dissent in ephraim metropolitan trust of cal.cal d.id.at dis.opn.of carter.that is not the modern rule.the majority in ephraim held that where quiet title depends upon another claim,it must stand or fall on that claim.see id.at see also leeper beltrami cal d,the modern tendency is to look beyond the relief sought,and to view the matter from the basic cause of action giving rise to the plaintiff right to relief.thus,the statute of limitations on a quiet title action is determined with reference to the underlying theory of relief.muktarian barmby cal d,salazar thomas th.we,therefore,examine the theories underlying the claims for declaratory relief.
statutory subordination 
in the first amended complaint,appellant asserted a claim variously titled as violation of statutory obligations and declaratory relief re statutory subordination of trust deed.the claim was based on the following allegations under civil code section,subdivisions a and d,countrywide and its escrow agent were entitled to rely on citibank january,statement to determine the payoff amount for days following the date of that statement under civil code section,citibank was obligated by statute to reconvey the deed of trust within days of receiving countrywide payoff on march,and under civil code section,subdivision d any amount the borrower owed to the lender that was not included in the payoff statement became an unsecured obligation.based on these allegations,appellant requested a declaration that its deed of trust was senior to respondent,to the extent respondent had a valid security interest at all.
respondent demurred under section,subdivision a on the ground that appellant claim was based on a violation of a duty imposed by statute.in opposition,appellant retreated from its theory that citibank west violated its statutory duty to reconvey and argued instead,as it does on appeal,that a reconveyance was not even necessary because citibank west lien on the second line of credit was automatically extinguished at payoff.according to appellant,the essence of its theory of statutory subordination is that its deed of trust has priority by operation of law.
we are not convinced that appellant claim to lien priority sounds in law.california follows the first in time,first in right system of lien priorities.civ.code.thaler household finance th.however,that rule is not without exceptions.other things being equal,different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation,italics added.it appears the legislature used the words other things being equal to refer to the equities involved in a competing liens situation.jp morgan chase bank,banc of america practice solutions,th.
appellant relies on civil code sections and,but those provisions do not establish the priority of its lien as a matter of law.
under civil code section,subdivision a,a payoff statement must set forth the amounts required to fully satisfy all obligations secured by the loan that is the subject of that statement.such a statement may be relied on in accordance with its terms,subd.d.a ny sums that were due and for any reason not included in the statement are recoverable by the beneficiary as an unsecured obligation,subd.d.the provision that a deficiency in the payoff of a loan is no longer secured is a departure from the common law,which allowed reinstatement of an erroneously retired loan.see freedom financial thrift loan golden pacific bank th,disapproved on another ground in ghirardo antonioli cal th,fn.
civil code section,subdivision d has no bearing on appellant claim.citibank west issued the january payoff statement as to its first line of credit.any amounts that may have been due on citibank west second line of credit were not required to be included in it because that loan was not the subject of the payoff statement.moreover,any future advances on the second line of credit could not have been due at all before they were made,let alone be due on the first line of credit.appellant can not claim that the second line of credit became unsecured by virtue of the payoff statement issued on the first line of credit.
the other statute on which appellant relies,civil code section,does not provide for lien priority at all.it establishes deadlines and procedures for the reconveyance of a lien after a mortgage has been satisfied and provides for damages and a penalty,subd.d.appellant denies seeking damages arising from citibank west failure to record a reconveyance.civil code section makes no exception for lines of credit,and its procedures have been applied to such loans.see serafin first interstate bank th,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in markowitz fidelity nat.title th.however,nothing in the statute requires that a mortgage be considered satisfied in all cases where the debt is reduced to zero nor is there support for such a blanket rule at common law.
it is true that a security interest can not exist without an underlying obligation,and therefore a mortgage or deed of trust is generally extinguished by either payment or sale of the property in an amount which satisfies the lien.citations.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,italics added.however,it has long been recognized that whether the payment of a debt operates to release the lien of a mortgage depends on the mortgage terms and conditions.see frank buck buck cal,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in equitable plan dix box d.when a mortgage is designed by its very terms to afford the mortgagee security for his future advances to the mortgagor,much more is required for the extinguishment of the lien than the mere accidental circumstance that the books of one or another of the parties show a balance in favor of the mortgagor upon a given date.frank buck,at see also rest d property,mortgages,com.e,principle that mortgage is not extinguished on payment of debt if loan or payment documents provide to the contrary is most commonly applied to loans.
here,citibank west deed of trust on the second line of credit expressly secures future loan advances and provides that the lien will be released upon payment of all obligations,and upon the expiration of the agreement or upon the borrower request.accordingly,the instructions accompanying each of citibank west payoff statements required that the borrowers sign a termination letter,and warned that the payoff would otherwise be considered a paydown.appellant own exhibits indicate that the termination letter accompanying the march payoff statement on the second line of credit was not signed by the borrowers.
appellant argues that the payoff statement was misleading in several respects for example,because it indicated the account was frozen,even though the termination letter required the borrowers authorization to the account.appellant also argues citibank west did not strictly enforce the terms of its payoff statement because it accepted a payoff amount lower than the one listed on the statement.assuming these arguments support a claim of equitable estoppel against respondent,they nevertheless fail to support a claim to statutory lien priority as a matter of law.see vu prudential property casualty ins.cal th,claim of equitable estoppel arises where a party has been induced to refrain from using such means or taking such action as lay in his power,by which it might have retrieved its position and saved it self from loss city of hollister monterey ins.th,claim of equitable estoppel sounds in equity.
appellant calls our attention to civil code section,enacted in through assembly bill to codify a procedure for closing lines of credit,similar to the one citibank west had in place in.the new statute provides that a lender must close the line of credit and release the lien on the property upon receipt of a payoff and written instructions from the borrowers to suspend and close the line of credit,subds.c d.appellant requsts that we take judicial notice of the legislative history of this statute,and contends that,before the enactment of section,liens securing lines of credit were automatically extinguished upon payoff by operation of law.we grant the request for judicial notice,but disagree with appellant contention.
the problem presented to the legislature was that when an equity line of credit is not shut down by the borrower during the sale of a property,the underlying lien and loan become the debt of the innocent buyer.see assem.floor analysis,conc.amends.to assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july.that is because the lien follows the real property unless it is extinguished.ibid.the legislature intended to standardize the process for terminating a line of credit so that it will not inadvertently become the liability of the subsequent homeowner.ibid.
the legislature recognized that the problem was due to the automated processing of payoff statements and the lenders refusal to close lines of credit without instructions from the borrowers to do so.where a property was in the process of being sold to a new owner or refinanced with a lender who expected to have a first lien position,the failure to close an existing line of credit resulted in the new owner or lender being subject to an apparent prior lien.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,as amended july.
nothing in the bill analyses on which appellant relies suggests that,under the law existing before the enactment of civil code section,the lien on a line of credit was automatically extinguished on payoff by operation of law.to the contrary,the problem was that the lien continued to encumber the property,causing problems for subsequent owners and lenders.
the priority of liens in that situation is determined not at law,but in equity,under the doctrine of equitable subrogation,which admittedly is the gravamen of appellant action.we examine appellant request for declaratory relief regarding the priority of its lien under that doctrine next.
equitable subrogation 
the doctrine of equitable subrogation implies a right to recover from the principal debtor when the subrogee pays the debtor obligation to a creditor in order to protect the subrogee own interest.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity,and cases cited.the doctrine most typically applies in insurance cases but is not limited to that context,at.
as applied in the real property context,equitable subrogation provides an exception to the first in time,first in right system of lien priorities where equity requires a different result.jp morgan chase bank,banc of america practice solutions,supra,th at see also branscomb jpmorgan chase bank th.when a lender advances money to pay off an encumbrance on realty at the instance of either the owner of the property or the holder of the encumbrance,either on the express understanding,or under circumstances from which an understanding will be implied,that the advance made is to be secured by a first lien on the property,and the new security is for any reason not a first lien on the property,then the lender who holds that security,if not chargeable with culpable and inexcusable neglect,will be subrogated to the rights of the prior encumbrancer under the security held by him,unless the superior or equal equities of others would be prejudiced thereby.simon newman fink cal.in short,equitable subrogation allows a lender who pays off a borrower debt to a creditor to succeed to the rights and remedies of the creditor so paid.ibid.
the right of subrogation is purely derivative a party entitled to subrogation has the same rights as an assignee of the creditor claim,must stand in the creditor shoes,and is subject to the same defenses.fireman fund ins.maryland cas.th.a claim for equitable subrogation is subject to the statute of limitations that applies to the right to which the claimant is subrogated.see,valley crest landscape development,mission pools of escondido,th,equitable subrogation claim based on contractual indemnity subject to statute of limitations for breach of written contract.in other words,equity will enforce subrogation only when the action is brought within the time in which an action could have been brought to enforce the original obligation to which the right of subrogation is sought.howell dowling d.
here,appellant seeks to be subrogated to respondent position of priority by virtue of its payoff of the second line of credit,which would allow it to assert citibank west right under the january,deed of trust securing that line of credit.see simon newman fink,supra,cal.at holder of new security who pays off prior creditor will be subrogated to that creditor rights under that creditor security.because appellant right is derivative,it is governed by the statute of limitations that would apply to respondent rights under the january,deed of trust.
in the trial court,appellant argued that the equitable subrogation claim was subject to the statute of limitations in civil code section,which applies to the right to proceed under a power of sale in a deed of trust whether or not enforcement of the debt itself is barred.miller provost th.under that statute,a deed of trust expires years after the maturity date of the obligation if that date is ascertainable from the recorded evidence of indebtedness,or years after recordation of the deed,if the last date fixed for payment of the debt is not ascertainable from the recorded evidence of indebtedness.civ.code,subd.a miller,at.
neither party briefed civil code section on appeal.when asked to do so,appellant submitted a supplemental brief,which suggested in part that appellant had abandoned its reliance on civil code section in favor of other arguments.appellant argued that it did not seek to revive respondent lien,which it assumed was extinguished by operation of law,allowing its own lien to move into a position of priority.but even were the deed of trust securing the second line of credit extinguished,equitable subrogation will set aside a cancellation of such security,and revive it for appellant benefit,so long as n o rights of third persons who might be injured by the revival of the first mortgage are involved and no prejudice to the creditor whose security is revived,is shown.simon newman fink,supra,cal.at.
in other parts of its supplemental brief and at oral argument,appellant recognized that equitable subrogation allows it to assert respondent rights under respondent security,rather than to assert its own rights under its own security.appellant argued that,if it were asserting respondent rights under the second line of credit to foreclose in second priority lien position,its claim for equitable subrogation would be timely under civil code section because the deed of trust has a mortgage maturity date.
whether or not appellant has abandoned its reliance on civil code section on appeal,respondent demurrer to the equitable subrogation claim fails as a matter of law because that claim,on its face,is not subject to the statute of limitations in section.respondent demurrer was based exclusively on section,subdivisions a,which applies to actions based upon a liability created by statute,and d,which applies to actions for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake.but respondent right to proceed against the limas under the deed of trust securing the second line of credit,to which appellant seeks to be subrogated,is not created by statute.brandenburg eureka redevelopment agency th.nor is respondent or its predecessor citibank west the alleged victim of fraud or mistake as to its own security.thus,respondent right,to which appellant will be subrogated,is not in the nature of relief from a statutory violation,fraud or mistake for purposes of section,subdivisions a and d.
in its supplemental brief,respondent incorrectly argued that appellant would be subrogated to the limas right to a reconveyance of citibank west deed of trust,or to the rights of the title insurer.as we have explained,equitable subrogation would allow appellant to step into respondent shoes and assert respondent rights against the limas under the deed of trust securing respondent second line of credit.see simon newman fink,supra,cal.at.since appellant seeks only a declaration of its rights,respondent alternative argument that this is not an action to foreclose on a deed of trust is beside the point.see canova trustees of imperial irrigation dist.employee pension plan th,declaratory relief operates prospectively to declare future rights,rather than to redress past wrongs.
at oral argument,for the first time,respondent asserted that appellant had not stated a valid claim for equitable subrogation because its allegations do not meet all elements of that doctrine.respondent cited caito united california bank cal d caito,and we gave the parties an opportunity to submit additional briefing on that case.after considering the parties additional briefing,we find that respondent belated arguments against the merits of appellant equitable subrogation claim are not supported by caito,and they improperly raise what for the most part are factual issues that may not be resolved on demurrer.see intengan bac home loans servicing lp th,demurrer is not appropriate vehicle for resolving disputed facts.
in caito,supra,cal d,two cotenant families the caitos and the caponis cosigned on a bank loan when the bank foreclosed,the caitos asserted priority over a subsequent lender as to amounts they claimed to have lent to the caponis to keep the original loan current.the caitos claimed to have signed onto that loan only to accommodate the caponis.id.at.the court declined to apply the doctrine of equitable subrogation based on an undisclosed accommodation agreement between the two cotenant families.id.at.although the court recited all elements of equitable subrogation,its holding turned on the principle that a codebtor could not be subrogated to the rights of a creditor since the debt paid must be one for which the subrogee was not primarily liable.id.at.that is not the issue here because countrywide was not a codebtor on citibank west lines of credit.
respondent argument that countrywide acted as a volunteer in refinancing those lines of credit finds no support in caito,supra,cal d.under authority,a bank that refinances a loan at the debtor request and with the understanding that it will receive priority is not a volunteer.see jp morgan chase bank,banc of america practice solutions,supra,th at simon newman fink,supra,cal.at.
the argument that countrywide did not pay off the limas entire debt raises a factual issue that is beyond the scope of our review on demurrer.we must deem true appellant allegations that the escrow agent conferred with both the limas and citibank west regarding the correct sum required to obtain a reconveyance of the deed of trust and determined that sum to be less than the amount included in the march,payoff statement.we also must deem true the allegation that citibank west accepted payment of the lesser amount and reduced the balance on the second line of credit to zero.that the second line of credit remained open for lack of a termination letter signed by the limas does not defeat appellant allegations that the payment was offered and accepted in full satisfaction of the limas debt.see potter pacific coast lumber of cal.cal d,tender of lesser sum offered and accepted in full satisfaction of debt results in discharge of debt see also california federal bank matreyek th,bank accepted full payment on loan without prepayment penalty.
respondent relies on caito,supra,cal d to argue that countrywide loan resulted from a secret agreement with the limas,of which citibank west had no notice,and it would be unjust to invoke the doctrine of equitable subrogation against respondent.under the doctrine of superior equities,the right to subrogation may be invoked against a third party only if that party wrongful conduct makes its equity inferior to the plaintiff.golden eagle ins.first nationwide financial th,see jp morgan chase bank,banc of america practice solutions,supra,th at subrogee equity superior if intervening lienor has notice of subrogee lien.the holding of caito,which was based on the fully litigated facts of that case,can not be used on demurrer to resolve what is essentially a factual dispute about what notice countrywide and citibank west each had of the other lender refinancing of citibank west first line of credit.
in the first amended complaint,appellant alleged on information and belief that citibank west knew countrywide was refinancing the limas lines of credit with an expectation of priority.in the second amended complaint,it clarified that citibank west must have been on notice of the refinancing because countrywide escrow agent was well known in the loan industry as an escrow company that handled refinancing of loans.
a p laintiff may allege on information and belief any matters that are not within his personal knowledge,if he has information leading him to believe that the allegations are true.citation.gomes countrywide home loans,th.on demurrer,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.rickley goodfriend th.it is not unreasonable to infer that receiving payoff requests from an escrow agent known to handle refinancing transactions would have placed citibank west on notice that the limas were involved in such a transaction with another lender.
respondent argues appellant has not alleged that countrywide relied on any wrongful act by citibank west.however,both the first and second amended complaint allege that,in closing escrow on its loan,countrywide relied on citibank west payoff statement as to the first line of credit,which was issued even though that line of credit was in the process of being refinanced by citibank west the first line of credit was allegedly closed and a second line of credit opened without further notice to countrywide.in essence,appellant has alleged that countrywide was misled by citibank west partial disclosure of the payoff amount due on the first line of credit,absent additional disclosure that citibank west was in the process of refinancing that line of credit.
in its initial brief on appeal,respondent relied on the record notice citibank west deed of trust gave countrywide.respondent argued that the first amended complaint showed countrywide had actual and imputed knowledge of citibank west second line of credit and deed of trust.respondent also argued that the allegations to the contrary in the second amended complaint were inconsistent with those in the first amended complaint and should be disregarded.in its second supplemental brief,respondent does not challenge the allegation in the second amended complaint that the escrow officer did not inform countrywide about citibank west second line of credit when she learned about it in february.
constructive or record notice of an intervening lien is insufficient to defeat a claim of equitable subrogation under california law only actual notice may defeat such a claim.see jp morgan chase bank,banc of america practice solutions,supra,th at.the allegations in the first amended complaint show only that countrywide acted through its escrow agent in paying off the second line of credit.the agency relationship gives rise to a presumptive imputation of constructive,but not actual,notice.see in re marriage of cloney th,see also han united states cir.
in the second amended complaint,appellant attempted to repudiate the agency relationship with the escrow agent.that attempt may have resulted in an inconsistent,and legally conclusory,allegation,which we need not accept as true.see holland morse diesel,supra,th at inconsistent a
