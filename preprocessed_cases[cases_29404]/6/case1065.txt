background 
meritor failure 
in,the fdic sought to save a failing pennsylvania bank,the western savings society of philadelphia western,through merger with a solvent bank.and the fdic agreed that meritor would merge with western to facilitate the merger,the fdic agreed that meritor could treat as goodwill the difference between the assets and liabilities meritor assumed from western and that meritor could use this goodwill as a capital asset for purposes of meeting the fdic capital requirements for banks.in,the fdic breached this capitalrelated agreement by no longer recognizing the goodwill resulting from the western acquisition as capital on meritor books.as a result,meritor no longer satisfied the fdic capital requirements.meritor later failed and,on december,the pennsylvania secretary of banking took possession of meritor and appointed the fdic as receiver.
at the time of meritor failure and seizure in december,roth owned more than million shares of meritor stock.in september,however,roth sold his shares for per share,receiving a total of approximately.
roth claim 
in,frank slattery,an owner of meritor stock,filed suit in the court of federal claims,asserting a shareholder derivative action on behalf of meritor for breach of contract by the fdic,as well as a class action on behalf of meritor shareholders at the time meritor was put into receivership.in,slattery citing the fact that a market for meritor stock had developed and some shareholders had sold their stock amended the complaint to redefine the putative class as consisting of shareholders of meritor as of the date of judgment in the case,not at the time of seizure.
in light of slattery amendment to the complaint,roth sought leave to intervene in the proceedings,which the court of federal claims granted.roth alleged that as a meritor shareholder at the time it went into receivership,he was entitled to a portion of any receivership surplus under.he asserted claims against the fdic r based on its failure to distribute to roth his portion of the receivership surplus.however,the court postponed consideration of roth claims until after a final determination of slattery claims.
the court of federal claims ultimately dismissed slattery class action but allowed him to pursue his shareholder derivative action for breach of contract.slattery prevailed on the derivative claim,and the court of federal claims awarded approximately million in damages.as for roth,the court of federal claims dismissed his complaint,ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his claims because the fdic,in its capacity as receiver,is not the united states and therefore can not be sued under the tucker act.
on appeal,this court affirmed the court of federal claims finding that the government was liable for the fdic breach of contract.slattery i,at.we also affirmed,in part,the damages award,allowing million in lost value damages based on meritor market valuation immediately before the fdic breach,on the theory that the breach initiated a chain of events leading to the bank seizure and the loss of all shareholder value.id.at.with respect to roth,we reversed the court of federal claims dismissal of his claims on jurisdictional grounds,although w e express ed no opinion on the merits of his claims.id.at.we remanded the case to the court of federal claims for further proceedings,including consideration of roth claims relating to the receivership surplus.id.
on remand,slattery moved for a partial final judgment against the government for the million damages award affirmed on appeal,and for an order directing the fdic r to distribute the award to meritor current shareholders immediately,while reserving a portion pending the outcome of roth claims.roth filed a,requesting that the court of federal claims order the fdic r to distribute the million award to former shareholders like him who owned shares of meritor at the time of its seizure in december.the government opposed roth motion,contending that d requires that any receivership surplus be distributed to current meritor shareholders.
on november,the court of federal claims held that meritor current shareholders are the proper recipients of meritor receivership surplus,and that former shareholders who sold their shares relinquished their right to claim any benefit from the litigation.slattery ii.at.accordingly,on december,the court dismissed roth second amended complaint.slattery united states,cv,order dismissing roth second amended complaint.then,in a final order dated december,the court of federal claims ordered the government to pay million to the fdic slattery iii,slip op.at.in addition,it ordered the fdic r to use the million to pay certain litigation costs and attorneys fees,and then to distribute the remaining money to meritor current shareholders,except for,which was to be set aside in an escrow account and paid to roth in the event he succeeded in this appeal.id.at the court entered final judgment on december.
mccarron claim 
john mccarron was a meritor employee at the time the bank went into receivership in.mccarron claims entitlement to share in this litigation proceeds based on a severance compensation agreement and an employment agreement he had with meritor.mccarron alleges that under his severance compensation agreement,he is owed two times his annual compensation,equal to.he also alleges that his employment agreement granted him options to purchase shares of meritor stock for one dollar per share.thus,mccarron claims he is entitled to times the difference between the amount of any per share distribution to shareholders and one dollar.
mccarron previously litigated against the fdicr in the eastern district of pennsylvania and the third circuit in the early to mid.see mccarron,cir.among other things,mccarron claimed entitlement to twice his annual salary under his severance compensation agreement.id.at.the third circuit permitted mccarron suit to proceed for vested pension benefits under an unrelated retirement plan.see id.at.however,relevant to the present litigation,the third circuit affirmed the district court dismissal of mccarron claim based on his severance compensation agreement,concluding that after meritor was placed into receivership,mccarron severance compensation agreement was properly repudiated by the fdic id.at.
in september,while mccarron appeal was pending before the third circuit,he filed a motion to intervene in this litigation.in,mccarron filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to intervene,and the court of federal claims denied his motion.mccarron never appealed that decision.
in september,after this court ruled on the prior appeal and remanded the case to the court of federal claims,mccarron filed a second motion to intervene.mccarron attached a complaint in which he asserted a claim to a share of this litigation proceeds based on his severance compensation agreement and employment agreement,as discussed above.
the court of federal claims denied mccarron second motion to intervene in its november,order and opinion.see slattery ii.at.the court held that the motion should be denied for at least three independent reasons.first,the court determined that mccarron claim is directed against meritor and the receiver rather than the government,and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction under the tucker act to hear mccarron claim.id.at.second,the court determined that mccarron claim was barred by res judicata or claim preclusion because mccarron previously asserted the same claim in district court,resulting in a final judgment affirmed by the third circuit.id.citing mccarron,at.third,and finally,the court determined that mccarron motion was barred by issue preclusion because,by failing to appeal the court denial of his first motion to intervene,mccarron did not preserve the issue and can not raise it again now.id.

discussion 
roth appeal 
roth raises three principal issues on appeal.first and foremost,roth argues that the court of federal claims incorrectly construed d as requiring distribution of a receivership surplus to current meritor shareholders,instead of to shareholders at the time meritor went into receivership.second,roth appeals the court of federal claims dismissal of his second amended complaint.third and finally,roth contends that the court of federal claims exceeded its jurisdiction in entering an order purporting to limit the government liability for claims by potential future plaintiffs who were not parties to this litigation.we address each issue in turn.
the fdic r distribution of a receivership surplus is governed by d.the version of the statute that was in effect at the time the fdic was appointed as receiver for meritor,and which is controlling in this case,provided 
in any case in which funds remain after all depositors,creditors,other claimants,and administrative expenses are paid,the receiver shall distribute such funds to the depository institution shareholders or members together with the accounting report required under paragraph b.
d b emphasis added 
the primary issue raised in roth appeal is the meaning of shareholders in d,and whether the word refers to meritor shareholders at the time of the final judgment in this litigation,current shareholders or to shareholders at the time meritor was seized and placed into receivership.roth owned million shares of meritor at the time of meritor seizure in december,but he sold those shares in september.the meaning of shareholders therefore dictates whether roth is entitled to receive a portion of the million receivership surplus.the court of federal claims held that d refers to current shareholders,and thus that current shareholders not former shareholders like roth are the proper recipients of the receivership surplus.slattery ii.at.we review questions of statutory interpretation such as this de novo.mudge united states.
as an initial matter,we note that the court of federal claims erroneously applied the current version of d.see slattery ii.at.the current version of the statute was enacted on august,and applies only with respect to insured depository institutions for which a receiver is appointed after the date of the enactment.omnibus budget reconciliation act of,c,stat.emphasis added.because the fdic was appointed as meritor receiver in december,the pre version of the statute controls,and it was error for the court of federal claims to apply the current version of the statute.nevertheless,we do not find this to be reversible error because,as discussed below,we reach the same conclusion as the court of federal claims based on our de novo review of the pre version of the statute 
roth argues that the plain meaning of expresses the clear intent of congress to give the shareholders of meritor at the time of seizure the right to receive proportionate shares of any receivership surplus.roth points to another provision of d,which provides that when the fdic is appointed as a receiver for a seized depository institution,it succeeds to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution,and of any stockholder,member,accountholder,depositor,officer,or director of such institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution.d a i emphasis added.according to roth,this means the rights of meritor shareholders were fixed as of december,the date meritor went into receivership and that subsequent trading of shares in meritor corporate shell could not confer upon purchasers any rights relating to matters regulated by statute,such as distribution of a receivership surplus.roth further notes that d requires the fdic r to distribute any receivership surplus to the depository institution shareholders.roth asserts that meritor ceased to operate as a depository institution when it went into receivership thus,according to roth,he was a shareholder of meritor up through the final moment that it functioned as a depository institution,and he therefore falls within the group of shareholders who should benefit from the receivership surplus.similarly,roth argues that those who purchased shares of meritor after it went into receivership were never shareholders of a depository institution,and thus they have no claim under d.in addition,roth argues that the court of federal claims interpretation would divorce the infliction of harm from the entitlement to recovery and lead to a bizarre outcome in which the shareholders of meritor who were injured by the government receive no compensation,while speculators who were never injured are compensated.roth appeal br.
the government responds that the plain text of the statute requires distribution of any receivership surplus to current meritor shareholders.the government invokes the temporal aspect of d,noting that the statute provides that after the fdic r pays all other claims and expenses,it shall distribute any remaining surplus to the depository institution shareholders.thus,according to the government,congress clearly was referring to those who hold shares at the time of the distribution,and not to those like roth who are no longer shareholders.the government also contends that roth other arguments are completely unsupported by the text of d.for example,in response to roth argument that meritor ceased to operate as a depository institution when it went into receivership,the government argues that all outstanding shares of meritor are shares in a depository institution because they were issued by meritor a depository institution and that nothing in the statute dictates that a depository institution shares cease to be shares in a depository institution if the institution enters receivership and stops accepting deposits.as for roth argument that d a i fixed the rights of shareholders at the time of the receivership creation,the government argues that this section permits the receiver to control and resolve the failed bank,but says nothing about the distribution of any surplus to the institution shareholders,which is governed instead by d.
we agree with the government that under d,current meritor shareholders are the proper recipients of the receivership surplus.the statute directs the fdic to distribute a receivership surplus to a depository institution share
