the limited,taxpayer,is one of the largest specialty retailers in the united states.as the common parent of a group of affiliated corporations,taxpayer filed a consolidated income tax return for the taxable year ending on january,the tax year.the commissioner of internal revenue informed taxpayer of several deficiencies in its federal income tax returns for two tax years,including the tax year.taxpayer and the commissioner settled all of their differences except for a dispute regarding taxpayer subsidiary credit card company sale of million in certificates of deposit to a subsidiary of one of taxpayer controlled foreign corporations.in a decision,the tax court concluded that taxpayer should have recognized the purchase of million in certificates of deposit as a taxable investment in united states property under and.first,the tax court held that the b a exception to the definition of united states property for deposits with persons carrying on the banking business does not apply because the subsidiary credit card company did not carry on the banking business.second,and equally vital to its judgment,the tax court held that under temporary regulation,the million in certificates of deposit should have been attributed to taxpayer controlled foreign corporation because the principal purpose for the creation,organization,or funding of the controlled foreign corporation subsidiary was to avoid the application of.taxpayer appealed both grounds for the tax court decision.the tax court erred in its analysis of,and on that basis,we reverse its judgment.
the disputed transaction was a january,of cash for certificates of deposit the january transfer.three of taxpayer subsidiaries were involved in the january transfer mast industries far east,mfe,mfe netherlands antilles,and the world financial network national bank wfnnb.
mfe is a hong kong corporation that operates throughout asia,manufacturing or obtaining garments for sale in taxpayer stores.mfe is a subsidiary of taxpayer,and under a,mfe constitutes a controlled foreign corporation a cfc of taxpayer.for several years before the close of the tax year,mfe had accumulated and not distributed approximately million in earnings and profits.
is a netherlands antilles corporation created in january,at the end of the tax year.is a subsidiary of taxpayer and is wholly owned by mfe.its corporate purposes include engaging in group financing activities and providing for a means of investing and reinvesting liquid assets and funds.consistent with those purposes,shortly after it was created,received a million capital contribution from mfe.
wfnnb is a credit card company that issues credit cards to customers of taxpayer stores.taxpayer wholly owns wfnnb.as a condition of being owned by a,wfnnb complies with c f,which requires that it i engage in only credit card operations ii not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties or others iii not accept any savings or time deposit of less than iv maintain no more than one office that accepts deposits and v not engage in the business of making commercial loans.wfnnb is also a nationally chartered bank,authorized to carry on the business of banking under the laws of the united states.consequently,wfnnb is regulated by the office of the comptroller of currency,the federal deposit insurance company,and the board of governors of the federal reserve.
the january,transfers 
the january transfer was a transaction between mfe,and wfnnb.in the first part,mfe wired million to.in the second part,used million to purchase eight certificates of deposit with an annual yield of the cds from wfnnb.
taxpayer explained that the sole reason for this transaction was to protect mfe assets from seizure by the people republic of china.taxpayer believed that because hong kong was scheduled to return to china in,china would begin to expropriate all assets in hong kong corporations on or before that date.to prevent the expropriation of mfe assets,mfe created to hold mfe assets and to act as a layer of protection from asset seizure.as a further shield against the asset expropriation,purchased cds from wfnnb with million that it received from mfe.
while this transfer may have been a good means of removing assets from hong kong and funding wfnnb,it now presents a difficult international tax question.taxpayer claimed that purchase of million in cds from wfnnb did not constitute taxable united states property under and thus taxpayer did not report a b taxes.taxpayer argued that the cds amounted to deposits with persons carrying on the banking business,which is an exception to united states property under b a.the commissioner disagreed.the commissioner believed that purchase of the cds did not qualify under the b a exception and therefore was an investment in united states property that was taxable under subpart f of the internal revenue code.consequently,the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to taxpayer.the commissioner and taxpayer could not resolve this issue and finally it was litigated before the tax court.
the two underlying tax issues 
two conclusions are necessary to sustain the commissioner finding of a tax deficiency that purchase of cds was not a deposit with persons carrying on the banking business under b a the issue and that under temporary regulation,the principal purpose for creating,organizing,or funding was to avoid the application of the regulation issue.
the first conclusion is necessary to sustain the deficiency because subpart f of the internal revenue code generally taxes cfcs when they invest their earnings in united states property.see a b.however,section b a excludes deposits with persons carrying on the banking business from the definition of united states property.b a.thus,if purchase of cds from wfnnb is not a deposit with persons carrying on the banking business,then it is an investment in united states property.
the second the cds should be attributed to mfe and recognized as income by the taxpayer under a b is also necessary to sustain the deficiency.section a,which taxes the income of cfcs,does not normally apply to an entity such as,which is a subsidiary of a cfc,and not a cfc itself.consequently,even if had made investments in united states property,that income would not have been subject to taxation.however,under temporary regulation,if the principal purpose for creating,organizing,or funding were to avoid the application of,then the cds that purchased would be attributed to mfe.if the cds were attributed to mfe,which is a cfc,then,building off of the first conclusion,those cds would be subject to taxation as part of mfe earnings invested in united states property.
thus,for a deficiency to stand,the commissioner must win the issue and the regulation issue.the tax court resolved both issues in favor of the commissioner and for that reason upheld the commissioner finding of a deficiency.
the tax court treatment of the issue 
on the issue,the tax court concluded that purchase of cds from wfnnb was not a deposit with persons carrying on the banking business,and therefore did not constitute an investment in united states property.the tax court interpreted the use of the definite article,the,in the phrase carrying on the banking business as indicating a purpose to particularize the activity.in deciding which particularized business activity congress was referring to in b a,the tax court relied on the language of the statute and legislative history.based on those sources,the tax court reasoned that the phrase,the banking business,as used in b a,applied only to deposits with banks offering banking services that facilitate the united states business activities of business facilitation rationale.because wfnnb,as a credit card company,was restricted from engaging in business facilitation aspects of banking by c f,the tax court concluded that mfe did not purchase cds from persons carrying on the banking business.
the tax court reaffirmed its conclusion on the issue by reading a exception into b a.the tax court reasoned that in light of the dividend equivalence theory,a plain reading of b a would lead to an unreasonable result if the taxpayer did not need to recognize income on the million investment made between its subsidiaries.in general,under the dividend equivalence theory,united states shareholders of cfcs must include in their income the amount of united states property owned by the cfc.see rept,generally,earnings brought back to the united states are taxed to the shareholders on the grounds that this is substantially the equivalent of a dividend being paid to them.the tax court interpreted the dividend equivalence theory as also treating a united states shareholder use of a cfc earnings as though those earnings were a taxable dividend.to avoid an unreasonable conflict with its understanding of the dividend equivalence theory,the tax court required that b a apply only to investments with an unrelated entity.
in short,by imposing the and the conditions on the b a exception,the tax court held that purchase of million in cds from wfnnb did not fit the b a exception to the definition of united states property.
the tax court treatment of the regulation issue 
in deciding the regulation issue,the tax court concluded that temporary regulation applied to the january transaction.temporary regulation b provides that a cfc indirectly holds investments in united states property where one of its subsidiaries makes investments in united states property and one of the principal purposes for creating,organizing,or funding the subsidiary was to avoid the application of.as a finding of fact,the tax court concluded that a principal purpose behind the creation,organization,or funding of was to avoid the application of.taxpayer witnesses stated that the sole reason behind the creation of was to shield mfe assets from chinese expropriation.but,the tax court did not believe taxpayer expropriation justification for the creation of.for the tax court,the smoking gun was the following portion of the testimony of timothy lyons,taxpayer vice president of tax during the years in question 
question okay.were there there ever any consideration take it there was no consideration given to the possibility of forming a domestic subsidiary of mfe.
answer to do what 
question to provide the extra layer of protection in ownership,in place than forming mfe,was there any consideration given to forming mfe 
answer it did really accomplish anything from the asset protection side because it was still an ownership of hong kong subsidiary,but,at the same time,then there is no question that it would have been deemed a dividend or something at that point.
emphasis added.based on lyons acknowledgment that a domestic subsidiary of mfe,such as the hypothetical mfe us,would be taxed for purchasing the cds,the tax court inferred that was created to avoid paying tax on the purchase of the cds.thus,the tax court concluded that the cds held by were attributable to mfe.
taxpayer arguments 
taxpayer appeals both bases for the tax court opinion.it argues that the tax court erred in its interpretation of the phrase carrying on the banking business because neither the requirement nor the exception that the tax court read into b a are appropriate interpretations of the statute.in contesting the regulation issue,taxpayer explains that its sole purpose for creating mfe nv was asset protection and not to avoid.if either of these arguments prevails,the tax court judgment must be reversed.
the commissioner arguments 
the commissioner urges us to affirm the tax court judgment for the reasons offered by the tax court.in addition,the commissioner argues that the tax court resolution of the issue should be affirmed for three reasons the definition of bank under coupled with revenue ruling excludes wfnnb as a bank,thus wfnnb was not carrying on the banking business the fact that wfnnb is outside of the definition of bank in c f means that wfnnb was not carrying on the banking business and the million that mfe nv paid for the cds does not constitute a deposit under because that transaction would not have taken place between independent investors on the open market.after considering all of the arguments before us,we conclude that the tax court erred in deciding the issue and on that basis we reverse its judgment.
standard of review and burden of proof 
different standards of review apply to different components of the tax court decision.the tax court factual determinations are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.kearns comm r of internal revenue,cir we generally review the tax court findings of fact on the clearly erroneous standard.see also gross comm r of internal revenue,cir.under this standard,the tax court findings of fact will be overruled only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.kearns,at.thus,we must uphold the t ax c ourt account of the evidence if it is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.gross,at.in contrast,the tax court legal conclusions are subject to de novo review.kearns,at.when reviewing mixed questions of fact and law,we review the underlying factual determinations under a clearly erroneous standard and the application of the facts to the law under a de novo standard.see friedman comm r of internal revenue,cir this court reviews the tax court findings of fact for clear error and its application of law de novo.mts int l,comm r of internal revenue,cir this court reviews the t ax c ourt legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.
these standards of review are evaluated against the backdrop of each party burden of proof in the tax court.the commissioner determination that a tax deficiency existed is generally presumed to be correct.kearns,at.consequently,a taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the commissioner finding of a deficiency is erroneous or arbitrary by a preponderance of the evidence.see rule a kearns,at.
b.the issue 
taxpayer appeals the tax court legal interpretation of the phrase deposit with persons carrying on the banking business as used in b a.because this challenge involves an interpretation of law,we review the tax court decision de novo.
before interpreting b a,we first review relevant canons of statutory construction.setting the tone for our statutory analysis is the principle that statutes imposing a tax are construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer.weingarden comm r of internal revenue,cir.with that perspective in mind,we look first to the plain language of the statute.see united states health possibilities,cir the starting point in a statutory interpretation case is the language of the statute itself.united states ables,cir united states mills,cir.when the text of a statute contains an undefined term,that term receives its ordinary and natural meaning.see fed.deposit ins.meyer,d smith united states,d united states moses,cir see also wuebker comm r of internal revenue,cir jones,dissenting interpreting an undefined term in the internal revenue code in accord with its ordinary meaning.as a further aide in determining the meaning of an undefined term,the maxim of noscitur a is known from its us to look to accompanying words to deduce the undefined word meaning.see parker metro.life ins,cir see also kurinsky united states,cir.where this textual analysis fails to produce a conclusive result,or where it leads to ambiguous or unreasonable results,a court may look to legislative history to interpret a statute.see palmer united states in re palmer,cir hoffman comshare,in re comshare.secs.litig,cir vergos gregg,cir.resort to legislative history is not appropriate,however,if the text of the statute may be read unambiguously and reasonably.koenig sporting goods,morse.in re koenig sporting goods,cir when a statute is unambiguous,resort to legislative history and policy considerations is improper.mills,at only when the language of the legislation is unclear should we look beyond the wording of the statute to the intent of the legislature.
it is improper to impute the business facilitation meaning to b a.
the parties disagree over whether the cds that mfe nv purchased from wfnnb constitute deposits with persons carrying on the banking business.the tax court interpreted the word the in the banking business as referring to a particularized banking business and examined legislative history to discern which particular banking business congress intended to govern.the tax court conclusion was incorrect because the phrase persons carrying on the banking business has an ordinary and natural meaning wherein credit card companies,such as wfnnb,constitute persons carrying on the banking business.however,if the use of the word the is capable of two distinct meanings,it is more appropriate to interpret the as limiting the business to that of banking.under that reading,wfnnb still carries on the banking business.because a plain language reading of b a is neither ambiguous nor unreasonable,there is no need to look to legislative history here.
the parties dispute whether b a reference to carrying on the banking business applies to credit card companies like wfnnb.as mentioned above,in construing a statute,a court starts with the plain language.see health possibilities,at ables,at mills,at.regrettably,that canon of construction by itself provides little help here because neither the internal revenue code nor the united states code defines the phrase the banking business.fortunately,two other canons of construction assist our efforts undefined terms are construed in accordance with their ordinary and natural meanings and the meaning of an undefined term may be deduced from nearby words under noscitur a sociis.
construing undefined terms in accordance with their ordinary and natural meanings,wfnnb is carrying on the banking business.
when a word is not defined by statute,courts construe the undefined term in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.see meyer,at.smith,at.moses,at.because there is no dispute that wfnnb carries on a business,we do not focus on that term.rather,we turn to the term banking and note that at the time congress enacted b a,it was commonly defined as 
the business of a bank,orig.restricted to money changing and now devoted to taking money on deposit subject to check or draft,loaning money and credit as by discounting notes and bills,issuing drafts and any other associated form or general dealing in money or credit.
webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove.
in light of that definition,wfnnb carries on the banking business.wfnnb is a nationally chartered bank that issues credit cards.as such,it extends credit and receives payment for those loans.wfnnb also accepts certain deposits.moreover,wfnnb is regulated by the office of the comptroller of currency and the federal reserve.also,it is insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.and,as taxpayer points out,in light of its national charter,the only business that wfnnb could possibly be engaged in is the banking business.thus,under an ordinary and natural reading,wfnnb carries on the banking business.for those reasons,there is little need to stretch a common understanding of the banking business to exclude wfnnb here.
using noscitur a sociis to interpret b a,wfnnb is carrying on the banking business.
rather than conduct the above analysis,the tax court focused on the term the in the phrase the banking business.reading meaning into a definite article has been rejected by at least one other circuit and it is hardly the wisest place to begin statutory interpretation.see georgetown.hosp.sullivan,refusing to use distinctions between the and an in interpreting a statute because that approach was overly formalistic and inconsistent with supreme court case law.nevertheless,even if the term the is capable of two meanings,under noscitur a sociis,only one meaning makes sense in the context of b a.
under a hypertechnical analysis,at odds with a plain language interpretation of the statute,the word the as used in the banking business at the time congress enacted b a may have had two relevant meanings 
definition used as a function word to indicate that a following noun or noun equivalent refers to someone or something previously mentioned or clearly understood from the context or the situation.
definition used as a function word with a noun modified by an adjective or by an attributive noun to limit the application of the modified noun to that specified by the adjective or by the attributive noun right answer privileged classes english language greatest difficulty third time boston road seafood industry.
webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove.the tax court considered only definition and concluded that the had to refer to a particularized banking business.but,from definition,it is also possible that the is a function word used to limit the noun business to mean only banking business.in deciding which of these two definitions should apply,we look to nearby words in the statute.
under definition,the refers to something previously mentioned or clearly understood from the context or situation.for the to mean a particularized banking business under definition,the particularized banking business must have been previously mentioned or clearly understood from the context of the situation.undoubtedly,makes no prior reference to a specific banking business.thus,the only way that the could fit definition is if a particularized banking business is clearly understood from the context or the situation.here,there is no particularized banking business that could be reasonably inferred from the context of the statute.due to the absence of either a prior reference or a clear contextual meaning,the text of does not support the use of definition here.
in contrast,the plain language of b a supports the use of definition here.under definition,the modifies phrases,as in the dictionary example,the seafood industry,to limit the application of the noun to that specified by the adjective.in the example,the seafood industry,the industry referred to is limited to an industry dealing with seafood.applying definition is reasonable here because as used in b a,the modifies an phrase,banking business.and,as with the dictionary example of the seafood industry,it is also reasonable to read the as limiting business to a business dealing with banking.for that reason,the application of definition is consistent with the plain language of b a.
in short,a hypertechnical analysis of the term the suggests that it may be capable of two meanings when used in b a to modify banking business.testing these two potential definitions in context reveals that only definition can be sensibly applied.consequently,the,as used in the context of b a,limits business to a business dealing with banking.because wfnnb is a business dealing with banking as the tax court conceded,wfnnb carries on the banking business for purposes of b a.
c.the tax court erred in examining legislative history.
rather than resolve this dispute through an ordinary and natural reading of b a or by considering which definition of the should have controlled,the tax court raced to the legislative history of to support its particularized definition of the.from the senate and house reports covering the enactment of,the tax court concluded that the exceptions to the definition of united states property were meant to apply only where the property located in the united states is ordinary and necessary to the active conduct of the foreign corporation business or substantially the same trade or business.quoting.at emphasis added by the tax court.under this reading,the tax court concluded that the referred to a particular banking business that aids the domestic business activities of cfcs.
the tax court erred in attributing that implied meaning to the word the.and,in its zeal to effectuate the intent of congress,the tax court failed to interpret the plain language of b a.before the tax court read in the complex requirement,it should have instead relied on another principle of statutory imposing a tax should be interpreted liberally in favor of the taxpayer.weingarden,at.thus,rather than force a complex meaning from legislative history,the tax court should have instead construed b a in taxpayer favor.
in sum,both the tax court analytical framework and its conclusions regardin
