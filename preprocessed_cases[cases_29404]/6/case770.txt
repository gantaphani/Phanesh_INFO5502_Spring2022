douglas is a wholesale grocery,beverage and tobacco supplier which serviced several convenience stores in arkansas and texas owned by usa express usa.on april,usa issued douglas a check for to pay for merchandise,and douglas deposited the check into its account at cnb.cnb proof operator mistakenly encoded the check for and sent it on to usa fargo.wells fargo failed to notice the encoding error and debited usa account for.as a result,douglas account was credited with only or less than the payment from usa.
douglas received its bank statement showing the deposit error within days of the transaction.douglas controller,however,had quit in late and it was unable to find an immediate replacement.by the time a new controller was hired there was a backlog.additionally,the new controller became ill during the spring of,adding to the backlog.consequently,douglas did not reconcile its april bank statement until november.on november,when douglas controller discovered the mistake,she immediately called cnb.cnb reviewed its records,discovered the encoding error and advised the controller the mistake would be corrected.relying on cnb assurances,the controller did not tell steven douglas,douglas president,about the discrepancy.
on november,cnb credited douglas account with and sent an adjustment request for to wells fargo through the federal reserve system.the federal reserve,however,does not process adjustment requests over days old.cnb employee testified she sent the request through the federal reserve hoping it would not notice it was untimely.she also testified the federal reserve had processed stale requests in the past.this time,the federal reserve rejected the adjustment request and on november,returned it to cnb.on november,cnb mailed an adjustment request directly to the wells fargo branch bank in houston,texas.cnb employee testified she did not make any inquiries to verify where the adjustment request should be mailed.instead,she consulted her big bank book and looked up the address for wells fargo,houston.she further testified she chose not to telephone or fax the request.cnb president testified the information should have been verified.
the adjustment request was received by wells fargo,houston,sometime after november but before november.individual wells fargo banks,however,because of the large volume of such requests,do not process adjustment requests.instead,adjustment requests are handled by regional adjustment centers.thus,when the request was received in houston it was forwarded to wells fargo southwestern adjustment center sac in phoenix,arizona.sac logged the request in on november,and generated an automatic notice to cnb indicating the request had been received and would be processed in the normal course of business.wells fargo employee worked on the adjustment request on november and,but because she looked in the wrong data base could not find any record of the usa check.on november,having found no record of the check,wells fargo closed out the request without notice to cnb of its findings.the parties agree that between november and november,there were occasions when usa wells fargo account had sufficient funds to cover the discrepancy,on november,the account held a balance of.on november,however,the funds were transferred out of the account and there were no longer any funds to pay the adjustment request.

at the time houston agreed to pay usa indebtedness to douglas,steven douglas remained unaware of the problem with usa earlier payment dating back to april.the controller,relying on cnb assurances,had never mentioned the matter because the had been deposited into douglas account.the parties agree houston would have paid the additional had it been advised of the problem.
in january,cnb,having heard nothing from wells fargo adjustment center,followed up on its adjustment request.sac reviewed its file and after conducting further investigations located usa april check and confirmed the encoding error.unfortunately,the account had been closed on november,when houston transferred the money to its account.sac notified cnb there were no funds in the account and denied the adjustment request.cnb advised douglas of these developments and reversed the credit previously issued to douglas.steven douglas met with cnb officials and it was agreed cnb would his account pending further investigations.cnb then wrote houston asking it to pay douglas in accordance with its agreement to take care of usa indebtedness to douglas.houston,however,refused and on march,filed for bankruptcy.thereafter,cnb again debited douglas account for.
on january,douglas sued cnb for negligence and breach of contract.douglas contended cnb owed a duty to use reasonable care and breached the duty when it improperly encoded usa check.douglas also contended it had an implied contract with cnb requiring cnb to properly credit its account and it breached the contract by erroneously encoding the check.

before trial,the district court denied cnb motion for summary judgment finding douglas suit was not barred by the agreement.in particular,the court held the agreement notice provision only applied to alterations or forgeries and not encoding errors.in other words,the agreement governed douglas duty to notify cnb of improper withdrawals from the account,not errors relating to deposits into the account.the district court also held the relative negligence of the parties was a question for the jury.
the case was tried and the jury found for douglas and awarded.the jury rejected cnb claims against wells fargo and judgment was entered accordingly.in motions,the district court denied cnb motions for jaml and a new trial,and awarded attorney fees to douglas and wells fargo.cnb now appeals the denial of its motions and the award of attorney fees.
