introduction 
richard lueras appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to his verified first amended complaint the first amended complaint.after the foreclosure sale of his home,lueras sued bank of america,successor by merger to bac home loans servicing,lp bank of america,recontrust company,recontrust,and federal national mortgage association,commonly called and referred to as fannie mae.the first amended complaint asserted causes of action for negligence,breach of contract,violation of the perata mortgage relief act,unfair and unlawful practices bus,and to quiet title.
the first amended complaint included no allegations directed specifically to fannie mae,and we therefore affirm the judgment in its favor.as to bank of america and recontrust,we affirm the judgment as to the causes of action for violation of civil code section and to quiet title,but,in all other respects,reverse and remand to permit lueras to amend the first amended complaint.
the key fact alleged in the first amended complaint is that a mere days before bank of america foreclosed on lueras home,bank of america falsely represented in writing to lueras that no foreclosure sale would occur while lueras was being considered for other foreclosure avoidance programs.in so doing,bank of america expressly and in writing informed lueras he will not lose his home during this review period.a bank of america representative also informed lueras the pending foreclosure sale would be postponed.nevertheless,days later,bank of america foreclosed on lueras home.
another key point is the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend to the first amended complaint,lueras had filed only two complaints in a complicated and evolving area of law before facing dismissal.given the standard of review and california policy of liberality in granting of amendments,lueras should be given an opportunity to amend the first amended complaint.
allegations 
in reviewing the order sustaining the demurrer,we accept the factual allegations of the first amended complaint as true.committee for green foothills santa clara county bd.of supervisors cal th,d.we also accept as true facts appearing in exhibits attached to the complaint.sarale pacific gas electric th,d dodd citizens bank of costa mesa d.if the facts expressly alleged in the complaint conflict with an exhibit,the contents of the exhibit take precedence.sarale pacific gas electric,supra,at,d.
in march,lueras refinanced his home loan in the amount of.the monthly payment on the year loan was.to secure the loan,a trust deed against lueras home was recorded.
lueras made every monthly payment due until he and his wife suffered financial hardship.in,lueras requested a loan modification from the lender,bank of america,under the home affordable modification program hamp 
in,fannie mae instituted the homesaver forbearance program,which was available to those who did not qualify for hamp loan modifications.according to the first amended complaint,t he program was supposed to lead to a permanent plan so that the borrower could save their sic home and in the interim offer the owner a month plan reducing the monthly payment by to less than the current mortgage payment.fannie mae announcement issued in april,stated homesaver forbearance is a new loss mitigation option available to borrowers who are either in default or for whom default is imminent and who do not qualify for the hamp.a servicer should offer a homesaver forbearance if such borrowers have a willingness and ability to make reduced monthly payments of at least of their contractual monthly payment.the plan should reduce the borrower payments to an amount the borrower can afford,but no less than percent of the borrower contractual monthly payment,including taxes and insurance and any other escrow items at the time the forbearance is implemented.during the six month period of forbearance,the servicer should work with the borrower to identify the feasibility of,and implement,a more permanent foreclosure prevention alternative.the servicer should evaluate and identify a permanent solution during the first three months of the forbearance period and should implement the alternative by the end of the sixth month.announcement,supra,at as of.
although lueras requested a hamp loan modification,bank of america apparently offered him the forbearance program instead of the hamp program.in a letter dated august,bank of america notified lueras that you qualify for the fannie mae homesaver forbearance program and,as a consequence,he was eligible for reduced mortgage payments for a period of up to six months.the letter stated under the homesaver forbearance program,we are working with fannie mae,a enterprise,to reduce your mortgage payment by up to for up to months while we work with you to find a solution.
lueras accepted bank of america offer for reduced monthly payments under the homesaver forbearance program by entering into a forbearance agreement the forbearance agreement,which was attached as an exhibit to the first amended complaint.the forbearance agreement reduced the monthly payments on lueras home loan to for six months,commencing on september.the forbearance agreement stated the deferral period payment commenced on september,and ended on the earliest of six months from the execution date by servicer execution of an agreement with servicer for another resolution of my default under my loan documents or my default under the terms of this agreement.the forbearance agreement stated the servicer will suspend any scheduled foreclosure sale,provided i continue to meet the obligations under this agreement.
the forbearance agreement also stated during the deferral period,servicer will review my loan to determine whether additional default resolution assistance can be offered to me.at the end of the deferral period either i will be required to recommence my regularly scheduled payments and to make additional payment s,on terms to be determined by servicer,until all past due amounts owed under the loan documents have been paid in full,i will be required to reinstate my loan in full,servicer will offer to modify my loan,servicer will offer me some other form of payment assistance or alternative to foreclosure,on terms to be determined solely by servicer,or if no feasible alternative can be identified,servicer may commence or continue foreclosure proceedings or exercise other rights and remedies provided servicer under the loan documents.
lueras made the monthly payment of for a period of months.during that time,bank of america did not work with lueras to identify the feasibility of,much less implement,a more permanent foreclosure prevention alternative bank of america did not evaluate and identify a permanent solution during the first three months of the deferral period and bank of america did not implement a permanent solution by the end of the period.
meanwhile,lueras submitted to bank of america all information required to determine whether he qualified for a hamp loan modification.in october,while lueras waited for bank of america determination,he was served with a notice of default by the trustee,recontrust.the notice of default stated the total amount in arrears was as of october.it was not until this notice of default was recorded that bank of america began to explore with lueras alternatives to foreclosure.at that point,lueras enlisted the aid of the california attorney general office,which agreed to monitor and assist with the loan modification process on behalf of lueras.
in december,lueras requested a loan modification package from fannie mae.in january,lueras returned the completed package to fannie mae,which sent a copy of it to bank of america.the completed package included over pages of documents from lueras.
in february,lueras was served with a notice of trustee sale with a scheduled sale date of february.bank of america rescheduled the sale date a total of four times,ultimately setting the sale for may.
the first amended complaint alleged that bank of america eventually determined lueras was eligible for a hamp loan modification and made an oral offer to modify the loan.lueras accepted the offer.but,the first amended complaint also alleged that,in a letter dated may,bank of america informed lueras he was not eligible for a hamp loan modification.the may,letter,which was attached as an exhibit to the first amended complaint,stated bank of america was reviewing lueras financial information to determine if there are other options available to you and that bank of america will contact you within days to let you know what other options are available to you and the next steps you need to take.the may letter also stated if a foreclosure sale of your home is currently pending and on hold,that hold will continue and remain in effect while you are considered for other foreclosure avoidance programs.while advising lueras not to ignore any foreclosure notices,the letter stated,you will not lose your home during this review period.
lueras immediately contacted nancy whitaker of bank of america,who told him the may,letter was sent by a third party home retention vendor and was an error.whitaker told lueras that he had been placed in an approved program in which the interest rate on his loan would be reduced for four years.she advised him that bank of america needed to obtain fannie mae approval.
in a letter to lueras,dated may,bank of america informed him it was reviewing his financial documents to determine whether he was eligible for a hamp loan modification.the may letter,which was attached as an exhibit to the first amended complaint,stated lueras would receive one of three possible responses notification he had been approved for a trial period plan under hamp,notification he was not eligible for a hamp loan modification,or more information was needed to make a decision.
lueras immediately contacted bank of america about the may letter.he was informed the letter was sent in error as his application had already been approved by bank of america.whitaker told lueras the trustee sale,which had been rescheduled for may,would be reset,pending approval by fannie mae.on lueras copy of the may,letter is this handwritten note per nancy sent in error reset already approved.
during may,lueras made many contacts with fannie mae,bank of america,and the california attorney general office,but n o response was ever received stating why the foreclosure was proceeding.lueras never received a further response oral or written from bank of america,advising whether he was or was not eligible for a loan modification program.he likewise never received notice from fannie mae that it had denied him a loan modification.
according to the first amended complaint,the making home affordable program guidelines require the loan servicer to wait days from the date of denial of a hamp loan modification before foreclosing so the borrower can appeal the decision.
on may,lueras was informed by the california attorney general office that the foreclosure sale would be conducted on that date.minutes later,lueras home was sold at the foreclosure sale to h and k acquisitions,llc.h and k acquisitions,llc,was named as a defendant in the first amended complaint but is not a party to this appeal.
procedural history 
lueras filed this lawsuit in june.the complaint asserted causes of action for negligence,breach of contract,breach of contract third party beneficiary,unfair and unlawful practices,and to quiet title.the trial court sustained,with leave to amend,a demurrer by bank of america,recontrust,and fannie mae 
lueras filed the first amended complaint,which asserted causes of action for negligence against bank of america,recontrust,and fannie mae,breach of contract against bank of america and fannie mae,violation of civil code section against bank of america and recontrust,against bank of america and fannie mae,unfair and unlawful practices against bank of america and fannie mae,and quiet title against bank of america,recontrust,and fannie mae.the trial court sustained without leave to amend bank of america,recontrust,and fannie mae demurrer to the first amended complaint and ordered it dismissed with prejudice.lueras timely appealed from the subsequently entered judgment of dismissal.
motion to strike portions of lueras reply brief 
bank of america,recontrust,and fannie mae move to strike several portions of lueras reply brief referring to a december,letter,of which lueras requested we take judicial notice.the motion is made on the ground the request for judicial notice was improper and,therefore,those portions of lueras reply brief,which reference the december,letter,should be stricken.we grant the motion.
california rules of court,rule a c states an appellate brief must s upport any reference to a matter in the record by a citation to the volume and page number of the record where the matter appears.we may decline to consider passages of a brief that do not comply with this rule.ragland bank national th,d.as a reviewing court,we usually consider only matters that were part of the record when the judgment was entered.ibid.
by separate order,we previously denied lueras request for judicial notice we therefore decline to consider those portions of lueras reply brief which are supported solely by the december,letter.those portions are on page,the first full paragraph beginning on december,congress received letters and from page,the fourth full paragraph beginning in the letter dated december,through the third full paragraph on page,ending investors would not lose their dividends.
standard of review 
we independently review a ruling on a demurrer to determine whether the pleading alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.in so doing,t he complaint must be liberally construed and survives a general demurrer insofar as it states,however inartfully,facts disclosing some right to relief.longshore county of ventura cal d.

at the outset,and as part of our discussion of the standard of review,we address the argument that some or all of lueras claims are not viable because the foreclosure sale has been rescinded and any equity lueras might have in the property remains.in opposition to the demurrer to the first amended complaint,lueras acknowledged,the trustee was able to rescind the foreclosure sale and,in his reply brief,argues,t he rescission of the trustee deed upon sale does not moot lueras s claims.
in reviewing the judgment,we are limited to the facts of the complaint and matters subject to judicial notice.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,walgreen city and county of san francisco th,d.the first amended complaint did not allege rescission of the foreclosure sale.no party has requested we take judicial notice of anything establishing such rescission.no party has explained what rescission means in this context,briefed the legal consequences of a rescission on possible future attempts to foreclose,or informed us of the status of any current foreclosure proceedings.no party has argued that statements of lueras counsel constitute judicial admissions.
in short,nothing in the record permits us to consider the foreclosure sale to have been rescinded or the legal significance of any such rescission in reviewing the judgment and the sufficiency of the first amended complaint.whether a rescission of the foreclosure sale occurred and the legal significance of a rescission is better resolved in the trial court,after lueras has the opportunity to replead and,as necessary and permitted,upon concrete evidence.further,assuming there was a rescission of the foreclosure sale,we can not say as a matter of law at this stage that lueras can not plead any cause of action.
discussion 
in the first cause of action of the first amended complaint,for negligence,lueras alleged bank of america and recontrust breached a duty of care in the handling of his application for a loan modification and in foreclosing his property.bank of america and recontrust argue lueras failed to allege,and can not allege,the existence of a duty of care.
overview of the law of negligence and relevant allegations of the first amended complaint 
to state a cause of action for negligence,a plaintiff must allege the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care,the defendant breached that duty,and the breach proximately caused the plaintiff damages or injuries.thomas stenberg th,d.whether a duty of care exists is a question of law to be determined on a basis.parsons crown disposal cal th,d.
we start by identifying the allegedly negligent conduct by bank of america and recontrust because our analysis is limited to the specific action the plaintiff claims the particular defendant had a duty to undertake in the particular case.vasquez residential investments,th,d.in the first cause of action,lueras alleged that bank of america and recontrust owed him a duty of care to handle his loan in such a way to prevent foreclosure and forfeiture of his property determine modification approvals,explore and offer foreclosure alternatives with lueras prior to default exercise reasonable care and skill in timely and accurately responding to customer requests and inquiries record proper land records properly service the loan ensure chain of title prior to foreclosing and stop all foreclosure sales that are unlawful.
lueras alleged bank of america and recontrust breached that duty of care in several ways.most importantly,lueras alleged bank of america and recontrust had a duty to offer lueras a loan modification and breached that duty by refusing to do so.he also alleged bank of america and recontrust breached their duty of care by failing to timely and accurately respond to customer requests and inquiries,by failing to comply with state consumer protection laws,properly service the loan,and use consistent methods to determine modification approvals,and by failing to record proper land records and ensure chain of title prior to foreclosing and to stop all foreclosure sales that are unlawful.

in nymark,supra,d at page,the court held a lender owed no duty of care to a borrower in preparing an appraisal of the real property security for the loan when the purpose of the appraisal is to protect the lender by satisfying it that the collateral provided adequate security for the loan.the court reached this holding by considering the six factors identified in biakanja irving cal d,biakanja to determine whether to recognize a duty of care.nymark,supra,at.those factors are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.ibid.
the nymark court stressed the purpose of the appraisal was to protect the lender interest and was not intended to assure the borrower the collateral was sound or to induce him to enter into the loan transaction.nymark,supra,d at.the foreseeability of harm to the borrower who would know the value of his own property was remote,the connection between the lender conduct and the injury suffered was tenuous,there was no moral blame because the borrower was in a position to protect himself from loss,and a strong public policy prevented imposing on the lender a duty of care in the preparation of an appraisal.id.at.
in ragland bank national,supra,th at page,d,a borrower contended the lender misadvised her to miss a loan payment in order to be considered for a loan modification.the borrower alleged the lender negligently caused her severe emotional distress by then failing to modify her loan and selling her home in a foreclosure sale.id.at,d.affirming summary adjudication of a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress,a panel of this court concluded,t he undisputed facts established there was no relationship between the borrower and the lender giving rise to a duty the breach of which would permit the borrower to recover emotional distress damages based on negligence.id.at,d.
some federal district courts in california have concluded a lender owes no duty of care to a borrower to modify a loan.in armstrong chevy chase bank,fsb,cv ejd wl.lexis,pp,the court explained a loan modification,which at its core is an attempt by a money lender to salvage a troubled loan,is nothing more than a renegotiation of loan terms.this renegotiation is the same activity that occurred when the loan was first originated the only difference being that the loan is already in existence.outside of actually lending money,it is undebatable that negotiating the terms of the lending relationship is one of the key functions of a money lender.for this reason,n umerous cases have characterized a loan modification as a traditional money lending activity.see diunugala jp morgan chase bank,wqh nls wl.lexis,absent special circumstances,there is no duty for a servicer to modify a loan sanguinetti citimortgage,sc wl.lexis,loan modifications are part of the lending process,and negotiating a lending agreement terms is one of a bank key functions bunce ocwen loan servicing,llc,july,no.civ.wbs efb wl.lexis,agreeing with armstrong chevy chase bank,fsb that lender does not owe duty in loan modification activities kennedy bank of america,cv ygr wl.lexis,pp.lender owes borrower no duty of care in process of approving loan modification dooms federal home loan mortgage,no.cv f ljo dlb wl.lexis,the lender owed no duty of care to the borrower arising from her default,property foreclosure,and loan modification attempts deleon wells fargo bank,cv lhk wl.lexis,the defendant lender did not have a duty to complete the loan modification process.

after oral argument,we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs on three recent opinions,including jolley chase home finance,llc th,d jolley,which addressed whether a construction lender owed a duty of care to the borrower.in jolley,the plaintiff and washington mutual bank wamu entered into a construction loan agreement by which the plaintiff borrowed to renovate a house for use as rental property.id.at,d.problems arose due to wamu alleged failure to properly disburse loan proceeds,and wamu agreed to modify the loan based on an expansion of the construction project.id.at,d.several months after the last disbursement,wamu was closed by the office of thrift supervision and placed in receivership under the federal deposit insurance corporation.id.at,d.certain of wamu assets,including the construction loan,were acquired by the defendant bank.ibid.
soon thereafter,the plaintiff ceased making payments on the loan,claiming he had been forced to default by wamu breaches and negligence in the funding of the construction loan.jolley,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff tried to obtain a loan modification from the defendant and was told there was a high probability the defendant would modify the loan to avoid foreclosure and it was likely the construction loan could be rolled over into a fully amortized conventional loan.id.at,d.so assured,the plaintiff completed construction by borrowing money from family and friends.id.at,d.instead of offering a loan modification,the defendant demanded payment of the loan in full and refused the plaintiff request to postpone the planned foreclosure sale.ibid.
the plaintiff sued the defendant for various causes of action,including negligence,fraud,breach of contract,and promissory estoppel.jolley,supra,th at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment,and the court of appeal reversed.id.at,d.on the negligence cause of action,the court of appeal recognized the general rule that a financial institution does not owe a duty of care to a borrower when the institution acts within its traditional role as a lender of money.id.at,d.the court of appeal concluded,however,the general rule did not apply to the facts of the case.the court explained when considered in full context,the cases show the question is not subject to analysis and not easily decided on the general rule.we conclude here,where there was an ongoing dispute about wamu performance of the construction loan contract,where that dispute appears to have bridged the federal deposit insurance corporation receivership and chase acquisition of the construction loan,and where specific representations were made by a chase representative as to the likelihood of a loan modification,a cause of action for negligence has been stated that can not be properly resolved based on lack of duty alone.ibid.
the court of appeal did not end its analysis there.the court next considered the six factors identified in biakanja,supra,cal d,for determining whether to impose a duty of care.jolley,supra,th at,d.the court assessed those factors and concluded they compelled the conclusion the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to review his request for a loan modification in good faith.id,d.
the jolley court acknowledged it was dealing with a construction loan,not a residential home loan where,save for possible loan servicing issues,the relationship ends when the loan is funded.jolley,supra,th at,d.by contrast,in a construction loan the relationship between lender and borrower is ongoing,in the sense that the parties are working together over a period of time,with disbursements made throughout the construction period,depending upon the state of progress towards completion.we see no reason why a negligent failure to fund a construction loan,or negligent delays in doing so,would not be subject to the same standard of care.ibid.fn.omitted.despite limiting its holding to construction loans,the jolley court went to great lengths,in dictum,to explain the rule is only a general rule and to suggest that a lender may be liable for negligence in its handling of a loan transaction within its traditional role as a lender of money.id.at,d,citing ottolini bank of america,no.c emc wl.lexis,pp.
the jolley court reviewed recent federal and state legislation directed at aiding resident homeowners at risk of losing their homes through foreclosure,and concluded that,while the new legislation did not directly apply to construction loans,it sets forth policy considerations that should affect the assessment whether a duty of care was owed to the plaintiff at that time.jolley,supra,th at,d.if the new legislation supports imposition of a duty of care on a construction lender,then it would support imposition of such a duty of care on a lender of home loans.
we disagree with jolley to the extent it suggests a residential lender owes a common law duty of care to offer,consider,or approve a loan modification,or to explore and offer foreclosure alternatives.as the jolley court recognized,there is no express duty on a lender part to grant a modification under state or federal loan modification statutes.jolley,supra,th at,d.in aspiras wells fargo bank,th,d,the court distinguished jolley and declined to impose a duty of care on an institutional lender in handling a loan modification.the aspiras court agreed with the federal district courts that had held,offering loan modifications is sufficiently entwined with money lending so as to be considered within the scope of typical money lending activities.aspiras wells fargo bank,supra,at,d.
we conclude a loan modification is the renegotiation of loan terms,which falls squarely within the scope of a lending institution conventional role as a lender of money.a lender obligations to offer,consider,or approve loan modifications and to explore foreclosure alternatives are created solely by the loan documents,statutes,regulations,and relevant directives and announcements from the united states department of the treasury,fannie mae,and other governmental or agencies.the biakanja factors do not support imposition of a common law duty to offer or approve a loan modification.if the modification was necessary due to the borrower inability to repay the loan,the borrower harm,suffered from denial of a loan modification,would not be closely connected to the lender conduct.if the lender did not place the borrower in a position creating a need for a loan modification,then no moral blame would be attached to the lender conduct.
b.why the allegations of the first amended complaint do not state a cause of action for negligence 
accordingly,in this case,bank of america and recontrust did not have a common law duty of care to offer,consider,or approve a loan modification,or to offer lueras alternatives to foreclosure.likewise,bank of america and recontrust did not have a duty of care to handle lueras loan in such a way to prevent foreclosure and forfeiture of his property.their rights,duties,and obligations in those regards were set forth in the note and deed of trust,the forbearance agreement,federal and state statutes and regulations,and the directives and announcements of the united states department of the treasury and fannie mae.gomes countrywide home loans,th,d because of the exhaustive nature of the nonjudicial foreclosure scheme,california appellate courts have refused to read any additional requirements into the foreclosure statute.
lueras did not allege bank of america and recontrust did anything wrongful that made him unable to make the original monthly loan payments.lueras did not allege bank of america and recontrust caused or exacerbated his initial default by negligently servicing the loan.to the contrary,he alleged his inability to make the payments was caused by financial hardship due to the drastically decreased demand of his services of his contracting business and his wife loss of employment.lueras allegations that bank of america and recontrust owed him duties to follow through on their own agreements,to comply with consumer protection laws,and to stop foreclosure sales that were unlawful fail to state a cause of action for negligence because such duties,if any,are imposed by the loan documents and the forbearance agreement,statutes,or regulations.if bank of america and recontrust failed to follow through on those agreements,then lueras remedy lies in breach of contract,not negligence.
thus,the first amended complaint did not,and can not as a matter of law,state a claim for negligence based on bank of america alleged failure to offer lueras a loan modification.
basis for granting leave to amend 
we conclude,however,that a lender does owe a duty to a borrower to not make material misrepresentations about the status of an application for a loan modification or about the date,time,or status of a foreclosure sale.the law imposes a duty not to make negligent misrepresentations of fact,subd.defining deceit to include t he assertion,as a fact,of that which is not true,by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true small fritz companies,cal th,d.in a different context,courts have held a bank depositor can state a claim for negligent misrepresentation,based on a bank employee incorrect statements about the settlement of a check.wells fargo bank,fsi financial solutions,th,d holcomb wells fargo bank,th,d.it is foreseeable that a borrower might be harmed by an inaccurate or untimely communication about a foreclosure sale or about the status of a loan modification application,and the connection between the misrepresentation and the injury suffered could be very close 
leave to amend must be granted if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.city of dinuba county of tulare,supra,cal th at,d.the first amended complaint generally alleged bank of america failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in timely and accurately responding to customer requests and inquiries.based on the record before us and on the grounds we have explained in detail,it is reasonably possible that lueras could amend the first amended complaint to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.we therefore reverse the judgment as to the negligence cause of action and remand to the trial court with directions to allow lueras the opportunity to amend the first amended complaint to plead a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
breach of contract 
in the second cause of action of the first amended complaint,for breach of contract,lueras asserted two theories bank of america breached the deed of trust by failing to tender him the difference between the amount of the indebtedness and the auction price of his home at the foreclosure sale and bank of america breached the forbearance agreement 
bank of america argues the first theory is no longer viable because the foreclosure sale has been rescinded.as we have explained,in reviewing the judgment,we are limited to the facts of the complaint and matters subject to judicial notice.zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.the first amended complaint did not allege rescission of the foreclosure sale,no party has requested we take judicial notice of anything establishing such rescission,and no party has argued that statements of lueras counsel constitute judicial admissions.
under the second theory,lueras alleged bank of america breached the forbearance agreement by terminating the deferral period although the servicer i never executed the agreement,ii never offered another resolution of any default such as a modification,sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure,or iii found lueras in default under the program.in essence,lueras alleged bank of america breached the forbearance agreement by failing to offer him a loan modification or some other resolution that would avoid foreclosure before commencing or resuming foreclosure of his home.because the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action,we accept as true the allegations of the breach of contract cause of action and the exhibits attached to the first amended complaint.sarale pacific gas electric,supra,th at,d.
relevant principles of contract interpretation 
the arguments presented require us to interpret parts of the forbearance agreement.the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.citations.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.citation.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.citations.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,d.civil code section states,t he language of a contract is to govern its interpretation,if the language is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity.
a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.to the extent practicable,the meaning of a contract must be derived from reading the whole of the contract,with individual provisions interpreted together,in order to give effect to all provisions and to avoid rendering some meaningless.zalkind ceradyne,th,d.
whether the forbearance agreement was binding 
in a footnote in the respondents brief,bank of america states it does not concede that the forbearance agreement constituted a binding contract,since lueras admitted that bank of america did not execute the agreement.we may decline to address arguments made perfunctorily and exclusively in a footnote.people turner cal th,fn,d,reviewing court may disregard claims perfunctorily asserted without development and without a clear indication they are intended to be discrete contentions placer ranch partners county of placer th,fn,d opdyk california horse racing bd.th,fn,d.
we nonetheless reject this argument on the merits for two reasons.first,bank of america accepted payments during the deferral period and was entitled to receive a incentive fee upon successful reporting to fannie mae of the initiation of a homesaver forbearance plan and the collection of one payment under the forbearance plan.announcement,supra,at as of.under those circumstances,bank of america failure to sign the forbearance agreement did not render it unenforceable.barroso ocwen loan servicing,llc th,d lender failure to sign and return loan modification contract was not a condition precedent precluding formation of a binding contract.
second,while a forbearance agreement that modifies a note and deed of trust is subject to the statute of frauds secrest security national mortgage loan trust th,d,here,in contrast,the forbearance agreement states no modification.i understand that the agreement is not a forgiveness of payments on my loan or a modification of the loan documents.original boldface.the statute of frauds was not raised in the demurrer to the first amended complaint.
lueras argues the deferral period under the forbearance agreement has not ended and bank of america continues to have an obligation under the forbearance agreement to suspend foreclosure and offer him assistance.the forbearance agreement states the deferral period,under which lueras made reduced payments on the note,commences on the date of this agreement and ends on the earliest of six months from the execution date by servicer,execution of an agreement with servicer for another resolution of my default,or my default under the terms of this agreement.according to lueras,none of these events has occurred.since bank of america never signed the agreement,lueras argues that six months from the execution date has not elapsed.
we reject the argument the deferral period under the forbearance agreement has not ended.section of the forbearance agreement sets forth a table showing the amount and due dates for six deferral period payment s,with the first payment due on september,and the final payment due on march.following this table,the forbearance agreement sets forth the provision regarding the beginning and ending of the deferral period.other than the six payments set forth in the table,the forbearance agreement identifies no other deferral period payments since the forbearance agreement was not to be binding until signed by bank of america,and the first deferral period payment was due on september,a reasonable inference is the parties anticipated and intended that bank of america would sign the forbearance agreement by that date.viewing section of the forbearance agreement in light of the agreement as a whole,we conclude the parties intended the deferral period to end no later than six months from the due date of the first deferral period payment.
bank of america obligations under the forbearance agreement 
the forbearance agreement and announcement 
lueras breach of contract cause of action is based primarily on section of the forbearance agreement,labeled additional assistance boldface omitted.the first sentence of section states that d uring the deferral period,servicer will review my loan to determine whether additional default resolution assistance can be offered to me.section of the forbearance agreement then states that,at the end of the deferral period,one of five things will happen the borrower will be required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and to make additional payments until all past due amounts have been paid the loan will be reinstated in full the servicer will offer to modify my loan the servicer will offer me some other form of payment assistance or alternative to foreclosure,on terms to be determined solely by servicer or if no feasible alternative can be identified,servicer may commence or continue foreclosure proceedings or exercise other rights and remedies provided servicer under the loan documents.
section,on its face,thus expressly required bank of america to review lueras loan to determine whether additional default resolution assistance can be offered.the forbearance agreement did not expressly require bank of america to offer lueras a loan modification or an alternative to foreclosure.
however,in,announcement was issued to provide additional policy clarification and instruction on hamp and the homesaver forbearance program.announcement,supra,at as of.as to the homesaver forbearance program,announcement states during the six month period of forbearance,the servicer should work with the borrower to identify the feasibility of,and implement,a more permanent foreclosure prevention alternative.the servicer should evaluate and identify a permanent solution during the first three months of the forbearance period and should implement the alternative by the end of the sixth month.announcement,supra,at,italics added.
we conclude these provisions of announcement must be read into homesaver forbearance agreements.west,supra,th,d,is instructive.in west,a panel of this court addressed whether a residential borrower stated a cause of action against a residential lender for breach of a trial period plan tpp under hamp.west,supra,at,d.the borrower alleged the lender had breached the tpp by failing to offer her a permanent loan modification after she had complied with all of the terms of the tpp.ibid.the united states department of the treasury,hamp supplemental directive provides that if the borrower complies with all of the tpp terms and conditions,the loan modification becomes effective on the first day of the month following the trial period.west,supra,at,d.following wigod wells fargo bank,cir wigod,a panel of this court held that if the borrower complies with all of the terms of the tpp,then the lender must offer the borrower a permanent loan modification.west,supra,at,d.although the tpp in west,unlike the one in wigod,did not expressly include such a proviso,this court concluded it was imposed by the united states department of the treasury through hamp supplemental directive.west,supra,at,d.to make the tpp lawful and enforceable,it had to be interpreted to include the requirements of that directive.id.at,d.
in corvello wells fargo bank,na cir,the ninth circuit court of appeals expressly agreed with wigod and west to conclude where,as here,borrowers allege,and we must assume,that they have fulfilled all of their obligations under the tpp,and the loan servicer has failed to offer a permanent modification,the borrowers have valid claims for breach of the tpp agreement.see chavez indymac mortgage services th,d following corvello wells fargo bank,na.even more recently,the third district court of appeal also agreed with west and wigod.bushell jpmorgan chase bank,th,wl.
west dealt with a tpp under hamp,and this case deals with a forbearance agreement under the homesaver forbearance program.for that reason,bank of america argues in its supplemental brief that west is inapplicable.while hamp and the homesaver forbearance program differ,the guiding principle of west,that a tpp under hamp must be interpreted to include united states department of the treasury directives is applicable here.announcement is similar to united states department of the treasury,hamp supplemental directive and sets forth policy clarification and instruction regarding the homesaver forbearance program.announcement,supra,at as of.bank of america does not assert it was not required to follow announcement.thus,the reasonable interpretation of the forbearance agreement and the one necessary to make it lawful and in compliance with the homesaver forbearance program is that the forbearance agreement includes the obligations imposed by announcement.west,supra,th at,d.
the meaning of should in announcement 
as quoted above,announcement states the lender should work with the borrower to identify and implement a permanent foreclosure prevention alternative,should evaluate and identify a permanent loan solution,and should implement the alternative by the end of the deferral period.announcement,supra,at,italics added as of.bank of america argues the word should is permissive rather than mandatory and,therefore,announcement imposed no obligation on them to offer a loan modification or other alternative to foreclosure.in his supplemental brief,lueras argues the word should must be interpreted to mean bank of america was obligated to evaluate and identify a permanent solution.
what does should in this context mean we start by consulting the dictionary according to webster third new international dictionary,should in auxiliary function can be used to express condition to express duty,obligation,necessity,propriety,or expediency to express futurity from a point of view in the past in place of might or could capitalization omitted archaic to express what is probable or expected or to express a desire or request in a polite or unemphatic manner.webster new internat.dict,cols.black law dictionary defines should to mean t he past tense of shall,which ordinarily implies a command,but should used in the present or future tense,while not synonymous with and more forceful than may,can convey only a moral obligation or strong recommendation.boam trident financial th,fn,d,citing black law dict.ed.
the california rules of court distinguish between the words must,may,may not,will,and should.cal.rules of court,rule b.under the california rules of court,s hould expresses a preference or a nonbinding recommendation,while m ust is mandatory,m ay is permissive,and w ill expresses a future contingency,rule b.case law has defined should generally to mean a moral obligation or recommendation.see kucera lizza th,d the words may and should are ordinarily permissive boam trident financial,supra,th at,fn,d cuevas superior court d.in penal code section,subdivision b,t he word should is used in a regular,persuasive sense,as a recommendation,not as a mandate.
we agree with bank of america the word should in announcement is not mandatory however,we reject the notion the word should in that announcement is entirely permissive and imposes no responsibilities or obligations whatsoever on loan servicers.under the variety of definitions offered,should in the very least imposes a moral obligation or a strong recommendation,and can mean a duty or necessity.interpreting should as imposing some obligation on the loan servicer is in keeping with the purpose of announcement,which was issued to provide policy clarification and instruction to loan servicers for implementation of the homesaver forbearance program.the sense of moral obligation,strong recommendation,preference,or propriety imparted by the word should equates with good faith that is,although bank of america had no contractual duty to offer lueras a loan modification or an alternative to foreclosure,it had a contractual duty to work with him to identify the feasibility of,and implement,a foreclosure prevention alternative,and to do so in good faith.
the duty to act in good faith in working with a borrower is imposed expressly in the forbearance agreement through announcement and by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.every contract imposes on each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in contract performance and enforcement such that neither party may do anything to deprive the other party of the benefits of the contract.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,kendall ernest pestana,cal d,storek storek,citicorp real estate,th,d.this covenant not only imposes upon each contracting party the duty to refrain from doing anything which would render performance of the contract impossible by any act of his own,but also the duty to do everything that the contract presupposes that he will do to accomplish its purpose.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
the covenant of good faith finds particular application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another.such power must be exercised in good faith.carma developers cal,marathon development california,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,while the word should as used in announcement gives a loan servicer discretion to work with a borrower to identify the feasibility of a foreclosure prevention alternative,and to evaluate and implement a permanent solution,that discretionary power must be exercised in good faith.
as it stands,the first amended complaint alleged bank of america never offered another resolution of any default such as a modification,sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure.although the forbearance agreement did not impose on bank of america the obligation to offer lueras a loan modification or an alternative to foreclosure,we conclude lueras should be given leave to amend to state a claim for breach of contract in light of our interpretation of the forbearance agreement.
bank of america argues lueras failed to allege damages from breach of the forbearance agreement.in the first amended complaint,lueras alleged that,as a result of bank of america breach of contract,he sustained damages of at least,representing moni e s collected by defendants during the special forbearance time period and on the sale plus the amount of late fees and charges incurred on the loan as a result of defendants breach.the payments made by lueras during the deferral period do not constitute contractual damages because they would have been owed under the note and deed of trust in absence of the forbearance agreement.
in this opinion,the rights and obligations under the forbearance agreement are being identified and described in a definitive way for the first time.lueras has not had the opportunity to formulate and allege a theory of damages based on our construction of the forbearance agreement.we certainly can not say at this stage that lueras is unable as a matter of law to allege breach of contract damages.as there is a reasonable possibility city of dinuba county of tulare,supra,cal th at,d,that lueras could amend to allege recoverable damages,leave to amend must be granted.
violation of civil code section 
in his third cause of action of the first amended complaint,lueras alleged bank of america and recontrust violated civil code section because they did not initiate exploration of foreclosure alternatives with him until after a notice of default was recorded on the property placing him in imminent foreclosure.in mabry superior court th,d,this court held civil code section requires,before a notice of default may be filed,that a lender contact the borrower in person or by phone to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options to prevent foreclosure.the only remedy afforded by section is,however,a postponement of the foreclosure sale before it happens.mabry superior court,supra,at,d.
the first amended complaint did not seek postponement of the foreclosure sale and alleged the sale had been conducted.the third cause of action therefore did not state and can not as a matter of law state a claim for violation of civil code section.
in the fourth cause of action of the first amended complaint,lueras alleged bank of america committed fraud and led him to believe that his home would not be sold in may and that it wanted to help him maintain ownership of his home.the elements of fraud are the defendant made a false representation as to a past or existing material fact the defendant knew the representation was false at the time it was made in making the representation,the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation and the plaintiff suffered resulting damages.lazar superior court cal th,d.
the first amended complaint alleged bank of america made the following false representations 
bank of america represented it wanted to help plaintiffs maintain ownership of their home through the language of the forbearance a greement which states under the homesaver forbearance program,we are working with fannie mae,a government sponsored enterprise,to reduce your mortgage payment by up to for up to months while we work with you to find a solution.this is not a permanent payment reduction,but it will allow you to stay in your home as we work together to find a solution.
the forbearance agreement reinforced the representation that bank of america and fannie mae would work with lueras to find a long term solution on the second page where it stated the deferral period would continue until execution of an agreement with servicer for another resolution of my default 
bank of america led plaintiff to believe that defendants were going to work with him so he could stay in his home so long as he made the requested payments.
o n may,bank of america sent another letter stating it would contact lueras in days to explore alternatives to foreclosure.
bank of america concealed the fact that it was not going to identify a long term solution in order to save lueras s home from foreclosure.
the first amended complaint did not allege any misrepresentations attributed to fannie mae.
the first amended complaint alleged lueras was led to believe a solution to keep him in his home was being worked on and that his home would not be sold in may.the first amended complaint alleged lueras did the following in reliance on the alleged misrepresentations 
lueras continued to make the payments on the loan.
he took the time and t ook on the extra burden and expense of compiling and providing the information requested in which he had a right to privacy and he would not have spent his valuable money,time and efforts in attempting to modify his loan with bank of america prior to default,if he had known that he would not have had a genuine opportunity to modify.
these allegations do not allege detrimental reliance.continuing to make payments on the loan reduced under the forbearance agreement does not constitute detrimental reliance because lueras already had the obligation to make those payments.in auerbach great western bank th,d,the plaintiffs asserted that a bank promise to engage in good faith negotiations to modify a loan caused the plaintiffs to continue making payments on a note secured by undervalued property.the court rejected that theory because the plaintiffs had a contractual obligation to make payments on the note,notwithstanding the bank promise to renegotiate its terms.id.at,d.
time and effort spent assembling materials for an application to modify a loan is the sort of nominal damage subject to the maxim de minimis non curat lex,the law does not concern itself with trifles.black law dict.ed,see,the law disregards trifles merrill hurlburt cal,considering the amount involved in the action we can not say we ought to affirm the judgment upon the maxim de minimis,mcallister clement cal,nominal damages not recoverable under maxim de minimis non curat lex wolff prosser cal,maxim de minimis non curat lex applies to damages of harris time,d.the present action is de minimis in the extreme.
nevertheless,the exhibits attached to the first amended complaint including the forbearance agreement,the may,letter,and the may,letter demonstrate there is a reasonable possibility the defects in the fraud cause of action can be cured by amendment.in the may,letter,bank of america informed lueras any pending foreclosure sale would be on hold while he was being considered for other foreclosure avoidance programs.whitaker,a bank of america representative,told him the may letter was sent in error and he had been approved for a loan modification.in the may,letter,bank of america informed lueras it was reviewing his financial documents to determine whether he was eligible for a hamp loan modification.when lueras contacted bank of america about the may letter,whitaker told him the trustee sale,which had been rescheduled for may,would be reset,pending approval by fannie mae of his loan modification.despite the express representation in the may letter that no foreclosure sale would proceed,and whittaker oral representation that the sale would be reset,the foreclosure sale was conducted on may 
as explained above,bank of america argues the trustee sale conducted on may,was rescinded,and,therefore,lueras suffered no damages.even if we were to assume the trustee sale was rescinded,we could not say as a matter of law that lueras suffered no damages as a result of bank of america actions.
unfair and unlawful practices 
in the fifth cause of action of the first amended complaint,lueras alleged bank of america engaged in deceptive business practices in violation of california unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et.he alleged bank of america engaged in deceptive practices with respect to mortgage loan servicing,foreclosure of residential properties and related matters in violation of the ucl.
bank of america argues lueras failed to allege it engaged in any unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent practices.bank of america also argues the trial court was correct in concluding lueras lacked standing to sue under business and professions code section section.
the ucl permits civil recovery for any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising bus.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair competition acts or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent cel tech communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
by defining unfair competition to include any unlawful act or practice,the ucl permits violations of other laws to be treated as independently actionable as unfair competition.cel tech communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.a n unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.citation.citation.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d.an unfair business practice also means the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions.scripps clinic superior court th,d.a fraudulent practice under the ucl require s only a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived and can be shown even without allegations of actual deception,reasonable reliance and damage.daugherty american honda motor,th,d.
before addressing lueras specific allegation of unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent practices,we address the threshold issue whether lueras has alleged standing to assert a ucl claim.to have standing to sue under the ucl,a private plaintiff must allege he or she has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property.in kwikset superior court cal th,d,kwikset,the california supreme court held that to satisfy the standing requirement of section,a plaintiff must establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact,economic injury,and show that that economic injury was the result of,caused by the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the gravamen of the claim.a ucl claim will survive a demurrer based on standing if the plaintiff can plead general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct.kwikset,supra,at,d.
the kwikset court held a plaintiff can satisfy the economic injury prong of the standing requirement in innumerable ways but listed four injuries that would qualify under section the plaintiff surrendered more or acquired less in a transaction than the plaintiff otherwise would have the plaintiff suffered the diminishment of a present or future property interest the plaintiff was deprived of money or property to which the plaintiff had a cognizable claim or the plaintiff was required to enter into a transaction,costing money or property,that would otherwise have been unnecessary.kwikset,supra,cal th at,d.
bank of america argues lueras can not allege the threshold standing requirement because he had been in default for years before suing and his monthly payment under the forbearance agreement was less than his monthly payment under the note and deed of trust the first amended complaint failed to allege that lueras lost any money as a result of bank of america acts of alleged deceptive practices,except for costs incurred in preparing and assembling materials for his application for a loan modification.we have deemed such costs to be de minimis,and they are not sufficient to qualify as injury in fact under section.
but the allegation that lueras home was sold at a foreclosure sale is sufficient to satisfy the economic injury prong of the standing requirement of section.see jenkins jpmorgan chase bank,th,d.jenkins allegation of impending foreclosure and loss of home satisfies economic injury requirement.sale of a home through a foreclosure sale is certainly a deprivation of property to which a plaintiff has a cognizable claim.see kwikset,supra,cal th at,d.lueras must also satisfy the caused by prong of the section standing requirement,show plaintiff economic injury occurred as a result of the unfair competition.kwikset,supra,at,d.the first amended complaint did not allege any such causal connection ibid.between bank of america allegedly unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent conduct and lueras economic injury.
the question is whether lueras should be granted leave to amend to try to satisfy the caused by prong.we believe there is a reasonable possibility that lueras can cure the defect in the first amended complaint.as we explained in addressing the fraud cause of action,bank of america informed lueras any pending foreclosure sale would be on hold while he was being considered for other foreclosure avoidance programs.whitaker of bank of america told him the may,letter was sent in error and he had been approved for a loan modification.lueras was told the foreclosure sale was to be rescheduled pending fannie mae approval of his loan modification.those allegations suggest lueras can amend his ucl cause of action to allege bank of america misrepresentations caused him to lose his home through foreclosure.in addition,lueras might be able to allege bank of america did not work with him in good faith to evaluate and try to identify and implement a permanent solution,as a consequence of which he lost his home through foreclosure.
in jenkins,supra,th at pages,d,the plaintiff alleged the defendants unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practices caused her home to be subject to foreclosure.the court of appeal held the plaintiff failed to satisfy the caused by prong because she admitted in her complaint that she defaulted on her loan,thereby triggering the power of sale clause in the deed of trust that made her home subject to foreclosure.id.at,d.the court explained as the plaintiff home was subject to nonjudicial foreclosure because of the plaintiff default on her loan,which occurred before defendants alleged wrongful acts,the plaintiff can not assert the impending foreclosure of her home,her alleged economic injury was caused by defendants wrongful actions.thus,even if we assume the plaintiff third cause of action alleges facts indicating defendants actions violated at least one of the ucl three unfair competition prongs unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent,the plaintiff complaint can not show any of the alleged violations have a causal link to her economic injury.id.at,d.
this case is similar to jenkins in that lueras default on the loan,not any conduct on the part of bank of america,triggered foreclosure proceedings.jenkins is distinguishable,however,because,in this case,lueras might be able to allege that bank of america alleged misrepresentations about his loan modification and the status of the foreclosure sale,or bank of america failure to work with him in good faith to identify and to try to implement a permanent solution,caused him to lose his home through a foreclosure sale.
whether lueras alleged unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent practices 
allegations of ucl violations 
since,we conclude,lueras should be given leave to amend to allege standing,we address whether he has alleged in the first amended complaint unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent practice on the part of bank of america.lueras alleged bank of america violated the ucl in these nine ways 
refusing to offer a resolution of the default after leading lueras to believe that the homesaver agreement would lead to another agreement that would c ure the arrearages which they never disclosed in amount 
selling the home at foreclosure within days of receiving the written denial of modification in violation of the making home affordable guidelines.
failing to stop the foreclosure process when fannie mae and bank of america agreed to permanently modify lueras loan in may in violation of federal regulations that prohibit dual tracking.
failing to explore foreclosure alternatives with lueras prior to filing the notice of default in violation of civ il code and the homesaver plan guidelines 
inserting deceitful language in the forbearance plan using phrases such as homesaver long term solution and resolution of my default leading the public and lueras to believe that they were going to be offered some type of permanent solution so that they could save their home if they signed the agreement,supplied the information requested and made all of the payments on time.
failing to make a determination or identify a permanent solution so that the public like lueras could save their home s by the third month of the plan in violation of the homesaver guidelines quoted above in breach of industry standards set by united states code section.
falsely representing that lueras did not qualify for hamp modification when,in fact lueras did qualify for a hamp modification in breach of industry standards set by united states code section.
auctioning off the home for less than the amount owed,yet refusing to reduce the principal which would have resulted in a positive npv net present value in breach of industry standards set by united states code section.
representing in the may,letter by bank of america to lueras that once we have finished reviewing your information,we will contact you within days to let you know what other options are available to you and the next steps you need to take then selling the home within days at foreclosure auction without contacting lueras and providing other options in breach of industry standards set by united states code section.
sufficiency of the allegations of ucl violations 
numbers,and do not constitute unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent practices.as to numbers,and,the forbearance agreement did not require bank of america to offer lueras a loan modification or other alternative to foreclosure.we find nothing in the forbearance agreement or the homesaver forbearance program,which would mislead a borrower into believing they were going to be offered some type of permanent solution merely by signing the agreement and making the deferral period payments.bank of america august letter informed lueras the bank was working with fannie mae to reduce his mortgage payment by up to percent for up to months.the forbearance agreement explicitly stated that,at the end of the deferral period,bank of america could resume foreclosure.the forbearance agreement explicitly stated,i understand that the agreement is not a forgiveness of payments on my loan or a modification of the loan documents.boldface omitted.nothing in the forbearance agreement would mislead a borrower into believing bank of america would always determine or identify a permanent solution to save the borrower home.
although the forbearance agreement did not require bank of america to offer lueras a loan modification,we concluded above that the forbearance agreement did impose on bank of america the duty to act in good faith to evaluate and try to identify a permanent solution during the first three months of the forbearance period,and to implement an identified alternative by the end of the sixth month.in light of this interpretation of the forbearance agreement,lueras should be given leave to amend his ucl cause of action.
as to number failure to explore foreclosure alternatives we concluded above that lueras failed to state a cause of action for violation of civil code section.number selling lueras home for less than the amount owed does not state a ucl claim because lueras alleged in the breach of contract cause of action that bank of america sold his home for more than the amount of the indebtedness and failed to tender him the difference.the breach of contract allegations were incorporated into the ucl cause of action.
numbers,and do allege facts which,if true,would constitute fraudulent unfair practices.it is fraudulent or unfair for a lender to proceed with foreclosure after informing a borrower he or she has been approved for a loan modification,or telling the borrower he or she will be contacted about other options and the borrower home will not be foreclosed on in the meantime,as represented in the may letter.it is fraudulent or unfair for a lender to misrepresent the status or date of a foreclosure sale.in this case,lueras alleged he contacted bank of america about the may,letter,was informed he had already been approved for a loan modification,and was told the trustee sale,which had been rescheduled for may,would be reset pending approval by fannie mae of the loan modification.
bank of america argues that recent legislation known as the california homeowner bill of rights that prohibits the practice of dual tracking was not effective in and is not to be applied retroactively lueras argues the california homeowner bill of rights demonstrates that bank of america conduct,though not unlawful at the time,was unfair fraudulent.we do not address either argument because lueras alleged that bank of america engaged in conduct that amounted to fraudulent practices,independent of the california homeowner bill of rights.
quiet title 
in the sixth cause of action of the first amended complaint,lueras sought to quiet title to the property and alleged,t he claims of defendants are without any right whatever and such defendants have no right or interest in the subject property.a borrower may not,however,quiet title against a secured lender without first paying the outstanding debt on which the mortgage or deed of trust is based.miller provost th,d mortgagor of real property can not,without paying his debt,quiet his title against the mortgagee aguilar bocci d.borrower can not quiet title without discharging the debt.the cloud on title remains until the debt is paid.burns hiatt cal.
lueras does not challenge the validity of the underlying debt.he alleged he refinanced his home for in and he executed a deed of trust to secure the loan.instead,he argues tender of the indebtedness is not required to quiet title because making payments under the forbearance agreement constituted a tender of the debt,and tender would not have been required to halt or set aside a foreclosure sale.
as to the first argument,making the monthly payments required under the forbearance agreement would not constitute full payment of the outstanding loan.as to the second argument,full tender of the indebtedness must be made to set aside a foreclosure sale based on irregularities in the foreclosure procedure.lona citibank,th,d.full tender of the indebtedness is not required if the borrower attacks the validity of the underlying debt.id.at,d.lueras is not seeking to set aside the foreclosure sale,nor is he challenging the validity of the underlying debt.
in his supplemental brief,lueras argues pfeifer countrywide home loans,th,d supports his contention that tender of the indebtedness was unnecessary to maintain the quiet title action.in pfeifer,the court of appeal held that the borrowers stated a claim for wrongful foreclosure and declaratory and injunctive relief,based on allegations the lenders failed to comply with certain interview requirements imposed by the federal housing administration deed of trust before conducting an otherwise valid nonjudicial foreclosure.id.at,d.the interview and other servicing requirements imposed by federal regulations were conditions precedent to acceleration of the debt and foreclosure.ibid.the court of appeal concluded the borrowers were not required to tender the indebtedness before seeking to enjoin the foreclosure sale because to permit a foreclosure when the lender has not complied with the requirements that may have prevented any need for a foreclosure would defeat a salient purpose of the regulations.id.at,d.in addition,tender of the indebtedness is required only to set aside a completed sale,and is not required in an action to prevent a foreclosure sale.ibid.
pfeifer countrywide home loans,and the other tender cases are inapplicable here because lueras has not sued to set aside or prevent a foreclosure sale.in the sixth cause of action,he sought to quiet title to the property,which he can not do without paying the outstanding indebtedness.
disposition 
the judgment in favor of fannie mae is affirmed.the judgment as to the causes of action for violation of civil code section and to quiet title is affirmed.in all other respects,the judgment in favor of bank of america and recontrust is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant lueras leave to file an amended complaint.lueras shall recover costs incurred on appeal.
i concur in those portions of the majority opinion which conclude the trial court correctly sustained the demurrers to the first amended complaint,because lueras did not state any viable cause of action.i respectfully dissent from those portions of the majority opinion which conclude the trial court incorrectly denied leave to amend,because lueras did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility he can state any viable cause of action.therefore,the trial court did not abuse its discretion and the judgment should be affirmed in all respects.
introduction 
there are three core areas of disagreement between my views and the views expressed by my colleagues in the majority opinion.
first,the majority refuses to acknowledge what the parties themselves do not dispute there is no foreclosure upon which this wrongful foreclosure action can be based.lueras admitted the trustee sale was rescinded before the trustee deed was recorded,and lueras alleged he was never deprived of ownership or possession of his home.the trial court properly considered these facts when ruling on the demurrers and we are required to do the same when reviewing the propriety of those rulings.the consequence of the majority refusal to do so is akin to allowing a wrongful death action to proceed when the alleged victim did not die.
second,despite recognizing the rule that a residential lender does not owe any duty of care to a borrower,the majority stretches to create an exception,and concludes a residential lender does owe a duty of care to not make misrepresentations about the status of an application for a loan modification or about the date,time,or status of a foreclosure sale.there is no such exception.furthermore,the majority fails to analyze whether lueras pleaded or demonstrated a reasonable possibility he can plead facts sufficient to establish the elements of a negligent misrepresentation cause of action against bank of america.lueras did not and can not plead any such facts.
third,the majority concedes the breach of contract cause of action is hopelessly deficient,but asserts the provisions of fannie mae announcement must be read into the forbearance agreement to circumvent those deficiencies.the majority cites no case which has followed this approach or found a borrower has a private contractual right to sue a lender for money damages based upon alleged noncompliance with announcement.moreover,this approach violates basic principles of contract law and injects uncertainty into california residential lending.
lueras factual allegations 
the majority summarizes some of the factual allegations,and fails to note many of the glaring factual omissions in the verified first amended complaint.all of the factual allegations and omissions i find material are set out below.of necessity there is some repetition,but only to keep everything in proper context.
lueras owned the property property and occupied it as his primary residence at all relevant times,through and including the date on which the first amended complaint was filed.lueras did not allege he ever was deprived of ownership or possession of the property.
in march,lueras refinanced the property with a year adjustable rate loan loan originated by gateway business bank gateway.gateway,a potentially indispensible party,was not named as a defendant in the first amended complaint and is not a party to this appeal.
the loan was evidenced by a promissory note note and secured by a deed of trust deed of trust which encumbered the property.the deed of trust was attached to the first amended complaint.
lueras did not allege gateway subsequently retained or sold the note and the beneficial interest under the deed of trust.thus,the identity of the current lender under the note and deed of trust collectively loan documents is uncertain.
bank of america as successor to countrywide home loans servicing was the servicer of the loan.lueras did not allege bank of america was a party to the loan documents.
lueras did not allege fannie mae was a party to the loan documents.moreover,lueras did not allege the loan was owned or insured by fannie mae.
lueras regular monthly payment on the loan was.lueras has not made a full regular monthly payment on the loan since december.
in august,more than eight months after lueras stopped making regular monthly payments on the loan,bank of america offered him a forbearance agreement forbearance agreement and lueras accepted.
fannie mae is not a party to the forbearance agreement.
the forbearance agreement required lueras to make reduced monthly payments on the loan in the amount of during the deferral period.bank of america agreed to apply these reduced monthly payments to the delinquent full regular monthly payments on the loan.

discussion 
standard of review and lueras burden on appeal 
when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
to satisfy that burden on appeal,a plaintiff must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.citation.the plaintiff must clearly and specifically set forth the applicable substantive law citation and the legal basis for amendment,the elements of the cause of action and authority for it.further,the plaintiff must set forth factual allegations that sufficiently state all required elements of that cause of action.citations.rossberg bank of america th,d.
no authority commands or even suggests these pleading requirements do not apply unless the plaintiff has been given more than two bites at the apple.we are required to affirm the ruling if there is any ground on which the demurrer could have been properly sustained.scott jpmorgan chase bank,th,d.also,leave to amend should not be granted where an amendment would be futile.newell state farm general ins.th,d.it is axiomatic,the law neither does nor requires idle acts.
factual allegations,judicial notice and factual admissions 
we accept the factual allegations of the verified first amended complaint as true.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.serrano priest cal d.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.to that end,i take judicial notice,subd.d the trial court final minute order ruling on the demurrers expressly relied upon the fact that,plaintiff admits in the opposition that the foreclosure sale was rescinded.
we also take into account briefs and arguments,which are reliable indications of a party position on the facts as well as the law,and a reviewing court may use statements in them as admissions against the party.citations.witkin,california procedure ed.appeal.likewise,a n express concession or assertion in a brief is frequently treated as an admission of a legal or factual point,controlling in the disposition of the case.citations.
one court citing witkin held an admission in the opening brief was the equivalent of a concession,which,taken together with the failure to allege a necessary element,controls the disposition of the case.federer county of sacramento d.another court also citing witkin relied on concessions made by plaintiff counsel during oral argument to show there was no basis for a cause of action.derose carswell d,fn,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in ramona superior court th,fn,d.
in brandwein butler th,d the court affirmed an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,and expressly relied on the factual allegations and omissions in the complaint,together with factual admissions in the trial court and in appellant briefs.id.at,fn,d,citing,inter alia,fassberg construction housing authority of city of los angeles th,d oral statement by counsel in same action is binding judicial admission electric supplies distributing imperial hot mineral spa d.stipulations in brief constitute binding judicial admissions.
similarly,in setliff du pont de nemours th,d the court affirmed an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend and stated,plaintiff papers in opposition are reliable indications of his position on the facts and we may use these statements as admissions against him.citation.id.at,d.likewise,in rodas spiegel th,d,the court declared,we also may,and shall,take judicial notice of admissions in plaintiff opposition to the demurrer,subd.d.id.at,d.
in sum,we are not permitted to turn a blind eye to lueras admissions the trustee sale was rescinded before the trustee deed was recorded.these admissions are consistent with his verified affirmative allegations he was never deprived of ownership or possession of the property.these admissions were properly considered by the trial court when ruling on the demurrers,without any objection by lueras.we are required to do the same when reviewing the propriety of those rulings.
negligence and negligent misrepresentation 
the rule that a residential lender does not owe any duty of care to a borrower is well settled and summarized in the majority opinion.i would only add that all of the reasons why a residential lender owes no such duty to a borrower apply with even greater force to a servicer,even though courts are not always careful to differentiate between the duties of lenders and the duties of servicers.somera indymac fed.bank,fsb,wl.
applying the rule to the negligence claim,the majority recognizes bank of america did not owe lueras a duty to offer,consider,or approve a loan modification,or to explore and offer foreclosure alternatives,or to handle the loan in any other way so as to prevent foreclosure.i agree.these are all core functions well within the scope of the conventional role of a residential lender and the rule applies.
despite recognizing the rule,the majority stretches to create an exception,and concludes bank of america does owe a duty to a borrower to not make material misrepresentations about the status of an application for a loan modification or about the date,time,or status of a foreclosure sale.i disagree.there is no such exception.no duty is owed for purposes of negligent misrepresentation or negligence.aspiras wells fargo bank,th,d.
as is true of negligence,responsibility for negligent misrepresentation rests upon the existence of a legal duty owed by a defendant to an injured person.citation.the determination of whether a duty exists is primarily a question of law.citation.eddy sharp d.t he test for determining whether a financial institution owes a duty of care to a involves the balancing of various factors citations.nymark heart fed.savings loan d.
without balancing the various factors discussed in nymark,the majority discovers a duty which has never before been recognized.but there is no reasoned basis for making any distinction between these residential communications and other residential communications.communications about the status of a modification application or a trustee sale are also core functions well within the scope of the conventional role of a residential lender.hence,the rule applies equally to negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims in this situation.
furthermore,the rights and duties of lenders and borrowers regarding these communications are set forth in the loan documents and applicable law,including the federal truth in lending act et and the california statutory nonjudicial foreclosure statutes,through.it is inconsistent with these comprehensive and exhaustive statutory schemes to incorporate common law negligent misrepresentation claims in this context.gomes countrywide home loans,th,d residential capital cal western reconveyance th,d.
leaving aside the duty question,lueras did not request leave to plead a negligent misrepresentation cause of action.but even if he had,lueras also did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility he can plead the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact,without reasonable ground for believing it to be true,with intent to induce another reliance on the fact misrepresented,justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation,and resulting damage.citation.wells fargo bank,fsi,financial solutions,th,d.
lueras alleged both oral and written misrepresentations by bank of america about the status of the loan modification application and the trustee sale.
the alleged oral misrepresentations were all made by whitaker in early may and may be summarized as follows.first,whitaker told lueras the may and may letters had been sent in error.second,she told him the loan modification application had been approved by bank of america,subject to fannie mae approval.third,she told him the trustee sale would be reset,again pending fannie mae approval.
regarding the statements the may and letters had been sent in error,lueras did not allege and can not allege these statements were untrue or that whitaker had no reasonable ground for believing them to be true.obviously,his entire case is predicated upon his alleged reliance on the truth of these statements.
regarding the statement bank of america had approved the loan modification application,subject to fannie mae approval,again lueras did not allege this statement was untrue or whitaker had no reasonable ground for believing it to be true.besides,this statement is conditional,and he did not allege that condition was satisfied.regarding the statement the trustee sale would be reset,while lueras did allege this was untrue,he did not allege whitaker said the trustee sale had been reset.instead he alleged she said it would be reset.so this statement is really a prediction about a future event,not a misrepresentation about a past or existing fact.
lueras also did not allege any facts showing he justifiably relied on the statement the trustee sale would be reset.in particular,lueras did not allege he did or refrained from doing anything after this statement was made on may,and before the trustee sale occurred on may.all of the alleged actions or inactions took place well before this statement was made.
regarding all of these statements,lueras did not allege and can not allege any resulting damage.again the trustee sale was rescinded so lueras was never deprived of ownership or possession of the property.
regarding the alleged written misrepresentations in the may and letters,lueras can not allege he reasonably relied on the contents of those letters,and at the same time allege he relied on the statements that those letters had been sent in error.he can not have it both ways.but even if he could,again lueras did not allege and can not allege he suffered any resulting damage,because the trustee sale was rescinded.
in conclusion,lueras did not plead or demonstrate a reasonable possibility he can plead sufficient facts to establish the elements of a negligent misrepresentation cause of action against bank of america based upon communications concerning the status of the loan modification application or the trustee sale.hence,there is no basis for granting lueras leave to allege a negligent misrepresentation cause of action.
breach of contract 
lueras alleged bank of america breached the forbearance agreement by terminating the deferral period,and by failing to offer him a loan modification or some other resolution before commencing or resuming the foreclosure process.but lueras did not plead sufficient facts to establish the elements of this claim.
lueras did not plead any facts showing bank of america breached the forbearance agreement by terminating the deferral period actually,lueras did not plead any facts showing bank of america terminated the deferral period at all.on this point,i agree with the majority opinion.examining the first amended complaint as a whole reveals the parties intended the deferral period to terminate and it did terminate by its own terms no later than march.
lueras also did not plead any facts showing bank of america breached the forbearance agreement by failing to offer him a loan modification or some other resolution before commencing or resuming the foreclosure process.the forbearance agreement simply did not require bank of america to do or abstain from doing any of the things lueras complained of.thus,bank of america did not breach the forbearance agreement by failing to offer lueras a loan modification or some other resolution before commencing or resuming the foreclosure process.
recognizing the inevitability of this conclusion,the majority asserts the provisions of fannie mae announcement must be read into the forbearance agreement to circumvent these deficiencies.the majority has not cited any case which has followed this approach or found a borrower has a private
