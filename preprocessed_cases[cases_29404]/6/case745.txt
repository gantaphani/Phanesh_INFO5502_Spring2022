linda green appeals the grant of summary judgment against her claims of a racially hostile work environment,discriminatory discharge,and retaliation under title vii and.green also appeals the grant of summary judgment against her claim under the minnesota whistleblower act,for her reporting of discrimination at franklin national bank.we affirm.
background 
green is an female who was employed by franklin national bank.she worked as a teller from march until her termination on august.because we are hearing this case as the result of a grant of summary judgment,we view the facts in the light most favorable to green.the factual background of green claims is complicated.as a result,we first detail the allegations she made as to her work environment.then,we turn to the specifics of her complaints to the employer and the bank responses to those complaints.next,we discuss the facts surrounding green termination.lastly,we describe other evidence related to green claim.
work environment 
green started working for franklin national bank at its blaisdell avenue location in minneapolis,minnesota,and remained there for about one month.she was transferred to the washington avenue location after complaining that a teller at the blaisdell branch called her stupid.
beginning in may,green worked with jared howard,a teller at the washington avenue location.howard is a caucasian male.according to green deposition,howard began harassing her and using racial slurs to describe her.specifically,howard called green monkey,black monkey,and chimpanzee.in june,howard told green that she should wear dreadlocks.the racially insensitive conduct continued until august.
green asked howard to stop using racial slurs,but he persisted and engaged in other demeaning conduct toward her.green told howard that she felt that the primate rhetoric was similar to saying nigger,and that the phrase porch monkeys was historically used to discriminate against.on several occasions,green made written notes of the dates of these incidents and her requests for howard to stop.those specific instances are detailed below,along with other related issues raised by green.
during june,green alleges that beth markoe,franklin national bank vice president of operations,and tammy koop,a bank officer,acted unprofessionally toward green.specifically,green alleges that markoe and koop were blaming many of howard mistakes on green.further,green believes that markoe and koop were unprofessional in their communications with her.
on july,green felt she was treated rudely by kyle kray a commercial loan officer.kray needed a cashier check printed immediately and was rude to green when she said she would get to it as soon as possible.according to green,kray was friendly toward howard,but aggressive and demanding with green.
on july,howard told green,i want to eat your liver and asked if he could eat her liver.howard told green that he had eaten liver before,but found that it tasted sour.he then described the movie silence of the lambs to green.on other occasions,howard made other intimidating remarks to green.he told her that he gets even with people.
on august,while howard and green were closing the vault late in the afternoon,howard again called green a monkey and chimpanzee.on august,howard sent an email to green that said just wanted to let you know you got a funny shaped head.green felt that the comment about her head was race related.
green complaints and franklin national bank responses 
at dates that are not specified in the record,green reported howard racial harassment to kim reep,her supervisor.reep is a woman of and caucasian heritage.reep told green that reep could not do anything for green and that green should report the wrongful conduct to wayne erdman,a vice president of franklin national bank.green did not make any complaints about howard racial comments during the months of may and june.
however,when reep was on vacation in june,green made complaints about her work environment to the president and ceo of franklin national bank,dorothy bridges.the substance of these complaints concerned the criticism from markoe and koop,and not the harassment by howard.bridges told green that the two of them would talk with reep concerning green complaints about markoe and koop.no followup meeting between bridges,green,and reep took place.
on june,after reep returned from vacation,green spoke with her about green conflicts with markoe.green felt that markoe was treating her differently than howard.reep met with markoe and green to discuss the conflict between them.according to reep,green attempted to explain her concerns to markoe,but markoe did not listen.
on july,green reported the incident with kray to reep.reep spoke with erdman several times about kray,but erdman never told reep whether he had spoken with kray.
also on july,green complained about howard racial harassment to erdmam.she told erdman that howard had called her monkey.erdman said he would speak to howard about it however,according to green,erdman never spoke with howard about green complaint.
on july,markoe held a meeting with green and reep to discuss concerns about green work performance.the meeting did not mention any of green complaints about her work environment.markoe cited several incidents where she had requested green to do things for her,but green did not do them immediately.
according to markoe,reep spoke with howard about the racial slurs for the first time on august.this was howard first warning from a supervisor about racially insensitive conduct.reep also spoke with vice president erdman.at that time,erdman said he had already spoken with green about the complaints.he did not indicate to reep what was being done to resolve the problems.
on august,the day after the incident at the vault when howard told green she was a chimpanzee and a monkey,green told reep about what howard had said.green also left a voicemail with bridges about howard statements.green told reep that green needed to speak with bridges,but reep said that bridges would not want to hear from her.reep proposed that green and reep try to work out the situation.green ignored reep warnings and went to speak with bridges.she put her complaints about howard august comments in writing.bridges told green to take the written complaint to her supervisor and make a formal complaint.reep gave howard a second warning about racially insensitive language.
according to bridges,the company policy on sexual harassment also applied to racial harassment.the policy required that after an employee notified his or her direct supervisor of harassment,a supervisor would investigate the complaint.the supervisor was also responsible for attempting to resolve the complaint.there was no requirement to report harassment to the president of the bank.franklin national bank policy required that the investigation proceed from the perspective of a reasonable victim of harassment and not the viewpoint of an alleged harasser.upon beginning her employment,green signed a form acknowledging that she understood franklin national bank harassment policy.bridges felt that it was not her duty to pursue the complaint.the proper course,in her view,was to wait for green to make a formal complaint with reep.
green again met with reep and gave her two written complaints detailing howard august use of the word monkey and his july statements about wanting to eat her liver.reep told howard about the complaint and told him that if something like that happened again,he would be fired.
when green received the funny shaped head email,she forwarded it to reep.reep brought the email to markoe and erdman.after meeting,they decided to terminate howard.bridges was not part of the process to terminate howard.
green termination 
on august,green spoke with reep about taking classes the following week.these classes were for another job that green wanted to do on her free weekends.the classes were scheduled on monday,tuesday,and wednesday.reep arranged for a teller from the blaisdell location,shelly,to cover for green while she attended classes.according to reep,green time missed was all set in terms of coverage.reep told erdman and another officer at the bank about the coverage.erdman agreed to the coverage arrangement so that green could attend classes.in his deposition,erdman admitted that other employees were allowed to attend classes during work hours.
on august,reep gave her notice to erdman.erdman told her that he accepted the resignation to be effective immediately.the vault was audited before reep was allowed to leave the bank.reep stated that this made her feel like a criminal.reep generally felt that she was treated unprofessionally when she offered her resignation.green noted that lynn miller,a caucasian employee,was not been treated the same when she gave her notice.
green worked at the bank on august.she attempted to confirm with erdman that she had permission to take her classes the following week.erdman told her to go to her class on monday and call him during that day break in her classes.
on august,green went to her class and called erdman during her break.he told her that she would be needed at the bank the next day,august.green came to the bank later on august and began work at.she worked two hours before she found time to talk with erdman.erdman again told green that she was needed at work on august and that she should not go to her class.green told erdman that she would be at work by noon and that miller could cover for her.she told erdman that she could not reschedule her class.green told erdman that reep had made coverage arrangements with a teller at the blaisdell location.erdman said he needed green there and that the coverage arrangement was unacceptable.he also refused the suggestion that miller cover for green.erdman offered to pay for the cost of green classes.however,green informed erdman that the classes were free.
it became apparent to erdman that green was upset by their conversation.erdman told green to turn off her computer and put her drawer away.he told her that he was letting her go miller,markoe,and koop would cover green teller duties after she was gone.
markoe prepared a series of memos related to green performance issues.green alleges that these memos only surfaced after her firing and that she suspects they were prepared after the fact.the memos stated that green was rude to customers,staff,and markoe.the memos also detailed some problems green was having with lock box processing.green believes the memos were prepared at a later date because none of the issues therein were discussed in her august meeting with markoe.reep also stated that she had never seen the memos before her deposition related to this case.reep said that she was unaware of any of the underlying issues described in the markoe memos.reep further noted that the markoe memos were unusual because it was generally reep job to evaluate the performance of tellers.
franklin national bank did have a regular performance review policy.normally,an employee would receive a performance review and an individual improvement plan after ninety days with the bank.reep stated that green performance was okay when reep wrote the performance review.there is neither a record of the performance review nor individual improvement plan.neither document was given to green during discovery.franklin national bank does not have an explanation for why the performance review and individual improvement plan are missing from green file.
d.other related facts 
green also describes other incidents at franklin national bank that she believes were racially motivated.she alleges that erdman told her not to park her car in front of the bank and told her to move it.erdman did not tell other workers,including miller,a caucasian customer service representative,to move their cars.green asked miller if erdman had ever asked miller to move her car,and miller said she had not been told to do so.however,erdman stated that he does remember telling miller to move her car on some occasions.
green also alleges that markoe treated minorities at the bank differently from.green says that markoe treated lataya pedigrew,an bookkeeper,poorly.she says that pedigrew was violently ill at work,but markoe would not allow her to go home.
in addition,markoe had several conflicts with reep.reep felt that markoe was taking over her responsibilities to supervise the tellers.at some later date,markoe was actually assigned to supervise reep,but the intrusions into her work areas preceded that formal assignment.markoe also told reep that she would have expected reep son to have blue eyes like his father.when reep told her that her son did in fact have brown eyes,markoe asked,does that mean she is full of shit like you markoe made other comments about reep mixed race children.reep told green that markoe said so you have poo poo kids too.
ii.standard of review 
we review an order of summary judgment de novo.pope esa,cir.in doing so,we view all evidence in a light most favorable to the party.id.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.hostile work environment 
the district court found that green did not prove that the harassment at her workplace was severe and pervasive enough to be actionable.green argues that the district court reasoning is flawed because it failed to properly apply the totality of circumstances analysis outlined in harris forklift systems,d.
to establish a claim of hostile work environment,a plaintiff must show he or she belonged to a protected group he or she was subjected to unwelcome harassment the harassment was based upon race the harassment affected a term,condition,or privilege of his or her employment and the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take proper remedial action.ross douglas county,cir.the underlying wrongful conduct must be sufficient to create a hostile environment,both as it would be viewed objectively by a reasonable person and as it was actually viewed subjectively by the victim.howard burns,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim because the court found that the harassment was not severe or pervasive enough to be actionable and the employer took legally sufficient remedial action.we disagree with the district court that the harassment was not severe or pervasive,but agree that the employer response was adequate to grant summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim.
green and the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc argue that the alleged conduct at issue in this matter was so severe and pervasive that it affected a material condition of employment.unquestionably,a working environment dominated by racial slurs constitutes a violation of title vii.jackson flint ink.am,cir quoting johnson bunny bread,cir,mod.on reh g on other grounds,cir.we also consider physical threats in conjunction with racial harassment in determining whether a hostile work environment exists.harris,at.however,if the comments are s poradic or casual,they are unlikely to establish a hostile work environment claim.carter chrysler,cir.frequency of harassment is a factor,but even infrequent conduct can be severe enough to be actionable.see bowen.dep t of soc,cir.
in the present matter,green allegations about howard statements to her are sufficient to be actionable.his comments were frequent and directed at green.while green did not make a handwritten notation of all the times howard called green a monkey,she created a record of several instances.
green had told howard that she thought the term monkey was roughly equivalent to nigger.other courts have agreed with green assessment of calling monkeys.white bfi waste servs.llc,cir.to suggest that a human being physical appearance is essentially a caricature of a jungle beast goes far beyond the mere unflattering it is degrading and humiliating in the extreme.id.the use of the term monkey and other similar words have been part of actionable racial harassment claims across the country.see jeffries,cir plaintiff was called a monkey webb worldwide flight,cir plaintiff was called a monkey spriggs diamond auto glass,cir plaintiff was called monkey and dumb monkey daniels pipefitters ass local union,cir plaintiffs were called porch monkeys and baboons.primate rhetoric has been used to intimidate and monkey imagery has been significant in racial harassment in other contexts as well.morgan mcdonough,cir in a school desegregation case,caucasian students harassed students by chanting assassinate the nigger apes.
in all,there are eight alleged instances of howard using racially insensitive terms toward green in a time frame.we have found just a few incidents in a longer time span to be sufficient for a hostile work environment claim.see reedy quebecor printing eagle,cir five incidents of harassment within seven months was actionable.
howard comments about wanting to eat green liver are also noteworthy.while the comments were not in themselves obviously racially motivated,they do constitute the sort of physical threats that are significant in cases like this one.howard also told green he liked to get even with people who wronged him.howard facilitated an atmosphere of intimidation that accentuated the effect of his racial slurs directed at green.
taking all inferences in the light most favorable to green,we find sufficient severity and pervasiveness of harassment for green claim to be actionable.because we find howard comments alone were sufficient to form a hostile work environment,we do not discuss the other factual claims of harassment made by green.
however,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim because green has failed to show that franklin national bank did not take the proper remedial action.title vii does not necessarily require that an employer fire a harasser.davis mack,cir.nonetheless,franklin national bank did fire howard to end the harassment against green.
green made several informal complaints about her harassment in the time leading up to early august.she also had meetings with the ceo of the bank and other supervisory employees where she complained about harassment at the bank.she alleges that she told erdman on july about the allegations of racial harassment.assuming that claim is true,it still was less than one month later that franklin national bank terminated howard.further,as green waited until early august to make a formal complaint,it is disingenuous for her to argue that the bank should have acted sooner to dismiss howard the bank employees may not have acted in ideal manner in this case,but the remedial actions of franklin national bank were sufficient.
the actions by franklin national bank promptly followed the formal complaint.the firing of the harasser in a hostile work environment case can effectively bar a plaintiff claim.see zirpel toshiba am.info,cir.green argues that franklin national bank did not fire howard promptly enough.however,the cases that green cites to support her claim involved situations where the employer waited much longer than one month to terminate the employee.therefore,we conclude that the grant of summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim as to howard harassment was proper because franklin national bank took prompt remedial action.
as to the other alleged harassment,it is not clear that green ever reported it to anyone or that it was racially motivated.green conflict with markoe does not have any of the traditional marks of racial harassment.it may have been unprofessional,but there is no link to racial animus.similarly,there is nothing in the record to support that green problems with kray were the result of racial differences.further,the other allegations were never reported as part of the bank internal procedures.we would be hard pressed to hold the bank could be liable for conduct that was never reported.
iv.discriminatory discharge 
green argues that she was terminated because of her race.to prove a claim of discriminatory discharge,green must show she was a member of a protected class she was qualified for the position she suffered an adverse employment action and there is evidence that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.see rodgers bank,cir.
the district court and both parties agree that green has met her burden as to the first three elements of a discriminatory discharge claim.however,the district court found that green did not show any evidence that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.we agree.
we have held that for an employee to prove a discriminatory discharge claim,he or she must show that similarly situated employees were involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and were disciplined in different ways.id.at quoting wheeler aventis,cir.green argues that the district court did not properly apply the rodgers test.however,we find no error in the district court analysis on this point.
green argues that she was replaced in her duties by miller,a caucasian female.she further alleges that she was denied the same parking privileges as miller.also,green argues that the conduct of kray and markoe was racially motivated because they were both friendlier with howard.
as to miller replacing green,there is no evidence to support this claim.it is green burden to present evidence sufficiently supporting disputed material facts that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in his or her favor.jackson arkansas dep t of,cir quoting gregory city of rogers,cir.green has offered no evidence to prove that miller replaced her.while miller,along with other bank employees,did replace green on an ad hoc basis,there is no evidence that she was the permanent replacement for green position.as a result,green has not met her minimal prima facie burden on this point.
as to green other allegations regarding differential treatment,she has not connected them in any way to her discharge.a plaintiff must show some causal link between the differential treatment and her adverse employment action.in this case,none of the employees who allegedly treated green differently had any role in her firing without that connection,the claims of differential treatment can not support an inference of discriminatory intent.see breeding arthur gallagher and,cir.
because green has not established a prima facie case for discriminatory discharge,we need not discuss pretextual motives for this claim.instead,we address the issue of pretext below,in the discussion of retaliatory discharge.
retaliation 
title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee for engaging in protected action such as making a racial harassment complaint.a.to prove a retaliation claim,a plaintiff must show that he or she engaged in statutorily protected activity an adverse employment action was taken against him or her and a causal connection exists between the two events.gilooly.dep t of health senior,cir citing rheineck hutchinson,cir a plaintiff need not establish the conduct which he or she opposed was in fact discriminatory but rather must demonstrate a good faith,reasonable belief that the underlying conduct violated the law.foster time warner entm t,cir internal citations omitted.
the defense can rebut a retaliation claim by showing a non retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.rheineck,at.if the defendant can show a legitimate reason,the plaintiff must show that the given reason was only a pretext for discrimination.gilooly,at.
in the present matter,the district court concluded that green failed to establish a prima facie retaliation claim.specifically,the district court found that green did not engage in protected activity and that green did not show a causal connection between her termination and a retaliatory motive.we disagree that green had not engaged in protected activity,but nonetheless affirm the judgment of the district court concerning the retaliation claim.
green told her immediate supervisor,reep,about howard alleged racial harassment.she also alleges that she later told erdman about instances of racial harassment.in august,she told the ceo of the bank,bridges,about the instances of racial harassment.after the meeting with the ceo,she filed a forma
