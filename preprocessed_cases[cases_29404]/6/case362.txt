in connection with a loan secured by a deed of trust on her house,renee mccray commenced this action for damages against the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac wells fargo bank,and well fargo home mortgage collectively,wells fargo samuel white,the white firm john driscoll,iii,robert frazier,jana gantt,laura harris,kimberly lane bitt,and deena reynolds collectively,substitute trustees and john does,alleging that,in the administration of and collection efforts on the loan,the defendants violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et the truth in lending act tila,id.et,and the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et.the allegations center primarily on the defendants alleged failure to provide mccray with notices and requested information as purportedly required by these statutes.
on the defendants motions,the district court dismissed mccray fdcpa and tila claims and,following discovery,granted wells fargo motion for summary judgment on her respa claim.
on appeal,mccray contends that the district court erred in concluding that the white firm and the substitute trustees,who were members of that firm,were not debt collectors,as that term is used in the fdcpa that the court erred in concluding that mccray failed to allege a cause of action under tila when she alleged that freddie mac,as the new owner of her loan,failed to provide her timely notice of the purchase and that the court erred in concluding that wells fargo,as servicer of the loan,was not required to provide mccray with notice when the deed of trust was assigned to it.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that mccray adequately alleged that the white firm and the substitute trustees were debt collectors,as that term is used in the fdcpa.accordingly,we reverse the order of dismissal of her fdcpa claims against them and remand for further proceedings,without suggesting whether or not those defendants violated the fdcpa.as to the tila claims,we affirm.
in october,mccray borrowed from american home mortgage corporation to refinance her house,giving american home a note and a deed of trust on her home in baltimore city,maryland,to secure repayment of the note.at some point after mccray executed the loan documents,american home sold the loan to freddie mac,and wells fargo was retained to service the loan.
for reasons not clear from the record,after making payments on her mortgage for more than five years,mccray disputed a monthly billing statement in june and sent wells fargo a written request for information about the fees and costs that it was charging and how it was maintaining the escrow account on the loan.wells fargo allegedly failed to respond or responded inadequately to her request and her inquiries.
again for reasons not clear from the record,mccray stopped making payments on her mortgage after making the april payment and thereby went into default,and wells fargo retained the white firm to pursue foreclosure.by letter dated september,the white firm informed mccray that the firm had been instructed to initiate foreclosure proceedings to foreclose on the mortgage on her property.the letter concluded with the statements this is an attempt to collect a debt.this is a communication from a debt collector.any information obtained will be used for that purpose.capitalization and emphasis modified.a few days later,the white firm sent mccray a more detailed notice of intent to foreclose,in which the firm advised mccray that her loan payments were currently days past due and that the amount required to cure default was.the notice also advised mccray of her various options.
thereafter,several members of the white firm were substituted as trustees on the deed of trust to facilitate foreclosure,and in february,the substitute trustees filed an order to docket a foreclosure action in the circuit court for baltimore city,which mccray has resisted.that proceeding is still pending.
shortly after the substitute trustees commenced the foreclosure proceeding in state court,mccray commenced this action for damages,challenging the amount of her debt and the manner in which the defendants administered the loan.more particularly,she alleged that the defendants continu ed to collect on an alleged debt without proper validation that the defendants did not respond to written requests for information and requests in a timely manner that the defendants refused to provide her with all the information that she requested that she was never given notice of the assignment of her deed of trust to wells fargo for purposes of servicing the loan and that she never received notice of the alleged sale of the loan to freddie mac,all with the consequence that the defendants attempted to collect an alleged debt under false,deceptive,and misleading means and stated an inaccurate character,amount and status of said debt.
wells fargo and freddie mac filed a motion to dismiss mccray complaint or,in the alternative,a motion for summary judgment,and the white firm and the substitute trustees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motions to dismiss mccray fdcpa and tila claims and,with respect to her respa claim,granted summary judgment.
in dismissing mccray fdcpa claim against the white firm and the substitute trustees,the district court concluded that mccray had failed to allege sufficiently that they were debt collectors under the fdcpa.the court distinguished these defendants role in initiating foreclosure proceedings from a role focused on collecting the debt,explaining 
even when a communication includes,this is an attempt to collect a debt,it is not an attempt to collect a debt unless there is an express demand for payment and other specific information about the debt,including the amount of the debt,the creditor to whom the debt is owed,the procedure for validating the debt,and to whom the debt should be paid.blagogee equity trustees,llc,wl,at.july.
applying blagogee to the alleged facts,the court concluded that mccray had failed to allege any facts indicating that the white firm and the substitute trustees were engaged in any attempt to collect her debt.
in dismissing mccray fdcpa claim against wells fargo and freddie mac,the district court concluded that those defendants were not subject to liability under the fdcpa because they were creditors,not debt collectors.
in dismissing mccray tila claim against freddie mac for failing to provide notice that it had purchased her loan,in violation of g,the court noted that the cause of action was not created by congress until,and the complaint,which described a loan and its sale to freddie mac on an unspecified date,failed to allege that the sale to freddie mac occurred after.in addition,the court noted that,while mccray was notified in october that freddie mac was the owner of her loan,she failed to bring her tila claim until may,beyond tila statute of limitations.
in dismissing her tila claim against wells fargo for failing to provide notice that the deed of trust had been assigned to it,the court explained that because wells fargo received only a beneficial interest as necessary to service the loan and not legal title,the assignment did not implicate the notification requirement in g.
after discovery on the remaining respa claim against wells fargo,the district court granted wells fargo motion for summary judgment.
from the district court final judgment dated march,mccray filed this appeal,presenting three distinct issues,which we now address.
mccray contends first that the district court erred in concluding that her complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to establish that the white firm and the substitute trustees were debt collectors subject to the fdcpa regulation.she maintains that the complaint sufficiently alleged these defendants debt collection role when it alleged that the firm is a debt collection law firm that employed the substitute trustees,and that the firm sent her a notice of intent to foreclose with the statement,this is an attempt to collect a debt,before initiating a foreclosure proceeding in the name of the substitute trustees and on behalf of wells fargo and freddie mac.she argues that these facts were sufficient to demonstrate that the white firm and the substitute trustees regularly collect ed or attempt ed to collect debts,and use d the mail to send her a letter to attempt to collect a debt,owed or due another,which qualified those defendants as debt collectors under the fdcpa.
the white firm and the substitute trustees contend that the district court properly concluded that mccray complaint failed to allege their status as debt collectors because mccray failed to plead any facts indicating that they had made any demands for payment,or that they in any way communicated deadlines and penalties for mccray failure to make any payment.emphasis added.they argue,all of the pled actions occurred in connection with the enforcement of security interests in real property,rendering them fundamentally distinct from a debt collection activity covered under the fdcpa.they explain that a foreclosure action in maryland is not designed to obtain payment on an underlying debt,but rather serves the more limited role of terminat ing the ownership interests of the mortgagor in the property and foreclos ing her right of redemption by the trustee s sale,so that the property can then be transferred free and clear of the mortgagor interest by the secured party.they contend,therefore,that up to the point when the actual collection of money is sought,there has been no debt collection activity undertaken.they also contend that their activity was only incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation and therefore excluded from regulation by an exception contained in the fdcpa definition of debt collector.
the question thus presented is whether the white firm and the substitute trustees,who regularly pursue foreclosure on behalf of creditors,were acting as debt collectors,as that term is defined by,when they pursued foreclosure against mccray after she defaulted on her loan.
the fdcpa defines the term debt collector to include generally any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.emphasis added.the definition excludes any person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity is incidental to a bona fide fiduciary obligation.id.f i.
the fdcpa definition of debt collector,however,does not include any requirement that a debt collector be engaged in an activity by which it makes a demand for payment,as the white firm and the substitute trustees claim.they argue that the notice letters and papers they used to initiate foreclosure proceedings were somehow to be distinguished from letters amounting to actual debt collection efforts,maintaining that foreclosure papers are not an attempt to collect a debt unless,as the district court explained,they contain an express demand for payment or specific information about her debt.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as we have previously explained,however,nothing in the language of the fdcpa requires that a debt collector misrepresentation or other violative actions be made as part of an express demand for payment or even as part of an action designed to induce the debtor to pay.powell palisades acquisition xvi,llc,cir.second emphasis added.to the contrary,we concluded that,to be actionable under the fdcpa,a debt collector needs only to have used a prohibited practice in connection with the collection of any debt or in an attempt to collect any debt.id.at see also sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir.wilson draper goldberg,cir.
in powell,we held that a law firm filing of an assignment of judgment in a debt collection action qualified as a debt collection activity that triggered the protections of the fdcpa.at.similarly,in sayyed,we held that a motion for summary judgment filed in a debt collection action was subject to the provisions of the fdcpa.at.and in wilson,we held that a law firm that provided notice that it was preparing foreclosure papers and that thereafter initiated foreclosure proceedings could be a debt collector as defined by the fdcpa.at.indeed,wilson directly controls this case.
in wilson,a lender had retained a law firm and one of its attorneys to foreclose on the plaintiff property due to her alleged failure to make mortgage payments.at.the law firm and attorney wrote to the plaintiff to announce that she was in default on her loan and that they were preparing foreclosure papers.id.they also sent her a validation of debt notice pursuant to the fdcpa,which gave specific information concerning the amount of debt,the identity of the creditor,and the procedures for validating the debt.id.at.we concluded that the law firm and the attorney were debt collectors under the fdcpa,holding that defendants foreclosure action was an attempt to collect a debt.id.at.
particularly relevant to the defendants arguments here,in wilson we explicitly rejected the argument that foreclosure by a trustee under a deed of trust is not the enforcement of an obligation to pay money or a debt,but is merely a termination of the debtor equity of redemption relating to the debtor property.at.we explained that the plaintiff debt remained a debt even after foreclosure proceedings commenced and that defendants actions surrounding the foreclosure proceeding were attempts to collect that debt.id.we also noted the consequence if that were not so 
defendants argument,if accepted,would create an enormous loophole in the act immunizing any debt from coverage if that debt happened to be secured by a real property interest and foreclosure proceedings were used to collect the debt.we see no reason to make an exception to the act when the debt collector uses foreclosure instead of other methods.
it is clear from the complaint in this case that the whole reason that the white firm and its members were retained by wells fargo was to attempt,through the process of foreclosure,to collect on the loan in default.mccray complaint alleged that the white firm is a debt collection law firm that mailed her a notice of intent to foreclose,which explicitly stated that it was attempting to collect on her debt,and that then filed a foreclosure action against her property.while her complaint referred to and described in part the notice of intent to foreclose,the defendants included a full copy of an october,notice as an attachment to their motion to dismiss.that notice provided 
you have missed one or more payments on your mortgage loan or you are otherwise in default.if you do not bring the loan current,otherwise cure the default,or reach an agreement with your mortgage company to avoid foreclosure such as a loan modification,repayment plan,or other alternative to foreclosure,a foreclosure action may be filed in court as early as days from the date of this notice.
emphasis added.the notice also included specific loan information,such as the name of the lender,the date of default,and the total amount required to cure the default.finally,the notice included a letter detailing loan mitigation programs,which ended with the statement,this communication is an attempt to collect a debt.
these facts,construed in the light most favorable to mccray on a motion to dismiss under rule b,indeed show that the white firm and its members were seeking repayment of a debt,attempting to collect on a debt.see.they stated in their notice to mccray that they were pursuing foreclosure because mccray had missed one or more payments.they noted that if mccray did not bring the loan current such as by repayment,a foreclosure action may be filed in court.in addition,they provided mccray with the nature of default and the amount necessary to cure the default,concluding that the communication was an attempt to collect a debt.thus,all of the defendants activities were taken in connection with the collection of a debt or in an attempt to collect a debt.
