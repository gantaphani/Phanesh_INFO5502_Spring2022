background.
in,northwest national bank was a distressed bank operating in gravette,arkansas,under a memorandum of understanding with the occ.sinclair filed a application with the occ,stating his intent to purchase the bank and submitting a business plan in which the bank would purchase large pools of consumer loans to borrowers from stevens financial group,a company formerly owned by sinclair.the occ approved the change of ownership provided the bank would maintain enhanced capital ratios.in march,sinclair agreed to that condition,purchased the bank for million,changed the bank name to snb,and contributed an additional million to the bank capital.the district deputy comptroller primarily responsible for oversight of snb immediately received a letter from the fdic criticizing the occ for approving the change in ownership without considering the fdic negative comments regarding sinclair business plan.thus began a contentious regulatory relationship during which,the amended complaint alleges,occ officials took the following actions against snb 
in april,occ began a persistent series of directives and criticisms,each of increasing severity,none of which was based on a comprehensive examination of the actual loan files.a may occ letter alleged that the bulk loans purchased by snb violated the legal lending limit.
on june,the occ issued a safety and soundness notice of deficiency criticizing snb management and monitoring of its loans and containing numerous contrived and specious allegations.the statute authorizes the occ to commence proceedings if in the opinion of the agency,a national bank is engaging or has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice.b.the comptroller regulations authorize the occ to issue a notice of deficiency to request a compliance plan.see b 
in september,occ officials demanded that snb limit minority and loans to percent of the bank capital.occ threatened to issue a safety and soundness order if snb did not comply.because this patently punitive demand would leave snb unable to implement its business plan,snb sued the occ in the united states court of federal claims for breach of an alleged contract defining the capital requirements occ would impose.snb also sued various occ officials in the district of columbia district court,asserting the constitutional violations alleged in this lawsuit and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the threatened regulatory action 
the occ conducted two lengthy examinations of snb in late and early that totally paralyzed snb activities by virtue of the examiners constant and deliberate interference.the national bank act authorizes the comptroller to appoint examiners who shall examine every national bank as often as the comptroller shall deem necessary.
in december,the occ concluded that snb proposed compliance plan was inadequate and issued a notice of intent to issue a safety and soundness order,a regulatory action authorized by a.in response,snb submitted another compliance plan.in march,the occ criticized that plan and imposed restrictions on lending that made it impossible for snb to carry out the business plan that the occ had expressly approved just one year earlier.
in april,the occ issued a cease and desist consent order.when snb refused to consent,the agency issued a notice of charges on june,as authorized by b.snb answered the charges,and an administrative law judge set a discovery schedule.
in early august,the occ reclassified snb loan portfolio,declared snb critically undercapitalized,and issued a prompt corrective action directive requiring snb to submit a capital restoration plan and take other corrective actions,a directive authorized by statute,see e i,and by the comptroller regulations,which provide for a prompt administrative appeal,see a.snb filed a capital restoration plan and an administrative appeal.in addition,the chapter trustee for stevens financial group submitted a application to the occ,seeking to purchase snb from sinclair for million.when the occ denied snb request for a hearing and more time to respond,snb and sinclair filed their initial petition for review of agency action and complaint in the district court.after a telephonic hearing the next day,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order.
in early september,the occ declared snb insolvent,appointed the fdic as snb statutory receiver,and terminated the pending administrative proceeding as moot.see,c a ii.the district court declined to enjoin the receivership,the fdic sold snb assets to another bank,and sinclair alleges he lost the ability to recover his investment in snb.
after setting forth the dispute in great detail,the amended complaint asserts the following compensatory and punitive damages claims on behalf of sinclair personally and as snb assignee 
fifth amendment equal protection and procedural and substantive due process claims under bivens six unknown named agents of the fed.bureau of narcotics,d,alleging that the occ officials took the above regulatory actions for retaliatory and vindictive purposes and to discriminate against minority borrowers.
first amendment bivens claims alleging that,beginning in december,all the occ regulatory actions were taken in retaliation for snb exercise of its first amendment right to file the two lawsuits snb filed that fall.
claims of race discrimination under and.in support of these claims,the amended complaint alleges that various occ officials made statements over the course of the dispute evidencing their hostility toward minority borrowers,statements of the kind we have called stray remarks in the more familiar context of employment discrimination disputes.
rico claims alleging that defendants conspired to fraudulently approve the charter for snb and then institute a program of regulatory action to force snb to abandon its lending programs as part of a pattern of racketeering activity designed to deprive minorities from having ownership of significant national banks and to prevent minority and borrowers from having access to credit.
by these claims,sinclair seeks to have a jury decide whether defendants facially lawful regulatory actions were the product of an unlawful motive.to our knowledge,such judicial review of the actions of federal bank regulators would be unprecedented.the issue,broadly stated,is whether congress has authorized judicial review of regulators motives in personal damage actions that might have a chilling effect on their willingness to aggressively attack unsafe and unsound banking pr
