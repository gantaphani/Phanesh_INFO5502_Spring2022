this diversity case involves a loan used to finance a significant commercial real estate development.when the borrower sold the property and the loan,it balked at paying a prepayment fee according to the terms of the note.the borrower eventually paid the fee,subject to a reservation of rights,and sued the lender.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the borrower and the lender now appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
river east plaza,river east is a real estate developer third party defendant daniel mclean is the president of river east.river east had worked with another party to develop a large retail store on the north side of chicago.in,the other developer offered to sell its share of the project to river east for roughly million.river east,through a mortgage broker,shopped around for a loan to allow it to buy out the other developer share.variable annuity life insurance company valic offered to meet river east demand for a closing date before the end of the year and agreed to an interest rate that river east wanted.among the other terms of valic offer was a yield maintenance prepayment clause.a yield maintenance prepayment clause is an attempt to ensure that prepayment does not deprive the lender of the yield that they bargained for over the life of the loan.
the final version of the note contained a yield maintenance calculation which the parties describe as.to arrive at the amount of the yield maintenance fee in the event that river east decided to prepay,the parties would need to know the outstanding principal as of the date of prepayment and the scheduled loan payments from that date to maturity.they would also need to determine the prevailing interest rate on united states treasury bonds or notes maturing closest to the loan maturity date of january treasuries.with those three amounts in hand,the clause calculates the difference between the scheduled payments and potential interest if the prepaid principal were invested in treasuries.that amount is compared to an amount equal to one percent of the outstanding principal.the larger of these two numbers is then compared with the highest rate allowed by law,and the lesser of those two numbers is the yield maintenance fee.in short,the remaining interest due under the note is discounted by the current interest rate on treasuries.the provision is described as because parties can and apparently occasionally do negotiate a discount rate that is different from the treasury yield.
some examples are in order.if river east decided to exercise the privilege of prepayment and interest rates had fallen since the time that the loan was funded,river east would be on the hook to pay valic the difference between what valic would have received in interest over the life of the loan and what valic could receive by investing the prepaid principal into treasuries.assuming that valic placed the unexpected principal into treasuries and received the prepayment fee from river east,the expected yield that valic bargained for would be maintained by river east supplementing the interest on the reinvested funds with the prepayment fee.if,however,river east prepaid the loan and interest rates had risen substantially in the interim,the interest on the treasuries would presumably exceed the interest rate called for in the loan and the prepayment fee would equal the minimum fee of one percent of the outstanding principal.but in no case would the fee exceed the maximum interest rate allowed by law.
the parties dickered over several of the terms in the note.river east sought to have the yield maintenance fee removed,but valic refused.prior to closing,river east counsel offered to both parties a opinion letter that,among many other opinions,express ed no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision providing for a prepayment premium in the event such premium is held to be a penalty.appellant app.at.nevertheless,the parties went forward with the closing.
several years later,river east sought to sell the property.the tenant had a right of first refusal,and offered to purchase the property.but the tenant would not assume the loan.river east eventually sold the property to the tenant and prepaid the loan.
the parties then began to dispute the size and enforceability of the prepayment penalty.river east eventually paid the penalty under protest,and brought suit in the state courts of illinois.valic removed the case to the federal district court and against river east and mclean for costs and fees.the parties agree that,due to a mathematical error,valic agent had overcharged river east by nearly one million dollars when it computed the prepayment fee.valic returned the overcharge,with interest,but the parties still dispute whether the amount returned was the correct amount.the district court conducted a bench trial,and entered judgment in favor of river east on the question of whether the prepayment fee was enforceable under illinois law.the district court did not enter judgment on the question of whether valic had accurately returned the overcharge that question being moot due to the court first holding,and the court dismissed valic.this appeal followed.

we have three questions before us on the appeal.first,whether the prepayment clause is enforceable under illinois law.second,if the clause is enforceable,whether the amount refunded by valic was the correct amount.third,again only if the clause is enforceable,whether river east or mclean owes costs and fees to valic.
enforceability of the prepayment fee 
yield maintenance prepayment clauses are nothing new.see dale whitman,mortgage prepayment clauses a legal and economic analysis,ucla.the idea behind a yield maintenance clause is to protect a lender during times when interest rates are falling.yield maintenance formulas are calculated to cover the lender reinvestment loss when prepaid loans bear rates.george lefcoe,yield maintenance and defeasance two distinct paths to commercial mortgage prepayment,real.a lender who makes a loan expecting a particular rate of interest runs the risk that prepayment during a period of lower interest rates will reduce its income.valic argues that some lenders,itself included,need to be able to rely on predictable payments in order to live up to their other financial and regulatory obligations.when the loans in question are measured in eight digit figures,as in this case,the lost interest income can be substantial.
one method that lenders might use to guard against this risk is to refuse to allow borrowers to prepay the loan.see restatement third prop.mortgages s an agreement that prohibits payment of the mortgage obligation prior to maturity is enforceable.or lenders might charge a fixed fee,a percentage of the loan balance,or a declining percentage of the loan balance.whitman,ucla.at.however,assuming that the borrower would like the privilege of prepaying the loan instead of being locked in for its entire term,fees based on fixed numbers or the loan balance do not take into account fluctuations in interest rates.hence the development of yield maintenance clauses formulas that attempt to account for the expected interest,the outstanding principal,and fluctuations in prevailing interest rates.
we should note at the outset that the parties are unable to agree on the legal standard that illinois courts would apply to this question.river east maintains that illinois would analyze the prepayment fee under a liquidated damages analysis.appellee br.at.valic argues that illinois would consider the clause to be a form of alternative performance.appellant br.at.the district court applied illinois liquidated damages analysis but did not cite any illinois cases to support that decision.river east plaza,variable annuity life,c,wl at.
the parties can point us to no case from the illinois supreme court that establishes a rule of law for the enforceability of prepayment fees in commercial real estate loans,and we are unable to find one.illinois has placed statutory limitations on the ability of lenders to charge prepayment fees,but those provisions apply only to certain residential mortgages.see.comp.stat.river east argues that the illinois supreme court has adopted the restatement of contract prohibition against penalty clauses.appellee br.at citing bauer sawyer.valic appears not to take issue with this statement of the law.but we should note that bauer was not a case concerning mortgage prepayment,and it specifically cited to section of the restatement,which stands more precisely for the proposition that some liquidated damages clauses are void as against public policy because they are penalties.restatement second of contracts a term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty.the comments to the restatement clarify punishment of a promisor for having broken his promise has no justification on either economic or other grounds and a term providing such a penalty is unenforceable on grounds of public policy.rest d contr.cmt.
if we start from the position that illinois will not enforce penalty clauses,and that illinois recognizes that some liquidated damages clauses cross the line and become penalty clauses in disguise,the underlying question is whether this clause is punitive in nature.w hen the sole purpose of the clause is to secure performance of the contract,the provision is an unenforceable penalty.checkers eight.hawkins,cir citing am.bank trust of chi.reg l transp,cir med plus neck back pain,noffsinger,d.penalties,or liquidated damages clauses in general,are distinct from alternative forms of performing the obligations under the contract.see john calamari joseph perillo,contracts ed.in order to distinguish between the two,a court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether the parties have attempted to disguise a provision for a penalty that is unenforceable in determining whether a contract is one for alternative performances,the relative value of the alternatives may be decisive.restatement second of contracts cmt 
using the restatement as a guide,we will first consider the relative value of the alternatives to see if they are decisive.all of the figures that follow although rounded for ease of reading come from the stipulated facts dated february,that the parties agreed on,and which the district court adopted.river east borrowed million from valic at interest.if river east had paid as scheduled over the course of twenty years,it would have paid roughly million in interest to valic before the note matured in.by july,when river east prepaid the loan subject to reservation of rights,the outstanding principal remained over million,and river east had already paid roughly million in interest.on july,river east paid slightly more than million in prepayment fees,but that sum was reduced to approximately million while this litigation was pending when valic reimbursed the overcharge.
looking at the relative value of the alternatives,we are not convinced that the parties used this clause to disguise a penalty that is unenforceable.by electing an option to pay early,river east avoided paying the million in remaining interest payments that would have been due between and,and instead paid only million.even assuming,due to the time value of money,that the million was worth more in than it would have been worth over the course of the loan,river east seems to have benefited from this bargain.this hardly seems to be a clause whose sole purpose is to secure performance of the contract.checkers eight,at.note,for example,that this prepaid interest is automatically reduced by the operation of the discount rate in the prepayment clause river east was not obligated to pay any of the forgone interest that valic could have earned back by investing the returned principal in treasuries.
but what of the relative value of the alternatives to valic river east makes much of the fact that valic was overcompensated by the prepayment clause.appellee br.at,et.of course,a term such as overcompensated only begs the question of compared to what it certainly can not be the case that valic was overcompensated by receiving more from river east than it contracted for.it contracted to receive million over twenty years.loan amortization being what it is,that income from interest would have been into the first half of the loan term.instead,valic received million over three years and an additional million in year four.river east also does not make the argument that the prepayment overcompensated valic compared to what the prepayment clause required.we recognize that there is a second question at play here,regarding whether valic agent properly calculated the payoff amount,which was the subject of count two of the complaint.more on that later.but whether valic agent incorrectly calculated the figure in can not be the grounds for arguing that the clause was unenforceable as written in december.
instead,river east relies on a clever argument that valic is overcompensated because valic can now,if it so chooses,reinvest the returned principal and eventually get an even greater income stream from somebody else than it would have received from river east.this argument is worth considering in more detail.the prepayment provision is termed.this means that valic interest rate was discounted by the prevailing rate on treasuries as of the date that river east elected to prepay.as we noted above,the unwritten assumption in such a formula is that valic can take the returned principal,invest it in treasuries,and by taking the income from the treasuries and adding it to the prepayment fee,valic gets the exact return it expected from the loan.reality,we might suspect,will be different.one might believe,and expert testimony at trial supported this belief,that interest rates on commercial real estate loans will almost always exceed the interest rates on treasuries.this spread in interest rates gives valic a chance to profit from the prepayment.the argument goes that sophisticated lenders like valic will not invest the returned principal in treasuries,but will simply line up a new commercial real estate loan.but there is an irony to this argument.in trying to argue that the prepayment clause is a penalty,which by definition is a clause whose sole purpose is to secure the performance of the contract,river east argues that valic would have been effectively worse off if the contract had been repaid over the term of the loan instead of prepaid.
in short,viewing the contract in light of illinois reliance on the restatement,we find nothing to suggest that the clause is an unenforceable penalty.under illinois law,the loan could have explicitly prohibited any prepayment whatsoever.river east desired the option to prepay.valic accommodated that desire and included a yield maintenance prepayment fee.river east voluntarily prepaid,and by doing so river east escaped paying million in interest over seventeen years by prepaying million in.valic received its principal,and was free to either reinvest it in treasuries in which case it would be no worse off,hold it as cash in which case its income would be less than bargained for from river east,or invest it in additional real estate mortgages with their attendant higher risks of default.the relative value of the alternatives for both parties leads us to believe that the clause is not punitive in nature.
river east and the district court believe that illinois courts would apply the rubric of liquidated damages to determine if the prepayment clause is unreasonable.as river east notes in its brief,illinois follows the restatement in holding that d amages for brea
