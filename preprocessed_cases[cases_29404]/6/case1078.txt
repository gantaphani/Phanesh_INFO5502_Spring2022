this case involves a takings claim.the alleged taking resulted from the commodity credit corporation ccc enforcement of its lien interest in sugar produced from sugar beets under d.appellants ross bair,et appellants are sugar beet growers whose liens on the sugar were rendered valueless by the enforcement of ccc lien.they appeal from the decision of the united states court of federal claims granting summary judgment in favor of the government.because we conclude that the court of federal claims correctly determined that there was no taking,we affirm.
background 
appellants are producers of sugar beets in washington state.they contracted with processor pacific northwest sugar company pnsc to process their sugar beet crop into refined beet sugar.the beets were delivered for processing.payment for the beets was to occur over the course of several months,but pnsc only made the first of those payments.under washington law,upon delivery of an agricultural product to a processor,the producer has a first priority statutory lien,referred to as a processor lien.this lien attaches to the agricultural products delivered,to the processor or conditioner inventory,and to the processor or conditioner accounts receivable.id.appellants delivered their beets to pnsc on or before december,and therefore had state statutory processor liens that attached by that date.both parties agree that the liens gave appellants a lien on the sugar beets,the sugar refined from those beets,and any proceeds from the sale of that sugar.if pnsc failed to make a payment under the contract,appellants were entitled to foreclose and enforce the lien by a civil action in state court.see id.the processor liens may be foreclosed and enforced by civil action in superior court.
the ccc,an agency of the united states within the department of agriculture,makes loans to sugar beet processors in order to provide price support to the domestic sugar market.between october,and february,the ccc issued nonrecourse loans to pnsc.upon making these loans,the ccc acquired a security interest in the refined sugar produced by pnsc from appellants beets.appellants state processor liens,which attached upon delivery of the beets and later attached to the sugar produced from the beets,necessarily predated the later ccc loans,which were secured by the sugar refined from those beets.nonetheless,the ccc loans received over appellants loans under d,which provides 
a security interest obtained by the commodity credit corporation as a result of the execution of a security agreement by the processor of sugarcane or sugar beets shall be superior to all statutory and common law liens on raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar in favor of the producers of sugarcane and sugar beets and all prior recorded and unrecorded liens on the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived.
on march,after paying about half of what it owed to appellants,pnsc defaulted on its agreement with them.after this default by pnsc,appellants timely filed statements evidencing their processor liens on march.see.requiring producers to file liens within twenty days of payment due date in order to maintain priority over liens and perfected security interests.on september,appellants brought suit in washington state court,against both pnsc and ccc,seeking foreclosure of those liens and recovery of.
the government removed this action to the united states district court for the eastern district of washington.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the ccc because it concluded that the plain language of d afforded super priority to the ccc liens.bair pac.nw.sugar,no,slip op.at,unpublished,aff.cir not selected for publication in the federal reporter.as a result of these rulings,the ccc was able to recover of its outstanding loans,through a combination of the remaining processed sugar and the proceeds from its sale,and wrote off of pnsc debt.no sugar or proceeds remained to pay pnsc debt to appellants,and their liens were rendered worthless.

discussion 
we review the court of federal claims decision to grant summary judgment without deference.old stone united states.
the supreme court has recognized two types of regulatory regulatory takings and partial regulatory takings.if a partial regulatory taking is alleged,we must undertake the inquiry set out by the supreme court in penn central transportation new york city,d.the supreme court has identified several relevant factors that have particular significance,including i the character of the governmental action ii t he economic impact of the action on the claimant and iii the extent to which the action has interfered with distinct expectations.id.at.if a categorical regulatory taking is alleged,we ask only whether the regulatory imposition is one that denies all economically beneficial or productive use of the property.lucas south carolina coastal council,d see also maritrans united states.appellants contend that such a categorical taking occurred here because their liens were rendered valueless by the government foreclosure on the ccc liens and consequent enforcement of its statutory right,which left no collateral or proceeds from which the appellants liens could be satisfied.
we assume without deciding that the correct date from which to judge whether a taking occurred is,as appellants contend,the date on which the government asserted its interest against the appellants and that this action rendered their property valueless.however,under either type of alleged regulatory taking categorical or partial,before we undertake a penn central or lucas analysis,we must determine as a threshold matter whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.see members of the peanut quota holders ass united states,am.pelagic fishing united states,maritrans,at.in other words,we ask whether the claimant possessed a stick in the bundle of property rights.adams united states,citation omitted.it is axiomatic that only persons with a valid property interest at the time of the taking are entitled to compensation.wyatt united states.once the claimant has identified a valid property interest,we must determine whether the challenged governmental action constituted a compensable taking of that property interest.see am.pelagic,at.
the central dispute in this case is whether appellants possessed a compensable property interest in their right to lien priority over the ccc liens on pnsc refined sugar.the supreme court in lucas made clear that property interests are acquired subject to background principles of law,and that limitations on property rights that otherwise would effect a categorical taking are permissible if they inhere in the title itself.at.the parties do not dispute that,under washington law,appellants interests were created in,with the last date of creation being december.at that time both state law and federal law existed purporting to define the priority of the appellants liens.
appellants argue,however,that only the states,and not the federal government,have the power to create and define property rights,and that the federal statute therefore can not constitute a background principle of law in derogation of appellants right to lien priority we reject appellants argument.
we first note that the supreme court has held that federal law determines what constitutes property for purposes of applying federal statutes.in particular,the court has made clear that the priority of liens stemming from federal lending programs must be determined with reference to federal law.united states
