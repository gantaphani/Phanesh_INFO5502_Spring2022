the issue before us involves the interpretation of florida garnishment statute and the obligations it imposes on third parties,including attorneys,who are served with writs of garnishment.in its decision in first american holdings,preclude,so d dca,the second district court of appeal ruled upon the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance 
does an attorney garnishee have a duty to issue a stop payment order for a check drawn on his or her trust account and delivered to the payee prior to the receipt of a writ of garnishment if the service of that writ occurs prior to the presentment of that check for payment to the attorney bank 
id.at.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
the second district broadly concluded that florida does impose on both bank and nonbank garnishees the duty to retain funds held by the garnishee even after a check on those funds has been drawn by the garnishee and delivered to the payee.first american,so d at.in so holding,the second district adopted a rule of law that applied equally to attorneys and other garnishees.because we agree with this analysis,we answer the certified question in the affirmative and approve the decision of the second district.
factual and procedural background 
the law firm of arnold,matheny and eagan,ame represented preclude,in a lawsuit against greenleaf products,which resulted in ame obtaining a settlement from greenleaf for its client preclude.the settlement reached on june,required greenleaf to pay these funds into ame trust account.
prior to the time of the settlement between greenleaf and preclude,first american holdings,first american,sought to collect on a judgment it had previously obtained in unrelated proceedings against preclude.the precise details of both underlying lawsuits are not relevant to the issue before us.
on june,first american served ame with a writ of garnishment seeking to collect its judgment from the greenleaf settlement.at that time,ame had not yet received the settlement funds and answered the writ by stating that,although greenleaf was indebted to preclude,ame did not currently hold any funds belonging to preclude.two days later,on june,ame received the proceeds of the settlement and deposited the funds into its trust account.on that same date,ame issued two trust account checks.ame made the first check payable to its operating account in the amount of for attorneys fees and costs.that check is not in dispute.the other check for the balance of the funds was made payable to preclude,which ame hand delivered to preclude that same day.
four days later,on june,first american served a second writ of garnishment on ame,again attempting to collect on the judgment against preclude.once again,ame answered the writ by denying that it was in possession or control of any funds that were the property of preclude.upon subsequent review of the records,however,first american determined that as of june,the funds represented by the check were still in ame trust account and that the check was not presented to ame bank for payment until june,several days after ame had answered the writ of garnishment denying possession of the funds.
first american then filed an action seeking to hold ame responsible for the funds represented by the trust account check issued to preclude.first american contended that ame was liable because ame had possession and control of the funds until the check cleared.ame defended its actions by arguing that once the check was delivered to preclude on june,it no longer had possession or control and therefore had no duty to stop payment.alternatively,ame argued that any stop payment duty applied only to banks and thus was not applicable to ame as a garnishee.the trial court ruled in favor of ame,granting its motion for summary judgment and dissolving the second garnishment writ.first american,so d at.
first american appealed to the second district.as stated previously,the court specifically rejected ames argument that attorneys and their trust account checks should be treated differently for purposes of the garnishment law.id.at.thus,the second district reversed the trial courts ruling.id.consequently,ame filed a notice to invoke this courts discretionary jurisdiction based on the certified question,requesting this court to review the second districts decision.
the question in this case,which is one of first impression for this court,is whether an attorney must issue a stop payment order on a check drawn from an attorney trust account and delivered to a client before the attorney is served with a garnishment writ,if the writ is received before the check has been presented for payment to the attorney bank.because the issue requires this court to interpret the statutory provisions of florida garnishment law,we apply a de novo standard of review.see heart of adoptions,so d.
in answering the certified question,we first provide an overview of the florida garnishment statute,sections,florida statutes.next,we discuss the proper interpretation of possession or control as those terms are used in section.we then analyze whether the obligations of the garnishment statute apply equally to bank and garnishees.next,we determine whether a different rule of law should apply to attorney trust accounts,which also requires us to review the obligations of attorneys toward their clients.finally,we apply our analysis to the facts of this case.
a.the garnishment statute 
garnishment is a creature of statute,unknown at common law.robinson robinson,so d.it is authorized as a method of collecting a monetary judgment against a defendant.in florida,the right to garnishment is created under section,which states in relevant part 
every person or entity who has sued to recover a debt or has recovered judgment in any court against any person or entity has a right to a writ of garnishment,in the manner hereinafter provided,to subject any debt due to defendant by a third person or any debt not evidenced by a negotiable instrument that will become due absolutely through the passage of time only to the defendant by a third person,and any tangible or intangible personal property of defendant in the possession or control of a third person.
emphasis added.
once a garnishee receives the writ,the garnishee must answer the plaintiff within twenty days and state 
whether he or she is indebted to defendant at the time of the answer,or was indebted at the time of service of the writ,or at any time between such times and in what sum and what tangible or intangible personal property of defendant the garnishee has in his or her possession or control at the time of his or her answer,or had at the time of the service of the writ,or at any time between such times and whether the garnishee knows of any other person indebted to defendant,or who may have any of the property of defendant in his or her possession or control.
stat.in addition to filing the answer,the garnishee is required to retain any deposit,account,or tangible or intangible personal property in the possession or control of such garnishee until disposition or dissolution of the writ.stat.if a garnishee fails to retain the property of the defendant or otherwise comply with the writ,the plaintiff may obtain a monetary judgment against the garnishee.see.stat.
on the other hand,the legislature,in recognizing the risk of liability for a garnishee,has provided immunity for any garnishee acting in good faith.section,florida statutes,states 
in any case where a garnishee in good faith is in doubt as to whether any indebtedness or property is required by law to be included in the garnishee answer or retained by it,the garnishee may include and retain the same,subject to the provisions of and subject to disposition as provided in this chapter,and in such case the garnishee shall not be liable for so doing to the defendant or to any other person claiming the same or any interest therein or claiming to have sustained damage on account thereof.
emphasis added.this section acts as a shield from liability for garnishees who have acted in good faith in accordance with their statutory responsibilities.finally,florida garnishment law provides for reimbursement of a garnishees attorneys fees,costs and expenses associated with complying with a garnishment writ.see.stat.
statutory construction 
with this overview of florida garnishment law in mind,we now discuss the interpretation of the garnishment statute.the actual issue before us is a narrow one concerning the obligations the statute imposes on attorneys under a specific set of circumstances that is,where a trust account check has been written and delivered to the payee prior to receipt of the garnishment writ but before presentment of the check to the payor bank.the specific determination we must make is whether an attorney is in possession or control of funds as those terms are used in section,when a check has been written and delivered to the client but not yet been presented to the attorney bank for payment.
this court must construe the statute in accordance with legislative intent by looking primarily at the statutory language.cason.dep t of mgmt,so d.if the language is clear and unambiguous,then this court has no further reason to apply the rules of statutory construction.borden ins,so d.yet,if the language is unclear or ambiguous,or otherwise must be interpreted,then this court applies the rules of statutory construction to discern legislative intent.gulfstream park racing ass n,tampa bay downs,so d.
we focus on the statutory provision that requires that a garnishee report and retain any property that is in its possession or control at the time the writ is served because there is no express duty in the garnishment statute requiring the garnishee to issue a stop payment order.see.stat.the garnishee shall report in its answer and retain any deposit,account,or tangible or intangible personal property in the possession or control of such garnishee.therefore,in answering the certified question,it is necessary to determine the meaning of the terms possession or control.
because possession or control is not defined in the garnishment statute,canons of statutory construction require that the term be given its plain and ordinary meaning which can be ascertained by reference to dictionary definitions.see rollins pizzarelli,so d.according to black law dictionary ed,possession is t he fact of having or holding property in one power the exercise of dominion over property.control is defined as to exercise power or influence over.id.at.
in the case of funds in a bank account,the payee obtains possession and control once the funds are physically present in its account.see nicholas ross,so d,dca appellant obtained possession of funds from wire transfer once the funds were deposited into her account.as for the payor,if a check has not been written,the duty to report and retain is easily fulfilled because the funds are still physically present in the account and the payor continues to have possession and control.however,simply because a check has been issued does not necessarily result in the payor losing possession and control of the funds.
considering that a check is a negotiable instrument,the most relevant provisions governing the status of the funds represented by an issued check,specifically as to who is in possession or control,are those found within the uniform commercial code.the has been adopted by statute in florida in chapters through,florida statutes,and chapter pertains to negotiable instruments,such as checks.see.stat.
section,florida statutes provides that a check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the drawee which are available for its payment.the third district court of appeal in gelco united national bank,so d dca,relied on this provision in specifically rejecting the argument that upon receipt of the check by the payee,the payor effectively assigned the funds still in the payor account pending the payment of the check.id.at.
further,regarding whether the funds remain in the payor account and hence in the payor possession up until presentment,section a,florida statutes,defines presentment as a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument a to pay the instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged to pay the instrument or,in the case of a note or accepted draft payable at a bank,to the bank.presentment has been construed as the point in time where the payee or the payee bank presents the check to the payor bank for payment.see florida bank at perry citizens bank of perry,so d,dca using the term presentment in defining the exchange between banks where the collecting bank would bring checks to the payor bank and request payment for the checks.importantly,after the check is issued to the payee but before presentment of the check to the payor bank,the funds represented by the check remain in the payor account.it is not until presentment that issuance of a check constitutes full and absolute payment.see henry bailey richard hagedorn,brady on bank checks ed.since delivery of an ordinary,uncertified check is only conditional payment,dependent on the check being honored upon presentment,the check vests no title or interest in the payee as to funds on deposit in the drawer bank account and the check is deemed revocable by the drawer until it is paid.
other indications of possession and control are found in chapter,florida statutes,which pertains to bank deposits and collections.specifically,section,florida statutes,deals with the customer right to stop payment and provides in part 
a customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer account or close the account by a written order to the bank describing the item or account with certainty received by an officer of the bank during a banking day and at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in.
thus,a payor of a check may issue a stop payment order after the check has been written in an attempt to prevent the check from being paid and the funds from being transferred to the payee.this right to stop payment is strongly indicative of the possession or control one has over funds in an account.in other words,we would be hard pressed to deny that a payor was still in control over funds in his or her account if the payor could actually take steps to stop payment of the check.
as to the steps for requesting a stop payment order,we recognize that various banking institutions may not be uniform regarding the requirements for issuance of a stop payment order or even what constitutes a reasonable amount of time for the issuance.therefore,the focus in an individual case may be on whether the garnishee both has the ability to issue a stop payment order and takes reasonable steps to do so after the time the writ is served 
of course,if a check has not yet been written,the duty to retain is easily fulfilled.however,even if the check has been written and delivered,section provides the owner of the account with the right to stop payment on the check if the bank is afforded a reasonable opportunity to act.as previously stated,it is not until the check has been presented for payment to the payor bank that the payor ceases to have possession or control of the funds represented by the check.until that point,a payor may issue a stop payment order on the check,transfer the funds to another account,or even liquidate the bank account.in essence,possession and control reside with either the payor or the payee and,until the payor loses the ability to control the funds in the account,the payee has not yet obtained possession or control of the funds.
construing the provisions of the garnishment statute together with the related provisions of florida,specifically sections and,we hold that funds remain in the garnishee possession and control,even though a check has been written and delivered to the payee,if the check has not been presented for payment accordingly,we conclude that the statute imposes a duty on garnishees to issue a stop payment order on a check that has not yet been presented for payment if a garnishee has the ability to do so 
bank and garnishees 
now that we have concluded there is a general duty to stop payment if the garnishee has the ability to do so,we next discuss whether there is any distinction between bank and garnishees.in gelco,the third district,in reliance on the statutory provision that writing a check in and of itself does not operate as an assignment of funds,held that once a bank account has been garnished,the bank is obligated to retain funds of the depositor in obedience to the writ,even when a check has been delivered to a payee before the writ was served.so d at quoting kipnis taub,so d,dca.
we note that although gelco specifically dealt with the duties of a garnished bank,the garnishment statute does not distinguish between bank and garnishees.in fact,in,the legislature repealed a portion of the statute that required only banks or other financial institutions to retain property in their possession or control when served with a writ of garnishment.ch,laws of thus,it appears that the legislature intended for the duties imposed on bank garnishees to extend to garnishees as well.
we are aware that case law from some other states distinguishes between bank and garnishees or holds that garnishees as a whole have no duty to stop payment,but we have found no basis in our statutes for making a similar distinction several of those courts were concerned with the risk of liability for a garnishee if the garnishee stopped payment on a check that the debtor had negotiated to a holder in due course however,in florida,our statutory scheme protects against liability for a garnishee who acts in good faith.see.stat.other courts appear to base their holdings on the fact that a check,as a promise of payment,is sufficient to place the funds out of garnishment reach once again,our statutory scheme addresses and rejects this rationale by specifically providing that issuance of a check does not operate as an assignment of funds.see.stat.
we recognize that arguments have been made that not imposing a duty to stop payment on a garnishee may be the preferable policy.as judge stone expressed in his concurrence in michael acri boxing promotions,miles,so d,dca,t he better policy,in my judgment,absent fraud,is that followed in those states holding that,upon service of a writ of garnishment,a garnishee does not have a duty to stop payment on checks that have been issued and delivered to discharge a debt.yet,when interpreting a statute,policy preferences are within the purview of the legislature and the court does not interfere with that authority as long as the statute does not violate any constitutional rights or principles.see tillman state,so d,i t is not this court function to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as to the wisdom or policy of a particular statute.quoting state rife,so d.accordingly,we defer to the florida legislature on this matter of policy.because the garnishment statute does not distinguish between the obligations of bank and garnishees,we conclude that there is no reason to recognize such a distinction here.
attorney trust accounts 
having concluded that the statute does not support creating a distinction for garnishees,we next address ame argument that attorneys should be exempt from any stop payment duty because of the nature of attorney trust account checks and the rules regulating the florida bar.we are unable to find any statutory basis for making this distinction.first,the garnishment statute does not address attorney trust accounts.second,we note that the legislature elsewhere in the florida statutes has chosen to exempt several funds from garnishment,including the cash surrender value of life insurance,see.stat.disability income benefits,see.stat.firefighters pension benefits,see.stat.and veterans benefits,see.stat.however,the legislature has not created an exemption for attorney trust accounts.
we also reject ame attempts to analogize attorney trust account checks to both certified and cashier checks,which are immediately negotiable a certified check is a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn.stat.see also black law dictionary defining certified check as a depositor check drawn on a bank that guarantees the availability of funds for the check.a cashier check is a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.stat.see also black law dictionary defining cashier check as a check drawn by a bank on itself,payable to another person,and evidencing the payee authorization to receive from the bank the amount of money represented by the check.a bank is subject to severe penalties for wrongfully stopping payment on a cashier or certified check.see.stat.a bank may honor the check for at least the ninety days following the date of a cashier check or the date of acceptance of a certified check.see.stat.only after this time has expired may the bank pay the check to someone other than the original payee.see id conversely,a stop payment order can be executed on a personal check on the same day.see.stat.stating that a stop payment order must be received by an officer of the bank during a banking day and at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it.
as evidenced by the procedures involved in stopping payment,the difference between the two categories of checks is a critical one because an attorney trust account check is simply not addressed by any of these statutory provisions.further,a trust account check lacks the guarantee inherent in a certified or cashier check that the funds represented by the check are available.see hudgins.fed.sav.loan ass n,so d,dca tender of a personal check is not the equivalent of cash or a certified check.the delivery of a personal check is at best conditional payment because whether or not it is drawn on a trust account or escrow account,it is not finally paid until the conclusion of the settlement process and in the interim,the account may fluctuate in amount,it may be garnished,set off by the bank,or the drawer may stop payment on the check.emphasis added footnotes omitted.because of the salient differences between attorney trust account checks and the guaranteed funds that are represented by cashier and certified checks,we reject ame assertion that the two categories of checks should be treated similarly.
certainly,we recognize that through the rules regulating trust accounts,as contained in chapter of the rules regulating the florida bar,every effort is made to ensure the integrity of an attorney trust account and the checks drawn upon it.rule regulating the florida bar a b,provides that a client funds held in an attorney trust account are held in trust and directs that such funds be handled pursuant to the instruction of the client.the rule specifically states that a lawyer must hold in trust funds and property of clients that are in a lawyer possession in connection with a representation.regulating.bar a.further,m oney or other property entrusted to an attorney for a specific purpose is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose.id.b.
in addition,an attorney is also obligated under the rules to promptly distribute to the client monies received from a third party not subject to dispute.see id.e f.moreover,an attorney can accept another attorney trust account check before the funds have been credited to the attorney trust account if the attorney has a reasonable and prudent belief that the deposit would clear and represent collected funds in the trust account in a reasonable amount of time.regulating.bar j.
however,another provision of the rule,rule e,specifically provides that u pon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest,a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person.emphasis added.further,the comment to rule states 
third parties,such as a client creditors,may have lawful claims against funds or other property in a lawyer custody.a lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect such third party claims against wrongful interference by the client.when the lawyer has a duty under applicable law to protect t
