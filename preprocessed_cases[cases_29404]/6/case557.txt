background 
procedural history 
this case involves a criminal forfeiture in which defendant was indicted on various charges of medicare fraud and money laundering on september.on january,the government accepted defendant guilty plea wherein defendant withdrew his previous plea of not guilty,and entered a written plea agreement to charges and of the indictment.on this date,the government also moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture,which was granted while defendant waived notice of forfeiture as well as the right to appeal the order of forfeiture.the property seized by the government included real estate owned by harris management service,hmsi,an ohio corporation wholly owned by defendant and his wife.claimants in this matter are innocent third party lenders who held mortgages on this real estate,and each therefore petitioned the district court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of the legal interests asserted in the property pursuant to n petition for hearing and for validation of mortgage of lien interests.specifically,nrf filed a petition asserting that it held valid,first priority liens on property known as the fox run apartments and the riverbend apartments lnb likewise filed a petition as to four large apartment complexes in the toledo,ohio area known as the hunt club,windjammer,devonshire,and wellington house apartment complexes.
on june,the district court held a hearing to consider the extent of claimants asserted interests in the property.following the hearing and submission of briefs by the parties,the court issued a memorandum opinion and order finding that claimants were entitled to principal and interest at the default rate,and to reasonable costs,late charges and attorney fees,but that they were not entitled to prepayment premiums,or to late charges beyond those reasonably necessary to reimburse the lenders for transaction costs associated with processing late payments.the district court entered a corresponding judgment and it is from this judgment that claimants now appeal.
defendant amassed a real estate empire consisting of several residential rental properties in toledo,ohio,which,according to the government,defendant financed by defrauding the federal medicare program.between july of,when medicare first paid defendant for what later were found to be fraudulent claims,and september of,when the government took action against defendant,the government claims that defendant used over of the monies which he received as a result of his fraudulent dealings with medicare as down payments for dozens of properties worth at lest.
specifically,on september,federal agents executed search warrants at the offices of harris medical supply hms,a company that defendant used to defraud medicare,and at hmsi,a company that defendant used to manage his rental properties.within three months after the searches were executed,defendant established a nominee corporation called ashton button company,in the cayman islands,and a second nominee corporation called iguana reef,also in the cayman islands.over the eighteen months between march of,and september of,defendant at least to the cayman islands and used these funds to buy real estate in the name of his two cayman island corporations.the government alleged that defendant obtained the funds that he wired to the cayman islands from several sources,but that most of the funds came from the refinancing of defendant apartment buildings.
claimant nrf 
as to claimant nrf,defendant,on behalf of hmsi,obtained loans from nrf in the amount of approximately one note dated august,was in the amount of,and the second note of the same date was in the amount of.these loans were secured by two mortgages given to nrf by hmsi one mortgage on the fox run apartment complex,and the other mortgage on the riverbend apartment complex.as part of the loan agreement,hmsi agreed that it would pay prepayment consideration to nrf if the loans were prepaid.nrf and the government stipulated that the prepayment consideration owed under the fox run note is,and the prepayment consideration owed under the riverbend note is however,while the government agrees that these are the amounts due as prepayment consideration,the government claims that the amounts are not recoverable by nrf as part of the forfeiture process.under the terms of the notes,prepayment consideration becomes due and owing upon certain events including an event of default as provided in the agreement.
hmsi failed to make its august,installment payment in a letter dated august,nrf informed hmsi that it had not received its payment due august,on both the fox run and riverbend loans,and that it had five days in which to make the payment in order to cure the default otherwise,the failure to pay would be an event of default under the loan documents.hmsi did not cure its default and,according to nrf,the debt was accelerated on both loans.
specifically,on august,nrf filed its amended complaint in foreclosure for declaratory judgment,and for appointment of a receiver against hmsi in the court of common pleas of lucas county,ohio.on august,the court of common pleas entered an order appointing dennis noneman as receiver of two apartment complexes that secured the debt owed to nrf.
in the criminal proceeding involving defendant,on september,united states district judge james carr entered an order in aid of execution of seizure warrant as to defendant property.the fox run apartment complex and the riverbend apartment complex were among the properties involved.defendant was indicted on september.
on september,as a result of the government seizure of the properties,nrf filed an amended complaint in foreclosure in its ohio suit naming the united states of america as a party defendant.the government removed nrf civil foreclosure action to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio and,upon the government motion,the civil foreclosure case,together with foreclosure cases filed by other innocent third party lenders including lnb,was transferred to united states district judge david katz,who had been reassigned to handle defendant criminal case.
claimant lnb 
as to claimant lnb,defendant,on behalf of hmsi,obtained four loans from midland loan services,for which lnb is the assignee of all loan documents,each of which was secured by a mortgage on an apartment building and totaled approximately.the apartment complexes were named as the hunt club,the windjammer,the devonshire,and the wellington house.the loans on the hunt club and the windjammer complexes both the hunt club and the windjammer debts.the loans on the wellington house and the devonshire complexes were separate.
in september and october of,lnb filed four foreclosure actions in lucas county,ohio,common pleas court against hmsi after hmsi defaulted on its loan obligations,naming the united states of america as a party defendant in each action.the common pleas court entered cognovit judgments in favor of lnb in three of the actions,awarding the full amount on three of the mortgages,including principal,interest at a default rate,and prepayment consideration.specifically,on september,the court entered judgment in favor of lnb in the amount of regarding the hunt club complex on september,the court entered judgment in favor of lnb in the amount of regarding the windjammer complex on october,the court entered judgment in favor of lnb in the amount of regarding the devonshire complex.the fourth foreclosure action,the one involving the wellington house complex wherein lnb sought judgment in the amount of,was not reduced to judgment because of the government intervention.shortly after judgments were entered,the government moved to transfer the cases to the united states district court,and the matter ultimately came before judge katz,whose decision is now the subject of this appeal.
on october,the government auctioned off the four apartment complexes involved in the lnb loan agreements,for a total sum of.the payoff figures to lnb,trustee totaled,plus a few days of per diem interest,leaving the government with a profit of on these properties.lnb claims that as of september of,the time at which defendant defaulted on the loans,the prepayment premiums owed to lnb totaled however,lnb notes in its brief on appeal that because interest rates spiraled upward,the prepayment premiums were in the fall of.
discussion 
we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,and its conclusions of law de novo in this mixed issue of law and fact.see razavi comm r of irs,cir see also schroyer frankel,cir.
the government four main arguments as to why claimants are not entitled to prepayment premiums are as follows because the transfer of the property to the government was involuntary,it did not trigger the prepayment premiums provision because the claimants accelerated the loans,thereby demanding full payment in advance of the maturity date,claimants can not collect prepayment premiums even if claimants were permitted to accelerate the loans and then collect prepayment premiums,claimants could not do so here because they did not accelerate the loans until sometime after they learned of defendant crimes and because the risk that lenders will lose prepayment premiums due to their borrowers criminal conduct is a risk that is better borne by the lenders than by the victims of the crimes.
we disagree with each of the government arguments where the case law that has spoken to prepayment premiums in well as other provisions for which an innocent lienholder has not support the government position.as stated,the issue of whether an innocent lender is entitled to prepayment premiums as provided in the loan agreement upon the real property being forfeited to the government as a result of a criminal forfeiture proceeding against the debtor,is an issue of first impression in this circuit as well as the circuits across the country however,when we apply analogous case law,although not directly on point,it becomes evident that the government arguments do not carry the day.
although this issue is ultimately one of federal law under n b,both parties agree that ohio law governs the outcome.as this court stated in united states smith,
because forfeiture proceedings implicate property rights which have traditionally been measured in terms of state law,and because section contains no rule for determining the scope of property rights,it is appropriate to refer to state law in determining the nature of the property interest involved in a forfeiture proceeding.

the government accurately notes that the only case under ohio law to speak to prepayment premiums,or prepayment consideration as the term is also known,in this regard is landohio northwestern mut.life mortgage realty investors.the government relies upon landohio in support of its first argument that an involuntary transfer of property to the government can not trigger a prepayment premium.however,we are not persuaded by the government argument because it fails to accurately represent the holding of landohio,and instead relies upon only a select portion thereof.
landohio involved a taking under eminent domain where the mortgage lienholder sought prepayment consideration as provided in the lending agreement.landohio.at.the district court noted that the ohio courts had yet to speak on the issue and that under erie tompkins,the court had a duty to determine what the ohio courts would do if presented with this question.landohio.at.the district court looked to a case from new jersey which was factually on point,particularly regarding the fact that like landohio,the lenders in the new jersey case failed to include a provision as to the payment of prepayment premiums when the land was sold involuntarily before the note matured.id.citing jala berkeley sav.loan ass of newark.the district court then adopted the jala rule that when the state coerces the sale of a mortgagor property through the exercise of its condemnation power,the mortgagor is relieved of the contractual duty to render a prepayment premium to the mortgagee,unless the parties have explicitly agreed that such a payment shall be made even in the event that the mortgagor is forced to sell his property.id.at citing jala,at.
the government cites only the portion of the landohio case wherein the district court held that a prepayment premium may not be assessed against a lienholder when the land is sold involuntarily,but fails to include the qualification of the jala rule that unless the parties have explicitly agreed that such a payment shall be made in the event that the mortgagor is forced to sell his property.landohio.at.indeed,the district court in landohio adopted the jala rule in its entirety,including the qualification,and because claimants in the matter at hand expressly provided for the payment of prepayment premiums even if the borrower were forced to sell the property,the government argument that prepayment premiums are forbidden under landohio because the transfer in the matter at hand was involuntary fails.see see also john murray,enforceability of prepayment premium provisions in commercial loan documents,prac.inst,acknowledging the holding of landohio to include the qualification of the parties being able to specifically bargain for the right to prepayment premiums in the case of an involuntary transfer.
we are not persuaded otherwise by the government reliance on a case from the seventh circuit,in re lhd realty,cir,where,like the court in landohio,the seventh circuit explicitly held that the lender was not entitled to a prepayment premium because the lender accelerated the,the prepayment was involuntary,and the prepayment clause did not clearly provide that the premium could be collected upon acceleration after default.simply put,the seventh circuit would have allowed for the prepayment premium in the case of an involuntary transfer if the parties had expressly bargained for it.id.the parties did bargain for it in the matter at hand.
this brings us to the government next claim which is that a lender may not accelerate a loan,thereby demanding full payment in advance of the maturity date,and also claim a prepayment premium.as noted,claimants bargained for the right to prepayment consideration,even in the event that defendant lost ownership of the property through acceleration of the debt or foreclosure.the government argues that under wide scope,freedom fed.savs.loan ass n,ohio misc d,ohio law prevents the payment of prepayment premiums when the lender has accelerated the debt.we acknowledge wide scope holding that i f a lender requires payment in full,it may not also enforce a prepayment penalty however,wide scope a decision from the franklin county municipal court failed to account for landohio s earlier qualification to the general premise that prepayment premiums are not allowed when the transfer is involuntary namely,that the premiums will be allowed if the parties expressly bargained for
