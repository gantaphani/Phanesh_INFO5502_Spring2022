the panel directs the clerk to reenter judgment.the parties may seek panel rehearing or rehearing en banc thereafter within the time limits provided by federal rule of appellate procedure.
robin orr orr appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of bank of america boa.the district court found that most of the evidence submitted by orr in support of her opposition to boa motion for summary judgment was inadmissible due to inadequate authentication and hearsay.it held orr had failed to present any admissible evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact and thus entered summary judgment in favor of boa on orr first amended complaint complaint.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
background 
orr was a service manager for boa incline village branch in.joe bourdeau bourdeau was its sales manager.in july,the branch suffered a deposit loss of.as part of its investigation,the fbi took a polygraph test from orr boa claims it did not receive the results of orr polygraph test.its position is corroborated by orr deposition testimony and the affidavit of an fbi agent who administered the test.orr was never charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
in january,george burns,boa district officer,and vicki haven,boa auditor,conducted an operational review of boa incline village branch.they reported deficiencies.this led julie castle castle,boa incline village branch manager,to terminate bourdeau and orr for failure to implement proper control procedures.
bourdeau and orr subsequently raised million to start the bank of lake tahoe tahoe bank.an application for deposit insurance was submitted to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,listing orr as tahoe bank proposed vice president of operations and bourdeau as its president and ceo.
the fdic interviewed boa incline village branch managers castle and robert underwood underwood as part of its investigation of tahoe bank.castle and underwood insist they did not disclose any information about orr to the fdic.orr,however,claims they submitted disparaging information about her to the fdic.she points to exhibit b,bourdeau deposition testimony in which he states that he saw negative documents about orr at the fdic and was told they were submitted by boa.she also points to exhibit c,a memo sent from bob geerhart to scott walshaw,both agents of the nevada department of financial institutions,concerning the investigation of tahoe bank in which geerhart paints a suspicious portrait of orr based on an fbi report.that report purportedly identified her as a suspect in an theft of a deposit at boa at the close of its investigation,the fdic denied tahoe bank application.
in february,bourdeau filed an action against boa alleging slander,fraudulent misrepresentation and intentional interference with business relations.the jury dismissed all but one count in which it found boa liable for intentional interference with prospective business relations and awarded bourdeau million in compensatory damages.on appeal,the nevada supreme court reversed and remanded for a new trial 
following the fdic denial of tahoe bank application,the nevada banking company purchased tahoe bank and opened a branch in incline village.it hired bourdeau and orr and became highly successful.orr has been working there since january and is currently its operations officer.
orr brought the present action against boa on august.her complaint contains counts for intentional interference with existing contractual relations,intentional interference with prospective business relations,business disparagement,slander,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,the sherman act,and the employee polygraph protection act.orr alleges that the fdic rejection of tahoe bank application injured her,costing her equity in tahoe bank and depriving her of valuable career opportunities.
boa moved for summary judgment on orr complaint.the district court found that of the exhibits submitted by orr were inadmissible as hearsay or for lack of proper authentication.as the three admissible exhibits failed to raise a triable issue of material fact,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of boa.orr appeals.
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.see clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all justifiable inferences in its favor,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.compare eastman kodak image technical,d,with cal.architectural,franciscan ceramics,cir.
choice of law 
this is a diversity action.the federal rules of evidence govern.see trammel united states,d wray gregory,cir per curiam the federal rules of evidence ordinarily govern in diversity cases.nevada law,including its statute of limitations,governs orr tort claims because the alleged torts occurred in the state of nevada 
discussion 
i.many of orr exhibits are inadmissible because of inadequate authentication and hearsay.
in opposing boa motion for summary judgment,orr submitted exhibits a through y,various documents attached as exhibits to the declaration of her counsel kevin mirch mirch.the district court admitted exhibits a,u,and v.it excluded the remaining exhibits for inadequate authentication and hearsay.we confront the issue whether any of the excluded exhibits should have been admitted and whether such admission alters the outcome of the summary judgment motion we conclude that with the exception of exhibits a,u,and v,orr exhibits are inadmissible due to inadequate authentication or hearsay.because exhibits a,u,and v do not present a triable issue of material fact,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
standard of review of evidentiary rulings 
the district court exclusion of evidence in a summary judgment motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see joiner,d.it follows that we must affirm the district court unless its evidentiary ruling was manifestly erroneous and prejudicial.see id.at.maffei ins,cir.
authentication 
a trial court can only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.see.e beyene coleman sec,cir.authentication is a condition precedent to admissibility,and this condition is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.a.we have repeatedly held that unauthenticated documents can not be considered in a motion for summary judgment.see cristobal siegel,cir hal roach studios,richard feiner,cir beyene,at canada blain helicopters,cir hamilton keystone tankship,cir.
in a summary judgment motion,documents authenticated through personal must be attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of.e and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence.canada,at citation omitted.however,a proper foundation need not be established through personal knowledge but can rest on any manner permitted by federal rule of evidence b or.see.b providing ten approaches to authentication.documents need no extrinsic foundation.
most of orr exhibits are inadmissible because of improper authentication.
a deposition extracts i exhibit y deposition of castle 
exhibit y purports to be an extract from the deposition of castle in which she states that boa security officer rick parsons told her he knew the results of orr polygraph test.
this exhibit is not properly authenticated.the reporter certification and the names of the deponent and the action are missing.the statement in mirch affidavit that exhibit y is a true and correct copy does not provide authentication because mirch lacks personal knowledge of castle deposition.see.b beyene,at.nor can it be authenticated by reviewing its contents because castle name is not mentioned once in the deposition extract.see.b.it is thus inadmissible 
a deposition or an extract therefrom is authenticated in a motion for summary judgment when it identifies the names of the deponent and the action and includes the reporter certification that the deposition is a true record of the testimony of the deponent.see.b.e f beyene,at pavone citicorp credit,d,excluding a deposition for failure to submit a signed certification from the reporter.ordinarily,this would have to be accomplished by attaching the cover page of the deposition and the reporter certification to every deposition extract submitted.it is insufficient for a party to submit,without more,an affidavit from her counsel identifying the names of the deponent,the reporter,and the action and stating that the deposition is a true and correct copy.see beyene,at.such an affidavit lacks foundation even if the were present at the deposition.see pavone,d at.
ii deficient references to exhibit d in orr statement of undisputed facts 
orr statement of undisputed facts fails to cite the page and line numbers when referring to the deposition contained in exhibit this defect alone warrants exclusion of the evidence see huey ups,cir j udges need not paw over the files without assistance from the parties.am.kline,cir parties must designate specific facts and their location in the record when relying on deposition testimony.the efficient management of judicial business mandates that parties submit evidence responsibly.we hold that when a party relies on deposition testimony in a summary judgment motion without citing to page and line numbers,the trial court may in its discretion exclude the evidence 
iii exhibit s deposition of orr 
exhibit s purports to be extracts from orr deposition in which she states that bourdeau saw negative documents about her at the fdic in connection with boa.it lacks a reporter certification and does not identify the names of the deponent and the action.it is therefore not authenticated.ordinarily,it would have to be excluded.
however,a more complex problem arises when a district court admits into evidence,as it did here,a document that has been authenticated by a party but excludes the same document on the ground of inadequate authentication when submitted by another party orr submitted exhibit s in support of her opposition to boa motion for summary judgment.the district court found that the extracts of orr deposition contained in exhibit s were not authenticated.it excluded exhibit s from evidence despite the fact that boa had authenticated orr deposition and relied upon it in the summary judgment motion.we must determine whether under these circumstances,the district court abused its discretion in excluding exhibit s because of inadequate authentication.
the third circuit examined this issue in in re japanese prods.antitrust,cir,rev on other grounds by matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.it held that the trial court erred in finding that two diaries were authenticated as to some defendants but not others.see id.it explained 
the evidence which suffices to establish authenticity should be evidence that is relevant on the limited question of genuineness that is,evidence admissible against the party having such a relationship to the proffered materials that it is likely to know the facts as to genuineness.once a prima facie case of genuineness against that party is established,the court should regard the materials as sufficiently authenticated against all parties,subject,of course,to the right of any party to offer evidence to the ultimate disputing authenticity.the other parties are adequately protected,with respect to trustworthiness,by the requirement that the court must still rule on admissibility.
we have previously held that a district court admission of unauthenticated evidence in a summary judgment motion is harmless error when the same item of evidence has been authenticated by an opposing party.see cristobal,at hal roach studios,at.we now hold that when a document has been authenticated by a party,the requirement of authenticity is satisfied as to that document with regards to all parties,subject to the right of any party to present evidence to the ultimate disputing its authenticity see in re japanese,at.thus,we recognize that an inquiry into authenticity concerns the genuineness of an item of evidence,not its admissibility.see wright gold,federal practice procedure evidence at once evidence offered against one party is deemed authentic,its authenticity is established as against all other parties as well.
exhibit s,which contains four pages of orr deposition testimony,was not properly authenticated by orr.however,because these pages were included in portions of orr deposition authenticated by boa,the district court manifestly erred in its decision to exclude exhibit s for inadequate authentication 
iv exhibit b deposition of bourdeau 
orr also failed to authenticate exhibit b,which contains an extract from bourdeau deposition in which he states that boa submitted disparaging documents about orr to the fdic however,because bourdeau deposition was authenticated by boa,the district court manifestly erred in excluding exhibit b for inadequate authentication.see in re japanese,at.
b trial transcripts 
exhibits h,j,p,w,and x purport to be transcripts of testimony from the bourdeau trial.they do not identify the names of the witness,the trial,and the judge and are not certified copies of the reporter transcript.accordingly,they are not authenticated.see.c requiring that testimony stenographically reported and offered into evidence at a later trial be proved by the transcript thereof duly certified by the person who reported the testimony beyene,at steven roscoe turner aeronautical,cir an uncertified copy of testimony is inadmissible in a summary judgment proceeding.
mirch can not authenticate these exhibits by stating in his affidavit that they are true and correct copies.his statement lacks foundation even if he were present when the witnesses testified at the bourdeau trial.see beyene,at pavone,d at.
c documents obtained in discovery 
i exhibit c memo discussing fbi report on orr 
exhibit c purports to be a memo,dated and written on nevada department of financial institutions ndfi letterhead,from bob geerhart geerhart to scott walshaw walshaw,both agents of the ndfi.in this memo,geerhart discusses an fbi report identifying orr as a suspect in a deposit theft at boa.the memo identifies both the author and recipient and contains a signature next to their names.however,it lacks foundation because orr has failed to submit an affidavit from geerhart stating that he wrote the memo mirch affidavit does not lay a foundation for exhibit mirch neither wrote the memo nor witnessed geerhart do so,and he is not familiar with geerhart signature.see hal roach studios,at canada,at.
moreover,exhibit c is not authenticated by having been produced in discovery in the bourdeau action.orr has not identified who produced it,and neither geerhart nor the ndfi have admitted to producing the memo further,neither geerhart nor the ndfi is a party in orr action against boa.exhibit c is therefore inadmissible it matters not whether exhibit c is hearsay.
ii exhibit m letter from the ndfi to bourdeau 
exhibit m purports to be a letter from walshaw to bourdeau,permitting tahoe bank to transact business preliminary to its organization.it is not authenticated because orr has failed to submit an affidavit or deposition testimony from walshaw stating that he wrote the letter.because orr attempted to introduce exhibit m by attaching it to mirch affidavit,federal rule of civil procedure e requires that mirch have personal knowledge of the letter.had orr submitted the letter by attaching it to an exhibit list rather than to mirch affidavit,the alternative means to authentication permitted by federal rule of evidence b and would have to be considered orr did not do so.the district court exclusion of exhibit m was therefore proper.
iii exhibit q letter from fdic to bourdeau 
exhibit q purports to be a letter from the regional director of the fdic to bourdeau denying tahoe bank application.it provides y our departure from bank of america under unfavorable circumstances reflect s poorly on your stability for positions as a director or senior officer.
the district court properly found that exhibit q was not authenticated because orr introduced the letter by attaching it to mirch affidavit.mirch lacks personal knowledge of the letter the district court exclusion of exhibit q was therefore proper.
as discussed above,the district court finding that exhibits b and s were not authenticated was erroneous.our next inquiry is whether the exhibits are inadmissible hearsay.hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.in the absence of a procedural rule or statute,hearsay is inadmissible unless it is defined as under federal rule of evidence d or falls within a hearsay exception under rules,or.see.federal practice procedure evidence at.
we review the district court construction of the hearsay rule de novo and its decision to exclude evidence under the hearsay rule for an abuse of discretion.see united states bao,cir.we find that exhibits b and s are both inadmissible hearsay.
a exhibit b 
exhibit b consists of an extract from bourdeau deposition.in that extract,he states that when he visited the fdic,an employee gave him an fbi report which stated that orr had failed her polygraph and was a suspect in a deposit loss at boa.bourdeau also states that the same employee told him that boa had submitted negative documents about orr to the fdic.exhibit b was offered by orr to establish that boa had submitted negative documents about her to the fdic.it was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is thus hearsay.see.c.there being no exceptions,exhibit b is inadmissible.
b exhibit s 
exhibit s is an excerpt from orr deposition in which she states that bourdeau told her that he saw disparaging documents about her at the fdic.it was offered by orr as circumstantial evidence to show that boa submitted these documents to the fdic.although it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,it is nonetheless hearsay.orr seeks to draw the inference from it that boa submitted the documents to the fdic.this inference depends on the truth of bourdeau statement that he actually saw the documents.see.c united states cowley,cir holding that the postmark on a letter is hearsay when offered to prove that the letter was mailed from a particular location united states jefferson,cir whether evidence is offered as circumstantial evidence as opposed to direct evidence has nothing to do with whether it constitutes inadmissible hearsay in other words,the inference that boa submitted disparaging documents about orr to the fdic depends on whether bourdeau actually saw the documents at the fdic.bourdeau statement to orr is therefore hearsay.there being no applicable exceptions,it is inadmissible 
ii.certain tort claims by orr are barred by nevada statute of limitations.
orr contends the district court erred in finding that the statute of limitations governing her tort claims began to run in september when she was told by bourdeau that boa had submitted negative information about her to the fdic.
whether a claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations is reviewed de novo.see santa maria pac.bell,cir.when the statute of limitations begins to run is a question of law also reviewed de novo.see harvey waldron,cir in re delaurentiis entm t group,cir.
orr discovered or should have discovered the necessary facts supporting her tort claims by september.
under nevada law,which governs orr tort claims,the statute of limitations begins to run when the wrong occurs and a party sustains injuries for which relief could be sought.petersen bruen.however,when a plaintiff has not discovered her injury or cause of injury at the time of its occurrence,the statute of limitations is tolled until the injured party discovers or reasonably should have discovered facts supporting a cause of action.see siragusa brown,sorenson pavlikowski.
whether a plaintiff has discovered or should have discovered the cause of her injury is ordinarily a question of fact.see siragusa,at.however,when uncontroverted evidence proves that the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the facts giving rise to the claim,such a determination can be made as a matter of law.id.at.
orr contends she did not discover the cause of her injury until when she came across documentary evidence exhibit c in bourdeau trial indicating that the fdic had received an fbi report suspecting her of criminal conduct at boa.orr,however,testified in her deposition that by september,bourdeau told her that boa had made negative comments about her to the fdic and that she did have any reason to doubt that.despite her absence of doubt,she failed to investigate this matter.this is evident from her deposition testimony i wanted it to go away.i was just wanting to move on with my life.orr failed to exercise reasonable diligence in attempting to discover the cause of her injury.this bars her from asserting a discovery rule tolling defense to nevada statute of limitations.see siragusa,at.thus,we conclude that orr discovered or should have reasonably discovered the necessary facts supporting her tort claims by september and that the statute of limitations for these claims began to run at that time.
nevada limitations period bars some of orr tort claims.
orr complaint contains tort claims for intentional interference with existing contractual relations,intentional interference with prospective business relations,business disparagement,slander,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.under nevada applicable statute of limitations,orr had two years from september to file her third,fourth and fifth tort claims.see.c providing a limitations period for a n action for libel,slander,assault,battery,false imprisonment or seduction.e providing a limitations period for an action to recover damages for injuries to a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another 
orr filed her complaint against boa on august.the statute of limitations on her claims for business disparagement,slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress began to run in september and expired in september.accordingly,these tort claims are.
however,orr claims for intentional interference with existing contractual relations and intentional interference with prospective business relations are subject to nevada limitations period and are thus not see.c sorenson,at.the district court contrary finding was erroneous.
iii.orr tort claims are unsupported by evidence.
the error,however,was not prejudicial.orr surviving tort claims fail for lack of evidence.these claims are based on boa alleged submission of disparaging information about orr to the fdic.however,there is no admissible evidence to support this claim.orr reliance on bourdeau deposition testimony in exhibit b is unavailing because it is inadmissible hearsay.
moreover,the record supports boa position.orr admits in her deposition that she does not know with certainty whether boa submitted disparaging documents about her to the fdic.castle and underwood assert in their affidavits that they disclosed nothing about orr to the fdic.further,the fbi agent who administered orr polygraph test said he did not disclose its results to boa or anyone outside the fbi.
orr contention is further undermined by the nevada supreme court holding in bourdeau,which suggests that information disclosed by boa employees to the fdic in its investigation of orr fitness to serve as an officer of tahoe bank would be subject to conditional privilege.boa would not be liable unless it made the statements with actual malice,knowledge of their falsity,or reckless disregard for their truth.see bourdeau,at.
orr has failed to establish that boa made any statements about her to the fdic.nor can she establish that the alleged statements were made with actual malice,knowledge of their falsity,or reckless disregard for their truth.orr tort claims thus fail for lack of evidence.see celotex catrett,d the moving party burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact can be met simply by showing an absence of evidence sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.beyene,at.
iv.there is no triable issue of material fact as to orr claims for violation of rico,the sherman act,and the employee polygraph protection act.
rico mail wire fraud 
to maintain a viable private rico action,orr must establish that boa engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.a c schreiber distrib.furniture,cir.racketeering activity is defined by b as any act indictable under enumerated criminal statutes,including,which criminalizes mail fraud,and,which criminalizes wire fraud.see b.the elements of mail and wire fraud consist of a scheme or artifice devised with the specific intent to defraud and use of the united states mail or interstate telephone wires in furtherance thereof.see franciscan ceramics,at.
orr contends boa engaged in a scheme to defraud the organizers of tahoe bank by submitting negative information about her to the fdic in an attempt to prevent the formation of tahoe bank.however,orr has presented no admissible evidence to substantiate this claim.indeed,orr can not establish that boa was ever in possession of her polygraph test results or the corresponding fbi memo that allegedly suspected her of criminal conduct.
nor can orr establish that boa submitted negative information about her to the fdic.the only evidence supporting this accusation is contained in exhibits b and s,which are inadmissible hearsay.in the absence of evidence of a scheme to defraud,orr can not establish a pattern of racketeering activity.thus,orr rico claim fails.see rothman vedder park,cir franciscan ceramics,at.
sherman act,
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations.to prevail under of the sherman act,orr must establish that boa entered into a contract,combination,or conspiracy,which unreasonably restrained trade,affected interstate commerce,and caused her injury compare sicor cetus,cir,with kaiser cement fischbach and moore,cir w ithout a showing of injury,plaintiff can not recover.
in her antitrust claim,orr contends that boa entered into an agreement with other banks in incline village to restrain competition by preventing the formation of tahoe bank,and that it accomplished this by submitting disparaging information about orr to the fdic.however,there is no evidence of an agreement among boa and other banks in incline village to prevent the formation of tahoe bank.indeed,orr admits in her deposition that she is not aware of any such agreement.moreover,orr reliance on bourdeau deposition testimony in this regard is unavailing because it is inadmissible hearsay.nor can orr establish a restraint of trade because the nevada banking company purchased tahoe bank and opened a branch in incline village that became successful beyond orr wildest dreams.
orr has failed to present any admissible evidence in support of her antitrust claim.to defeat summary judgment,she must respond with more than mere hearsay and legal conclusions.kaiser cement,at.she must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus,at.antitrust case.the district court grant of summary judgement on this claim was therefore proper see sicor,at.
employee polygraph protection act eppa 
the eppa,restricts employers from using,taking adverse employment action on the basis of,or disclosing information obtained from an employee polygraph test.see,saari smith barney,harris upham,cir veazey communications cable,cir.section of the eppa prohibits an employer from disclosing information about an employee polygraph test to anyone other than the following the employee or a person designated in writing by him,the employer that requested the test,any court or governmental agency pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction,and a governmental agency,but only insofar as the disclosed information is an admission of criminal conduct.
orr contends boa disclosed her polygraph test results to the fdic in violation of the eppa.in support of her position,she relies on exhibits b,x,and however,none of these exhibits are admissible.exhibit b is inadmissible hearsay.exhibits x and y are not authenticated.orr eppa claim thus fails for lack of evidence establishing that boa disclosed the results of her polygraph test.
v.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying orr request for a continuance.
orr contends the district court abused its discretion in denying her request to continue the june,summary judgment hearing because her counsel was in trial at the time and the fdic had not produced certain subpoenaed documents.
we review the district court denial of orr request for a continuance for an abuse of discretion.see weinberg whatcom county,cir united states shirley,cir.there was no such abuse.
the district court had continued pretrial dates on two prior occasions.the final pretrial order set discovery for april,and the last day for hearing dispositive motions for june.it stated no further continuances will be permitted.given the discovery of april,orr request for a continuance to obtain additional discovery from the fdic was groundless.orr should have filed a motion to compel production of documents prior to the discovery.
orr request for a continuance due to scheduling conflicts was likewise devoid of merit because two previous continuances to pretrial dates had been granted.moreover,orr had notice from december,that the final day for filing dispositive motions was june,and that no further continuances would be granted.that orr counsel was in the midst of another trial on the day of the summary judgment hearing does not as a matter of right entitle her to a continuance.orr lacked diligence as she waited for two weeks after being served with the summary judgment papers before seeking a continuance.despite this,the district court gave orr five days to cure the evidentiary defects in her opposition papers following the hearing.she failed to do so.under these circumstances,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying orr request for a continuance.see canada,at.
vi.boa motion for sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal.
boa moves for sanctions against orr for filing a frivolous appeal pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure.we deny boa motion because some of orr evidentiary arguments are meritorious,and the result of the appeal is not obvious see goss golden sheet metal,sheet metal workers int union,cir gayle,fed.sav.loan ins,cir.
conclusion 
orr exhibits are mostly inadmissible due to lack of authentication or hearsay.as a consequence,she can not raise a triable issue of material fact as to any of the counts in her complaint.further,even if meritorious,some of her tort claims are barred by nevada statute of limitations.we thus affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
there is no admissible evidence indicating whether orr passed or failed her polygraph.
therein,geerhart states i read the fbi report and it did reflect a high degree of suspicion on the part of orr,however,she was never charged,nor were her accounts ever investigated by the fbi,because they did not have enough evidence to proceed.it is the fdic position that they can not use the fbi report because it was given in confidence,with no legal action taken against robin orr,however,it does present a problem of security to the new bank.chris collella of the fdic informed me that he intends only to advise examiners to be watchful of her activities,if fdic issue insurance,and the bank is opened with her as operations officer.
the court held that statements made by boa employees to the fdic in its investigation of bourdeau fitness to serve as an officer of tahoe bank were subject to conditional privilege.the privilege could be overcome by showing that the statements were made with malice,knowledge of their falsity,or reckless disregard for their truth.see bank of am.b
