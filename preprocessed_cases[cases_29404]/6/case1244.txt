plaintiff scott holcomb challenges the judgment entered after the trial court sustained demurrers to each of his claims against defendants wells fargo bank wells fargo and dan viles,a wells fargo and branch manager.holcomb contends he properly alleged causes of action for negligent misrepresentation,breach of contract,and negligence.wells fargo contends holcomb claims fail because a wells fargo had an absolute right to charge back a provisional credit it had given to holcomb on a check when the payor bank dishonored the check b holcomb breach of contract cause of action failed to specify whether the contract was written or oral and c a depositor may not bring a claim for negligence against a bank.
we conclude holcomb complaint adequately stated a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation because it alleges viles,as wells fargo branch manager,assured holcomb he could write checks against his deposit,despite knowing the payor bank had dishonored the deposited check.we agree with wells fargo,however,that holcomb breach of contract cause of action fails to adequately describe the contract and the terms purportedly breached.finally,we conclude holcomb negligence claim fails because it a duplicates his negligent misrepresentation claim,and b fails to allege wells fargo breached any duties it owed to holcomb.we also conclude,however,that the trial court should grant holcomb an opportunity to amend his negligence cause of action.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
according to holcomb complaint,he maintained a personal checking account with bank and a business checking account under the name holcomb enterprises with wells fargo.on or about july,holcomb obtained a loan from fhl financial group fhl,and received a check representing the loan proceeds.holcomb deposited the check into his bank account.the branch manager assured holcomb bank would not hold the funds,allowing holcomb to immediately write checks against the deposit.
on august,holcomb wrote a check against the bank account,and deposited it into his wells fargo business account.the wells fargo teller told holcomb a hold would be placed on his deposit until wells fargo could verify the funds with bank.around august,holcomb received a telephone call from viles,who informed holcomb that the funds had been verified and that he could begin using the funds deposited.holcomb then began writing checks on his wells fargo account.
holcomb,however,later received notices that checks written on both his bank and wells fargo accounts were being returned due to nonsufficient funds.holcomb learned the check drawn on his bank account had been returned for nonsufficient funds.although bank told holcomb wells fargo had never presented the check to it,holcomb later discovered that wells fargo presented the check to bank on august,which bank rejected due to held funds.to make up the shortfall in the wells fargo account,wells fargo requested that holcomb obtain a cashier check from bank and deposit it in his wells fargo account,which holcomb did on august.the following day,holcomb discovered his wells fargo account was overdrawn by.the cashier check holcomb deposited was still in the wells fargo branch and had not been sent out for processing.wells fargo later withdrew from holcomb bank account and returned the cashier check.
because bank improperly placed a hold on holcomb account,and failed to honor holcomb check when presented by wells fargo,holcomb suffered damage to his finances and credit.for example,telecheck,a national check verification service,placed a disapproval ban on checks from holcomb enterprises because an august check to compusa had bounced.one of holcomb vendors,techdata,closed holcomb enterprises account because of a dishonored check.us bank admitted it had mishandled holcomb account,and attempted to repair the damage to holcomb credit,but continued to make errors which ruined holcomb credit rating and required him to refinance his house at an interest rate approximately three times greater than he would have received had his credit been intact.
holcomb sued bank,wells fargo,viles,and others for damages arising from the hold placed on his bank account.after the court sustained bank demurrers with leave to amend,holcomb filed his first amended complaint,alleging claims against wells fargo and viles for negligent misrepresentation second cause of action,breach of contract fourth cause of action and negligence sixth cause of action.the trial court sustained demurrers to the second and sixth causes of action without leave to amend,and sustained demurrers to the fourth cause of action with leave to amend.holcomb declined to amend his fourth cause of action,and the trial court entered judgment dismissing holcomb action as to wells fargo and viles.holcomb now appeals.

discussiona.the trial court erred in sustaining demurrers to holcomb negligent misrepresentation cause of action without leave to amend 
the trial court sustained demurrers to holcomb negligent misrepresentation and negligence causes of action because it interpreted copesky superior court d.copesky and mitsui manufacturers bank superior court d.mitsui,to prohibit a depositor from bringing a tort cause of action against a bank neither of these cases,however,stands for this proposition.
copesky considered whether a depositor could state a tort cause of action against the depositor bank for allegedly breaching its fiduciary duty by wrongfully cashing checks without proper signatures.copesky held simply that banks,in general,are not fiduciaries for their depositors and that the relationship is not a special relationship,such as to give rise to tort damages when an implied contractual covenant of good faith is broken.copesky,supra,d at.although the plaintiff in copesky had included a negligence cause of action in his complaint,the defendant did not challenge this claim in the trial court or on appeal.similarly,mitsui held that a borrower could not assert a tort action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against a lender.holcomb is not seeking to recover tort damages for violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but for negligent misrepresentation and negligence.thus,neither copesky nor mitsui applies to the present
