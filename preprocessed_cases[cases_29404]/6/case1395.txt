we have for review buckeye check cashing,cardegna,so d dca,which expressly and directly conflicts with the decision in fastfunding the company,betts,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons expressed below,we quash the decision of the fourth district court of appeal in buckeye,and approve the decision of the fifth district court of appeal in fastfunding.we hold that an arbitration provision contained in a contract which is void under florida law can not be separately enforced while there is a claim pending in a florida trial court that the contract containing the arbitration provision is itself illegal and void ab initio.
factual background 
the relevant facts in buckeye are summarized by the district court opinion 
appellant,buckeye check cashing,timely appeals from an order that denied its motion to compel arbitration and to stay proceedings.we reverse and remand.
appellees brought a class action lawsuit against appellant.they alleged that appellant made illegal usurious loans disguised as check cashing transactions in violation of various florida statutes.in response,appellant filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay proceedings,pursuant to the provisions for arbitration contained in the deferred deposit and disclosure agreement signed by appellees.the agreement provided in pertinent part 
arbitration provisions.any claim,dispute,or controversy whether in contract,tort or otherwise,whether,present,or future,and including statutory,common law,intentional tort,and equitable claims arising from or relating to this agreement or the validity,enforceability,or scope of this arbitration provision or the entire agreement collectively claim,shall be resolved,upon the election of you or us or said,by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,and shall be governed by the federal arbitration act faa,sections.
appellees filed a memorandum in opposition to appellant motion to compel arbitration in which they argued that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced because it is contained in an illegal usurious contract and is,therefore,void ab initio.
buckeye,so d at.the district court continued 
the trial court denied appellant motion to compel arbitration,relying on party yards,templeton,so d dca,and fastfunding betts,so d dca.appellant contends the federal arbitration act applies and that the trial court erred when it failed to construe the arbitration provision in a manner consistent with prima paint flood conklin manufacturing,d,and its progeny.appellant also contends the trial court misplaced its reliance on party yards and fastfunding.we agree.
buckeye,so d at.the fourth district reversed the trial court decision and held that cardegna challenge to the underlying contract validity must be resolved by an arbitrator,not a trial court.
the petitioners claim that the fourth district holding in buckeye conflicts with the fifth district decision in fastfunding,holding that arbitration could not be compelled under a contract that would be void under florida law and that the issue of the contract legality must be determined in florida courts.
fastfunding 
in fastfunding,fastfunding the company,appealed a trial court order that denied fastfunding motion to compel arbitration.see fastfunding,so d at.the complaint asserted that under the guise of a payment instrument sale,fastfunding compelled the payment of unconscionable,usurious interest rates on check cashing loans,in violation of various florida statutes.id.at.pursuant to the arbitration clause of the contract,fastfunding moved to compel arbitration.id.fastfunding motion was denied by the trial court.id.
fastfunding appealed the trial court ruling to the fifth district court of appeal,which,consistent with its recent decision in a similar case,held that the trial court properly denied fastfunding motion to compel arbitration.the district court reasoned if betts is correct in her complaint that the contract violates the usury laws,then the contract is illegal and an arbitrator could not require betts to perform under the contract.pursuant to party yards,the trial court was correct in refusing to order the parties to arbitrate betts claims.fastfunding,so d at.
in the earlier decision,party yards,templeton,so d dca,the district court held that w here the facts alleged by the plaintiff are sufficient to put the making of a lawful agreement at issue,the trial court must determine the validity of the agreement before compelling a party to submit to arbitration.id.at.judge sharp,writing for the district court,reasoned 
a court failure to first determine whether the contract violates florida usury laws could breathe life into a contract that not only violates state law,but also is criminal in nature,by use of an arbitration provision.this would lead to an absurd result.legal authorities from the earliest time have unanimously held that no court will lend its assistance in any way towards carrying out the terms of an illegal contract.illegal promises will not be enforced in cases controlled by federal law.
id.at citation omitted.thus,the fifth district concluded a party who alleges and offers colorable evidence that a contract is illegal can not be compelled to arbitrate the threshold issue of the existence of the agreement to arbitrate only a court can make that determination.id.at.we agree with judge sharp reasoning and analysis.
prima paint 
buckeye asserts that the supreme court decision in prima paint flood conklin manufacturing,d,supports the fourth district decision and requires that an arbitrator resolve cardegna illegality claim,because the parties agreed in the contract to be governed by the federal arbitration act and the cases applying the act.
in prima paint,the supreme court resolved the issue of whether a claim of fraud in the inducement of the entire contract is to be resolved by the federal court,or whether the matter is to be referred to the arbitrators.id.at.having acknowledged that various courts have differed in their approach to resolving this question,the court agreed with the approach of the second circuit court of appeals that the arbitration clause contained in a contract may be severable from the contract itself,and that where no claim is made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself,a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.id.at.in so holding,the court looked to the express language of the united states arbitration act now known as the federal arbitration act faa,which required a federal court to order arbitration to proceed if it determined that the making of the arbitration agreement itself or failure to comply with the arbitration agreement was not in issue.see prima paint,at.the court reasoned that this requirement reflected the intent of congress to provide a speedy remedy for parties who elected to resolve disputes via arbitration.id.at.
however,we conclude that the rationale of prima paint should not be extended to the facts of this case.there is a key distinction between the claim in prima paint and the claim presently before us in prima paint,the claim of fraud in the inducement,if true,would have rendered the underlying contract merely voidable.in the case before us today,however,the underlying contract at issue would be rendered void from the outset if it were determined that the contract indeed violated florida usury laws.therefore,if the underlying contract is held entirely void as a matter of law,all of its provisions,including the arbitration clause,would be nullified as well.
appellate courts in other states have also distinguished prima paint and reached conclusions similar to those of the fifth district in fastfunding and party yards.see rosenthal great western fin.sec,cal th,d,stating that contracts that render an agreement void ab initio are not arbitrable of aspen,innovative communications,stating that if a party asserts that the entire contract is illegal,the court must determine this threshold issue.a number of federal courts have likewise distinguished prima paint and declined to extend its holding to instances where a party claims that a contract was void from its inception.see spahr secco,cir holding that the rule announced in prima paint does not extend to a case where a party challenges a contract on the basis that the party lacked the mental capacity to enter into a contract sphere drake ins.all am.ins,cir concluding that as arbitration depends on a valid contract an argument that the contract does not exist ca logically be resolved by the arbitrator sandvik ab advent int l,cir stating that prima paint holding dealt strictly with fraud in the inducement of the larger contract and made no broader pronouncements regarding void agreements chastain,cir stating that prima paint has never been extended to require arbitrators to adjudicate a party contention,supported by substantial evidence,that a contract never existed at all three valleys mun.water dist.hutton,cir limiting prima paint to voidable contracts and holding that a challenge to a signatory authority to bind plaintiffs to an agreement must be resolved by a trial court.we agree with the reasoning of these cases distinguishing prima paint.
we acknowledge that recently,under similar facts,the eleventh circuit court of appeals rejected the argument that a contract legality was to be determined by a trial court,not an arbitrator.see bess check express,cir.in that case,the plaintiffs also challenged the legality of a check cashing contract arbitration clause.the eleventh circuit held that because there was no dispute about the plaintiffs assent to the contract itself,the contract was presumptively valid,and any disputes,including those about the validity of the contract,were to be determined by an arbitrator.id.at.however,the case presently before us is distinguishable because bess was expressly resolved under federal law,not state law principles.the court said in reaching our decision,however,we are not deciding questions of alabama contract law rather,we are deciding the scope of the district court authority under,a question of federal law.bess,at emphasis supplied.
we conclude that florida public policy and contract law prohibit breathing life into a potentially illegal contract by enforcing the included arbitration clause of the void contract.florida law has long held that contracts which are determined to be against public policy and void should not be enforced.a contract which violates a provision of the constitution or a statute is void and illegal and will not be enforced in our courts.harris gonzalez,so d,dca.this court itself long ago declared 
the inherent and inalienable right of every man to enter into contracts or refuse so to contract is not only recognized but well established.competent persons have the utmost liberty of contracting and when these agreements are shown to be voluntarily and freely made and entered into,then the courts usually will uphold and enforce them.the general right to contract is subject to the limitation that the agreement must not violate the federal or state constitutions or state statutes or ordinances of a city or town or some rule of the common law.
wechsler novak,so d.as others have also noted,contracts in violation of statutory prohibitions are void,and issues arising under such contracts are therefore not arbitrable,at citing martin domke,commercial arbitration ed.
in other words,there are no severable,or salvageable,parts of a contract found illegal and void under florida law.judge sharp observation in party yards,that a contrary holding would lead to an absurd result is right on point.we do not believe federal arbitration law was ever intended to be used as a means of overruling state substantive law on the legality of contracts.
conclusion 
accordingly,we hold that where a party sufficiently alleges that a contract is void for violation of florida usury laws,the florida courts,and not an arbitrator,must first determine the contract legality before a party may be required to submit to arbitration under a provision of the contract.hence,cardegna claim that the underlying check cashing contract is illegal and void ab initio as being usurious must be resolved by a trial court before arbitration of any other disputes may be compelled.we approve the fifth district opinions in fastfunding and party yards,and we quash and remand buckeye for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
i agree with justice cantero that the issue before us is one of federal law,and in that respect i agree that the decisions of federal courts of appeals should be considered as persuasive authority on the issue.but i do not agree with the conclusion reached by justice cantero or the federal decisions on which he relies.although we should carefully consider the decisions of federal courts on issues of federal law,we are not bound by such decisions.until the united states supreme court resolves the issue,we must independently consider the federal question for ourselves.because i disagree with the conclusions that have been reached by the federal courts cited by justice cantero,i join the majority decision.
i will begin by briefly restating the issue.the petitioners hereinafter referred to collectively as cardegna,the named petitioner entered into numerous transactions also known as payday loans with buckeye check cashing.cardegna brought a class action on behalf of himself and those similarly situated in which he argues that these transactions were actually nothing other than usurious loans under florida law,which would make the contracts void ab initio and unenforceable.buckeye sought to stay the trial court proceedings and compel arbitration of cardegna claims pursuant to the arbitration clause contained in the contracts.the arbitration clause provided that 
a ny claim,dispute,or controversy whether in contract,tort or otherwise including statutory,common law,intentional tort,and equitable claims arising from or relating to this agreement or the validity,enforceability,or scope of this arbitration provision or the entire agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision.
buckeye check cashing,cardegna,so d,dca.
the language of the arbitration clause certainly was broad enough to cover the claims brought by cardegna.the clause even goes so far as to purport to settle the very issue before us the clause provides that even a claim relating to the validity or enforceability of the arbitration clause itself,or a claim relating to the validity or enforceability that is,the legality of the agreement as a whole,will be submitted to arbitration.so the scope of the arbitration clause agreed to by the parties is not in question.nor is cardegna assent to the arbitration clause in question cardegna does not claim that he did not assent to the clause,and he does not claim to have been defrauded into giving his assent to the clause.
it is also important to note that cardegna does not claim that the arbitration clause itself separately,as opposed to the contract as a whole somehow is invalid.his claim,rather,is that the contract in its entirety is invalid and unenforceable because the transaction underlying the contract was illegal.that the transaction is not yet been decided.indeed,the issue before us here is who will or must decide that issue a court or an arbitrator.the issue,in other words,is whether the trial court was bound to enforce the arbitration clause and required to compel arbitration of cardegna claims.the majority holds that it was not,and i agree.
to explain why i agree with the majority that the trial court was not required to enforce the arbitration clause and compel arbitration of cardegna claims,i begin with the language of the federal arbitration act faa.the faa provides that 
a written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
essentially,the faa requires that an arbitration clause be treated in the same manner as any other contractual provision legislatures can not create rules,and courts can not apply rules,that discriminate against or give a status to arbitration clauses.see,southland keating,d.the faa does not require,however,that state courts treat arbitration clauses more favorably than they would treat any other contractual provisions.see terminix dobson,d by passing the faa,congress intended courts to enforce arbitration agreements into which parties had entered,and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.internal brackets,quotation marks,and citations omitted.
i believe the decisions cited by justice cantero go too far towards treating arbitration clauses as a class of super clauses,immune from a state otherwise generally applicable contract law.i do not believe the faa was intended to preempt a state generally applicable consumer protection laws as opposed to laws directed specifically at the validity or enforceability of arbitration clauses,either in general or in certain types of contracts,see,southland,at,and to require the arbitration of the very legality of the underlying contract of which the arbitration clause was a part under a state usury laws.the state regulatory authority in the consumer protection arena could be severely weakened if predatory lenders are allowed to circumvent the state courts and direct to arbitration claims that their lending practices violate state law.see joshua welsh,comment,has expansion of the federal arbitration act gone too far enforcing arbitration clauses in void ab initio contracts,marq.
if the transactions at issue here are determined by a state court not to be illegal per se,then of course any particular claims or disputes arising out of the transactions would presumably be referable to arbitration.but the question here is whether there even was an agreement to enforceable agreement to arbitrate.the faa directs courts to place arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts,but it does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so.equal employment opportunity comm waffle house,d quoting volt info.sciences,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.whether a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists is a threshold question that must be answered by the courts,and it must be answered by reference to the state generally applicable contract law cardegna does not dispute that he assented to the arbitration agreement but assent alone does not make for a valid and enforceable contract.there is more to the making of the arbitration agreement,dissenting op.at,than mutual assent.by examining arbitration clauses only for assent,justice cantero and the federal circuit courts approach does not simply treat arbitration clauses separate ly or independently,dissenting op.at,but differently.
the issue of the underlying contract legality must be determined by the courts before any claim or dispute arising out of the contract may be referred to arbitration pursuant to the contract arbitration because we are applying a more stringent standard to the enforceability of the arbitration clause a course of action that would violate the faa,but because we are,as the faa allows,applying the generally applicable grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.if,under florida law,no contract ever existed here,then by definition no enforceable agreement to arbitrate ever existed.the dissenting opinion and the federal decisions on which it relies have elevated arbitration clauses to a more favored status,exempting them from the state otherwise generally applicable contract law.the faa,however,mandates only that arbitration clauses be given equal status.in this case,if a valid and enforceable contract exists,then a valid and enforceable arbitration clause exists.the problem is that we do not yet know if a valid and enforceable contract exists.i therefore concur in the majority decision.
the issue in this case is not whether a contract is void as usurious.that issue will be determined under florida law.the issue here is who decides whether the contract is arbitrator,as provided in the contract itself,or the court.that issue must be decided under federal law,specifically the federal arbitration act.the majority confuses these issues.the majority also disregards the plain language of the federal arbitration act,fails correctly to apply the united states supreme court decision in prima paint flood conklin manufacturing,d,and either ignores or fails to distinguish the federal cases compelling arbitration in identical circumstances.i respectfully dissent.
i.the faa and prima paint 
contrary to the majority assumption,the issue in this case arises under federal,not florida,law.as no one disputes,the arbitration agreement itself provides that it is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,and shall be governed by the federal arbitration act faa,sections.the parties concede they are governed by the faa.
any discussion of the arbitrability of the parties dispute should therefore begin with the plain language of the conspicuously absent from the majority opinion.section of the faa provides that an agreement to arbitrate in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.section of the faa provides in pertinent part as follows 
the court shall hear the parties,and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement if the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure,neglect,or refusal to perform the same be in issue,the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.
emphasis added.therefore,as many courts have recognized,under the faa the issue for a court confronted with a plaintiff seeking to avoid arbitration is whether the plaintiff is contesting the making of the arbitration agreement or the underlying contract.
given the parties agreement to be governed by the faa,the district court in this case correctly recognized its task as simply to apply controlling federal law to the case at hand.see buckeye check cashing,cardegna,so d,dca see also jensen rice,so d,dca recognizing that the faa supersedes inconsistent state law and a s a result,florida courts must enforce arbitration agreements that are valid and enforceable under the faa,even where,as here,the arbitration agreement would not be enforceable under florida law.
federal law favors arbitration.as the united states supreme court has recognized,the purpose of the faa is to override the judiciary reluctance to enforce arbitration agreements.see volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.the faa places such agreements on the same footing as other contracts.id.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem.hosp.mercury constr,d.under the faa,questions of arbitrability must be resolved with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration,even when general state law principles of contract interpretation are applied.volt info,at.the faa establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone,at.
in concluding that the agreement enforceability should be decided in arbitration,the district court relied in part on prima paint,where the united states supreme court addressed whether the federal court or an arbitrator is to resolve a claim of fraud in the inducement,under a contract governed by the faa.at.see so d at.citing to section of the act quoted above,which requires arbitration to go forward if the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court concluded that the statute itself answers the question.at.that is,the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.id.at.emphasis added.the court held that a court may adjudicate a claim of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,id.at,because then the issue is the making of the arbitration agreement.thus,a court may consider only issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate.id.at.emphasis added.as the court stated 
accordingly,if the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause issue which goes to the making of the agreement to federal court may proceed to adjudicate it.but the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally we hold,therefore,that in passing upon a application for a stay while the parties arbitrate,a federal court may consider only issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate.
id.at.footnote omitted emphasis added.
applying these principles,the court held that because the fraud claim did not specifically address the arbitration agreement and the arbitration clause was sufficiently broad to encompass the dispute,including legal issues,the parties must proceed to arbitration.id.at.
the import of prima paint,then,is that under the faa,arbitration agreements or arbitration clauses contained in contracts are treated separately from the underlying contracts.the faa expressly limits courts to determining whether the making of the arbitration agreement the underlying disputed.the only exception,as explained later,is where a party contests its very assent to the underlying contract,and therefore to the arbitration agreement as well.
the majority violates the faa express directive.it dismisses prima paint as applicable only to opposed to.nothing in that opinion makes that distinction,and even though the issue in that case involved a voidable was allegedly fraudulently court did not limit its holding.sandvik ab advent int l,cir noting that the dissenting opinion in prima paint impl ies that the majority rejected the distinction.nor can its holding logically be limited to such contracts because the court interpreted the plain language of the faa,which does not exempt from arbitration allegations that the underlying contract is void.the court did acknowledge a in the statute not between void and voidable contracts.such a distinction is arbitrary and totally disconnected from the statutory language.rather,the court distinguished between issues concerning the making of the underlying contract,which are arbitrable,and issues concerning the making of the arbitration agreement,which are not.
ii.federal appellate cases on point 
in the last three years no fewer than three federal courts of appeals have decided the precise issue we confront,under the faa,the issue of whether a transaction is void as usurious is for the court or the arbitrator to decide.every one unanimously has held that the issue is one for the arbitrators.nevertheless,the majority fails to distinguish one of them and simply ignores the others.
most recently,the eleventh circuit court of appeals decided this issue.in bess check express,cir,the plaintiffs had signed deferred payment transactions containing arbitration agreements governed by the faa.they filed a class action suit against check express,alleging that the transactions constituted usurious loans under state law.id.at.when check express invoked the arbitration clause,the plaintiffs contended that the court,not an arbitrator,must decide the legal question of whether the transactions were void as usurious.the court recognized that its task was not to determine the legality of the contract,but simply to address the threshold question of who should decide the issue,the arbitrator or the court.id.at.noting that the faa limits courts to the issue of the making of the arbitration agreement,the court concluded that it must determine whether the allegation that the underlying contract was illegal placed at issue the making of the arbitration agreement.id.the court emphasized that the plaintiffs did not dispute having assented to the underlying contracts.the court thus concluded that the question of the legality of the contract was for the arbitrator because the case fell within the normal circumstances where the parties have signed a presumptively valid agreement to arbitrate any disputes,including those about the validity of the underlying transaction.id.at citing chastain,cir.
the majority acknowledges bess,but distinguishes it on the purported ground that the federal court was deciding an issue of federal law,while this court is deciding an issue of state law.majority op.at.that conclusion is blatantly wrong.
the majority cites a footnote in which the eleventh circuit stated the following in pertinent part 
colburn contends that we are bound by alabama law in deciding defenses to the arbitration agreement,and therefore,alabama case law requires that the void ab initio argument be decided by the court.in reaching our decision,however,we are not deciding questions of alabama contract law rather we are deciding the scope of the district court authority under the faa,a question of federal law.
the identical situation exists here.just as the eleventh circuit did not decide questions of alabama law,we are not deciding questions of florida law.specifically,we are not deciding whether the contract is usurious.the sole issue before both courts is the same who decides the legality of the underlying contract the issue here,as in bess,is one of federal law because the faa governs the arbitration agreement.bess can not be distinguished.
the fourth circuit court of appeals also has addressed the precise claim presented here.in snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir,cert.denied,d,the court considered whether the plaintiff contention that a deferred deposit transaction,such as the one in this case,was a usurious loan void under maryland law was subject to arbitration.noting that the plaintiff did not dispute that the faa governed the arbitration agreement or that her claim fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement,the court applied prima paint and the faa requirement that the party contesting arbitration must allege grounds relating to the arbitration clause,not the underlying contract.id.at.the court concluded that under the severability doctrine of prima paint,arbitration must proceed because the plaintiff allegations of usurious rates of interest d id not relate specifically to the arbitration agreement nor did they underlie a claim that the plaintiff failed to assent to the terms of the agreement.id.at.
finally,in burden check into cash of kentucky,llc,cir,cert.denied,d,the plaintiffs also alleged that the check cashing agreements they signed were usurious in violation of state law and therefore void.the court concluded that because the plaintiffs admitted assenting to the agreements,the challenge to the legality of the underlying contract constituted a challenge to the substance,rather than the existence,of the loan agreements.id.at accord furgason mckenzie check advance of indiana,no,wl,holding that a plaintiff can not avoid arbitration by alleging or showing the illegality of a payday loan contract see also sweet dreams unlimited,int l,cir holding that under prima paint the claim that the underlying contract should be rescinded because it violated state law was subject to arbitration under the broad scope of the contract arbitration clause.
we should follow bess,snowden,and burden,which considered the identical issue under identical facts and held that,under the plain language of the faa,the issue of whether a transaction is usurious must be determined by the arbitrators.these decisions are persuasive on matters of federal law.see state dwyer,so d,stating that federal court rulings are persuasive.
justice bell,specially concurring,agrees with me that the
