the practical effect of the statutory scheme is to permit a chartered housing creditor to make a loan either under state law,in which case the loan transaction remains subject to the full range of state regulations,or under federal law,in which case the loan transaction becomes subject to federal regulations governing similar loans by federally chartered lending institutions.chartered housing creditors exercise this regulatory option by affirmatively complying with substantive federal regulations identified by the office of thrift supervision.in return for exercising this option,the chartered housing creditor is promised parity with federally chartered lenders.see.as the senate report relevant to the act observes,the parity act does not place chartered housing creditors under the supervision of the federal agencies,but instead merely enables them to follow a federal program as an alternative to state law,at.
in april,the compliance connection,the official newsletter of virginia state corporation commission,announced its position that the parity act did not preempt virginia statutory law limiting prepayment penalties.the newsletter explained that congress explicitly restricted the office of thrift supervision authority to preemption of only such state laws as related to features not common to traditional,transactions the virginia statutes applicable to prepayment penalties govern a longstanding feature of conventional mortgage lending which congress left to state law the newsletter announced that the bureau of financial institutions will continue to cite violations of virginia statutes relating to prepayment penalties.it noted that licensees would have to notify borrowers of virginia prepayment penalty limits and to refund prepayment penalties.the letter also stated,in addition to possible revocation of license,such violations can be referred to the attorney general office for investigation pursuant to virginia code.

virginia argues principally that the scope of preemption effected by the parity act does not preclude it from regulating prepayment penalties in alternative mortgage transactions.it argues,
s tate laws that do not prevent or interfere with alternative mortgage transactions are not preempted.congress defined alternative mortgage transactions in to be loans involving terms not common to traditional,transactions.prepayment penalties were obviously not included in this definition,because they were and are common to traditional real estate financing.hence,because the virginia statutes do not interfere with the making of alternative mortgage transactions,they are not preempted.

in enacting the parity act,congress clearly intended to preempt state law to the extent it authorized chartered housing creditors to take advantage of the federal regulations for alternative mortgage transactions that govern federally chartered lending institutions.section a of the parity act states that the office of thrift supervision ots,formerly known as the federal home loan bank board,as well as other agencies,have recognized the importance of alternative mortgage transactions and have adopted regulations authorizing federally chartered depository institutions to engage in alternative mortgage financing.a.and continues,it is the purpose of this title to eliminate the discriminatory impact that those regulations have upon nonfederally chartered housing creditors and provide them with parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the federal agencies.id.b.
