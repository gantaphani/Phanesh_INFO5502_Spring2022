uncontested facts 
agosto became gdb president on january,at which time he extended all probationary periods then in effect and ordered an be conducted by all recent appointments,including those of plaintiffs,to determine whether any violated the applicable law and regulations.both plaintiffs allege discriminatory adverse employment actions resulting from this investigation.
plaintiff aguiar 
on april,aguiar was appointed executive director of the tourism development fund,a trust position with a salary of.that salary was increased to on july.in august,the gdb human resources office prepared an announcement for the position of assistant director of private finance.the requirements for the position included 
a bachelor degree in accounting or finance from an accredited university or college six years of experience in loan analysis and administration,two of those years in personnel supervision functions bilingual spanish and english or in its place 
b master degree in accounting or finance from an accredited university or college five years of experience in loan analysis and administration,two of those years in personnel supervision bilingual spanish and english.
jaime lópez lópez,director of private finance at gdb,reviewed these requirements before the announcement was published,met with aguiar to discuss his eligibility for the position,and subsequently eliminated the education prerequisites and the requirements for experience in loan analysis and administration.in their stead,he established a much lower threshold of qualifications for the,six years of experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing,two of which must have entailed the planning and coordination of financing services including personnel supervision.despite the fact that gdb had classified the position of assistant director of private finance as one that categorically required a degree in accounting or finance,the announcement was published with no such requirements.aguiar does not have a degree in accounting or finance and would not have been eligible for the position if lópez had not changed the requirements.
aguiar applied for the position of assistant director of private finance and was appointed,effective september,subject to the standard six month probationary period.at that time,aguiar qualifications for the position included four years and eleven months experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing,two of which related to planning and coordination of financing services.when he was certified as eligible for the position,one additional year of employment which time he served as an administrative counted toward the requirement of six years experience in the analysis and administration of private sector financing,despite the fact that his duties as an administrative officer did not include those activities.
the position of assistant director of private finance was a permanent career position,with an annual salary of.aguiar continued to occupy the position of executive director of the tourism development fund,for which he received a differential compensation of annually.the sum of his salary and the differential was,which is the same salary that he had received as executive director of the tourism development fund prior to his promotion.according to gdb personnel regulations,a differential can only be authorized,with written justification,when the geographic location,the extraordinary job conditions or the extraordinary difficulties regarding recruitment or retention of personnel in certain positions justify the use of additional incentives to the ordinary salary.there is no evidence on the record of a valid justification for the differential.
on june,agosto notified aguiar that serious irregularities had been identified with regard to his appointment as assistant director of private finance.these included a the impermissible elimination of the educational prerequisite from the published requirements for the position b the fact that aguiar did not have the six years required relevant experience and c the fact that aguiar simultaneously occupied two positions at gdb.after an administrative hearing during which aguiar had the opportunity to present evidence,his appointment was declared null and void,and he was reinstated to a previous and finance officer at the tourism development fund,effective july.
plaintiff reyes 
reyes applied for the position of senior account executive at gdb on august.the requirements of the position included two years of experience in financing,investment,or professional accounting functions,one of which must have entailed credit analysis or the administration of financing accounts or investment portfolios.reyes resumé did not initially list any duties related to financial analysis,and she was asked to submit a new certification.her new certification,listing financial analysis responsibilities,was submitted on september.on that date she was certified as eligible for the position and appointed to the position of senior account executive,effective september,subject to a probationary period.
reyes was appointed after ten other candidates had previously been certified as eligible,despite the fact that gdb personnel regulations stipulate that t he eligibles included in each certification must be the first ten that appear in the register,willing to accept the appointment under the conditions stipulated.reyes salary was set at,more than the minimum salary for the position,despite the fact that gdb personnel regulations provide that every person will receive as salary for their services the minimum rate established for the class to which their position is assigned.only where there is difficulty in recruitment,extraordinary qualifications of the candidate,or needs of the service,may an employee be awarded a salary higher than the minimum.the director of human resources stated that reyes had vast experience in the field of financial analysis,despite the fact that her credentials do not appear to support such an assessment,and reyes claims that she had extraordinary qualifications because she was bilingual,organized,met her deadlines,and stayed at a previous post for seven years.
reyes probationary period was extended when agosto took office as gdb president,and caballero found several irregularities upon review of her appointment.among them were a the fact that,in violation of gdb regulations,reyes was certified as eligible for the position after ten other candidates had been certified and b the fact that a higher salary was recommended without a valid justification.on june,agosto notified reyes of the irregularities,and after an informal hearing at which she had the opportunity to present evidence,reyes was terminated,effective july.
ii.analysis 
noncompliant brief 
as an initial matter,defendants claim that plaintiffs brief on appeal to this court fails to comply with the local rules adopted by this circuit.specifically,local rule d stipulates that t he court will not receive documents not in the english language unless translations are furnished.cir.d.nevertheless,plaintiffs appendix contains pages in spanish,with no accompanying english translation.in the past,we have refused to consider materials submitted to the court in any language other than english,and we continue to do so.see,cir.
however,we do not think the exclusion of these untranslated materials will have any significant effect on the strength of plaintiffs case because most,if not all,of these appendix pages appear to constitute exhibits to plaintiffs opposition to summary judgment.because the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion unopposed,we conclude that these exhibits were not relevant to decisionmaking below.on appeal,w e review only the materials actually relied upon below united states robinson,cir.because these exhibits were not considered below,we can not consider them now.
summary judgment 
plaintiffs do not challenge the district court determination that defendants motion for summary judgment was unopposed,or that defendants factual assertions were uncontroverted,and thus we do not consider those issues.nevertheless,entry of a summary judgment motion as unopposed does not automatically give rise to a grant of summary judgment.instead,the district court is still obliged to consider the motion on its merits,in light of the record as constituted,in order to determine whether judgment would be legally appropriate.mullen paul fire and marine ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in this appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court grant of summary judgment was not legally appropriate.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.reckitt colman,cir.summary judgment is properly granted if the movant can demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.it is that before granting an unopposed summary judgment motion,the court must inquire whether the moving party has met its burden to demonstrate undisputed facts entitling it to summary judgment as a matter of law.lópez corporación azucarera de puerto rico,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in a political discrimination claim under,plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants deprived them of federally protected rights while acting under color of state law.fagundo,cir.they must further establish that they have engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.the burden then shifts to defendants to demonstrate that i they would have taken the same action in any event and ii they would have taken such action for reasons that are not unconstitutional.id.at.
in this inquiry,although we are constrained by the uncontested facts as accepted by the district court,we construe the record in the light most favorable to the party,tobin liberty mut.ins,cir.there is no doubt that the adverse employment actions in both cases took place immediately after the administration change following the pdp victory in the elections,when defendant agosto directed caballero to conduct an audit of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with gdb personnel regulations.plaintiffs claim that caballero audit was selective because it only affected npp members,but this allegation is entirely unsupported and it is,in any event,not persuasive.even if the personnel actions taken during the relevant period involved npp members,official review of such employment decisions does not support a claim of discrimination.as we have observed,
i f uniformly applied personnel practices,predicated on legitimate reasons,result in terminations,those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted.it is in the nature of a change in administrations that job actions by the new party in power will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.
cir.we evaluate each plaintiff allegations in turn.
plaintiff aguiar claims that he was reinstated to his previous position because of political discrimination.however,aguiar is not certain that defendant agosto was even aware of his political affiliation.in fact,his only specific allegation as to the knowledge of any government official of his political affiliation is that former gdb vice president zaida marrero knew of his political leanings when she hired him for a position with the municipal collection revenue center crim several years earlier,before her retirement in.thus,aguiar has not demonstrated that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in his reinstatement to his previous career position.even if,arguendo,he had made such a showing,defendants have alleged facts in support of their healthy claim that aguiar appointment violated gdb personnel regulations,and thus that they would have removed him from the position of assistant director of private finance regardless of his political affiliation because,among other reasons,he was not qualified for the position.although aguiar now claims that the administrative hearing that gave rise to his removal from his position was pro forma,a sham and a subterfuge,this allegation is conclusory and devoid of any substantiation.as we have repeatedly intoned,we do not consider conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.emmanuel int l of teamsters,local union,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.aguiar offers nothing more.
plaintiff reyes claims that she was terminated because of her political affiliation.however,she admits that she never told anyone at gdb about her political affiliation,claiming only that people must have known because of her relationship with aguiar and the fact that she had been employed under the previous administration.reyes does not elaborate as to the nature of this relationship with her and so we have no basis upon which to evaluate that argument.further,we do not find persuasive her claim that the simple fact of her employment prior to the election would have been sufficient to put her and employers on notice of her political inclinations.as plaintiffs point out,they need not produce direct evidence of discriminatory treatment a smoking gun to establish a prima facie case of politically discriminatory demotion or termination,cir.nevertheless,more is required than reyes bare allegations in this case.we find that she has not discharged her burden to demonstrate that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for her termination.however,even if she had made a prima facie case for political discrimination,defendants have presented a legitimate,explanation for her,that her appointment violated gdb personnel regulations.
in addition to their first amendment claims,both plaintiffs allege violations of their fourteenth amendment right to due process.specifically,aguiar and reyes claim deprivation of their property interests in employment without a meaningful hearing.defendants respond,consistent with the district court opinion,that because plaintiffs appointments were made in violation of gdb personnel regulations,plaintiffs had no property interests in their positions and thus
