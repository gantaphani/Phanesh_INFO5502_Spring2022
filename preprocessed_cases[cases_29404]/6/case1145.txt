discussion 
appealability 
mountain lion,mountain lion llc,andy maxwell,and dennis scott carruthers argue appellant appeal is not proper with respect to them because the record reveals no judgment against them and no resolution of mountain lion complaint.
we disagree with these respondents apparent contention that the lack of a document titled judgment is dispositive.the trial court granted these respondents motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered appellant be dismissed.this order was written,signed by the trial court,and filed in the action.all dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes code civ.
however,we agree that the lack of a resolution on mountain lion complaint is relevant with respect to whether this judgment is final and appealable as to mountain lion.a judgment is not final and not appealable when it decides the issues in a but not the issues in a complaint,unless the sought separate and independent relief by or against different parties,or the judgment or order on the leaves no issues to be determined as to one party.westamerica bank mbg industries,th.mountain lion was the plaintiff on the complaint,and the record reveals no final resolution of this complaint.
accordingly,with respect to mountain lion the judgment on the is not yet appealable,because it does not resolve all the issues between appellant and mountain lion.with respect to the remaining respondents,however,who were not plaintiffs and as to whom no issues are left to be resolved,the judgment on the is final and appealable.we will dismiss the appeal as to mountain lion only.
ii.section a 
appellant argues the sale of her consumer debt to entities that were neither licensed finance lenders nor institutional investors violated section a.we disagree.
the finance lenders law requires all persons engaged in the business of making consumer loans be licensed,subd.a.section a provides a licensee may sell promissory notes evidencing the obligation to repay loans made by the licensee pursuant to this division or evidencing the obligation to repay loans purchased from and made by another licensee pursuant to this division to institutional investors,and may make agreements with institutional investors for the collection of payments or the performance of services with respect to those notes.appellant argues this language stating a licensee may sell notes to institutional investors means that licensees may not sell notes to anyone else,apart from other licensees.respondents contend the statute grant of permission to sell to institutional investors does not preclude sale to any other party.
the starting point for determining an issue of statutory interpretation is the statutory language.tarrant bell property,llc superior court cal th,tarrant bell.as respondents argue,u nder principle s of statutory construction,we ordinarily construe the word may as permissive and the word shall as mandatory.ibid.however,we find this principle of limited utility in the present case.no party is contending section a requires licensees to sell their notes to institutional investors.the issue is whether it permits licensees to sell their notes to institutional investors and other parties,or whether it permits licensees to sell their notes only to institutional investors.
respondents also argue that neither section a nor any other provision of the finance lenders law expressly prohibits a licensee from selling debt to a investor.we are not persuaded to end the inquiry there,however.if the finance lenders law permits licensees to sell debt to anyone,as respondents contend,section a appears on its face to be unnecessary.such an interpretation would contravene the principle of statutory construction directing us to assume that every part of a statute serves a purpose and that nothing is superfluous.in re cal th.moreover,as appellant argues,another principle of statutory interpretation,commonly known under the latin name of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,is that the expression of one thing in a statute ordinarily implies the exclusion of other things.ibid.
these principles appear to weigh in favor of appellant interpretation.however,neither of these principles of statutory construction is applied invariably and without regard to other indicia of legislative intent.thus,we have explained that the rule against interpretations that make some parts of a statute surplusage is only a guide and will not be applied if it would defeat legislative intent or produce an absurd result.citation.and we have said that courts do not apply the expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle if its operation would contradict a discernible and contrary legislative intent.in re,supra,cal th at.
because the statutory language is ambiguous,we may properly consider other indicia of legislative intent,including relevant legislative history.tarrant bell,supra,cal th at.section a was enacted,under a different section number,in.stats,ch,enacting.the legislative history reveals a very specific purpose to permit licensees under the finance lenders law to sell notes secured by real property to institutional investors without having to also be licensed as a real estate broker.an assembly floor analysis explains present law regulating finance lenders is silent concerning the authority of these lenders to sell and service promissory notes.the real estate law,however,requires any person engaged in assigning notes to the public to be licensed under that law.fina
