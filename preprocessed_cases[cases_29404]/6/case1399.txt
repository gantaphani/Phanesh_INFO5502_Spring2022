appellant lehman brothers bank,fsb appeals from a superior court order affirming a decision by the state bank commissioner the commissioner assessing additional franchise tax and penalties against the bank for the tax years,and.we affirm that portion of the order upholding the imposition of additional franchise tax,reverse that portion upholding the assessment of penalties,and remand the case for further proceedings.
facts and procedural background 
the material facts are undisputed.since the,lehman brothers holdings,lbh has operated a mortgage business whose activities consist of acquiring,and earning interest on,mortgages issued by independent mortgage lenders and brokers or by lbh subsidiary mortgage company,aurora loan services,aurora.before,lbh mortgage business was funded by unsecured bank loans,commercial paper,or short and repurchase agreements.because this type of funding was unstable,lbh actively sought to acquire a federal savings bank,specifically to gain access to federal home loan bank fhlb funding,which was a more stable and efficient funding source.
in,lbh acquired delaware savings bank,fsb,a federal savings bank organized under the federal home owner loan act,and subject to regulation and supervision by the united states office of thrift supervision,and changed its name to lehman brothers bank,fsb the bank.the bank federal stock charter,which became effective on june,designated wilmington,delaware as the bank home office.that designation enabled the bank to access fhlb funds from the pittsburgh fhlb.
the bank maintained a retail banking in wilmington,personal banking services.that retail operation was not profitable.the bank profitable operation was its mortgage banking business in that latter business,the bank had two primary sources of funds for acquiring mortgages i funds derived from sales of certificates of deposit representing of the total funds and ii funds derived from fhlb loans representing of the total.using those funds,the bank acquired mortgages in one of three ways outright purchase direct origination and origination through a correspondent lender the bank customarily held the mortgages for practice generating interest income that represented about of the bank total income.after days,the bank then sold the mortgages to its parent company,lbh,making no profit on the transfer.
most of the bank senior management was based in new york,and the bank board of directors met approximately eight times a year in new york.for the tax years in question,about persons were employed at the delaware home office.half of the delaware employees engaged in retail banking activities,and half performed accounting and other support services for the bank as a whole.to conduct its mortgage banking business,the bank employed direct employees in new york all on the bank payroll,dual employees in new york persons on lbh payroll,for whose services the bank reimbursed lbh,and dual employees in colorado persons on aurora payroll,but for whose services the bank reimbursed aurora.
for each of the years at issue the bank filed a delaware franchise tax report.delaware imposes a bank franchise tax on the taxable income of banking organizations for the privilege of doing business in this state the measure of the franchise tax depends importantly on whether the banking organization here,a federal savings bank is domiciled in delaware under.a subsection a,a federal savings bank with its principal office in delaware is taxed on all its taxable income but,under line b of its return,a bank may deduct from its reported income the portion that was earned from activities conducted outside delaware by branches or subsidiaries subject to income taxation under the laws of another state a line b deduction under.b subsection b,a federal savings bank not headquartered in delaware is subject to a more limited bank franchise tax,imposed only on the income of the bank delaware branches or subsidiaries,if any.the delaware bank franchise tax statute does not define the terms principal office or headquartered.for ease of reference,we sometimes refer to either of those terms,or both interchangeably,as domicile,or domiciled.
for the year,the bank filed its franchise tax return under subsection a,as had its predecessor the delaware savings bank,as a banking organization having its principal office in delaware.for that tax year,the bank reported all its income,but claimed a line b deduction to reflect its income from activities conducted outside delaware,even though the bank had no formally established branches or subsidiaries.the commissioner office made no objection to the bank franchise tax return for nearly three years.
the bank used the same approach in filing its franchise tax return for the tax year.the bank filed its return in under subsection a,as a banking organization having its principal office in delaware,and again claimed a line b deduction.thereafter,the commissioner contacted the bank to discuss the return.during those discussions,the commissioner requested,among other things,documentation to support the line b deduction.the statute allowing that deduction authorizes the taxpayer to deduct net operating income before taxes verifiable by documentary evidence from any subsidiary or branch.in response to that request,the bank submitted,in march,two apportionment schedules,consisting of charts listing income purportedly allocated and reported to other states.
in,the bank filed its franchise tax return,again under subsection a,and again claiming a line b deduction.by letter dated october,the commissioner advised the bank that its returns for the tax years were incorrect,because in the commissioner view the bank had no basis to claim a line b deduction.the commissioner then recalculated the bank tax liability based on the disallowance of the line b deduction,and also assessed late penalties.the bank disputed both the assessment and the penalties.that dispute prompted the commissioner to issue a notice of proceedings under.for purposes of finally determining the bank franchise tax liability for tax years,and.
in response to the commissioner disallowance of the line b deduction in its returns,the bank did not claim that deduction in its franchise tax return filed in.the bank filed its return under subsection a as instead of claiming a line b deduction,the bank reported only that portion of its income it claimed to be attributable to delaware on august,the commissioner issued a revised notice of proceedings,this time covering the bank franchise tax liability for all four years in question,and.an evidentiary hearing before the commissioner was scheduled for september and october.
after it received the commissioner august,notice,the bank submitted amended franchise tax returns for all four tax years.the basis for the amended returns was that,for all the years at issue,the bank was not domiciled in delaware,contrary to what the bank had represented in its original returns.therefore,the bank should be taxed under subsection b,only on the income earned from its delaware operations.in submitting those amended returns,the bank reported that it used a separate accounting method,based on a study prepared by ernst young,to segregate the income generated by the bank delaware retail operations from the income generated by the bank nationwide mortgage and trust operations.based on that accounting method,the bank claimed that it was entitled to tax refunds for all four years,totaling approximately million.
after the evidentiary hearing,the commissioner determined that because the bank was domiciled in delaware,subsection a of section was applicable.the commissioner further decided that the bank was not entitled to claim a line b deduction,because it had no branches or subsidiaries.therefore,the commissioner concluded that a franchise tax balance of million was due,and assessed late penalties for each tax year,at a daily rate of of the balance,to accrue at the same rate until the additional assessed tax was paid the late penalties imposed from march,the due date for the tax to may,the date of the commissioner decision totaled approximately million 
the bank appealed to the superior court,which upheld the commissioner decision.the superior court held that i the bank was domiciled in delaware for franchise tax purposes ii all of the bank interest income was earned in,and derived from,delaware iii the commissioner method of assessing the tax did not violate the commerce or the due process clauses of the united states constitution and iv the commissioner did not abuse its discretion by refusing to abate the tax assessment and the penalties.
this appeal followed.
the claims of error an overview 
on appeal,the bank advances several claims of error.the bank first claims that the commissioner and the superior court reversibly erred by concluding that the bank was domiciled in delaware and,thus,subject to section a.the bank takes the position that it was and is domiciled in new york,because most of the bank employees,including its senior management,work in new york.therefore,the bank claims,the applicable franchise tax provision is not section a,but section b,under which only the income attributable to a delaware branch is subject to tax.
second,and alternatively,the bank argues that even if section a is the applicable statute,the commissioner and the superior court reversibly erred in holding that the bank was subject to delaware bank franchise tax on of its income.that was error,the bank contends,because i the bank did not earn all of its income in delaware,and ii the statutorily prescribed manner of assessing the tax violates the commerce and the due process clauses.
third,the bank claims that the superior court reversibly erred in finding that the commissioner properly refused to abate the penalties.fourth,the bank argues that if this court finds that the bank is entitled to a tax refund,the bank is entitled to interest on that refund.these claims generate the issues presented on this appeal.
the first issue is whether the bank is domiciled in delaware.if the bank is not domiciled in delaware,then section b applies and the bank amended franchise tax under section b were correct,thereby entitling the bank to a tax refund.if,however,the bank is domiciled in delaware,then the bank is subject to section a,in which case the question becomes whether the bank was entitled to a line b deduction.we conclude that the bank was domiciled in delaware,and that under the applicable a the bank was not entitled to apportion its income by taking a line b deduction.
the next set of issues involve whether the delaware bank franchise tax statute violates the commerce the due process clause.we hold that the apportionment mechanism contained in the delaware statute which is not available to the bank in this case passes constitutional muster under the commerce and the due process clauses.
the final issue is whether the commissioner abused its discretion by refusing to abate the penalties assessed.we conclude that in these specific circumstances the commissioner abused its discretion by not abating the penalties and that the superior court erred in holding otherwise.
standard of review and analysis of the claims of error 
in reviewing an administrative agency decision,this court determines whether the factual findings of the agency are supported by substantial evidence on the record before the agency.where,as here,the agency has interpreted and applied statutory provisions,those determinations involve questions of law that this court reviews de novo 
section a is applicable because the bank was domiciled in delaware 
section a of the bank franchise tax statute applies to federal savings banks having their principal office in delaware.section b applies to federal savings banks that are not headquartered in delaware.from the structure of section,it is evident that the terms principal office and headquarter s are used interchangeably neither term is defined in chapter banking of the delaware code,of which section is a part.this court must therefore ascertain the meaning of those terms,which requires us to interpret the delaware bank franchise tax statute,as applied to a federal savings bank.
the bank argues that in interpreting the statute,the terms principal office and headquarter s must be given their ordinary meaning.according to the bank,the ordinary meaning is commercial domicile,defined as the place from which the trade or business is principally managed or directed.under that definition the bank commercial domicile would be new york,because the bank executive officers are employed in new york,its board of directors meets exclusively in new york,its regulatory examinations are conducted in new york,and most of its decisions are made in new york.
we disagree with the bank interpretation.the rule of construction which requires that an undefined statutory term be given its ordinary meaning does not apply to terms of art.under the general rules of statutory interpretation set forth in the delaware code,technical words and phrases must be construed and understood according to their peculiar and appropriate meaning.here,the terms principal office and headquarter s are terms of art and,therefore,must be given their peculiar and appropriate meaning.because those terms are used in a statute imposing a tax upon banking organizations entities that include federal savings conclude that the appropriate meaning of principal office and headquarter s is the meaning accorded those terms by the regulations that govern federal savings banks and their taxation.
the code of federal regulations cfr requires that all federal savings banks designate a home office.under the cfr,home office is synonymous with principal office.the latter term is employed in section of the delaware statute here,the bank federal stock charter explicitly designates wilmington,delaware as the home office.the cfr further mandates that if a federal bank wishes to change its home office address,it must apply to the united states office of thrift supervision ots the bank has never applied to the ots to change the location of its wilmington,delaware home office.therefore,under the cfr,the bank is domiciled in delaware.
other applicable regulations lead to the same conclusion.b prescribes that a federal savings bank may become a member only of,or secure advances from,the federal home loan bank of the district in which is located the institution principal place of business.here,the bank borrowed exclusively from the fhlb in pittsburgh,which serves not new savings banks.we regard this course of conduct as evidence that the bank considered its principal place of business to be delaware,not new york.
the delaware bank franchise tax statute also points to the conclusion that the bank is domiciled in delaware.although that statute does not define principal office and headquarter s,it does define a similar term located that appears in both subsections of section under,a savings institution is located in the state in which the amount of aggregate deposits of all its offices in that state is greatest.the bank had only one office where its deposit operations were conducted.that office was located in delaware.
finally,we note a recent amendment to the delaware bank franchise law that defines,for the first time,the term headquarters.under the new provision,the headquarters of a national banking association are located in the state of the bank home office as designated in its charter.although that amendment is effective for tax years and,thus,not applicable here,the definition it adopts is instructive and fully supports the interpretation reached here 
for these reasons,we conclude that both the commissioner and the superior court correctly held that the bank was domiciled in delaware for franchise tax purposes.as a consequence,section a was the applicable provision for computing the delaware bank franchise tax.
the bank is not entitled to a line b deduction under section a 
under section a,the entire net income of federal savings bank domiciled in delaware is taxed by delaware,unless that entity has an branch or subsidiary.in that case,the income attributable to the branch or subsidiary may be deducted from the total reported income,subject to certain limitations.for a line b deduction to be available,however,the income sought to be excluded must be a derived from business activities carried in other states through branches or subsidiaries,b verifiable by documentary evidence,and c subject to income taxation under the laws of another state the superior court and the commissioner held that the bank did not satisfy these conditions.we uphold their determination.
regarding the first condition,it is undisputed that the ots must approve the establishment of branches and subsidiaries,and that during the years in question the bank had no branches or subsidiaries the bank requested ots approval to open a branch in new jersey to be effective january,but it never sought ots approval to establish a new york branch.rather,the bank applied only for approval of an agency office in new york,solely to conduct trust activities.the distinction is significant,because agency offices are expressly excluded from the cfr definition of branch.
the bank asserts,nonetheless,that for franchise tax purposes it had de facto branches in the other states to which it paid more than million in state and local income taxes.this argument has no legal force.congress has decreed that any branches must be approved by the ots.that requirement reflects a policy judgment that a branch is more than a verbal is a geographical location where a monopoly activity may be lawfully conducted because approval of a branch authorizes the taking of deposits and the making of loans by the branch exclusively at that particular location,there is no such thing as a de facto branch in the federally regulated banking industry.
faced with this insurmountable legal obstacle,the bank attempts to circumvent it by arguing that requiring a taxpayer bank to establish a formal branch to avail itself of the line b deduction does not reflect modern banking practices.under such modern practices,the bank asserts,certain mortgage banking related activities may be conducted without prior ots approval,through an agency office.it is the case that federal savings banks are allowed,under federal law,to conduct limited activities through agency offices without ots approval even so,this limited exception does not aid the bank position,because the delaware bank franchise tax statute permits a line b deduction only on income earned by an branch or subsidiary,and,under federal law,an agency office is not a branch.accordingly,the commissioner properly held that the absence of any branches or subsidiaries precludes the bank from taking advantage of the line b deduction.
even if we accepted the bank argument that an branch was not required to enable the bank to take a line b deduction,other conditions for utilizing that deduction remain unsatisfied.first,the bank failed to provide either at the time of filing or after documentary evidence verifying that the portion of the income it sought to exclude from the taxable income reported in delaware was derived from business activities carried in other states.the only documents furnished by the bank were apportionment schedules that listed the percentages of the bank total income that were allocated to other states.those schedules did not explain how those percentages were calculated,and,moreover,covered only tax years and,even though the bank also claimed the line b deduction for tax year.as the superior court noted,the bank should have prepared a separate delaware balance sheet accounting for the money earned in delaware.second,the bank failed to prove that other states were taxing the line b deducted income.as the superior court found,the bank did not establish whether the other states taxed the same mortgage interest income,or if they taxed other transactions,such as an origination fee or transfer fee.
the bank is not entitled to any other apportionment 
having determined that the bank was not entitled to account for its operations by taking a line b deduction,we must decide whether the bank was allowed to apportion its income in some different manner.the bank claims that,to the extent the delaware statute does not allow apportionment,the united states constitution requires that result.specifically,the bank argues that the commissioner and the superior court reversibly erred in holding that delaware could tax of the bank income because i in fact,the bank did not earn all of its income in delaware,and ii the tax assessed on that counterfactual basis violates the commerce and the due process clauses.
we initially dispose of the bank first argument.the bank goes to great pains to argue that the activities which generated its funding and income all took place outside delaware,principally in new york.both the superior court and the commissioner determined,however,that all the bank income was actually earned in and derived from sources in delaware.under delaware taxation scheme,the entire net income of a federal savings bank having its home office in delaware is taxed by delaware,except for income attributable to branches or subsidiaries.under that scheme,where the bank income was in fact earned is not a relevant inquiry,because the statute authorizes delaware to tax the bank entire income to say it differently,to resolve the constitutional issues we need not determine what portion of the income was in fact earned in delaware and what portion,if any,was in fact earned elsewhere rather,the inquiry is whether delaware taxation scheme reasonably reflects the component of the activity being taxed under the commerce clause and whether there is a rational relationship between the taxed income and the values connected with the taxing state under the due process clause.for the reasons next discussed,we conclude that delaware bank franchise tax statute passes muster under both constitutional provisions.
commerce clause analysis 
the commerce clause authorizes congress to regulate commerce among the several states.although the commerce clause is expressed as an affirmative grant of power,the united states supreme court has consistently held that the commerce clause also contains a negative implication,known as the dormant commerce clause,which prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstate commerce 
a taxpayer challenging a state taxation statute carries the burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality with clear and convincing evidence to determine a statute constitutionality under the dormant commerce clause,the united states supreme court has consistently applied the complete auto transit,test.under that test,a tax will be upheld if it is applied to an activity having a substantial nexus to the taxing state,it is fairly apportioned,it does not discriminate against interstate commerce,and it is fairly related to the services provided by the taxing state the bank commerce clause claim is limited to the second prong of complete auto 
specifically,the bank argues that the delaware bank franchise tax is not fairly apportioned,because the statute does not allow a federal savings bank that is domiciled in delaware and has no branches to apportion its income to account for operations conducted in other states.the commissioner responds that the complete auto test,and its fair apportionment requirement,are inapplicable in this case.therefore,we must first address a threshold issue whether complete auto is applicable at all.we conclude that it is.
complete auto is applicable 
the commissioner contends that the complete auto test established to implement the dormant commerce clause does not apply here,for two reasons.first,the commissioner argues,congress affirmatively exercised its power to regulate interstate commerce in this area by enacting section h of the federal home owner loan act hola.therefore,the commerce clause is not dormant and may not be used as a basis to attack the constitutionality of a delaware statute adopted under the authority affirmatively delegated by the congress to the states in section h of hola.
we conclude that the dormant commerce clause is applicable.section h authorizes states to tax federal savings associations,but provides that such state taxes may not be greater than that imposed on other similar local mutual or cooperative thrift and home financing institutions.that is,congress affirmatively exercised its power to regulate the interstate commerce only in a limited way,to prohibit discriminatory state taxation of federal savings associations.congress did not,however,affirmatively legislate to regulate any other aspect of state taxation of federal savings associations.as the united states supreme court has held,federal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion,or that the congress has unmistakably so ordained.here,there is no unmistakable evidence that congress intended affirmatively to regulate the entire field of state taxation of federal savings banks.therefore,section h of hola does not displace the dormant commerce clause.
second and alternatively,the commissioner argues that even if the dormant commerce clause applies complete auto requirement of fair apportionment is limited to.therefore,delaware domiciliaries such as the bank may be taxed without any apportionment restrictions.stated differently,the commissioner urges that a state has the constitutional power to tax all of the income of its residents,no matter where that income is earned.
the united states supreme court has not yet decided whether a state may constitutionally tax the unapportioned net income of a domiciliary entity that derives income from other states in which it conducts business.this issue was addressed,however,by the supreme court of rhode island in commercial credit consumer services,norberg that case commercial credit involved a tax similar to the one at issue here,on banking institutions organized or incorporated under the laws of rhode island the taxing state.the tax was computed on net income from any sources.the rhode island statute allowed no apportionment,but permitted the domiciliary to deduct its ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business from gross income.those deductible expenses included taxes paid to other states in which the domiciliary conducted business.underscoring the novelty of the issue,the rhode island supreme court held that modern doctrine appears to permit,either under the commerce clause or the due process clause,a state to tax local businesses engaged in interstate commerce so long as the tax is applied to an activity that bears a substantial nexus to the taxing state,is fairly apportioned,does not discriminate against interstate commerce,and is fairly related to the services provided by the state,the complete auto requirements after conducting a complete auto analysis,the court concluded that the rhode island tax satisfied the commerce clause the court emphasized that it was a tax as opposed to a gross receipts tax,that the statute allowed for deduction of taxes paid in other states,and that the taxpayer entity had failed to clearly show what taxes had been levied by other states.
although the commercial credit case is not binding on us,we regard its complete auto is the appropriate analytical highly persuasive.here,like in commercial credit,the bank,although domiciled in the taxing state and having no branches or subsidiaries,was nevertheless engaged in interstate commerce.by parity of reasoning,we conclude that the complete auto test controls the commerce clause analysis.
complete auto fair apportionment requirement is satisfied 
we now reach the bank claim that the second prong of complete auto is not satisfied,because under the delaware statute the tax is not fairly apportioned.the applicable delaware bank franchise tax has a structural apportionment mechanism.first,a bank domiciled in delaware would not be taxed on income attributable to branches or subsidiaries,to the extent that other states tax that portion of the income.second,a bank not domiciled in delaware would be taxed only on the income attributable to a delaware branch or subsidiary.
the bank first contends that,by amending the statute in,the delaware legislature recognized the constitutional infirmities of the existing regime.under the amendment,a bank may choose to be taxed under the section method as occurred here or under an alternative method established in section which was not available to the bank for the tax years at issue.the alternative franchise tax is the sum of two components a tax on the entire net income that is apportioned to the state of delaware,and a location benefit tax reflecting the value of utilizing delaware banking laws and bank system.the three factors used for apportionment are property,payroll,and receipts 
we find no merit to the bank contention that the amendment exposes the constitutional infirmity of the scheme.absent legislative history showing the contrary,a statutory amendment will not be regarded as indicative that the predecessor version was unconstitutional here,the legislative history indicates that the purpose of the amendment was to promote economic development in delaware.there is no evidence of any purpose to correct any perceived unconstitutionality of the original version.
under complete auto second prong,a tax is fairly apportioned if it is internally and externally consistent nowhere in its briefs does the bank dispute that the internal consistency test is met.the superior court held that the internal consistency test was satisfied because i f every state franchise tax included mortgage interest only when its banks held the mortgages,there would not be multiple taxation.the bank does not challenge this determination on appeal.
what the bank claims is that the tax,as imposed,was not externally consistent because it was unapportioned and resulted in multiple taxation.the focus of the external consistency inquiry is upon the economic justification for the state claim upon the value taxed that inquiry is whether the factors used in the apportionment formula actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.the bank cites no cases addressing an apportionment system that is similar to that employed by the delaware statute.the federal cases cited by the bank merely reiterate the undisputed and proposition that external consistency mandates that states tax only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects the component of the activity being taxed.
delaware apportionment system is structural.that is,the bank franchise tax statute apportions income according to the banking entity structure home office,branches,and subsidiaries.structural apportionment is peculiarly tailored to banks,which are heavily regulated entities.the activities that a bank may conduct are restricted,the places branches,subsidiaries,agency offices where a bank may conduct those activities are specified,and both are subject to a detailed system of regulatory accounting and financial control.the bank argues that delaware structural apportionment system is flawed because the only permissible apportionment factor is the source of the income,where the income was earned,not how the entity is structured or how the income is earned.none of bank cited authorities supports its proposition apart from the requirement of reasonableness,the united states supreme court has expressly declined to impose constitutional constraints on a state selection of a particular income allocation formula as the commissioner observed,states have wide latitude in devising constitutionally sufficient methods of fairly apportioning the income delaware system need not be the only method of apportioning income,nor need it be the best method in the view of any particular taxpayer.the constitution does not require that delaware conform to the prevailing approach adopted by other states all that is required is that the system chosen be reasonable.in our view,that requirement is met here.
taxing the bank entire net income reasonably reflects the component of its activity,namely,that the funds generated by the bank domiciliation in delaware fueled lbh entire mortgage banking business.to acquire mortgages,the bank had two primary funding sources money generated by certificates of deposit sales and fhlb loans.the bank held the mortgages purchased with those funds for to days,and the interest accumulated during that period generated almost of the bank income the bank franchise tax is directed to that interest income,and only to that income.as the superior court correctly observed,delaware did not tax any other transactions.it did not tax the bank activities outside delaware,such as aurora lending in colorado.nor did delaware tax the loans and the interest income after they were moved from delaware to new york.
with respect to the first source of funding certificates of deposit,lbh would not have had access to it without the bank.only a bank may accept deposits and issue certificates of deposit therefore,the deposits were accepted at the bank and the certificates were issued in the bank name.these operations all took place in delaware.attributing income generated by deposits to the place where a bank has its franchise to operate and is the only location at which deposits are accepted,is reasonable.the bank home office was in wilmington,delaware.the bank sole retail banking office,where all deposits were received,was established and staffed in wilmington,delaware.that the bank had officers and employees at locations other than wilmington does not weaken delaware reasonable economic justification for imposing the tax.
regarding the second source of funding,only the bank,not lbh,could and did receive fhlb loans.by virtue of being a federal savings association,the bank was able to obtain loans from the pittsburgh fhlb.
the bank disputes this conclusion,arguing that lbh would have had access to federally insured deposits and fhlb loans from pittsburgh or elsewhere if it acquired any federal savings bank,not necessarily one chartered in delaware.but,lbh chose to acquire a delaware bank,and that choice resulted in significant benefits authorization to lend money outside the state in accordance with delaware laws without regard to the other states lending restrictions or usury laws fire and police protection access to courts and access to schools,health care,and welfare benefits for the bank employees those benefits are reasonably related to the bank presence in delaware.
the bank next urges that the external consistency test is not satisfied because the delaware bank franchise tax creates both threatened and actual multiple taxation.there is no constitutional prohibition against actual double taxation occasioned by two states having different apportionment systems in any event,the bank argument leads nowhere because the superior court found that the bank had failed to prove by clear and cogent evidence precisely what income if any was taxed by other states.as earlier explained,other than an unsupported one page document purporting to show that million in tax was paid to other jurisdictions,nothing in the record establishes actual multiple taxation or a significant threat thereof.thus,the external consistency requirement is met here,because the structural apportionment framework of the delaware bank franchise tax statute reasonably reflects and fairly measures the delaware components of the bank business.accordingly,delaware bank franchise tax does not violate the dormant commerce clause.
due process clause analysis 
the bank also challenges the constitutionality of the delaware bank franchise tax statute under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.for a state to constitutionally tax income generated in interstate commerce,the due process clause imposes two requirements a minimal connection or nexus between the interstate activities and the taxing state,and a rational relationship between the income attributed to the state and the intrastate values of the enterprise.the bank argues that delaware taxing of all the bank income violates due process because no rational relationship exists between the tax imposed by delaware and the income taxed,which,the bank urges,was earned from activities conducted outside of delaware.
the united states supreme court has held that the requisite nexus between the interstate activities and the taxing state is established if the taxpayer avails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business within the taxing state sufficient connection has been found to exist where the taxpayer maintains an office in the taxing state here,it is undisputed that the bank had the requisite minimum contacts with delaware the bank home office and the bank sole banking office were both located in wilmington,delaware.those contacts are sufficient to satisfy the due process minimal connection requirement.
for the second requirement to be satisfied,there must be a rational relationship between the taxed income and the values connected with the taxing state.the inquiry is whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection,opportunities and benefits given by the state.the privilege of carrying on a business in the state police and fire protection emergency health services public utilities and a safe climate to conduct business have been deemed sufficient to support imposition of the tax the superior court held that the bank receives many of delaware benefits and protection,thus satisfying this requirement.the record discloses no basis to disturb that finding.
for these reasons,the commissioner and the superior court correctly concluded that the delaware bank franchise tax,as applied to the bank,satisfies the due process requirements imposed by the united states constitution.
abatement of penalties 
finally,the bank claims that the commissioner erred by refusing to abate the assessed penalties,which,according to the bank,totaled million and were excessive compared to the activities conducted in the state.before reaching the issue of excessiveness,we note that the bank computation of the amount of penalties as million is factually incorrect the million includes the penalties million plus the additional tax liability assessed million,as of the date of the commissioner decision may,thus,the penalties imposed totaled million,not million as the bank claims.
turning to the legal merits,the commissioner assessed penalties under section e,which provides that i f any banking organization shall fail to pay any tax due under this chapter on or before the due date,a penalty of percent shall be assessed for each day that the same shall remain unpaid after such date.the commissioner refused to abate the penalties,holding that the amount was appropriate in relation to the activities the bank conducted and the income it earned in delaware,and was not excessive even though the review of the bank franchise tax returns for the years at issue did not begin until after march.under section,the commissioner is authorized to abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax,interest,penalty,additional amount or addition to the tax,or any liability in respect therefore,which is e xcessive in amount.the usage of the word authorized indicates that the commissioner has discretion whether or not to abate.the internal revenue code irc contains a virtually identical abatement provision which has been construed as conferring discretionary power to the taxing authority 
in considering whether to exercise that discretionary power,the commissioner held that the phrase excessive in amount should not be given an expansive meaning that includes some general notion of equitable fairness.starting from that premise,the commissioner mechanically applied the statutory percentage rate to the additional tax liability assessed,as of march,the due date for the tax.federal district courts and the united states tax court have held that a taxing authority abuses its discretion if it denies a taxpayer abatement request arbitrarily,capriciously,or without sound basis in fact or law.here,the record does not disclose any basis in fact for the commissioner refusal to abate,because the commissioner recited no specific facts to support its decision.we recognize that the applicable delaware statutes sections e and a,defining the penalty and,respectively,authorizing abatement afford little guidance as to the factors to be considered when assessing and when deciding whether to abate a bank franchise tax penalty.the counterpart provisions of the irc and of chapter taxation of the delaware code are instructive in this regard,however 
both section a of the irc and section of chapter distinguish between penalties for failure to file a return that results in failure to pay the tax,and penalties for failure to pay additional tax assessed following the taxing authority review of a filed return failure to file a return which did not occur here results in higher penalties,which are calculated to run from the day that the return should have been filed.in contrast,where a return is filed and additional tax is assessed,a penalty is due only if the taxpayer fails to pay the balance within a prescribed period of time from the assessment 
here,the commissioner assessed penalties at a daily rate of per day,running from march,when the bank franchise tax first became due.to assess penalties from march,in a case where no additional tax liability was assessed until october,appears arbitrary the commissioner insists that it was not required to notify the bank of the deficiency any sooner than it did,because the statute contains a three year period of limitations,which was observed but the statute of limitations is not the only factor informing the sound exercise of discretion.a directs that a s soon as practicable after any return is filed,the tax authority shall examine it to determine the correct amount of tax.here,the commissioner office did not object to the bank franchise tax return until nearly three years after that return was filed.indeed,not until the commissioner october,letter was the bank told that its returns for the tax years were incorrect.only at that time was the bank liability recalculated based on the disallowance of the line b deduction.
the commissioner rejected without explanation the bank contention that the three year administrative delay justified an abatement of penalties.before this court,the commissioner claims that the delay was attributable to the bank failure to submit the requested documentation in support of the line b deduction.that argument is flawed.the bank did provide certain apportionment schedules,and the commissioner and the superior court found that those schedules were insufficient to support a line b deduction.but,during oral argument before this court,the commissioner conceded that the submission of any documentation,however sufficient,would have been irrelevant,because the line b deduction was simply not available to the bank as a matter of law accordingly,for penalty abatement purposes,the commissioner may not rely on the bank failure to provide sufficient supporting documentation.
finally,chapter and the irc provide that penalties should not be imposed when the failure to pay the additional tax liability assessed is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.the united states supreme court held that reasonable cause exists where a taxpayer demonstrates that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence,and that willful neglect means conscious,intentional failure or reckless indifference.although it is for the commissioner,not this court,to determine whether the bank met these requirements,it is noteworthy that i the bank filed its original franchise tax returns consistent with the practice of its predecessor ii the timeliness of the bank filings is undisputed iii the bank requested,and relied upon,the opinion of an independent tax advisor ernst young before amending its returns in august iv the bank later obtained the opinion of a second independent tax advisor pricewaterhousecoopers v the bank contested in good faith the assessment of additional tax liability,before the commissioner,the superior court,and this court and vi the bank legal position with respect to the original and the amended franchise tax returns was not frivolous,and the filing of those tax returns was not fraudulent.
because the commissioner failed to consider any of the circumstances,we are constrained to conclude that the commissioner abused its discretion by refusing to abate,in an appropriate way,the penalties assessed.it follows that,in affirming the commissioner decision,the superior court legally erred.therefore,the penalty provision of the superior court order will be reversed,and the case will be remanded with instructions that the superior court remand the case to the commissioner to reconsider the bank request for abatement of penalties,in accordance with this opinion.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth,the judgment of the superior court is affirmed in part,and reversed in part and remanded.
