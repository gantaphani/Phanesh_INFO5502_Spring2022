following a flurry of investigations into the propriety of a single firm providing investment banking services to a publicly held corporation while at the same time opining as to the prospects of the corporation stock,the plaintiffs in this case sued one such firm,credit suisse first boston csfb.they alleged that they had sustained losses resulting from false and misleading statements made by csfb analysts with respect to the stock of agilent technologies,agilent.the district court,in a lengthy unpublished opinion,dismissed the plaintiffs consolidated and amended class action complaint after concluding that the plaintiffs had not met the pleading standards required for such claims.see in re csfb agilent,analyst reports sec,slip op.at.although the question is is very little authority dealing with the requirements for pleading subjective falsity in a misstatement of opinion conclude that the plaintiffs allegations are insufficient to show that csfb analyst reports concerning agilent its quondam investment banking client were at odds with the analysts privately held beliefs.consequently,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
in reviewing the dismissal of a civil action under rule b,we accept the factual averments of the plaintiffs complaint.see dep t of hous.urban,cir.we follow that praxis here.
agilent is a that provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications,electronics,life sciences,and chemical industries.its three primary lines of business include test and measurement,semiconductor products,and chemical analysis.the plaintiffs,appellants here,are members of a putative class of persons who acquired agilent stock at various times from december,through february,the class period.the gist of their complaint is that analysts at csfb,led by elliot rogers,issued reports recommending the purchase of agilent stock despite their lack of faith in the rosy picture they were painting.these bullish reports were issued,the plaintiffs say,in an effort to curry favor with agilent and thereby secure future investment banking business.a side effect,however,was an artificial inflation of the price of the stock resulting in a wide disparity between cost and true value.unaware of that disparity,the plaintiffs acquired agilent securities at prices and suffered losses when the stock plummeted.
csfb overarching fraudulent culture.
csfb is a global financial services firm,dealing,among other things,in investment banking and investment research.at all times material hereto,frank quattrone served as the head of csfb global technology group the tech group.although quattrone was an investment banker,he had complete control over the tech group research activities.in that capacity,he helped to determine the analysts compensation and had the power to terminate their employment.
quattrone omnipotence within the tech group allowed him free rein to set up a system in which the analysts were pressured,from time to time,to issue unduly positive ratings on certain stocks in order to improve the chances of garnering investment banking business for csfb.quattrone promised potential clients favorable analyst reports and then used a technique with his analysts to redeem those promises.during quattrone reign,an analyst bonus which comprised a major portion of his or her remuneration was likely to correlate positively to that analyst support of the tech group investment banking activity.conversely,analysts who issued negative reports risked being reprimanded and passed over for choice assignments.
csfb tied its analyst reports to a ranking format,composed of strong buy,buy,hold,and sell ratings.the plaintiffs,based on information gleaned from a former csfb employee,averred that the format was effectively condensed into three tiers dropping out the sell rating and was jiggled for the benefit of investment banking clients.allegedly,common practices included issuing a hold rating if the analyst actually believed stockholders should sell,affording a buy rating to virtually all investment banking clients or prospective clients,and using the strong buy rating only when the analyst actually believed that investors should purchase the stock.
the analysts attached to the tech group sometimes attended investment banking sales presentations,at which they would distribute sample reports invariably portraying the potential investment banking client in an attractive light.this participation was intended to assure prospective clients that they would receive the benefit of positive reinforcement from the analysts should they choose to retain csfb for their investment banking needs.
quattrone system initially proved to be a howling success in,for example,csfb managed more initial public offerings ipos in the united states than any other investment banking house.in the year,the tech group accounted for almost half of csfb revenue from equity investment banking in the united states.shortly thereafter,quattrone persistent dismantling of the compulsory chinese wall between banking and research,required by the national association of securities dealers nasd,inspired a series of governmental and regulatory investigations.in a single period,from the fall of through the following spring,massachusetts state securities regulators,the new york attorney general,the nasd,and the securities and exchange commission all initiated proceedings against csfb related to the internal conflicts of interest that allegedly had caused csfb analysts to view the stock of csfb present and potential investment banking clients through glasses.
csfb involvement with agilent.
csfb relationship with agilent began when the tech group,assisted by rogers,made a sales pitch to agilent top brass with an eye toward managing that company forthcoming ipo.agilent was impressed,and csfb helped to take the company public on november.the stock,initially priced at per share,closed at after its first day of trading.
on december,first day of the class initiated its analyst coverage of agilent stock with a buy rating contained in a report authored by rogers and two of his confreres.the report set a target price for the stock of per share.that day,the stock closed at per share,up from the previous day close.
csfb published a second report,authored by the same trio of analysts,on february.this report reiterated the earlier buy recommendation and explained that agilent growth was spurred by strong orders for semiconductor products up percent and reasonable gains in test measurement.it discussed agilent six percent increase in test and measurement t m orders under the heading good orders,but not explosive.that day,the stock closed at per share,down from the previous day close.
four days after issuing this buy recommendation,rogers sent the following to agilent director of investor relations 
tmo order growth was.communications test and semi test were highlighted as key growth drivers.one would expect communications test growth to top.growth in teradyne orders was above sequentially,credence jan orders were up over that amount.yet agilent tmo business only grew despite two seemingly hot markets.what retarded your growth,or were communications and semi test less hot than you let on 
on march,agilent stock closed at its class period high of per share.although the stock price tumbled thereafter,csfb analysts maintained a buy rating in their third report issued on may.that day the stock closed at per share,down from the previous day close.
on july,agilent released a statement indicating that third quarter earnings were expected to fall short of forecasts as a result of manufacturing constraints,component shortages,and sluggish sales attributable to two divisions.this press release came as a surprise to the market as a whole.the following day,the csfb analysts issued their fourth report.the report maintained the stock buy rating but flagged the surprise announcement and cautioned that agilent was rated a buy only in the most generous sense.the stock closed that day at per share,down from the previous day close.
on saturday,august,rogers received an from a csfb customer inquiring as to his outlook on agilent stock.rogers replied let see what they announce thurs pm.hopefully some meaningful restructuring of the two problem divisions.absent that would not be aggressive despite the price pullback.
after the market closed on august,agilent reported that its third quarter earnings were better than anticipated.the following day,the csfb analysts issued their fifth report which was the last report authored in whole or in part by rogers.this document cited the upbeat announcement and reiterated the familiar buy rating.that day,the stock closed at per share,up from the previous day close.
on october,a tech group analyst,tim mahon,sent an to a fellow csfb employee in response to a general question about how to rate a struggling stock when investment banking sensitivities existed.the read suggest you ask elliot rogers about the agilent.that where in writing you have a buy rating but verbally everyone knows your position.neither mahon nor the analyst whom he advised was ever involved in reporting on agilent securities.
in a november,to all tech group analysts,rogers used agilent as an example of how to draft analyst reports.under the heading wordsmithing,rogers wrote 
verbally,you can say a lot more than what you put into print without it coming back to haunt you he said,she said.that does not preclude you from making your point,subtly.for example 
agilent operations supposedly fixed in our quarter.ha fat chance while management plans on turning the operation around next quarter,we have chosen to give them more breathing room to allow for any slippage.as a result,our estimates are more conservative than management guidance,but allow for upside to our eps projections if they achieve their bogey on the stated timeline.
other csfb analysts issued agilent reports on september,november,and december.each report reaffirmed the buy rating.the per share stock price rose on the dates of the september and november reports up to and up to,respectively,but fell following the december report down to.
on february,last day of the class announced that it was trimming back its forecast of second quarter profits.that day,csfb issued a report downgrading agilent stock from buy to hold.the stock sagged to per share,down from the previous day close.
throughout the class period,members of the tech group investment banking team maintained contact with agilent executives regarding potential investment banking business.none materialized.
proceedings below.
against this factual backdrop,the plaintiffs sued csfb and rogers,claiming that the analyst reports constituted false and misleading statements actionable under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder.in addition,they brought section a control person claims against csfb and quattrone for allowing and condoning such behavior.see a.certain procedural skirmishing followed,none of which is relevant here.
after the plaintiffs filed a consolidated and amended class action complaint,the district court,on motions brought pursuant to.b,found the complaint allegations insufficient.specifically,the court dismissed the section b and rule claims for failure adequately to plead i any false or misleading statement,ii scienter,or iii loss causation.op.at.it simultaneously dismissed the section a claims as derivative of and,thus,sharing the frailty of the underlying section b claims.id.at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
in considering a motion to dismiss,the district court is bound to assume the truth of all facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff stated theory of liability.in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.the court is free,however,to disregard bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,and opprobrious epithets.chongris bd.of appeals,cir.we review appeals from the grant or denial of rule b motions de novo,using the same set of criteria that guided the district court.see,at.
the usual elements of a section b claim are that the defendant i made a material misrepresentation,ii with scienter,iii in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,iv on which the plaintiff relied,v to his or her detriment.dura,broudo,d.to satisfy the final loss element,a plaintiff must show both economic or transactional loss and loss causation.see id.
in cases involving publicly traded stock,the private securities litigation reform act pslra,makes these elements important not only as a matter of proof but also as a matter of pleading.in order to survive a motion to dismiss in such a case,a section b claimant can not take refuge in the generous notice pleading formulation of.a.rather,he or she must satisfy the more stringent guidelines of the pslra.with this in mind,we turn to that special set of pleading requirements as they pertain to this case.
as a condition precedent to pleading the first element of a section b claim,the pslra demands that a complaint specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.to achieve this benchmark,a complaint must provide factual support for the claim that the statements were fraudulent,that is,facts that show exactly why the statements were misleading.aldridge cross,cir.this support typically will include particularized allegations regarding the time,place,and content of the alleged misrepresentations.greebel ftp software,cir.despite these strictures,however,a pleading setting forth a section b claim need not be precise to the point of pedantry although it must set forth the supporting facts with particularity,it need not elaborate upon every jot and tittle of evidentiary detail.in re stone webster.sec,cir.
circumstances differ from case to case,and we have shied away from attempting to compile a mechanical checklist of the type and kind of allegations that are essential to satisfy the pslra pleading requirements.see in re cabletron,cir explaining that there is no template for analyzing securities cases.rather,we have instructed district courts to make an individualized assessment that sweeps before it the totality of the facts in a given case.see id.
the allegations at hand give an idiosyncratic twist to this general guidance.the plaintiffs contend that their complaint adequately identifies nine false or misleading statements.eight of these are of a piece the plaintiffs claim that the buy ratings in the eight analyst reports issued during the class period qualify as specific misrepresentations because the defendants employed that taxonomy even though they actually believed that wise investors should not purchase agilent securities.the ninth instance is related the plaintiffs contend that the statement in the february analyst report describing agilent t m order growth as reasonable was false and misleading because this description contradicted rogers actual view.
to put these claims in perspective,we must understand the vocabulary that the analysts were using.csfb standard stock ratings strong buy,buy,hold,and sell are designed to reflect its analysts predictions anent the likely future performance of the securities in question although these ratings are based to some degree on objective facts,they ultimately convey an opinion about a stock prospects and,perhaps,about the likely proclivities of the stock market over a given period.armed with the same background facts,two knowledgeable analysts,each acting in the utmost good faith,could well assign different ratings to the same stock.moreover,ratings are unlike the statements sued upon in an archetypical section b action because they rest upon outsiders views about a corporation rather than upon a corporate insider factual assertions regarding his or her own company.most ratings are,therefore,best understood as statements of opinion,not as unadulterated statements of objective fact 
classifying ratings as opinions does not automatically shield them from liability under the securities laws.see virginia bankshares,sandberg,d.while virginia bankshares specifically addressed a claim under section a of the securities exchange act,other courts have applied its reasoning to section b claims alleging false or misleading opinions.see,city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir in re donald trump casino sec,cir.this transplantation makes sense even though section b,in terms,deals with statements of fact,a statement of opinion may be considered factual in at least two respects as a statement that the speaker actually holds the opinion expressed and as a statement about the subject matter underlying the opinion.see virginia bankshares,at.on that logic,the bullish or bearish statements that accompany in some circumstances qualify as false or misleading statements of fact.see,demarco lehman,d.
a plaintiff can challenge a statement of opinion by pleading facts sufficient to indicate that the speaker did not actually hold the opinion expressed throughout this opinion,we refer to such allegations as claims of subjective falsity.because the plaintiffs can not clear the subjective falsity hurdle,we need not answer the thornier question of whether a plaintiff who challenges a statement of opinion also must plead facts sufficient to show,from an objective standpoint,that the statement either expressly or by fair implication contained a false or misleading assertion about its subject matter.
as to subjective falsity,the plaintiffs argue that the csfb analysts issued buy ratings when they did not truly believe that wise investors should purchase agilent stock.although the plaintiffs arguments in support of this claim are not without some force,we conclude that their complaint,which as we have said is premised on misstatements of opinion,fails to satisfy the pslra heightened pleading standard.
although a speaker confession that his or her opinion was false when made would suffice,on its own,to show subjective falsity,that species of frank admission is unlikely to materialize.in the usual case,therefore,plaintiffs will need to rely on a more indirect form of evidence to meet their pleading burden.see virginia bankshares,at.in the case at hand,there is no smoking gun,so the case falls into this latter category.
before we scrutinize the specifics of the complaint in search of evidence of subjective falsity,we pause to discuss a unique facet of the pslra pleading requirements when applied to misstatements of opinion.in the typical section b case,the falsity and scienter elements do not overlap and,thus,necessitate separate inquiries.see,podany robertson stephens,d.in those cases,the falsity element addresses objective truth,whereas the scienter element focuses on the speaker subjective intent.in cases premised on misstatements of opinion,however,the falsity element,at a minimum,entails an inquiry into whether the statement was subjectively false whether it also entails an inquiry into objective falsity is a matter on which we take no view.accordingly,the subjective aspect of the falsity requirement and the scienter requirement essentially merge the scienter analysis is subsumed by the analysis of subjective falsity.see in re salomon analyst level,d.we think it follows that if a plaintiff adequately pleads that a statement of opinion was subjectively false when made,the complaint will,ex proprio vigure,satisfy the pleading requirements of the pslra relative to scienter 
there is a relative dearth of authority speaking to the topic of whether a plaintiff has adequately pleaded subjective falsity in a false opinion case.because subjective falsity is so intricately tied to scienter in false opinion cases,the authorities relative to pleading scienter are instructive although not necessarily controlling when determining whether a plaintiff has satisfied his or her pleading burden with respect to the subjective aspect of the falsity claim see podany,d at.focusing directly on scienter,the pslra enunciates a strict standard for pleading the second element of a section b claim.see b see also greebel,at.to plead scienter adequately,a complaint must,with regard to each challenged act,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.that the statute,by its terms,requires a strong,rather than merely a reasonable,inference that the defendant acted with scienter is more than an odd linguistic quirk.
commenting upon this distinction,we have suggested that a plaintiff allegations must show a high likelihood of scienter in order to satisfy the pslra standard.aldridge,at.although the inference need not be ironclad,it must be persuasive.greebel,at.scienter allegations do not pass the strong inference test when,viewed in light of the complaint as a whole,there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally convincing.see id.
by analogy,these authorities indicate that conclusory allegations regarding an analyst hidden beliefs are not sufficient to ground an assertion of subjective falsity.see serabian amoskeag bank shares,cir g eneral averments of the defendants knowledge of material falsity will not suffice,rather the complaint must set forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant s knew that a statement was false or misleading citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff must instead point to provable facts that strongly suggest knowing falsity.see podany,d at.
as one contemplates the inner workings of an analyst mind,the line separating fact from conclusion often may seem blurred.in the end,it is only when conclusions are logically compelled,or at least supported,by the stated facts to an acceptable level of probability,that conclusions become facts for pleading purposes.dartmouth dartmouth,cir.
the sufficiency of a subjective falsity allegation must be determined through a analysis based on the state of affairs extant at the time the opinion was rendered.see in re boston.sec,d,see also in re salomon,d at.the fact that a speaker changes his or her mind and decides after the fact that an earlier opinion was is insufficient to support an averment of subjective falsity.see in re cabletron,at.furthermore,the nature of the falsity analysis compels a conclusion that a plaintiff can not succeed in pleading subjective falsity merely by identifying an overarching fraudulent scheme or corrupt environment.see in re salomon,d at.rather,the plaintiff must,for each allegedly false opinion,plead provable facts strongly suggesting that the speaker did not believe that particular opinion to be true when uttered.see id.at see also lentell merrill lynch,cir suggesting,in dictum,that evidence of false opinions in analyst reports issued on one company would not suffice to meet the pslra pleading standard in a case alleging false opinions contained in reports regarding a different company thus,when alleging that an analyst opinions are false or misleading,a plaintiff must plead facts that directly implicate both the rated stock and the questioned report.see podany,d at.
the bottom line,then,is that while the plaintiffs allegations regarding the obvious conflicts of interest and general state of corruption within csfb analyst ranks may be enough to turn the stomach of an ethically sensitive observer,they are insufficient,on their own,to support a fraud pleading with respect to the subjective falsity of the eight buy recommendations issued on agilent stock.see in re salomon,d at finding that allegations of conflicts of interest,incentives to increase compensation,or internal pressure on analysts that is not tied to the particular stock at issue are not sufficient,standing alone,to satisfy the particularity requirements see also lentell,at suggesting that although conflicts of interest present opportunities for fraud,they can not,without more,furnish the basis of a fraud complaint.such allegations are tantamount to pleading conclusory statements regarding motive and we have made it pellucid that such gauzy generalities,without more,are insufficient to plead scienter in a pslra case.see,greebel,at.since they are not tied to a specific statement,we find them equally wanting as a basis for pleading subjective falsity.
in an effort to plead the something more needed to bolster their general
