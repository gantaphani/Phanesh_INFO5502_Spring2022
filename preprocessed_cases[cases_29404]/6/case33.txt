the sole question presented on this appeal is whether the district court properly dismissed the appellant complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.finding that dismissal was proper,we affirm the ruling of the district court.
background 
in september,appellant janet grapentine grapentine entered into a mortgage contract with appellee pawtucket credit union pcu for the purchase of real estate in bristol,rhode island.the mortgage agreement included a covenant permitting pcu to accelerate its loan and invoke its statutory power of sale in the event grapentine defaulted on her loan payments.this private contractual remedy,to which the contract expressly referred,is authorized by rhode island general laws.that statute provides,in pertinent part 
the following power shall be known as the statutory power of sale and may be incorporated in any mortgage by reference 
but if default shall be made in the performance or observance of any of the foregoing or other conditions then it shall be lawful for the mortgagee to sell,together or in parcels,all and singular the premises hereby granted or intended to be granted,or any part or parts thereof 
after grapentine fell behind on her loan in october,pcu declared her in default,invoked its statutory power of sale,and began to foreclose on the property.in response,grapentine filed suit against pcu in the district court.she alleged in her amended complaint which we refer to simply as her complaint that the foreclosure pursuant to violated her federal and state due process rights because the state statute permitted pcu to foreclose on her property without a judicial hearing.pcu fired back with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court granted pcu motion on june,finding that none of the statutory bases cited in grapentine complaint conferred federal jurisdiction.grapentine timely appealed.

discussion 
the parties agree they are and it is uncontested that the diversity statute,does not confer federal jurisdiction over grapentine claims.we therefore review the only other basis for federal jurisdiction asserted by grapentine.for the reasons set forth below,we find no federal jurisdiction.
generally speaking,provides a cause of action for the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws by any person acting under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory.to state a claim under that statute,a plaintiff must assert two allegations that some person deprived her of a federal right,and that such person acted under color of state or territorial law.gomez toledo,citing monroe pape,u.significantly,does not apply to merely private conduct,no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,quoting blum yaretsky.this is where grapentine complaint falls short.
we note first that in rhode island,the existence of notwithstanding,the right to exercise the power of sale in a mortgage is derived from contract,not statute.bucci lehman.bank,fsb,citing thurber carpenter.this contractual power of sale was recognized long before was enacted in.id.at.thus,though regulated by statute nonjudicial foreclosure is a private procedure involving private parties,occurring pursuant to a private power of sale contained in a mortgage.id.alterations in original quoting d mortgages at.
there is no dispute here that only defendant named in grapentine a private entity.at first glance,it appears grapentine can not satisfy the under color of state law requirement since she has not sued the state,any of its subdivisions,or any public employee.this is not by itself dispositive,however,as a private party can be fairly characterized as a state actor if the circumstances of the case meet one of three tests the public function test,the joint test,or the state compulsion test.alberto san,consejo de titulares del condomonio san alberto,cir grapentine asserts pcu is a state actor under all of these tests.she bears the burden of proving as much,mead independence ass n,cir,and after careful review we find that she fails to carry her burden here,as her complaint does not set forth any allegations of state action.
i.the public function test 
the public function test is designed to flush out a state attempt to evade its responsibilities by delegating them to private entities.perkins londonderry basketball club,cir.common sense tells us that pcu was not performing any sort of public function when it entered into a mortgage contract with grapentine or when it subsequently exercised the power of sale contemplated in the parties agreement.nonetheless,grapentine attempts to counter this point by arguing that legislation authorizing foreclosures and sales in itself constitutes state action.
the supreme court,unfortunately for grapentine,has squarely rejected the argument that mere legislative authorization of a creditor private power of sale with respect to a debt owed constitutes a delegation of a traditional government function.flagg brothers,brooks,see also apao bank of,cir recognizing flagg brothers holding that legislative approval of a private remedy was not the delegation of a public function.we see no reason to depart from this logic here.grapentine allegations simply do not permit any inference that pcu was performing a public function when it invoked a private contractual remedy,even though that remedy was permitted by state law.
ii.joint test 
we move on to consider whether grapentine allegations satisfy the joint test.a private party joint participation with state officials in the seizure of disputed property is sufficient to characterize that party as a state actor for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.lugar edmondson oil.we note first that grapentine did not come right out and allege joint action in her complaint,nor did she name rhode island as a party to this litigation.accordingly,her complaint bare allegations do not satisfy the joint test.nonetheless,on appeal grapentine feebly posits an attenuated theory of joint action.
grapentine contends that the state dominates the foreclosure process through its police and legislative power,thus meeting the joint test.we find no allegations here to support any inference that the state exercised its police power in conjunction with pcu to effectuate the foreclosure process.lugar,at,finding state action where private party utilized prejudgment attachment procedure set forth in state law,pursuant to which a state court issued,and the sheriff executed,a writ of attachment sequestering another property.and with respect to the implication that the joint test is met simply by the existence of,we return to the principle set out in flagg brothers,supra,and conclude that mere legislative sanction of a private remedy does not constitute state action.indeed,far from involving state action,simply permits a lender to exercise a right that the borrower voluntarily granted to it in a mortgage contract.
the allegations in grapentine complaint do not permit us to infer that pcu acted in conjunction with any state agency or public official in connection with the foreclosure.to the contrary,from all that appears in her complaint,pcu acted alone,and as a private entity,when it sought to enforce a contractual right in the mortgage agreement between two private parties.grapentine thus fails to allege sufficient facts to find joint action between pcu and the state.
iii.state compulsion test 
lastly,under the state compulsion test we will find the state action requirement has been satisfied when a plaintiff demonstrates that the state has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the challenged conduct must be attributed to the state.alberto san,at alteration in original quoting estades negroni cpc hosp.san juan capestrano,cir.
