facts and procedural history 
the factual transactions that gave rise to the present dispute are summarized in the fourth district opinion 
betts business relationship with nca national cash advance began in august when she gave nca two checks,each in the amount of.in return,she received in cash and nca promise to defer presentment of the checks for a specified time.approximately one week later,betts redeemed the checks for cash.less than one week later,betts gave nca three more checks,each for,in exchange for and the same promise by nca.approximately two weeks later,betts replaced the checks with three new checks,which she ultimately replaced with cash two weeks thereafter.a number of similar transactions subsequently took place,with betts continuing to replace one check with another check,each time paying a fee,until december when she redeemed all checks with cash.
mckenzie,so d at dca footnote omitted.a similar,although not identical,set of circumstances was presented in ace cash,so d at.following a trial court decision against betts based on the fifth district earlier decision in ace cash,the fourth district reversed and held that the deferred payment transactions between betts and nca were essentially loan transactions and were not authorized with the legislature enactment of the money transmitters code in.mckenzie,so d at.the fourth district decided that the loan agreements entered into between betts and nca contrasted sharply with the check cashing transactions authorized by the code 
there is no question that what takes place is something more than simple check cashing.in a deferred presentment transaction,the customer is advanced money in exchange for a check which the lender agrees not to immediately cash.in exchange for agreeing to defer presentment of the check,the lender exacts a fee.as betts argues in this case,one might wonder why anyone would utilize the services of a check casher and pay for what he or she could otherwise obtain for free at a bank.clearly,it is because the customer does not have the funds readily available to honor the check.thus,there can be no question that what takes place is essentially an advance of money or a loan.
mckenzie,so d at.the fourth district certified that its holding was in conflict with the fifth district holding in ace cash,and this review follows.
background 
as outlined in the fourth district opinion,the florida legislature enacted the money transmitters code in.this code sought to regulate the practices of the money transmitter industry,including check cashing.the code definition of money transmitter referred to any person located in or doing business in this state who acts as a payment instrument seller,foreign currency exchanger,check casher,or funds transmitter.stat supp.the code defined check casher as a person who,for compensation,sells currency in exchange for payment instruments received,except travelers checks and payment instruments.sell was defined as to sell,issue,provide,or deliver.a payment instrument meant a check,draft,warrant,money order,travelers check or other instrument or payment of money,whether or not negotiable.moreover,cashing was defined as providing currency for payment instruments,except for travelers checks and payment instruments.finally,the department of banking and finance was charged with interpreting and enforcing the code.
the following year,on february,the florida check cashiers association fcca a group representing the florida check cashing industry,solicited and received an informal opinion letter from the department of banking and finance concerning certain deferred check cashing practices.the department letter stated that chapter,florida statutes,does not explicitly prohibit the concept of deferred deposits so long as the service would be offered and managed in accordance with the provisions and fee caps of the code.
subsequently,on september,the department adopted rules regulating check cashing transactions.these rules permitted a check casher to accept a postdated check and capped the transaction fees for such transactions at ten percent and the verification fees at five dollars.admin.code transferred to,repealed,and transferred to.
on may,the department sent a letter to advance america,cash advance centers of florida,regarding cashing checks,fees associated with deferred deposit checks,and rollover transactions of deferred deposit checks.this letter stated that customers cashing checks must receive currency,not another check or other type of payment instrument.in referencing deferred presentment transaction practices,the letter described the limitations on fees that can be charged by check cashers and explicitly referenced florida usury law in section,florida statutes,stating that it is illegal to charge a higher rate of interest than percent per annum simple interest.any rollover,extension or renewal of a deferred deposit check for an additional fee may constitute interest.in the final paragraph of the letter,the department put advance america on notice that the department would fully enforce chapter and that advance america should refrain from issuing payment instruments for which it is not properly licensed.
on may,the florida attorney general office issued an advisory legal opinion to the comptroller of florida in response to the question are payday loans or like transactions subject to the state laws prohibiting usurious rates of interest op.att y.the opinion stated 
payday loans or like transactions are subject to the state laws prohibiting usurious rates of interest.a company registered under chapter,florida statutes,may cash personal checks for the fees prescribed in that chapter without violating the usury laws only if such transactions are concluded and are not extended,renewed or continued in any manner with the imposition of additional fees.
thus,to the extent that a transaction comports with the provisions of this act chapter,it would not violate the usury provisions in chapter,florida statutes.in the absence of statutory authorization for these types of transactions,cashing a check or exchanging currency for a fee outside the scope of chapter,florida statutes,would constitute a loan,subject to the usury provisions of chapter,florida statutes.
in,betts filed an administrative challenge to department rule.admin.code,claiming that the rule,in seeming to authorize the acceptance of postdated checks by a check casher,was an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority furthermore,the rule improperly enlarged,modified,or contravened specific provisions of the code it was meant to implement.after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj upheld the rule,finding it did not enlarge,modify,or contravene the code and it was a proper exercise of delegated legislative authority.betts dep t of banking.doah order filed.however,the alj concluded that the department rule did not authorize deferred deposit transactions or the fees to be charged for such transactions.id.the order stated that t he department has no rule,order,or declaratory statement authorizing deferred deposit transactions or repeated,consecutive deferred deposit transactions by a registered check casher.id.at.moreover,the order stated that t he rule does not establish the fees nor does it authorize rollover transactions or payday loans.id.at.
in,the legislature amended the code to expressly permit deferred presentment transactions subject to certain limitations and to prohibit rollover transactions.see deferred presentment act,ch,laws of codified at.stat.a deferred presentment transaction is defined in the amendment as providing currency or a payment instrument in exchange for a person check and agreeing to hold that person check for a period of time prior to presentment,deposit,or redemption.in the amended version of the statute,the legislature expressly authorized deferred presentment transactions subject to the lender compliance with strict,notice,and disclosure requirements.see.the statute limits the face amount of the check taken for deferred presentment to not more than and caps the fee for such transactions at ten percent.the statute expressly prohibits the of checks and any rollover or extension of a deferred presentment agreement.
we must decide whether the legislature intended to include the deferred presentment transactions challenged by betts when it enacted the code in.like the fourth district in mckenzie and the dissent in ace cash,we conclude that it did not.when reading all of the statute terms together,we conclude that the legislature contemplated a check casher to be a person or entity who may be compensated to provide currency in exchange for a check.we further conclude that the legislature did not authorize deferred presentment transactions such as those involved herein until the passage of the deferred presentment act in.hence,the transactions involved herein are subject to florida usury laws.our conclusion is based upon a plain reading of the language of the original version of the code enacted in and a similar reading of the version of the code,as well as the terms of florida usury laws.
when construing the meaning of a statute,we must first look at its plain language.montgomery state,so d.furthermore,w hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.id.quoting holly auld,so d.
historically,transactions involving the lending of money for a fee or at a particular rate of interest have been governed by florida usury laws.see.stat.all contracts for the payment of interest upon any loan,advance of money,line of credit,or forbearance to enforce the collection of any debt,or upon any obligation whatever,at a higher rate of interest than the equivalent of percent per annum simple interest are hereby declared usurious.however,the legislature from time to time has carved out exceptions to the usury laws.see.stat.sections and shall not be construed to repeal,modify or limit any or either of the special provisions of existing statutory law creating exceptions to the general law governing interest and usury and specifying the interest rates and charges which may be made pursuant to such exceptions.we find no exception to these laws in the enactment of the money transmitters code in.
when the money transmitters code was enacted in,it defined a money transmitter as any person located in or doing business in this state who acts as a payment instrument seller,foreign currency exchanger,check casher,or funds transmitter.stat.supp emphasis added.the code defined check casher as a person who,for compensation,sells currency in exchange for payment instruments received,except travelers checks and payment instruments.emphasis added.the term sell was defined as to sell,issue,provide,or deliver.a payment instrument meant a check,draft,warrant,money order,travelers check or other instrument or payment of money,whether or not negotiable.emphasis added.moreover,the term cashing was also defined in the code as providing currency for payment instruments,except for travelers checks and payment instruments.the code language explicitly provides,by the use of in exchange for and for,that the check for cash transaction would be a contemporaneous one.see.for example,the statute contemplates that a person may have to pay a fee for an authorized entity to cash a check,and the entity would then give the person money in exchange for the check.therefore,we conclude the check cashing transaction contemplated by the code is a straightforward payment of money in exchange for a check and not an authorization to process loans outside florida usury laws.
as noted above,the code was amended by the passage of the deferred presentment act in.see.stat.in the deferred presentment act,a deferred presentment transaction was defined as providing currency or a payment instrument in exchange for a person check and agreeing to hold that person check for a period of time prior to presentment,deposit,or redemption.moreover,rollover was defined as the termination or extension of an existing deferred presentment agreement by the payment of any additional fee and the continued holding of the check,or the substitution of a new check drawn by the drawer pursuant to a new deferred presentment agreement.additionally,termination of an existing deferred presentment agreement was defined as 
t he check that is the basis for an agreement is redeemed by the drawer by payment in full in cash,or is deposited and the deferred presentment provider has evidence that such check has cleared.a verification of sufficient funds in the drawer account by the deferred presentment provider shall not be sufficient evidence to deem the existing deferred deposit transaction to be terminated.
importantly,part iv of chapter,as amended in,imposes strict requirements for deferred presentment transactions.most relevant to the instant case is section,which states,no deferred presentment provider or its affiliate may accept or hold an undated check or a check dated on a date other than the date on which the deferred presentment provider agreed to hold the check and signed the deferred presentment transaction agreement.additionally,section states 
no deferred presentment provider or its affiliate may engage in the rollover of any deferred presentment agreement.a deferred presentment provider shall not redeem,extend,or otherwise consolidate a deferred presentment agreement with the proceeds of another deferred presentment transaction made by the same or an affiliated deferred presentment provider.
furthermore,section provides 
a deferred presentment provider may not enter into a deferred presentment transaction with a person who has an outstanding deferred presentment transaction with that provider or with any other deferred presentment provider,or with a person whose previous deferred presentment transaction with that provider or with any other provider has been terminated for less than hours.
like the fourth district in mckenzie and judge griffin dissent in ace cash,we conclude that the legislature did not intend for deferred presentment transactions to be covered under the money transmitters code until it expressly added the deferred presentment act in.
in fact,this reading of the plain language of the statute is well articulated in judge griffin dissent in ace cash 
the fact that chapter,which regulates check cashing operations,does not expressly prohibit rollovers and deferred presentments,does not mean that the usury laws are not violated by such devices.the legislature is to be forgiven for not having the foresight to prohibit or regulate the uncashing of a cashed check.nor am i persuaded that the passage of the deferred presentment act in october was intended by the legislature to confirm the prior legality of the practice.indeed,it appears the legislation undertook to regulate and limit these schemes.further,the statute appears to recognize that these transactions are,in fact,loans.
ace cash,so d at griffin,dissenting.we conclude that if the legislature had intended to carve out such an important exception to the usury laws in,it would have expressly done so,as it did with the amendment.
sometimes it may be appropriate to consider a subsequent amendment to clarify original legislative intent of a statute if such amendment was enacted soon after a controversy regarding the statute interpretation arose.lowry parole prob.comm n,so d.however,the fourth district decided that it is inappropriate to use an amendment for this purpose when the amendment was enacted seven years after the original statute.mckenzie,so d at see also parole comm cooper,so d,concluding that ten years is too long to be an affirmation of prior legislative intent.we agree.
in this case,the legislature enacted the version of the code seven years after the version.as with the gap in cooper,we conclude that seven years is too long to view the amendment as merely a clarification of legislative intent.it is telling that nowhere within the original version of the code did the legislature mention these types of transactions.moreover,the usury laws,which existed at the time the code was enacted,have a general application to a ll contracts for the payment of interest upon any loan,advance of money,line of credit,or forbearance to enforce the collection of any debt.stat.as a result,like the fourth district and judge griffin,we conclude that the deferred deposit transactions involved herein are not check cashing transactions and are not governed by the money transmitters code enacted in.instead,these transactions are contracts for the payment of interest upon any loan and subject to florida usury laws.
finally,we find it persuasive that courts in other states have held that deferred presentment transactions are loans.see,hamilton york,deciding that the transactions were nothing more than interest bearing loans austin alabama check cashers ass n,so d,wl,at,concluding that deferred presentment transactions were loans subject to the alabama small loan act white check holders,holding that the legislature did not intend for deferred deposit businesses to come under the law when it passed kentucky revised statutes section to allow check cashing businesses to charge fees without implicating usury laws.
the facts of the instant case are strikingly similar to those in white.in,the kentucky general assembly enacted kentucky revised statutes chapter,allowing check cashing businesses to charge a fee for cashing checks without implicating kentucky usury laws.white,at.the transactions in that case involved the use of an order instrument payable on demand and drawn on a bank to evidence the promise of a debt due at a later time.id.in white,the court addressed the following issue 
when a check cashing company licensed under krs et accepts and defers deposit on a check pursuant to an agreement with the maker of the check,is the service fee charged by the check cashing company a service fee and not interest under krs,or is the fee interest which is subject to the usury laws and disclosure provisions in krs chapter 
id.the kentucky supreme court held that the general assembly did not intend for section to encompass loans based upon deferred deposit transactions as well as check cashing from current funds.id.at.the court decided that deferred deposit businesses did not come under the code.id.furthermore,the court noted that if the act had applied to deferred deposit transactions,there would have been no need for the general assembly to have amend the statute in to include these types of transactions.id.
conclusion 
in conclusion,we hold that the original version of the code did not include deferred presentment transactions.therefore,at the time the transactions between betts and nca took place,the legality of such transactions was governed by florida usury laws.accordingly,we approve the fourth district essential holding in mckenzie on this issue,and disapprove the fifth district decision in ace cash.we decline to consider other issues raised by the parties.
it is so ordered.
although the majority does not distinguish between pure deferred presentment transactions and rollover transactions,i see great differences between them.more importantly,so did the department of banking and agency charged with implementing the statute we interpret.as i explain in more detail below,a deferred presentment transaction is one in which the check casher agrees not to present the customer check to the bank until a later date a rollover transaction is one in which the customer more than pays another fee to extend the period of deferment,usually by exchanging the previously cashed check for a new one.i agree with the majority that rollover transactions are essentially loans,and therefore are subject to the usury statute this,incidentally,was also the department conclusion.i disagree,however,to the extent the majority holds that pure deferred presentment transactions are loans as well.consistent with our many precedents deferring to an implementing agency reasonable interpretation of a statute,i would defer to the department,which concluded that the term check cashing includes deferred presentment transactions unless they involve a rollover for an additional fee.this interpretation reasonably clarifies a statutory ambiguity and falls squarely within the department area of expertise.
i.the statutory ambiguity 
the issue in this case is whether the term check cashing in the money transmitters,florida statutes encompasses deferred presentment transactions.in a normal transaction,the customer presents the company with a check sometimes a paycheck received that day,and in exchange receives cash.the majority finds nothing wrong with such transactions.deferred presentment transactions are transactions with a twist like normal transactions,the customer receives cash in exchange for a check,but instead of having authority to cash the check immediately,the company,for a fee,agrees not to present the check to the bank for a specified period of time 
some deferred presentment transactions present yet another wrinkle the customer enters into a rollover transaction.these come in three main types the customer pays an additional fee in cash,and the check casher agrees to defer presentment for an even longer period the customer pays an additional fee and replaces the first check with a new one,presentment of which is also deferred or the customer redeems the earlier check with cash and then promptly writes a new check for deferred presentment,in exchange for which the an additional returned.as scholars have noted,all of these rollovers achieve the same result a continuous flow of payments at very short intervals that never reduces the principal.lynn drysdale kathleen keest,the consumer financial services marketplace the fringe banking system and its challenge to current thinking about the role of usury laws in today society,
before,when the legislature passed the deferred presentment act specifically addressing deferred presentment transactions,see ch,laws of,the money transmitters code did not mention them.it merely discussed check cashing in general,which it defined as providing currency for payment instruments,except for travelers checks and payment instruments.stat.thus,if deferred presentment transactions qualified as check cashing,they were subject to the code fee structure.see id.if not,then they were effectively loans subject to florida longstanding usury laws.see id.all contracts for the payment of interest upon any loan,advance of money,line of credit,or forbearance to enforce the collection of any debt,or upon any obligation whatever,at a higher rate of interest than the equivalent of percent per annum simple interest are hereby declared usurious.
the majority concludes from the plain language of the code that all deferred presentment completed or rolled outside the definition of check cashing.majority op.at.according to the majority,they are simply disguised loans that must comply with the usury laws.id.at.i beg to differ.i do not agree that all deferred payment transactions are the same.to the contrary,as i explain below,the agency charged with implementing the code has reasonably interpreted it as including pure deferred presentment transactions but excluding rollovers.i would defer to the agency interpretation.
ii.the agency interpretation 
the agency with general regulatory powers under the money transmitters code is the department of banking and finance,which has express statutory authority to issue and publish rules to interpret and implement the provisions of the code,as well as the discretion to effectuate the purposes,policies,and provisions of the code.stat.this authority,however,is limited.the department may exercise o nly such rulemaking power and administrative discretion as is necessary,in order that the supervision and regulation of money transmitters may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions,in technology,and in money transmitter practices.id.h.
on many occasions,the department exercised its authority by evaluating whether the code authorized deferred presentment transactions.first,in february,the department wrote to florida association stating that it saw no reason to object to deferred presentment transactions,provided that they adhered to the code fee limitations for transactions.see letter from jeffrey jones,counsel,office of comptroller,to larry lang,president.check cashiers ass n,at.the letter cautioned,however,that it was not a rule,declaratory statement or final order,but rather an informal opinion by which the department would not consider itself bound.id.
in september,the department promulgated a formal rule addressing deferred presentment transactions.the rule provided that a check casher may accept a postdated check,subject to the fees established in section.admin.code.as a logical corollary,the rule also allowed the check casher to wait until the specified date to cash the check.this is because the customer has the ability,by notifying the bank in writing of the postdated check,to prevent it from being cashed early.stat.unless the department intended for check cashers to accept postdated checks without ever cashing them,which seems absurd,it must have intended to allow deferred presentment of postdated checks.
the majority dismisses the rule because none of the respondent transactions involved a postdated check all of her checks were presently dated.but that is too formalist a reading of the rule.no functional difference exists between a postdated check and a presently dated check whose presentment is deferred.in one case,the agreement to defer is noted on the check itself in the other,it is contained in a separate document.the agreements are effectively the same.thus,the most logical reading of the department rule is that check cashing encompasses transactions in which the check casher waits for an period before cashing the customer check.see betts mckenzie check advance of,llc,so d,dca stating that the rule expressly approved deferred presentment transactions subject to certain restrictions.
even if the rule did leave some ambiguity,however,it was clarified a few months later.in a letter of advice to florida check cashers in may,the department explained,as the rule implied,that deferred presentment transactions were subject to the code fee structure.but the department cautioned that when a deferred presentment transaction is rolled over,extended,or renewed for an additional fee,the additional fee may constitute excessive interest under the usury laws.see letter from douglas johnson,div.of banking,dep t of banking and,to billy webster,advance am.cash advance ctrs.of,at may.in other words,a deferred presentment transaction only counts as check cashing when it is consummated by the actual cashing of the check or cash redemption.
two years later,the department asked the attorney general for his opinion on the matter.we have long recognized that a lthough an opinion of the attorney general is not binding on a court,it is entitled to careful consideration and generally should be regarded as highly persuasive.state family bank of hallandale,so d.reaching the same conclusion as the department,the attorney general opined that a check casher registered under the code may cash personal checks for the fees prescribed in the code without violating the usury laws only if such transactions are concluded and are not extended,renewed or continued in any manner with the imposition of additional fees.op.
finally,in april,the respondent challenged the department rule in an administrative proceeding.the administrative law judge dismissed her petition,explaining that nothing in the code prohibits the check casher from holding the customer check for an period of time.betts dep t of banking,at.div.admin.hearings.while acknowledging that the department rule provides more details than the statute,the judge concluded that it does not enlarge,modify or contravene the language it seeks to interpret.id.at.accordingly,the judge upheld the rule as a reasonable implementation of the statute.the respondent did not appeal.shortly thereafter,in light of the amendments to the code,the rule was repealed 
in summary,the department has consistently interpreted the code term check cashing as including deferred presentment transactions unless they involve a rollover,extension,or renewal for an additional fee.this policy was stated informally in one year after the code enactment,was formalized into a rule in,was further explained in a formal letter in,was embraced by the attorney general in,and finally was upheld by an administrative law judge in,just before the code was amended.the interpretations were consistent.some of the transactions in this case occurred in,the year before the department made its position absolutely clear in the formal letter.but the letter did not represent a change in department policy.it merely confirmed the department consistent position,as already expressed less clearly in the informal opinion and the formal rule.
we have not required that,to be entitled to deference,an agency statutory interpretation be exhaustively articulated in a formal rule.to the contrary,we have deferred to a rule supported by an affidavit from an agency official who attested after the fact that the department of revenue had consistently maintained a policy since the inception of a given tax.dep t of revenue first union bank of,so d.thus,when we have reliable evidence that the implementing agency maintained a consistent interpretation of its statute during the time the statute was in is the case interpretation should be followed if it meets the requirements for administrative deference.i now address that issue.
iii.the doctrine of administrative deference 
we have long recognized that the contemporaneous administrative construction of the enactment by those charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight,and courts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.gay canada dry bottling of,so d,quoting state bd.of equalization,cal d.stated positively,this doctrine means that a reviewing court must defer to an agency interpretation of an operable statute as long as that interpretation is consistent with legislative intent and is supported by substantial,competent evidence.pub.employees relations comm dade county police benevolent ass n,so d.
courts defer to the implementing agency out of respect for the institutional competence and expertise of agencies charged with implementing legislation.agencies have more expertise about matters within their jurisdiction than courts,which consider a wide variety of issues.while the courts always remain the final authority on the interpretation of authority that,under the separation of powers in the florida constitution,no legislature may certainly can benefit from an agency unique combination of technical knowledge and practical experience.the legislature,by authorizing an agency to implement a statute,encourages us to accord considerable persuasive force to the agency judgments.state ex rel.szabo food,of dickinson,so d.we have done just that.under our precedents,deference usually will be accorded an administrative agency interpretation of matters entrusted by statute to its discretion or expertise.palm harbor special fire control dist.kelly,so d,citing pub.employees,so d at,and daniel.state tpk,so d 
although we occasionally depart from agency interpretations,it is only for the most cogent reasons.fidelity constr.arthur collins son,so d,citing gay,so d at.we do not defer to an agency interpretation that attempts to enlarge,modify,or contravene a statute.campus commc ns,
