one might think that years after congress established national banks in,the question of their citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction would be well established.not so.the relevant statute is ambiguous,the courts are split on the question,and the supreme court has not squarely decided the issue.
under,national banking associations are citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.id.the critical word located is not defined in the statute or elsewhere.nor does its meaning flow easily from dictionary definitions or interpretive canons.wachovia bank,schmidt.looking to the supreme court treatment of the issue and to the history and sequence of the enactment and amendment of the statute,we conclude that,under,a national bank is located only in the state designated as its main office.see id.at.
factual and procedural background 
robert and victoria rouse collectively,the rouses filed suit against wells fargo bank,its wachovia mortgage division collectively,wells fargo,and ndex west llc,in the superior court of the state of california.the original complaint raised multiple causes of action under state and federal law pertaining to the rouse home loan and deed of trust.wells fargo removed the action to district court,asserting subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of federal questions and diversity of citizenship.see,a.wells fargo filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,in which ndex west joined.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint with leave to amend.
the rouses filed their first amended complaint,raising only state law claims.following an order to show cause why the case should not be remanded to state court for lack of diversity jurisdiction,the district court held that national banks are citizens of the state where their principal place of business is located as well as of the state where their main office is located as designated in their articles of association.because wells fargo main office is in south dakota and its principal place of business is in california,and the rouses are citizens of california the district court remanded the case to california superior court for lack of jurisdiction.
the dispositive issue in this appeal is whether,under,a national bank is a citizen of both the state in which its principal place of business is located and the state where its main office is located as designated in the bank articles of association we review de novo this issue of statutory construction.see united states havelock,cir.
we conclude that,under,a national bank is a citizen only of the state in which its main office is located.hence,the district court had diversity jurisdiction because there was complete diversity between the rouses,citizens of california,and wells fargo,a citizen of south dakota.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i.the citizenship of national banks 
wells fargo is a national bank,a corporate entit y chartered not by any state,but by the comptroller of the currency of the treasury.wachovia bank,at.unlike banks or other corporations whose citizenship is governed by the citizenship of nationally chartered banks is governed by,which provides in pertinent part all national banking associations shall,for the purposes of all other actions by or against them,be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.
the sparse text of the statute offers no definitions.our analysis focuses on the meaning of the word located.where a statute does not define a key term,we look to the word ordinary meaning.in re hp inkjet printer,cir.however,the supreme court has held,in the context of,that the word is ambiguous on its face wachovia bank,at t he term located,as it appears in the national bank act,has no fixed,plain meaning.as the supreme court noted,located,as its appearance in the banking laws reveal is a chameleon word its meaning depends on the context in and purpose for which it is used.id.at.the message is clear we must look beyond the plain text of the statute and the word ordinary meaning to discern the meaning of the word located for purposes of.
ii.wachovia bank,schmidt 
in wachovia bank,the supreme court addressed a different but related issue whether a federally chartered national bank is a citizen of every state where it operates a branch in addition to the state where its main office is designated.at.the court held that a national bank,for purposes,is a citizen of the state in which its main office,as set forth in its articles of association,is located.id.at.although this holding appears to be a categorical statement with respect to,we acknowledge that it was rendered in response to a slightly different question than we face here.
the court granted certiorari in wachovia bank to resolve a circuit split over whether national banks are citizens of every state in which they operate a branch for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.both the fifth circuit and the seventh circuit held that national banks are not located in every state where the bank has a branch.horton bank one,cir firstar bank,faul,cir.both circuits reasoned that the legislative history of and its predecessor statutes revealed congress intent to maintain jurisdictional parity between national and state banking associations by placing them on the same jurisdictional footing.horton,at firstar,at.although not referenced in wachovia bank,we held years earlier in american surety bank of california,that the bank of california was a citizen only of the state in which its principal place of business is located,the state of california and that the bank was not a citizen of every state in which it operated a branch,cir emphasis added.by contrast,the fourth circuit in the wachovia bank appeal held that a national bank is a citizen of the state in which its main office is located as well as every state in which it has a branch,cir.the second circuit recognized the same in dicta.see world trade ctr,llc hartford fire ins,cir.
the supreme court holding in wachovia bank was largely reasoned from the conclusion that congress intended to protect the right of national banks to remove cases to federal courts.see at were we to hold that a national bank is additionally a citizen of every state in which it has established a branch,the access of a national bank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed.wachovia bank did not address whether a national bank is also a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business.the court noted,however,that one would sensibly locate a national bank for qualification for diversity jurisdiction,in the state designated in its articles of association as its main office.id.at.the court also stated that the omission of any reference to a national bank principal place of business in may be of scant practical significance for,in almost every case the location of a national bank main office and of its principal place of business coincide.id.at see wells fargo bank,wmr,llc,cir.this acknowledgment and discussion of the principal place of business issue strongly suggest that the court did not overlook the issue of whether a national bank is a citizen of both the state in which its main office is located and the state where it maintains its principal place of business in crafting its clear and unqualified statement limiting citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes to a national bank main office.
following wachovia bank,the eighth circuit addressed the exact issue we confront in this appeal and held that a national bank is only a citizen of the state designated in its articles of association as its main office.wmr,at see also mckenna wells fargo bank,cir finding diversity between an individual citizen of massachusetts and wells fargo,because well s fargo,a national bank,is a citizen of the state where it is located this is the state designated in its articles of association as its main office and wells fargo is a citizen of south dakota for diversity purposes.internal citations and quotation marks omitted hargrow wells fargo bank,app x,cir holding that wells fargo is a citizen of south dakota,where its main office is located,for diversity jurisdiction purposes hicklin eng g bartell,cir wachovia bank held that national banks are citizens only of the states in which their main offices are located.although agreeing in principle with the seventh circuit in firstar and the fifth circuit in horton that and its statutory predecessors initially embodied congress intent to put national and state banks on the same jurisdictional footing,in wmr,the eighth circuit held that jurisdictional parity did not survive a amendment to the general diversity jurisdiction statute,c.wmr,at.the eighth circuit reasoned that if congress intended jurisdictional parity to survive subsequent statutory amendments,it would have expressly indicated this intent.id.at.the court concluded that the word located,as used in the version of,could not mean both main office and principal place of business because citizenship for corporations based on principal place of business did not exist until ten years later when congress passed in.id.at.we agree.
iii.the historical landscape 
although we view the supreme court declaration in wachovia bank on the scope of to be definitive,the evolution of and its interaction with c also support our conclusion.
beginning in,in congress first treatment of jurisdiction for national banks,the statutory predecessor to the current explicitly ensured jurisdictional parity between national banks and banks.however,by,congress had abandoned jurisdictional parity between the two types of banks and reoriented the statutory predecessor to the current to ensure jurisdictional parity between individual citizens and national banks.during this period,banks were citizens only of the states by which they were incorporated it was not until that congress provided for dual citizenship for banks according to their state of incorporation and their principal place of business.the history of the jurisdictional statutes,which we review below,is consistent with reading the supreme court statement in wachovia bank to mean that,for all purposes under,a national bank is located only in the state in which its main office is located.
section and its statutory predecessors 
the first national banking act provided t hat suits,actions,and proceedings by and against any national banking association under this act may be had in any circuit,district,or territorial court of the united states held within the district in which such association may be established.act of,ch,stat,replaced internal quotation marks omitted.in,congress added that such suits could also be brought in any state,county,or municipal court in the county or city in which said association is located,having jurisdiction in similar cases.act of june,ch,stat,replaced.by,congress had provided for removal of national bank cases from state to federal court under the theory that suits involving national banks necessarily arose under the federal laws.act of,ch,stat,repealed see union pac.ry.myers.
congress changed course in when it enacted the first statute specifying the state citizenship of national banks.act of july,ch,stat,repealed see leather mfrs.bank cooper.the act provided 
t he jurisdiction for suits hereafter brought by or against any association established under any law providing for associations shall be the same as,and not other than,the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the united states which do or might do banking business where such associations may be doing business when such suits may be begun.
act of july,ch,stat.that act changed the jurisdictional landscape by provid ing,in clear and unmistakable terms,that the courts of the united states should not have jurisdiction unless they would have jurisdiction under like circumstances of suits by or against a state bank doing business in the same state with the national bank.cooper,at.therefore,national bank s were placed before the law in this respect the same as a bank not organized under the laws of the united states.id.the legislation plainly established a principle of jurisdictional parity with banks and ended national banks automatic qualification for federal question jurisdiction.see id.at.
but congress amended the statute five years later.the law provided in relevant part 
a ll national banking associations established under the laws of the united states shall be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located and in such cases the circuit and district courts shall not have jurisdiction other than such as they would have in cases between individual citizens of the same state.
act of,ch,stat,replaced.this statute was considered a revision to prescriptions on federal jurisdiction,wachovia bank,at,because it removed language tying national bank jurisdiction to state bank jurisdiction.see id.at.this provision evokes the principle of jurisdictional parity not parity between national and state banks,but between national banks and individual citizens.see act of,ch,stat.emphasis added.any contrary reading would render the last clause of the act surplusage because it was well established by that national banks did not automatically qualify for federal question jurisdiction solely because they were nationally chartered.
a year later,congress revised the act by adding this caveat as a separate paragraph the provisions of this section shall not be held to affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states in cases commenced by the united states or by direction of any officer thereof,or cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank.act of,ch,stat,replaced.this amendment clarified that federal courts retained federal question jurisdiction over national banks in two specific circumstances i in suits by the united states or ii for winding up the bank affairs.only the act contained express language providing that national banks should be treated the same as identically situated banks.the statutorily embodied principle of jurisdictional parity was not linked with banks or other corporations.from a historical perspective,the decision to tie the citizenship of national banks to the citizenship of banks as the act did bears no greater weight than tying the citizenship of national banks to the citizenship of natural persons as the act and revision did.
congress shifted gears again in.the act provided,in relevant part,that all national banking associations established under the laws of the united states shall,for the purposes of all other actions against them be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.act of,ch,stat,amended.in herrmann edwards,the supreme court explained that the act maintained the limits on federal jurisdiction that congress established in the act federal question jurisdiction was available for suits by the united states or for winding up a bank affairs,and diversity jurisdiction was available for all other suits with national banks being deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located,quoting act of,ch,stat.the court reasoning did not rely on analysis of jurisdiction for suits involving banks rather,its analysis focused on the availability of federal jurisdiction and reaffirmed the fundamental principle,codified in the act,that because a corporation was a national bank,created under an act of congress,gave it no greater right to remove a case to federal court than if it had been organized under a state law.id.at.therefore,to the extent that the and acts established any principle of jurisdictional parity,the statutes referred to federal question jurisdiction,not to diversity jurisdiction.
congress made a final minor tweak to the statute in.the act,which is presently codified at,provides in relevant part that a ll national banking associations shall,for the purposes of all other actions by or against them,be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.act of june,ch,stat.as with the amendment and act,there is no mention whatsoever of jurisdictional parity.
although congress last work on the citizenship of national banks came in,a significant shift in d
