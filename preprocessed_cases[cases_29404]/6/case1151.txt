introduction 
we hold that a bank may not for account service fees debit a coogan trust account a statutorily required account to preserve percent of a minor gross earnings for artistic or creative services for the benefit of the minor until the minor turns or is emancipated,et coogan law because of the statutory ban on withdrawals from a coogan trust account without court approval,subd.b.such a debit,without court approval,is a prohibited withdrawal under the applicable state statute,and that state law prohibition on a debit by a national bank is not preempted by federal law.we therefore reverse the judgment entered on a demurrer sustained without leave to amend.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs and appellants jasmine phillips aka jasmine gonzales phillips,as trustee for alex gonzales,and anesha colemen,as trustee for jadon monroe,filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against defendant and respondent bank of america,a national bank association.plaintiffs in their operative first amended complaint fac alleged causes of action for breach of written contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,conversion,and unlawful and unfair business practices.plaintiffs alleged that they were the parents or guardians of unemancipated minors who have been paid for performing artistic or creative services.
plaintiffs alleged that,as trustees for their minor children,they opened accounts entitled coogan trust accounts for the minors at defendant in full compliance with section et the coogan law.from time to time,wages or other monies earned by the minors for performing artistic services were deposited into plaintiffs coogan trust accounts for the benefit of the minors during the four years preceding the filing of the initial complaint in this action,defendant ha s made withdrawals from plaintiffs cogan trust accounts,including but not limited to withdrawals for monthly service fees,without court approval.
in their causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,plaintiffs alleged that they entered into written agreements with defendant pursuant to which defendant agreed to open and maintain coogan trust account s notwithstanding these written agreements defendant regularly and systematically breached these agreements by making withdrawals from the coogan trust accounts,including but not limited to monthly service charges,without court approval.
in plaintiffs cause of action for conversion,they alleged that d espite defendant representations that defendant would open and maintain the subject accounts as coogan trust accounts,defendant unlawfully took and converted monies from the coogan trust accounts for defendant own use.in their cause of action for unlawful and unfair business practices under the unfair competition law bus,et,plaintiffs alleged that n otwithstanding applicable california family code sections as well as other provisions of california law,defendant regularly and systematically made withdrawals from the coogan trust accounts,including but not limited to monthly service charges.in addition,defendant represented that defendant would open and maintain the subject accounts as coogan trust accounts.despite these representations,defendant failed to maintain the accounts as coogan trust accounts and instead regularly and systematically made withdrawals from these accounts,including but not limited to monthly service charges.plaintiffs sought as relief compensatory damages,issuance of a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction,disgorgement of all profits resulting,punitive damages,costs of suit,attorney fees,and such other and further relief as the trial court might deem just and proper.
the trial court sustained defendant demurrer to the fac without leave to amend,finding that the term withdrawal as used in the coogan law did not include the debiting of an account by a financial institution for service charges.the trial court thereafter entered a final judgment of dismissal,and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
the parties have confirmed that the issue on appeal is whether the coogan law precludes defendant from debiting the coogan trust accounts for account service fees,including whether the debits by defendant are withdrawals under the coogan law and if so whether the state law that has the effect of banning such debits by a national bank is preempted by federal law.the parties agree that whether plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to state the specific causes of action asserted in the fac is not an issue in this appeal.

applicable law 
the history of the coogan law has been summarized in legislative documents.the coogan law was enacted as former civil code sections and in in response to the childhood star jackie coogan plight.even though he earned millions as a child,coogan was surprised to find out when he reached adulthood that he was flat broke,because his mother and stepfather spent all his money legally thus,the coogan law was passed in order to preserve a portion of the minor earnings for the minor use when he or she reaches the age of majority.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.inadequacies in the statutory scheme,however,resulted in additional abuses of the finances of such as shirley temple,macauly culkin,lee aaker,and gary coleman whose parents left the minors with at best only a small percentage of what they earned during their careers.floor,reading of bill reg.sess.as amended.the legislature amended the coogan law in,and.stats,ch,sb stats,ch,sb stats,ch,ab see generally din,chapter instituting proper trust funds and safeguarding the earnings of child performers from dissipation by parents,guardians and trustees mcgeorge.
as relevant to this case,the coogan law provides that for a contract pursuant to which a minor is employed or agrees to render artistic or creative services,the minor employer must set aside percent of the minor gross earnings pursuant to the contract in trust in an account or other savings plan,and preserved for the benefit of the minor,subds.a,b,b.at least one of the minor parents or legal guardians must be appointed as trustee of the funds,unless the superior court determines that the appointment of a different individual,individuals,entity,or entities is required in the best interests of the minor,subds.b,c.
the coogan law provides that within seven business days after execution of the contract,the trustee must establish a trust account,known as a coogan trust account,at a bank,savings and loan institution,credit union,brokerage firm,or company registered under the investment company act of,that is located in the state of california,subds.a,d.within business days after commencement of employment,the trustee must provide the minor employer with a true and accurate photocopy of the trustee statement pursuant to section,subds.b,c,subd.c.the trustee must also include identifying information of the financial institution and account,and any additional information needed by the minor employer to deposit the funds into the account,subds.b,subd.c.the trustee must also attach to the statement a copy of any information received from the financial institution confirming the creation of the account,subd.c.within business days after receiving,inter alia,the trustee statement,the minor employer must deposit into the coogan trust account percent of the minor gross earnings pursuant to the contract,subds.b,c.the parent or guardian acting in his or her fiduciary relationship,shall,with the earnings and accumulations of the minor under the contract,pay all liabilities incurred by the minor under the contract,including,but not limited to,payments for taxes on all earnings,including taxes on the amounts set aside under subdivisions b and c of this section,subd.d.as percent of the gross earnings is deposited in the coogan trust account,it follows that these liabilities would be payable out of the remaining percent of the earnings.
the coogan law also specifies that upon petition of the parent or legal guardian,the minor or the trustee or trustees,on good cause shown,the superior court may order the trust be amended or terminated,subds.b,c.until the minor becomes years old,or a declaration of emancipation of the minor is issued,no withdrawal by the beneficiary or any other individual,individuals,entity,or entities may be made of funds on deposit in trust without written order of the superior court,subd.b.it is the coogan law and specifically section,subdivision b,that are at issue in this appeal.
plaintiffs assert that defendant,without written orders of the superior court,debited coogan trust accounts for account service fees,thereby violating the prohibition against withdrawals from coogan trust accounts.defendant contends that such debits are not withdrawals and that even if they were,any state law that prohibits such debits is preempted by federal law,which permits the imposition of account service fees and precludes the application of state law that prevents or significantly interferes with a national bank exercise of its powers.
debiting the account as a withdrawal 
section,subdivision b prohibits the withdrawal of funds on deposit in a coogan trust account by the beneficiary or any other individual,individuals,entity,or entities,without court approval.defendant contends that its debit of a coogan trust account for account service fees is not a withdrawal of funds,and the use of the phrase any other individual,individuals,entity,or entities shows that ban on withdrawals is meant only to reach trustees a parent or guardian or other individual or entity who are responsible for managing and controlling a earnings.the parties rely on dictionary definitions of debit and withdrawal to support their positions.but,when a bank debits an account,it necessarily withdraws money from that account.see black law dictionary ed,defines debit as.a sum charged as due or owing,a decrease in the amount of money in a bank account,as because one has withdrawnmoney from it.italics added.
moreover,courts have used the word withdrawal to include a bank debiting an account for,or charging,a service fee or charge.thus,in arlington video productions,fifth third bancorp cir,the court said,the parties agreed in their contract that the bank could collect service charges,with arlington giving the bank a security interest in its business checking account to permit the bank to withdraw any debt arlington owed to the bank.id.at,italics added.the court added,the bank did not disclose to arlington all of the facts relating to the deposit adjustment fee or the increase in the returned item fee before automatically withdrawing those fees from arlington account and listing unexplained service charges on the monthly bank statements.id.at,italics added see in re moffitt,zwerling kemler,second,was withdrawn automatically by the bank from the law firm account as a service charge to maintain the account of zwerling predecessor firm italics added,aff in part,vacated in part on other grounds,moffitt,zwerling kemler,cir whittenberg,commissioner of internal revenue tax wl other withdrawals were for bank service charges and bank tax italics added in re columbus avenue realty trust capitol bank and trust company bkrtcy,the bank automatically withdrew and paid to itself in three withdrawals of on july,august,and september,for service charges appendix a identifies the deposits,the checks written and processed against the account,and the automatic withdrawals for interest,tax escrow,and service charges italics added,aff in part,vacated in part on other grounds,in re columbus realty trust cir.
the purpose of the coogan trust account is for the preserving for the benefit of the minor percent of the minor gross earnings until the minor reaches majority,subd.a,italics added.preserving the gross amount of earnings contemplates no deductions for taxes or fees of any kind without court approval.
defendant reads the statute to mean that its prohibition on withdrawals applies only to the minor and his or her parents,guardians,and trustees and not to others,such as banks.under this reading,as defendant concedes,others could execute on the amounts in the coogan trust account or otherwise lawfully obtain portions of what is supposed to be protected monies,which actions are inconsistent with the purpose of a coogan trust account.see,if the trust instrument provides that a beneficiary interest in the trust funds is not subject to transfer,the beneficiary interest in those funds is not subject to enforcement of a money judgment until paid to the beneficiary.
section,subdivision b specifies that prior to the time the minor becomes years old or is emancipated,no withdrawal by the beneficiary or any other individual,individuals,entity,or entities may be made of funds on deposit in trust without written order of the superior court.italics added.thus,the statute explicitly provides that the withdrawal prohibition is not limited to the beneficiary,parent,or trustee.
defendant argues that the phrase any other individual,individuals,entity or entities is used elsewhere in the statute as referring to the responsibilities of account trustees,subds.b,b,c,c,subd.d and should therefore be so limited in the provision in question.but in each of the instances referred to by defendant,the individual or entity refers specifically to a parent or trustee.in the phrase at issue here,the words trustee or parent are not used and there is no language limiting the scope of the words any other individual,individuals,entity,or entities to parents or tr
