in these consolidated writ proceedings,several nonresident defendants challenge the denial of their motions to quash service of summons based on lack of personal jurisdiction they contend their contacts with the state of california are insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this state.they also contend the trial court applied an improper standard of proof and erred in finding that two individual defendants made false representations to the plaintiffs at a meeting in california.we reject these arguments.
we conclude that by soliciting investors in california through the personal visits of their employees and others,petitioners established sufficient contacts with california to justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction in this state.we further conclude that activities that are undertaken on behalf of a defendant may be attributed to the defendant for purposes of personal jurisdiction if the defendant purposefully directed those activities at the forum state,regardless of the specific requirements of alter ego or agency,and that state law of alter ego and agency does not determine the constitutional limits to the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction.the denial of the motions to quash was proper.

the irish bank,the isle of man bank,the trust company,davies,and connolly filed two separate petitions for writ of mandate in this court,challenging the denial of their motions to quash.we consolidated the two writ proceedings,stayed the trial court proceedings,and issued an order to show cause.

discussion 
constitutional limits on the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
a california court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the extent allowed under the state and federal constitutions.code civ.the exercise of personal jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible only if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the state so that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.internat.shoe washington.internat.shoe accord,pavlovich superior court cal th,d,pavlovich.in other words,the defendant contacts with the forum state must be such that the defendant had fair warning that its activities might subject it to personal jurisdiction in the state.burger king rudzewicz,d burger king accord,volkswagen woodson,d.
in judging minimum contacts,a court properly focuses on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.citations.calder jones,d.each defendant contacts with the forum state must be assessed individually.id.at.great care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field.asahi metal industry superior court,d asahi.
a defendant that has substantial,continuous,and systematic contacts with the forum state is subject to general jurisdiction in the state,meaning jurisdiction on any cause of action.perkins benguet consol.mining.see vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.the brars do not contend petitioners are subject to general jurisdiction.instead,they contend and the court found that petitioners are subject to specific jurisdiction,meaning jurisdiction in an action arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum state.helicopteros nacionales de columbia hall,fn,d vons,supra,cal th at,d.specific jurisdiction depends on the quality and nature of the defendant forum contacts in relation to the particular cause of action alleged.cornelison chaney cal d.
a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits citation the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum citation and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice citation.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.the purposeful availment inquiry focuses on the defendant intentionality.citation.this prong is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum so that he should expect,by virtue of the benefit he receives,to be subject to the court jurisdiction based on his contacts with the forum.citation.ibid.

a controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant forum contacts,so as to satisfy the second requirement for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction,if there is a substantial connection between the forum contacts and the plaintiff claim.vons,supra,cal th at,d.the forum contacts need not be the proximate cause or but for cause of the alleged injuries.id.at,d.the forum contacts also need not be substantively relevant to the cause of action,meaning those contacts need not establish or support an element of the cause of action.id.at,d.a claim need not arise directly from the defendant forum contacts in order to be sufficiently related to the contact to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction.rather,as long as the claim bears a substantial connection to the nonresident forum contacts,the exercise of specific jurisdiction is appropriate.id.at,d.accordingly,in evaluating the quality and nature of the defendant forum contacts,we consider not only the conduct directly affecting the plaintiff,but also the broader course of conduct of which it is a part.cornelison chaney,supra,cal d at.
in determining whether the exercise of jurisdiction would be fair and reasonable,so as to satisfy the third requirement for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction,a court must consider the burden on the defendant of defending an action in the forum,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief,the interstate or international judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the states or nations shared interest in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.asahi,supra,at.see id.at.these considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.citations.on the other hand,where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction,he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.burger king,supra,at.
the commission of a tortious act within the forum state ordinarily justifies the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction in an action arising from the tortious act.magnecomp athene d.kaiser aetna deal d.see rest d conflict of laws.
standard of review 
a plaintiff opposing a motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction has the initial burden to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,facts establishing purposeful availment and a substantial connection between the defendant forum contacts and the plaintiff claim.snowney,supra,cal th at,d,dvi,superior court th,d.if the plaintiff satisfies that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable,that is,would not comport with fair play and substantial justice burger king,supra,at.snowney,supra,at,d,vons,supra,cal th at,d.if there is no conflict in the evidence,the question whether a defendant contacts with california are sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this state is a question of law that we review de novo.snowney,supra,at,d.if there is a conflict in the evidence underlying that determination,we review the trial court express or implied factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.vons,supra,cal th at,d.although the parties here dispute their opponents characterization of the facts,there is no material conflict in the evidence itself,so our review is de novo life assurance guarantee of north america d.
petitioners purposely availed themselves of forum benefits 
the irish bank,the isle of man bank,and the trust company worked closely together in connection with the leveraged investments.the irish bank reviewed and approved credit applications on behalf of the isle of man bank,which made the loans,and the trust company served as trustee of the trusts holding the with profit bonds that were purchased using the loan proceeds.davies,connolly,and mcgee visited california for the purpose of meeting with suitable investors who would be willing to invest in leveraged with profit bonds and whose investment funds were from legitimate sources.davies was managing director of the trust company at the time of his first visit to california and was a director of the isle of man bank at the time of his later visits to this state.connolly was employed by the trust company at the time of his visit to california and was also a director of the isle of man bank at that time.mcgee was managing director of the isle of man bank at the time of his visit to this state.although connolly was not an employee of the irish bank at the time,he visited california at the request of the irish bank and in furtherance of the common interests of the three entities.
the business cards handed out by davies and connolly exemplified the close relationship among the three entities for purposes of the leveraged investments.davies card bore an anglo irish bank logo yet identified him as managing director of the trust company.connolly card bore the same logo and identified him as head of offshore trust operations for the irish bank,although he was not formally employed by the irish bank at the time.
