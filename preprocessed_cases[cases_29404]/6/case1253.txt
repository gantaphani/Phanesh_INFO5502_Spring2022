if a class action representative plaintiff is never member of the class he purports to represent,may he obtain precertification discovery from the defendants for the express purpose of identifying a member of the class who is willing to become a named plaintiff and pursue the action as the current plaintiff is,in effect,a stranger to the action,we conclude the grant of such discovery would sanction an abuse of the class action procedure.we therefore conclude the trial court order granting the discovery was an abuse of discretion,and grant the defendants petition for writ relief.
factual and procedural background 
in february,plaintiff jeffrey albert sjobring bought a house.the house was not newly constructed sjobring bought it from its owners.sjobring loan broker obtained a purchase money loan for sjobring from wilmington finance.the seller real estate agent selected the escrow company,and the title insurer,first american indeed,sjobring had wanted to use a different title company,but the seller agent and the escrow company selected by the seller agent had been adamant about using first american.sjobring suspected that the seller agent might have received a kickback,either from the escrow company or first american.at some point,either during or immediately after closing,sjobring loan agent commented to sjobring that several of the escrow costs for which he had been charged seemed suspiciously high,including the cost of title insurance.sjobring made no complaint at this time.
in november the colorado division of insurance began an investigation into unlawful title insurance practices,in which it uncovered a reinsurance kickback scheme pursuant to the scheme,certain homebuilders,lenders and realtors formed their own reinsurance companies,known as captive insurers.they would refer all of their title insurance business to a particular title company if that title company agreed to reinsure the title policies with the captive insurer.the title company would forward premiums to the reinsurer,yet,in practice,the reinsurer did not accept any risk and the premium payments far exceeded any minimal risk the reinsurer may have accepted.in short,the reinsurance agreement was simply a way for the title insurer to transfer funds to the captive insurer as a payment for the referral of customers.in january,the california department of insurance began its own investigation into the same practice.on february,colorado announced that it had reached a settlement with first american title insurance company by which that entity agreed to refund million to consumers nationwide,and also agreed to end the practice.
four days later,sjobring filed the instant action,purporting to sue on behalf of himself,all others similarly situated,and the general public.he named as defendants first american title company of los angeles,wilmington finance,and numerous doe defendants.he alleged causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud,unjust enrichment,violation of the consumer legal remedies act clra,unfair business practices,and declaratory relief.sjobring introductory allegations explained,this class action is brought by plaintiff charging that title insurers in the state of california are paying money for referral business from lenders.these payments to lenders are rewards for channeling business to them.these kickbacks may be disguised as payments for bogus reinsurance which is purchased from captive insurers operated by the firms sending business to the title insurers.emphasis added.sjobring alleged that he was directed in part through his lender to purchase a title insurance policy from defendant first american title company of los angeles.he alleged,on information and belief,that first american title company of los angeles paid part of his premium to wilmington finance as a payment for the referral of his business.sjobring class allegations defined the class as all persons w ho paid in whole or in part for a title insurance policy,from first american title company of los angeles does through,which provided coverage for property located in the state of california f or whom part of the premium paid for the title insurance policy was received by wilmington finance,does through.
the california department of insurance investigation continued.on july,the department of insurance announced a million settlement with nine different title insurance companies first american title insurance company accounted for million of the settlement.some million of the first american title insurance company settlement consisted of the share of the colorado settlement payable to california consumers.this amount was described as a full refund of the ceded premium,which was to be refunded to some individuals the remaining million was a penalty obtained by the california department of insurance.the investigation and settlement encompassed reinsurance agreements in effect from january through december.during this period,first american title insurance company had issued more than five million title insurance policies in california.in other words,less than one percent of first american title insurance company customers were victims of the reinsurance scheme and entitled to refunds under the settlement.the press release announcing the settlement issued by the california department of insurance identified a list of builders,realtors and lenders who were implicated in the reinsurance scheme.wilmington finance was not among them.
on september,the president and chief executive officer of wilmington finance executed a declaration stating that wilmington finance had not entered into any reinsurance agreements with any first american entities and that wilmington finance had not been paid any compensation by first american entities for the referral of title insurance business.in light of this evidence,on october,sjobring requested the dismissal of the action against wilmington finance,without prejudice.
on november,sjobring filed his first amended complaint.the only difference between the first amended complaint and sjobring original pleading was the omission of the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.despite sjobring apparent acknowledgement that wilmington finance was not involved,sjobring still named wilmington finance as a defendant defined the class in terms of kickbacks to wilmington finance and doe defendants alleged wilmington finance had directed him to use first american title company of los angeles and alleged first american title company of los angeles had paid a kickback to wilmington finance.
concurrent with his first amended complaint,sjobring filed a case management statement.in pertinent part,the statement read,plaintiff counsel is considering the substitution or addition of a class representative.it is possible that no improper kickbacks were directly connected to sjobring purchase of title insurance.however,plaintiff may have suffered a direct injury if his title insurance premium was artificially inflated as a result of defendant practice of paying improper kickbacks on other title insurance policies.if it is determined that plaintiff sjobring can not represent the class,the court should allow plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint to redefine the class,or to add new individual plaintiffs,or both,in order to establish a suitable representative.citation.
on november,sjobring filed a public records act request with the california department of insurance,seeking all documents relating to its investigation of the improper title insurance practices.although several of the categories of information sought in sjobring request specifically referred to the investigation of the first american entities,it was in no way limited to such entities of particular note was sjobring request for a ll documents which constitute,evidence,memorialize,relate to,refer to the identity of any individual,consumer,homeowner or policyholder who was allegedly injured by first american improper title insurance rebating practices.on january,the department of insurance rejected sjobring request,indicating that the few public documents which his counsel already possessed were the only documents subject to disclosure 
on march,sjobring amended his complaint to name five additional first american entities as doe defendants on april,sjobring served extensive discovery requests on the first american defendants the discovery requests were specifically designed to obtain information regarding the extensive reinsurance kickback scheme involving the first american entities that was the subject of the california department of insurance investigation.the discovery also sought basic information regarding the title insurance practices of the first american entities.among other information,sjobring sought the names and addresses of the individuals who had received refunds pursuant to the california department of insurance settlement.sjobring would subsequently argue that the list of all individuals who had received refunds would help plaintiffs identify a suitable class representative and also lead to potential witnesses to first american improper rebatings,kickback payment practices.plaintiffs must also contact these individuals to determine whether they received their refunds and,if so how those refunds were received and whether they adequately compensated for damages.the first american entities did not provide the responses for which sjobring had hoped.
on june,two of the first american defendants first american title insurance company and first american homebuilders reinsurance company hereinafter,collectively defendants moved for summary adjudication of the issues the motions were based on the facts that defendants had not paid wilmington finance for the referral of sjobring business defendants had not done any improper acts and defendants were not,in fact,involved in any aspect of sjobring title insurance transaction.
on july,sjobring filed a motion for precertification discovery to seek class representatives.sjobring sought an order compelling defendants to provide to a administrator the names and addresses of all california homeowners who were compensated by defendants as part of the settlement with the california department of insurance.sjobring then sought approval for the administrator to send a letter to each identified homeowner,informing those individuals of the pendency of this action and asking any individual who would like to serve as a class representative to send an authorization form back to the administrator granting permission to be contacted by class counsel.sjobring motion explained,the underlying transaction from which plaintiff sjobring brought his claim was based on the payment of an illegal kickback from first american to defendant wilmington financ e.however,as this case has developed,it appears that first american did not have an illegal kickback scheme with wilmington financ e.as a result,wilmington financ e has been dismissed as a defendant.the dismissal of wilmington financ e puts plaintiff sjobring in the position of having his claim subject to unique defenses that other class members may not face,namely that there was not a direct kickback agreement involved in his purchase of title insurance.defendants have already moved for summary adjudication on this issue.if there is a potential difference between sjobring claims and those of the class,he may not be able to serve as an adequate representative for the plaintiff class.citation.as a result,sjobring brings the instant motion to allow precertification discovery seeking a new class representative.
sjobring also filed an ex parte motion to continue the hearing on the summary adjudication motions until after his motion for precertification discovery had been heard.the motion to continue was heard on august.at the hearing,sjobring conceded that wilmington finance did not have a kickback agreement with any first american entity.he argued,however,that he still had two potential theories of liability against the first american entities first,that perhaps another entity had channeled sjobring into buying his title policy from first american in return for a kickback and second,that sjobring was indirectly harmed by the reinsurance scheme,in that the reinsurance scheme resulted in elevated premiums for all first american customers to some extent.the first american entities objected to any continuance,on the basis that we have a fundamental jurisdictional issue.we do have a lawsuit here.there is nobody who is in front of the court as a plaintiff other than a bunch of lawyers looking for a client.the trial court granted the motion to continue the summary adjudication motions.
defendants then opposed the motion for precertification discovery on the basis that sjobring had no standing and could not seek defendants assistance in finding a plaintiff to sue them.defendants argued that the order sought by sjobring would be unprecedented,highly prejudicial to defendants,an invasion of the privacy of defendants customers,an exploitation of the discovery process,and an invitation to litigation abuse by lawyers looking for clients.defendants argued that while sjobring might be entitled to such discovery if he was a member of the class who,due to a change in law,could no longer represent the class,sjobring was never a member of the class alleged in his complaint,and therefore lacked standing to obtain discovery to locate a proper class representative.
in his reply,sjobring conceded that he is not a member of the class he proposed in his complaint,but argued that he still had standing to bring other causes of action against defendants.he argued,sjobring is seeking to determine whether another individual or individuals would be interested in stepping forward to represent the class that was proposed in his complaint.but sjobring still has standing to bring other claims against first american and he could serve as a class representative for a class consisting of first american policyholders who have otherwise been harmed by wrongful practices.sjobring is just not a good class representative for the reinsurance class.as the settlement with the california department of insurance demonstrated that defendants had engaged in wrongdoing against the proposed class,sjobring argued that california law favors allowing him discovery to obtain a new representative for that class.
at the hearing on the motion,the trial court expressed concern that lawyers not be permitted to file a class action with any random individual named as the class representative,and then use precertification discovery to obtain from the defendant a client who could legitimately represent the class.the court concluded,however,that this case did not present that scenario,because sjobring had in fact purchased a title insurance policy from a first american entity,and may have mistakenly believed that his policy had been subject to an illegal reinsurance kickback scheme.the trial court ultimately granted the motion for precertification discovery,apparently based on its determination of sjobring good faith.the court stated,well,sjobring thought he might have been a member of the class.turns out sjobring was mistaken.i think it appropriate and consistent with california law to give him some discovery now to see if he can find another representative.the court approved a letter to be sent by the administrator to the recipients of refunds pursuant to the department of insurance settlement.
defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate and request for immediate stay.we granted the stay and issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.we now grant the writ petition,and direct the trial court to vacate its order and enter a new and different order denying precertification discovery.
issue presented 
the sole issue presented is whether the trial court abused its discretion by granting sjobring precertification discovery to find a new class representative.sjobring argues that he may have standing to assert a kickback in his purchase of title insurance,or that he may have standing to bring a class action on behalf of all first american customers whose premiums might have been increased as a result of the reinsurance kickback scheme.these issues are not relevant to the resolution of the issue before us that issue can be framed as follows can a plaintiff who purports to bring a cause of action on behalf of a class of which he was never a member obtain precertification discovery to find a new class representative framed as such,the answer must be no.
discussion 
at issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting precertification discovery.appellate review of discovery rulings is governed by an abuse of discretion standard.experian information solutions,superior court th,d.
we first briefly address sjobring standing to represent the putative class.it is elementary that the named plaintiff in a class action must be a member of the class he purports to represent.trotsky los angeles fed.sav.loan d.in the specific context of unfair business practices actions,plaintiffs who were not members of the class were previously permitted,by statute,to bring class actions on behalf of the general public.bus,former.in november,the voters approved proposition,which changed this statute.now,an individual or entity may bring an unfair business practices class action only if that individual is a member of the class injured by the practice.bus.issues of standing are generally determined by reference to the allegations made in the complaint.shapell industries,superior court th,d.
in this case,the operative complaint,as amended,alleges a class consisting of all persons w ho paid in whole or in part for a title insurance policy,from a first american entity or other doe defendant which provided coverage for property located in the state of california f or whom part of the premium paid for the title insurance policy was received by does through.the gravamen of the complaint is that the first american entities paid kickbacks to lenders for the referral of title insurance business.sjobring originally alleged that he was a part of this class because wilmington finance directed him to use first american title company of los angeles,and received a kickback for this referral.sjobring now concedes that this is false regardless of whether sjobring may have another,unpleaded,claim against a first american entity,and regardless of whether sjobring made his initial allegations in good faith,the fact remains that sjobring is not,and never has been,a member of the class he sought to represent 
when it is determined that a class representative lacks standing to represent the class,the representative may be granted leave to amend to redefine the class or add new individual plaintiffs,or both.la sala american sav.loan cal d.this rule is usually applied in situations where the class representative originally had standing,but has since lost it by intervening law or facts,branick downey savings loan cal th,d,plaintiff in pending unfair competition case lost standing by intervening adoption of proposition foundation for taxpayer consumer rights nextel communications.th,d same la sala american sav.loan,supra,cal d at,class action plaintiff challenged defendant loan acceleration clause defendant waived enforcement of the clause against plaintiff.it has also been applied when the class representative had standing when she sent the defendant a demand letter threatening suit,but lacked standing when the suit was filed because the defendant had granted plaintiff individual relief in response to her demand letter.kagan gibraltar sav.loan cal d.we do not have such facts here and each of the foregoing cases is distinguishable on that ground.
sjobring relies on branick downey savings loan,supra,cal th at,d,for the proposition that,in california,a plaintiff who has never been a member of the class may amend the complaint to substitute in a plaintiff with standing to represent the class.whether sjobring should be granted leave to amend his complaint to name a new class representative,if he so moved,is not at issue in this proceeding.sjobring is apparently unaware of the identity of any member of the alleged class who seeks to become a representative plaintiff in this action.at issue here is whether defendants must provide sjobring discovery in order to enable him to find a new plaintiff.
two california cases have addressed the issue of precertification discovery of the identity of class members.both agreed that,in exercising its discretion,the court must weigh the danger of possible abuses of the class action procedure against the rights of the parties under the circumstances.best buy stores,superior court th,d parris superior court th,d.in the parris case,the named plaintiffs sought leave to have precertification communication with the class members,and to compel discovery of the names and addresses of potential class members.division seven of the second appellate district concluded that no leave was required simply to communicate with potential class members,but that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to compel discovery without expressly weighing the actual or potential abuse of the class action procedure that might be caused by permitting the discovery,on the one hand,against the rights of the parties,on the other hand.parris superior court,supra,th at,d.in best buy stores,the representative plaintiff was an attorney who had also intended to represent the class.intervening authority held that a lawyer could not be both a class representative and class counsel.best buy stores,superior court,supra,th at,d.as a result,plaintiff sought precertification discovery to seek additional class representatives.division three of the fourth appellate district upheld the trial court order granting such discovery,on the basis that the trial court had properly engaged in the weighing required by parris.best buy stores,at,d.
in this case,while the trial court did not expressly engage in the parris weighing process,it is unnecessary to remand for the trial court to do so.in light of the complete record presented to this documents submitted by sjobring which were apparently not before the trial court at the time it ruled on the motion we have no trouble concluding that the potential abuse of the class action procedure greatly outweighs the rights of the parties under the circumstances.
the instant case began with the colorado investigation into title insurance abuses.the state of colorado investigated such abuses,concluded first american entities were involved in an illegal scheme using captive reinsurers,and reached a settlement whereby the first american entities agreed to fully refund the overcharges to all affected customers nationwide.four days later,sjobring filed suit in california,seeking to represent,in effect,the california customers who were entitled to refunds under the colorado settlement.while sjobring had obtained title insurance from a first american entity,less than one percent of first american customers in california had been directly affected by the reinsurance scheme.regardless of whether sjobring initially had a good faith belief that he was,in fact,the victim of such a scheme by means of a kickback to wilmington finance,it is apparent that,by the time he moved to dismiss wilmington finance seven months later,he knew that he was not.
sjobring did not,at this point,dismiss his action or seek leave to amend it to allege facts by which he could state a cause of action against a first american entity.instead,he continued to pursue the claims of a class of which he was not a member.first,sjobring sought documents relating to the reinsurance scheme from the department of insurance.when that avenue proved unfruitful,sjobring then sought all documents relating to that scheme from the first american entities.the scope of sjobring fishing expedition is illustrated by sjobring claim that he needed the names and addresses of all individuals implicated by the settlement because he must contact these individuals to determine whether they received their refunds and,if so how those refunds were received and whether they adequately compensated for damages.sjobring had apparently appointed himself enforcement officer for the california department of insurance settlement agreement the fact that sjobring was,at this time,an acknowledged stranger to that
