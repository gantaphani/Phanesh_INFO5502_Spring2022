plaintiff andrea skov filed an action against defendant bank national association,as trustee for credit suisse first boston csfb,and others in which she alleged improprieties in the nonjudicial foreclosure process involving her residence the trial court sustained bank demurrer to the second amended complaint and dismissed the action.skov contends the trial court improperly took judicial notice of various recorded documents and the second amended complaint sufficiently pleaded her causes of action for wrongful foreclosure,unlawful business practices,and declaratory relief.we conclude that the second amended complaint sufficiently pleaded a violation of civil code section accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in december,skov obtained a loan of million,which was secured by a deed of trust in her residential property in saratoga.the deed of trust identified skov as the borrower,gateway as the lender,financial title company as trustee,and mers as acting solely as a nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns.mers is also identified as the beneficiary under this security instrument.the deed of trust further stated that borrower understands and agrees that mers holds only legal title to the interests granted by the borrower in this security instrument,but,if necessary to comply with law or custom,mers as nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns has the right to exercise any or all of those interests,including,but not limited to,the right to foreclose and sell the property.
after skov stopped making payments pursuant to the terms of the promissory note,ndex,which identified itself as an agent for mers,served skov with a notice of default on june.a declaration of compliance with section was recorded with the notice of default.on july,mers assigned all beneficial interest in the deed of trust to bank.on july,bank substituted ndex as trustee for financial title company.on september,ndex recorded a notice of trustee sale,which had been sent to skov.
on june,skov filed her second amended complaint and alleged nine causes of action,only three of which are the subject of the present appeal.the first cause of action for wrongful disclosure alleged that there were several improprieties in the assignment,transfer and exercise of the power of sale in the deed of trust.more specifically,skov alleged that since bank and mers were not assignees of the original note identified in the deed of trust,they did not have the right to exercise the power of sale contained in the deed of trust,and thus bank was not entitled to any debt on the property.it was also alleged that bank failed to comply with section until on or about july.the eighth cause of action for unlawful business practices bus,et alleged that bank failed to comply with section because it did not contact or attempt to contact her to discuss her options to avoid foreclosure prior to filing the notice of default.the ninth cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief sought a determination of the parties legal rights and duties and that the foreclosure of the property be permanently enjoined.skov also sought compensatory and punitive damages.
bank filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint.in support of its demurrer,bank requested judicial notice of the deed of trust,the notice of default,the notice of default declaration,the assignment of the deed of trust from mers to bank,the substitution of trustee,and the notice of trustee sale.the trial court granted the request for judicial notice,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and dismissed the action with prejudice.skov filed a timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer,we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,such facts being assumed true for this purpose.citations.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d,mccall.we may also consider matters that have been judicially noticed.citations.committee for green foothills santa clara county bd.of supervisors cal th,d.generally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.citation.cooper leslie salt cal d.
judicial notice 
conceding that the trial court could properly take judicial notice of recorded documents,skov contends it improperly took judicial notice of the truth,validity legal effect of bank foreclosure documents capitalization boldface omitted.
this issue was recently considered in fontenot wells fargo bank,th,d fontenot.in fontenot,the complaint sought injunctive relief and damages for wrongful foreclosure,and alleged,among other things,the improper transfers of the promissory note and security.id.at,d.in ruling on the defendant demurrer to the complaint,the trial court took judicial notice of two deeds of trust,an assignment of a deed of trust,and other documents required by the nonjudicial foreclosure procedure.id.at,d.
fontenot began its analysis by summarizing the principles regarding judicial notice we review the trial court ruling on the request for judicial notice for abuse of discretion.citation.judicial notice is the recognition and acceptance by the court,for use by the trier of fact or by the court,of the existence of a matter of law or fact that is relevant to an issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the matter.citation.when ruling on a demurrer,a court may take judicial notice of something that can not reasonably be controverted,even if it negates an express allegation of the pleading.citation.accordingly,evidence code section,subdivisions c and h,respectively,permit a court,in its discretion,to take judicial notice of o fficial acts of any state of the united states and f acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.fontenot,at,d.reasoning that recordation and use of a notary public in the execution of real property records ensures their reliability,and their maintenance in the recorder office enables them to be readily confirmed,fontenot concluded that a court may take judicial notice of the fact of a document recordation,the date the document was recorded and executed,the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded document,and the document legally operative language,assuming that there is no genuine dispute regarding the document authenticity.fontenot,at,d.
fontenot then rejected the plaintiff argument that the trial court improperly took judicial notice of the defendant designation as beneficiary in the deed of trust.fontenot,supra,th at,d.fontenot explained that the defendant status as beneficiary was not the type of fact that is generally an improper subject of judicial notice since its status was not a matter of fact existing apart from the document itself.rather,the defendant was the beneficiary under the deed of trust because,as a legally operative document,the deed of trust designated the defendant as the beneficiary.given this designation,the defendant status was not reasonably subject to dispute.ibid.accordingly,fontenot concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in taking judicial notice of the documents.ibid.
in fontenot,as in the present case,the plaintiff relied on mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d,overruled on other grounds in in re tobacco cases ii cal th,d,herrera deutsche bank national trust th,d,and abernathy valley,county of solano th,d,and argued that the trial court had improperly taken judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the recorded documents.fontenot,supra,th at,d.in mangini,the court held that judicial notice could not be taken of the truth of the conclusions in a report issued by the united states surgeon general or the truth of matters reported in newspaper articles.id.at,d.fontenot distinguished mangini,pointing out that the documents in that case were fundamentally informative documents,and the parties sought judicial notice of the facts contained in the documents without demonstrating the facts were not reasonably subject to dispute.citation.ibid.fontenot also distinguished herrera,stating that the facts of which the trial court here took judicial notice arose from the legal effect of the documents,rather than any statements of fact within them.id.at,d.fontenot summarily rejected abernathy,stating that it appears to differ with the weight of california authority.that case declined to take judicial notice of deeds,judgments,and indentures as evidence of actual conveyances because such use would require accepting the truth of the facts stated therein.citation.because its holding is stated in a conclusory manner,the exact reasoning of the decision is unclear,and we do not find it to be persuasive authority in this context.id.at,fn,d.
we agree with the analysis in fontenot.thus,we conclude that the trial court properly granted judicial notice of the facts arising from the legal effect of the documents,such as the status of an entity as the beneficiary,trustee,or its agent.however,as we conclude,infra,to the extent that the trial court took judicial notice of any disputed statements of fact contained within these documents,such as whether there was statutory compliance with section,it erred.
mers authority to initiate foreclosure 
skov contends that mers lacked authority to execute the notice of default and the assignment of the deed of trust,and thus each of the foreclosure documents was void.skov acknowledges that mers could have properly acted under the deed of trust when such action was required and necessary to comply with law or custom.however,she contends that bank failed to establish that these two conditions had occurred.we reject her contention.
an assignment of a deed of trust is legally permissible.one commentator has acknowledged that such assignments are customary,stating because the lien of the trust deed is merely an incident of the debt,the assignment by endorsement and delivery of the promissory note accomplishes the transfer of the security without the necessity of a formal assignment of the trust deed itself the better practice,however,is to assign the mortgage or trust deed also by a formal written document that is duly acknowledged and recorded.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fns.omitted italics added.moreover,an assignment of the deed of trust is usually signed by the beneficiary,not the party that the deed of trust identifies as lender.see miller starr,cal.real estate forms ed.thus,here,the assignment was executed by mers rather than gateway 
similarly,the recordation of a notice of default is required by law.a notice of default must be recorded by the trustee,beneficiary,or an agent of either,subd.a.thus,ndex properly signed the notice of default as the agent of mers,the beneficiary.
accordingly,statutes and standard legal texts establish that mers execution of the assignment of the deed of trust and its authorization of the notice of default were required and necessary to comply with law or custom.
skov also contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the declaration of compliance with section conclusively proved such compliance.bank argues the second amended complaint does not allege facts showing noncompliance with section section does not create a private claim of action and the national bank act preempts section.
statutory compliance 
section provides that a mortgagee,trustee,beneficiary,or authorized agent must contact the borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure or satisfy due diligence requirements before a notice of default is filed section does not require the lender to modify the loan.mabry,supra,th at,d.the only remedy for noncompliance with the statute is the postponement of the foreclosure sale.ibid.
whether a defendant has complied with a statute is a question of fact.see daum spinecare medical group,th,d.here,the second amended complaint alleged in relevant part skov was fully available to meet with bank to explore foreclosure options she hired attorneys or other representatives,who telephoned and sent letters to bank which were unanswered bank failed and refused to evaluate her finances,to advise her of her right to meet with bank to discuss foreclosure avoidance options,and to give her a hud telephone number and bank did not comply with the requirements of section because it did not contact her until on or about july,which was after it had recorded the notice of default on june.in response,bank requested judicial notice of the notice of default declaration that stated that the requirements of section had been met on june.however,whether bank complied with section is the type of fact that is reasonably subject to dispute,and thus,not a proper subject of judicial notice.see fontentot,supra,th at,d.
bank also argues that skov has failed to allege any facts to support her claim.bank asserts that her allegation that she was fully available to meet with bank does not establish noncompliance with section,claiming that despite skov supposed full availability,bank may have complied with section by attempting,unsuccessfully but in good faith,to contact skov.italics added.however,as bank argument recognizes,it may not have complied with the statutory requirements.assuming the truth of skov allegations,the issue of compliance can not be resolved at this stage of the litigation.mccall,supra,cal th at,d.
private right of action 
bank next contends that there is no private right of action for noncompliance with section.relying on lu hawaiian gardens casino,cal th,d,lu,bank asserts that mabry,supra,th,d,which held to the contrary,was wrongly decided 
lu,supra,cal th,d,considered whether labor code section,which provides that a gratuity is the sole property of the employee to whom it was given,contains a private right to sue.relying on moradi shalal fireman fund ins.companies cal d,lu stated that whether a party has a right to sue depends on whether the legislature has manifested an intent to create such a private cause of action under the statute.citations.lu,at.however,when the statutory language does not strongly and directly indicate that the legislature intended to create a private cause of action citation,then courts must examine the legislative history.lu,at.turning to the language of labor code section,lu noted that it did not expressly state that an employee had a right to bring an action for any violation of the statute.lu,at.lu also observed that related statutes provided that an employer who violated labor code section was guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine imprisonment,and that the department of industrial relations was charged with enforcement of the statute.lu,at.after reviewing the legislative history,lu concluded that there was no clear indication that the legislature intended to create a private right to sue under labor code section.lu,at.
relying on the restatement test for determining tort liability for a statutory violation,the plaintiff in lu argued that a private action was implied from the statute.lu,supra,cal th at,d.the restatement approach allows the court itself to create a new private right to sue,even if the legislature never considered creation of such a right if the court is of the opinion that a private right to sue is appropriate and needed.citation.id.at,d.the plaintiff further argued that this approach was confirmed in katzberg regents of university of california cal th,d.lu,at,d.lu rejected the plaintiff arguments and distinguished katzberg on the ground that it involved a private action to remedy a constitutional violation.lu,at,d.lu also noted that there was no language expressly entitl ing individuals to a refund or any other type of payment for violation of the statute.citation.lu,at,fn,d.in response to the plaintiff arguments that the department of industrial relations had no authority to recover misappropriated gratuities,lu stated that there were other remedies available to the plaintiff,such as an action for conversion.id.at,d.
here,as in lu,section does not expressly provide for a private right of actio
