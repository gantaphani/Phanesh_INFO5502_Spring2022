introduction 
a probate court ordered the distribution of real property to a surviving spouse who executed and recorded a deed of trust on the real property in favor of a lender to secure a loan.when the surviving spouse died,and payments were not made on the loan,the lender recorded a notice of default and election to sell the real property.plaintiffs,who purported to have a remainder fee interest in the real property,brought an action,inter alia,to quiet title to the property.they claimed that the surviving spouse only had a life estate in the real property and had no power to encumber it.the lender contends that the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs because,inter alia,the surviving spouse had the power to sell the property during her lifetime with the proceeds being divided among her and plaintiffs,the probate court order should be interpreted as providing her with fee title to the property and thus the power to encumber it and the encumbering of real property with a deed of trust was a permissible conveyance of a fee simple estate in the real property.the lender contends alternatively that the surviving spouse had a percentage fee interest in the property and,as a matter of equity,the loan should be viewed as an advance against the proceeds to which the surviving spouse would have been entitled had the property been sold during her life we reject the lender contentions and affirm the judgment in favor of plaintiffs.even though the surviving spouse had a right to sell the property,that right did not convert her life estate into a fee simple estate.the lender had no rights in the property upon the death of the surviving spouse.

ii.the trial court properly found that jacqueline held a life estate in the property 
wells fargo ultimately conceded that if jacqueline held a life estate in the property,she could not encumber the fee interest in the property unless,as wells fargo contends,and as discussed post,the encumbrance is treated as a permissible sale of the property civil code section provides,a fee simple title is presumed to be intended to pass by a grant of real property,unless it appears from the grant that a lesser estate was intended.as the court in estate of smythe d at pages through said,a life estate is an estate whose duration is limited to the life of the person holding it or of some other person.citation.it is not an essential requisite to the giving of a life estate,that it be expressly declared to be such,nor that the term life estate shall be used.the intention can as well be manifested by other words,referring to the estate conveyed and describing its characteristics,and if by that means the intention to vest a life estate,only,is shown,it will be as effectual as if it were expressly so stated.citation.
in estate of smythe,supra,d,the decedent will contained the following provision all that i possess i give and bequeath to this same ruth smyth for her during her life time,as she may need or see fit to use.if,upon her death,any of my estate remains,it is my will that such remainder be divided equally through her will between pacific home a california corporation in los angeles,where i now reside,and the church of the messiah,of which i am now a member.id.at.the trial court ordered the property distributed to ruth smyth in fee unconditionally,without restrictions or limitations.ibid.pacific home and church of the messiah appealed.ibid.
on appeal,pacific home and church of the messiah contended that the decedent will created a life estate in ruth smyth with the right of use and the remainder to them.estate of smythe,supra,d at.ruth smyth contended she took an absolute fee simple estate in all of the decedent property and that the attempted disposition to pacific home and church of the messiah therefore was void.ibid.the court of appeal agreed with pacific home and church of the messiah,holding that the will had given the property to ruth smyth for her life with the power to consume the property as she saw fit and the remainder to pacific home and church of the messiah.ibid.the court explained,where an estate is devised in fee,a gift over of what is left or not disposed of by the first taker is void.this rule,called the power rule,has no application if the estate of the first taker is a life estate.citation.a life estate with power to use and consume part or all of the principal for specified purposes and a limitation over of the remainder on termination of the life estate has long been recognized in this state.citation.such power of absolute disposition,annexed to a life estate,does not enlarge that estate into an estate in fee.citations.the rule in this state,in accord with the majority view,is that where an estate for life with remainder over is given with a power of disposition in fee of the remainder annexed,the limitation for the life of the first taker will control and the life estate will not be enlarged to a fee notwithstanding the power of the life tenant to dispose of the fee.citations.id.at see estate of cooper d,see also luscomb fintzelberg cal,the authorities are uniform to the effect that where such are the terms of a devise a life estate only being expressly given to the first taker,with power of disposition of the property for a certain purpose,with a devise over the life estate is not enlarged into either a fee or an absolute right of property see also adams prather cal,will leaving estate to surviving spouse,who had unrestricted use and consumption during his life,remainder to be given to named relatives upon his death created life estate hardy mayhew cal,one with life estate can have the power to dispose or consume the whole of the property estate of mckenna d,miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,at express language in the grant or will may confer on the life tenant the right to totally consume the corpus of the estate for the care,support,and maintenance of the life tenant,but this power does not enlarge the estate into a fee rest d property,com.c,sometimes a document of transfer gives a transferee a legal life estate in property and also a presently exercisable general power of appointment over the property in which the life estate exists.the combination of the power and the life estate in the same person does not change the person ownership interest into a fee simple absolute,even though the presently exercisable general power enables the owner of the life estate to accomplish most of the things that an owner in fee simple could accomplish rest d property,supra,com.h,at a life estate is sometimes coupled with a power to sell or dispose of a larger estate or to consume the whole.historically,such an estate would have been called a life estate coupled with a power to sell,consume,or dispose,but in function the estate is a life estate with a power of appointment in the life tenant rest d property,com.b.
relying on civil code section,subdivisions a and a wells fargo contends that the probate order conveyed to jacqueline a fee estate subject to limiting conditions or conditions subsequent,conditions that would terminate her fee estate,and not a life estate,because it was not certain under the probate order that plaintiffs ultimately would receive fee title to the property.that is,if jacqueline remarried,thus forcing a sale of the property or if she elected to sell the property during her lifetime,then plaintiffs would not receive fee title to the property at jacqueline death.thus,wells fargo argues,the probate order transferred to jacqueline a fee interest in the property subject to conditions subsequent the conditions subsequent being the sale of the property,or remarriage,or the property passing to plaintiffs on jacqueline death.the probate order,however,granted jacqueline a lifetime interest in the property that terminated upon her death.as explained above,that jacqueline was required or permitted to sell the property during her lifetime did not transform her life estate interest into a fee interest.estate of smythe,supra,d at.
the probate order provided that jacqueline could live in the property rent free for her lifetime and that the property would pass to plaintiffs at her death.jacqueline was permitted to sell the property during her life,and the property had to be sold if she remarried.the proceeds of any sale would be divided equally between jacqueline and each of the plaintiffs.because the probate order granted jacqueline the right to live in the property rent free for her lifetime and provided that the property would pass to plaintiffs at her death,the probate order established in jacqueline a life estate interest in the property and in plaintiffs a fee interest as remaindermen.giving jacqueline a residence during her lifetime established a life estate because that is a limitation on the duration of her estate,not a condition on the use of the property.that jacqueline was granted the right to sell the property or that the property had to be sold if she remarried did not convert her life estate interest in the property into a fee interest.that right and obligation to sell were limitations on the estate granted,not conditions subsequent.luscomb fintzelberg,supra,cal.at estate of smythe,supra,d at see also in re reinhardt cal,determinable life estate estate of bernatas d,life estate determinable upon remarriage estate of horgan d,when property is bequeathed for life or until devisee remarries,the devisee has a life estate with a limitation and not a condition subsequent tiffany o
