we denied appellant petition for panel rehearing.in response to the petition for rehearing,the opinion of the court issued on july,at cir,is withdrawn,and the following is substituted.
this appeal arises from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of washington mutual bank washington mutual on philip berquist claim of age discrimination.we affirm the district court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
berquist began his career working in the internal audit department of united savings bank.in,bank united acquired united savings bank,which retained berquist as an employee.berquist received several promotions during his tenure with united savings bank and bank united.in,bank united merged with washington mutual.washington mutual asked berquist to stay an additional nine months after the merger to help consolidate the risk rating grids used in the two credit review departments.berquist accepted this offer.
following this period,washington mutual offered berquist a permanent position.berquist held the position of senior credit examiner,loan review department,corporate credit risk management.berquist alleges that he was qualified for the new position,he received exceeds expectations performance evaluations in and early,and he never received written or verbal notices criticizing his job performance.in september,washington mutual hired melissa martinez to supervise the bank credit review function,and in early,promoted martinez to chief credit review officer.martinez served as the corporate manager of berquist duties throughout the deterioration of his employment relationship with the bank.
in november,the bank decided to transfer berquist job functions from houston,texas,to seattle,washington.in light of this business decision,washington mutual offered berquist a different job in the credit review department.washington mutual contends that berquist work tasks,prior to november,only involved operational and administrative duties.after this date,berquist job duties required credit review skills.martinez asked berquist to work on the review and approval of unissued loan reports.berquist accepted this job position and exclusively focused on review and approval work from early november to february.
in late,the credit review department of the houston office was staffed by berquist,age,ron yancis,age,donald plaisance,age,and karl zatopek,age.berquist and yancis worked in the commercial banking group cbg under the management of robert granfelt.plaisance and zatopek worked in the specialty finance group sfg under the management of cynthia hart,and later under the immediate supervision of scott frazee.frazee counterpart position in cbg remained vacant,and therefore,frazee acted as the administrative manager for both groups.
during a december conference call,berquist alleges that martinez said,performance issues will be promptly and aggressively dealt with.we will build leaders internally and attract younger talent.on february,martinez reported to berquist that she was very unhappy with the houston office production.shortly thereafter,martinez issued berquist a performance improvement notice pin,criticizing berquist allegedly negative attitude,poor communication skills,and below standard work product.the pin also alleged that berquist t echnical skills and proficiencies are operational in nature and not commensurate with the job function,ccr corporate credit review focus,or those required for a credit review officer.
in response to the pin,berquist asked for specific examples,which he never received from martinez.berquist denied every allegation of poor work performance in a written response.berquist conceded that his work experience before the merger was strictly in an administrative and operational role,and based on his understanding,washington mutual asked him to remain with the bank to continue in his administrative and operational duties.further,berquist adds that i have never at any time represented to anyone that i have specific expertise in credit review since my responsibilities at both bank united and washington mutual were solely of an administrative and operational nature.
on may,martinez told berquist that his skills and proficiencies were no longer needed in the credit review function.martinez allowed berquist days to find a position in another department of washington mutual.berquist asserts that he asked martinez to downgrade his pin so as to not prevent an internal transfer to another position,but she denied this request.
on june,washington mutual offered berquist a separation proposal,which he refused to accept.following this offer,on june,martinez conveyed to berquist that he would be laid off in conjunction with a reorganization of the cbg.washington mutual contends that it decided for business reasons to eliminate the cbg function in houston and transfer the group to seattle or california because the west coast handled a greater portion of the cbg asset base.based on this avowed business decision,berquist did not receive days to secure another position.
berquist filed suit against washington mutual alleging violation of the age discrimination in employment act of,et adea,and washington mutual moved for summary judgment.the district court granted washington mutual motion.the court concluded that berquist failed to establish a prima facie case of wrongful termination based on age discrimination because the record lacked evidence of berquist qualifications for his position.additionally,the court concluded that berquist failed to establish a prima facie case of reduction in force based on unlawful age discrimination because the record lacked evidence of berquist being qualified for another position in the company.berquist does not appeal the district court holding on his claim of reduction in force based on unlawful age discrimination therefore,we address whether the district court properly granted summary judgment on his wrongful termination claim.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.machinchick power,cir.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must determine whether the submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c hart hairston,cir.in deciding whether a fact issue has been created,the facts and inferences to be drawn from them must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.reaves brokerage sunbelt fruit vegetable,cir.even if we do not agree with the reasons given by the district court to support summary judgment,we may affirm the district court ruling on any grounds supported by the record.lifecare hospitals,health plus of louisiana,cir citing forsyth barr,cir.
iii.discussion 
under the adea,i t shall be unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a.a plaintiff can demonstrate age discrimination in two ways,either through direct evidence or by an indirect or inferential circumstantial method of proof.rachid jack in the box,cir.a plaintiff relying on circumstantial evidence must put forth a prima facie case,at which point the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate,reason for the employment decision.willis coca cola,cir.if a plaintiff produces direct evidence of discrimination,no further showing is required,and the burden shifts to the employer trans world airlines,thurston,d.
to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination based on circumstantial evidence,a plaintiff must show that he was discharged he was qualified for the position he was within the protected class at the time of discharge and he was either i replaced by someone outside the protected class,ii replaced by someone younger,or iii otherwise discharged because of his age.rachid,at internal quotations and citations omitted palasota haggar clothing,cir.berquist fulfills the first and third elements of a prima facie case he was terminated from his position and he was a member of the protected class at the time of discharge.with respect to the remaining elements,we first determine whether berquist fulfilled the second component of a prima facie case,demonstrating his qualifications for the position of a credit review officer.
whether berquist was qualified for the position 
according to berquist,he met the objective criteria listed in a job posting for credit review officers and held the title of credit examiner for two years after the merger.berquist contends that he has performed the same job since,which includes the operational,audit,and administrative areas of credit review.to the contrary,washington mutual argues that absent the reorganization eliminating berquist job function,berquist still could not have remained in his position as a credit review officer.washington mutual explains that berquist lacked any background and experience in credit process review instead,berquist only held internal audit positions during his seventeen years at united savings bank and bank united.washington mutual maintains that berquist prior work experience included cataloging the risk grades of bank united loans and preparing audit committee reports.
the district court concluded that berquist was not qualified for his position at washington mutual because the fact that berquist was given the position of credit review officer in the first place does not constitute evidence that he was qualified.to hold otherwise would be to eliminate the qualification element in every case involving termination.the district court conclusion was error and expressly foreclosed under fifth circuit precedent established in bienkowski american airlines,cir.the record does not reflect that the district court considered bienkowski in its analysis of berquist claim similarly,washington mutual did not address bienkowski in its brief to this court.
in bienkowski,an employer alleged that the plaintiff was not qualified for his job as a security representative,even though his performance had been satisfactory for ten years,because his supervisors became unsatisfied with his work.id.at.the employer submitted two affidavits from the plaintiff supervisors documenting a decline in his performance.id.at.the employer argued that under the mcdonnell douglas test,the plaintiff must prove that he performed his job to the standards of his employer.id.thus,the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case.id.this court reasoned that 
a plaintiff challenging his termination or demotion can ordinarily establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that he continued to possess the necessary qualifications for his job at the time of the adverse action 
by this we mean that plaintiff had not suffered physical disability or loss of a necessary professional license or some other occurrence that rendered him unfit for the position for which he was hired.
id.at.the court established this rule in order to simplify application of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm in the context of termination and demotion cases.the court concluded that in applying this reasoning,t he lines of battle may then be drawn over the employer articulated reason for its action and whether that reason is a pretext for age discrimination.id.at.
after the merger,berquist monitored the process of conforming bank united risk ratings to washington mutual rating system.once berquist completed the conversion,washington mutual assigned berquist to a credit process review position.washington mutual interprets berquist response to the pin issued in march,reiterating his skills in the operational and administrative side of credit review,as an admission that he lacked qualifications in the credit review arena.washington mutual characterizes his statements as undisputed evidence,demonstrating that berquist did not have the skills,experience and background for credit review process work at washington mutual.more specifically,washington mutual maintains that berquist could not lead a credit review examination through origination,administration,and.
similar to the plaintiff in bienkowski,however,berquist possessed the same job qualifications when washington mutual terminated him as when martinez assigned him to the credit review position.accordingly,berquist need not show that his performance met washington mutual expectations to establish a prima facie case.although washington mutual submitted evidence that berquist supervisors were not pleased with his performance,this evidence does not prove a lack of qualifications at the prima facie stage.see medina ramsey steel,cir holding that an employer may not utilize wholly subjective standards by which to judge its employees qualifications and then plead lack of qualification when its promotion process is challenged as discriminatory lindsey prive,cir holding that it is not appropriate for the district court to determine whether subjective criteria are bona fide,in effect making dispositive determinations about the employer credibility,on summary judgment.as aptly stated in bienkowski,p lacing a plaintiff qualifications in issue at both the prima facie and pretext stages of a termination case is an unnecessary redundancy.id.at.therefore,for the limited purposes of establishing a prima facie case,berquist demonstrated that he was qualified for his position.
whether berquist was otherwise discharged because of his age 
the final prong of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination requires berquist to show that he was replaced by someone outside the protected class,replaced by someone younger,or otherwise discharged because of his age.rachid,at.the district court did not reach this issue,but the parties presented arguments on this final element before the district court and this court on appeal.
as a starting point,the record does not support a finding that berquist was replaced by someone either outside the protected class or by someone younger than himself.berquist argues that washington mutual decision to terminate him and yancis,the two older employees in the houston office,while offering the younger plaisance and zatopek the option of transferring to the dallas office proves age discrimination.the undisputed facts surrounding berquist job function and washington mutual reorganization,however,do not demonstrate that berquist was replaced by plaisance and zatopek.as explained in greater detail below,plaisance and zatopek,the sfg credit process reviewers,remained in the houston office for several months after berquist cbg functions were transferred to california.moreover,berquist presented no evidence to show who washington mutual hired to work in the california office.therefore,the only path available for berquist to establish a prima facie case is to show that he was otherwise discharged because of his age.id.
martinez remarks 
berquist asserts that martinez comments regarding the desire to attract younger talent,and her reference to plaisance and zatopek as the younger credit review officers,support his claim of age discrimination.statements evince unlawful discrimination only if the comments first,demonstrate discriminatory animus and,second,are made by a person primarily responsible for the adverse employment action or by a person with influence or leverage over the formal decisionmaker.laxton gap,cir citing russell mckinney hosp.venture,cir.under this test,martinez comments do not constitute evidence of age discrimination.
martinez made the first comment regarding younger talent in december,six months before washington mutual terminated berquist,and the comment does not at all relate to this employment decision.according to berquist contemporaneous transcription of the comment,martinez stated that performance issues will be promptly and aggressively dealt with.we will build leaders internally and attract younger talent.washington mutual contends that regardless of whether martinez expressed an intention to attract younger talent,this remark was too vague and remote in time to show any discriminatory animus on the part of washington mutual in terminating berquist.
martinez made no mention of replacing older employees with younger recruits or directly hiring younger employees into leadership positions.unlike other cases in which we have considered remarks as evidence of discriminatory intent,this comment was a broad statement not directed to any particular employee about her management goals and remote in time from berquist firing.see machinchick pb power,at,cir supervisor sent,just weeks before terminating plaintiff,discussing plans to strategically hire some younger engineers and designers supervisor said plaintiff was inflexible and not adaptable rachid,at,holding that employer ageist comments to and about employee constituted evidence of age discrimination bienkowski,at holding that comments requiring the employee to look sharp and criticizing an inability to adapt to new procedures constituted evidence of age discrimination palasota,at supervisor sent a memorandum,two months before plaintiff termination,recommending severance packages for fourteen named employees,all of whom were specifically identified as over fifty years of age,to create the flexibility to bring on some new players.accordingly,in this context,we conclude that this statement is not evidence of age discrimination.
as to martinez reference to plaisance and zatopek as younger employees,washington mutual asserts,and berquist offers no alternative interpretation,that martinez made this comment to contrast plaisance and zatopek with berquist,the senior employee in the department.in his role as the senior employee,martinez expected berquist to provide leadership for the inexperienced members of the group.berquist provides a similarly harmless interpretation of this statement in his response to the pin,which was written prior to this litigation.berquist writes that 
the criticism mentioned repeatedly on march from martinez and hart was that i did not notify them of the lack of desk reviews being sent to houston to be performed by the young guys in the houston office.i responded that since i reported directly to ron yancis at the time,it was not in my work experience to go over my boss head directly to credit review management martinez told me that i was a senior officer in this office and that other two employees in the department besides former regional manager ron yancis and myself were inexperienced young men who needed leadership.
based on berquist personal impressions of the statement,we decline to characterize this comment as anything more than a comment unrelated to an unlawful discriminatory animus.both statements are consistent with washington mutual stated commitment to build leaders internally based on available resources within the corporation.accordingly,martinez comments are not sufficient evidence of age discrimination.
other circumstantial evidence 
in addition to the above remarks,as stated supra,berquist contends that washington mutual decision to terminate him and yancis,the two older houston employees,while offering the younger plaisance and zatopek the option of transferring to the dallas office further supports his claim of age discrimination.according to berquist,all four employees were performing the same sfg work at the time of his termination.berquist also maintains that washington mutual age bias prompted martinez to issue only the older employees a pin.berquist contends that washington mutual then suggested an internal transfer to resolve his employment issues but refused to facilitate this action because martinez would not downgrade his pin.
washington mutual contends that the disparate treatment of berquist and the younger employees,plaisance and zatopek,was based on the differing job functions performed by the two sets of employees.washington mutual argues that,although berquist performed overflow work from sfg,everyone in houston pitched in to work on sfg reports during downtime.plaisance and zatopek were the only two employees,however,with years of experience in this specialty area.
in disparate treatment cases,the must show nearly identical circumstances for employees to be considered similarly situated.perez.dep t of criminal justice,cir quoting little republic refining,cir.berquist performed an array of jobs after the bank mutual merger.berquist initially stayed with the bank,at the request of don dahrens,for the specific purpose of assisting with the conversion of bank united risk grading system for loans to washington mutual system.in late october,washington mutual moved this function to seattle,washington,and berquist no longer worked with converting the risk rating grids.
martinez then assigned berquist to a national team reviewing a residential construction portfolio.after the group first meeting,martinez removed berquist from the residential construction portfolio and asked him to assist with the review and approval of credit reports.this assignment involved clearing a large backlog of unissued loan review reports.at some point in early march,berquist began working on change request summaries crs.crs require a determination of whether to increase or decrease a customer credit rating based on a credit review.in her deposition,martinez explained that the crs process was segmented into two teams,the sfg and cbg.sfg handled a different business line from cbg,cbg involved a larger work load and larger assets under management.martinez also stated that i f there was overflow from sfg then that would be allocated,and then berquist may have been assigned those.
martinez explanation comports with berquist account of the work distribution.berquist testified that during slow periods,after receiving a stack of crs in the mail,someone simply grabbed a stack of crs without any regard to whether the files dealt with sfg or cbg loans.berquist also testified in his deposition that after receiving his pin,the houston group received an email from either martinez or cynthia hart,the sfg manager,announcing that zatopek and plaisance were being permanently assigned to the sfg function.in this capacity,zatopek and plaisance attended a national meeting concerning their duties in the sfg position.berquist and yancis did not attend this meeting.moreover,berquist and yancis directly reported to bob granfelt,and only in the event of a workflow issue did these two employees report to frazee as their administrative supervisor.frazee managed the tracking system of work assignments for the houston office.finally,to this court,berquist represented that he was initially assigned sfg work and then assigned to the cbg position.thus,the pin and berquist response to the pin pertained to his sfg work,not the cbg position that appellee alleges he was assigned after he was given his pin.
the explanations provided by martinez and berquist regarding the division of labor in the houston office demonstrate that berquist was not similarly situated with zatopek and plaisance therefore,the employment decisions applied to zatopek and plaisance can not be used to support berquist claim of age discrimination.accordingly,based on the uncontroverted evidence,berquist can not argue that zatopek and plaisance were similarly situated employees treated differently from himself based on unlawful age discrimination.
berquist also argues that the pin from martinez accounts for one additional peg in the series of discriminatory events leading to his termination.berquist asserts that the pin supports his claim of age discrimination because it directly conflicts with verbal conversations between himself and martinez,and only the two older employees,himself and yancis,received a notice.berquist also maintains that frazee refused to participate in the pin because he did not agree with martinez performance assessment.
in early,the corporate credit review department of washington mutual consisted of percent of employees over,and percent of employees over.during the reorganization,martinez issued pin to only five employees under her management.based on berquist admission that he lacked skills in sfg review,his position,it is difficult to interpret the negative evaluation as motivated by age discrimination.on february,berquist sent an email to martinez attempting to carve out a position better suited
