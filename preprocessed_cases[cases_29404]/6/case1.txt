petitioner shaw used identifying numbers of a bank account belonging to bank customer hsu in a scheme to transfer funds from that account to accounts at other institutions from which shaw was able to obtain hsu funds.shaw was convicted of violating,which makes it a crime to knowingly execut e a scheme to defraud a financial institution.the ninth circuit affirmed.
subsection of the bank fraud statute covers schemes to deprive a bank of money in a customer deposit account.shaw arguments in favor of his claim that subsection does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor,not a bank,are unpersuasive.
first,the bank did have property rights in hsu bank deposits when a customer deposits funds,the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds,which the bank has a right to use as a source of loans that help the bank earn profits.sometimes,the contract between the customer and the bank provides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank only assumes possession even then,the bank has a property interest in the funds because its role is akin to that of a bailee.hence,for purposes of the bank fraud statute,a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a financial institution,at least where,as here,the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits,the funds obtained came from the deposit account,and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds.
second,shaw may not have intended to cause the bank financial harm,but the statute,while insisting upon a scheme to defraud,demands neither a showing that the bank suffered ultimate financial loss nor a showing that the defendant intended to cause such loss.this court has found no case that interprets the statute as shaw does.carpenter united states.
third,that shaw may have been ignorant of relevant property law is no defense to criminal prosecution for bank fraud.shaw knew that the bank possessed hsu account,shaw made false statements to the bank,shaw believed that those false statements would lead the bank to release from that account funds that ultimately and wrongfully ended up with shaw,and the bank in fact possessed a property interest in the account.these facts are sufficient to show that shaw knew that he was entering into a scheme to defraud the bank even if he was not aware of the niceties of property law.pasquantino united states.
fourth,shaw mistakenly contends that the statute requires the government to prove not just that he acted with the knowledge that he would likely harm the bank property interest but also that such was his purpose.this court has found no relevant authority supporting the view that a statute making criminal the knowin g execut ion of a scheme to defraud requires something more than knowledge.allison engine united states ex rel.sanders,tanner united states,united states cohn,and bridges united states,distinguished.
fifth,subsection of the bank fraud statute,which makes criminal the use of false or fraudulent pretenses to obtain property under the custody or control of a bank,may overlap with subsection,but it does not do so completely.thus,it should not be read as excluding from subsection applications that would otherwise fall within the scope of subsection,such as the conduct at issue in this case.see loughrin united states.
finally,because the bank fraud statute is clear enough,the rule of lenity is not implicated.
with regard to the parties dispute over whether the district court improperly instructed the jury that a scheme to defraud a bank must be one to deceive the bank or deprive it of something of value,instead of one to deceive and deprive,the ninth circuit is left to determine whether that question was properly presented and if so,whether the instruction given is lawful,and,if not,whether any error was harmless in this case.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
a federal statute makes it a crime knowingly to execut e a scheme to defraud a financial institution,for example,a federally insured bank.the petitioner,lawrence shaw,was convicted of violating this provision.he argues here that the provision does not apply to him because he intended to cheat only a bank depositor,not a bank.we do not accept his arguments.
the relevant criminal statute makes it a crime 
knowingly to execut e a scheme 
to defraud a financial institution or 
to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
shaw obtained the identifying numbers of a bank of america account belonging to a bank customer,stanley hsu.shaw used those numbers and other related information to transfer funds from hsu account to other accounts at other institutions from which shaw could obtain and eventually did obtain hsu funds.shaw was convicted of violating the first clause of the statute,namely,the prohibition against defraud ing a financial institution.the ninth circuit affirmed his conviction.shaw then filed a petition for certiorari arguing that the words scheme to defraud a financial institution require the government to prove that the defendant had a specific intent not only to deceive,but also to cheat,a bank,rather than a third party.pet.for cert.i.we granted review.
shaw makes several related arguments in favor of his basic claim,namely,that the statute does not cover schemes to deprive a bank of customer deposits.first,he says that subsection requires an intent to wrong a victim bank a financial institution in its property rights brief for petitioner.he adds that the property he took,money in hsu bank account,belonged to hsu,the bank customer,and that hsu is not a financial institution.at.hence shaw was a scheme designed to obtain only a bank customer property,not a bank own property.at.
the basic flaw in this argument lies in the fact that the bank,too,had property rights in hsu bank account.when a customer deposits funds,the bank ordinarily becomes the owner of the funds and consequently has the right to use the funds as a source of loans that help the bank earn profits though the customer retains the right,for example,to withdraw funds.michie,banks and banking,ch,michie,at,at phoenix bank risley.sometimes,the contract between the customer and the bank provides that the customer retains ownership of the funds and the bank merely assumes possession.michie,ch,at phoenix bank,supra,at.but even then the bank is like a bailee,say,a garage that stores a customer car.michie,ch,at.and as bailee,the bank can assert the right to possess the deposited funds against all the world but for the bailor or,say,the bailor authorized agent.am.jur,bailment.this right,too,is a property right.blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england referring to a bailee right in a bailment as a special qualified property thus,shaw scheme to cheat hsu was also a scheme to deprive the bank of certain bank property rights.
hence,for purposes of the bank fraud statute,a scheme fraudulently to obtain funds from a bank depositor account normally is also a scheme fraudulently to obtain property from a financial institution,at least where,as here,the defendant knew that the bank held the deposits,the funds obtained came from the deposit account,and the defendant misled the bank in order to obtain those funds.
second,shaw says he did not intend to cause the bank financial harm.indeed,the parties appear to agree that,due to standard banking practices in
