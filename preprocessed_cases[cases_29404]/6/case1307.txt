in yu signet th,d yu i,we reversed a summary judgment entered for defendants signet and capital one bank collectively banks on causes of action in the second amended complaint of plaintiffs william and darlene yu for abuse of process,and unlawful and unfair business practice bus.in the present appeal by the yus,we reverse the judgment entered for banks on these causes of action after their demurrer to the third amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend.in banks appeal,we affirm the order denying their motion to strike the action under the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute code civ,hereafter.
background 
a.our prior decision 
as described in yu i,this lawsuit seeks to redress an improper debt collection practice of virginia banks against california residents.the yus accepted a credit card from signet in,used it to make purchases,and defaulted on repayments.signet sued them on the debt in virginia in,obtained a default judgment,and served a garnishment summons on a virginia office of william yu employer,with directions that it be forwarded to his place of employment in california.yu wages were garnished from november to may to satisfy the judgment.the yus had no contact with virginia other than their credit card with signet.
the yus filed this suit as a class action against signet and its successor,capital one,alleging that banks program of pursuing collection actions in virginia against california credit card holders constituted distant forum abuse,the practice of collecting consumer obligations by suing debtors in distant locations to deprive them of the opportunity to defend themselves.yu i,supra,th at,d,citing chen,due process as consumer protection state remedies for distant forum abuse akron.distant forum abuse is unconscionable barquis merchants collection cal d,and insidious chen,supra,akron.at conduct employing an ostensibly legitimate legal process to deprive consumers of basic opportunities which should be afforded all litigants ibid.m isuse of the courts in this manner contributes to an undermining of confidence in the judiciary by reinforcing the unfortunate image of courts as distant entities,available only to wealthy or large interests,and leads consumers to conclude that the legal system is merely a rubber stamp for the improper practices utilized by predatory agencies.barquis merchants collection,supra,at.thus,courts have a strong interest in ensuring that such abuses of the legal process by collection agencies are not perpetuated.ibid.
the yus asserted causes of action for violations of due process and of california debt collection statutes,for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and for abuse of process and unlawful business practice.judgment was entered for banks after their motion for summary judgment was granted.in yu i,we reversed the judgment on the abuse of process and unlawful business practice claims,concluding that there were triable issues as to those claims under our supreme court decision in the barquis case.
to quote from our opinion in yu i,barquis merchants collection,supra,cal d at,held that a creditor who files consumer debt collection actions in an improper venue,knowing that the venue is improper,for the purpose of impairing the debtors ability to defend themselves,is guilty of a gross abuse of process and an unlawful business practice within the meaning of what is now business and professions code section.in support of this conclusion,the court observed that the venue rules for relatively small claims stemmed from recognition of the serious potential for harassment that arises if a plaintiff,in a small monetary action,commences his action in a distant forum d efendants in such cases will often be financially unable to expend the money to travel to a distant forum,or to hire an attorney to do so,even simply to move for a change of venue.without the protection of the venue statute,a plaintiff,aware of these practical limitations,could exploit the situation by filing all such actions in distant counties where a defendant could not afford either to defend or to move for change of venue,and could thereby unfairly obtain default judgments or favorable settlements in such actions.cal d at.the practice of distant forum abuse citation alleged in the yus case is even worse than the one condemned in barquis,because the practice there involved suits in the wrong venue within california,whereas the practice here involves suits in the wrong even more distant forum of another state.yu i,supra,th at,d.
we held that the yus claims and supporting evidence raise d triable issues of fact concerning banks knowledge and intent under barquis standards which can not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.yu i,supra,th at,d.we concluded that the virginia courts did not have personal jurisdiction over the yus,and reasoned,in view of a georgia decision against signet on the same issue and facts,that banks could be found to have been aware of this problem with their program before they used the program against the yus.yu i,supra,at,d,citing signet tillis.further evidence of culpable knowledge and intent included banks exemption of p eople in the limelight,celebrities,attorneys from the program.yu i at,d.a capital one officer had testified that suing attorneys was viewed as a bad business decision,and that celebrities were exempted because we did want to expose the company to any press because we had done everything we needed to do.id.at,d.this evidence,which has been likened to wearing a sign that says,sue me jaworski,subprime lending under siege in the summary of illustrative cases consumer fin,commenting on yu i,along with evidence that banks obtain ed default judgments as a regular business practice through their program chen,supra,akron.at describing the ideal scenario for a creditor practicing distant forum abuse yu i,supra,at,d ninety percent of banks suits resulted in default judgments,precluded entry of summary judgment for banks consistent with the decision in barquis.
we rejected banks contention that barquis was distinguishable because the yus default was obtained in compliance with virginia law.yu i,supra,th at,d noting that no virginia appellate court had ever purported to authorize jurisdiction over consumers for debt collection purposes.we also rejected banks various arguments as to why barquis could not be applied to their conduct.the summary judgment was based largely on the theory that virginia courts had personal jurisdiction over the yus,and we explained why that theory was incorrect.we pointed out the yus lack of minimum contacts with virginia,and rejected banks claim that we could not properly inquire into the virginia court jurisdiction.yu i,at,d.we also rejected banks related arguments that,notwithstanding barquis no abuse of process could be found because california can not regulate conduct that was lawful where it occurred principles of sovereignty and comity precluded imposition of liability based on a sister state judgment and inquiry into the validity of the virginia judgment could not be used to award any relief apart from refusal to enforce the judgment.yu i,at,d.we ultimately concluded that barquis holding can be applied to banks conduct,even though the distant forum abuse occurred in another state and involved the procuring of a foreign judgment.id.at,d.
subsequent proceedings 
when the case returned to the trial court after banks petitions to the california supreme court for review and to the united states supreme court for certiorari were denied,banks moved for judgment on the pleadings.banks argued that barquis was wrongly decided insofar as it would subject them to liability for abuse of process,and that their conduct was privileged,under the litigation privilege,subd.b and the first amendment.capital one argued separately that the yus had no claim against it for abuse of process because it was not involved in obtaining the virginia default judgment and garnishment summons against the yus.the yus opposed the motion on the ground,among others,that banks arguments were barred by our decision in yu i under the doctrine of the law of the case.the court granted the motion,with leave to amend to allege facts showing that the yus had no contacts with virginia beyond acceptance of the credit card solicitation and banks executed on the default judgment without a good faith belief that there existed any additional bases for personal jurisdiction beyond the acceptance of the credit card solicitation.
the yus filed a third amended complaint that added allegations pertaining to virginia jurisdiction as required by the court order.they also added an allegation acknowledging that yu had accepted a secured credit card from signet in addition to the unsecured credit card that became the subject of the collection action.they deleted allegations relating to the causes of action on which summary judgment for banks had been granted.they left unchanged the allegations of abuse of process and unfair business practice.
banks then filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint,reasserting the same arguments they had advanced in their motion for judgment on the pleadings.capital one demurred separately to the cause of action for abuse of process,making the same argument it had raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings.banks also filed a special motion to strike the third amended complaint under the law.the court sustained banks demurrer without leave to amend,and denied the motion as well as the capital one demurrer as moot.
the court determined that the yus could not state a cause of action for abuse of process or,alternatively,that banks conduct was immunized by the litigation privilege,and explained its reasoning in a statement of decision.since it was obvious that it is not wrongful to litigate an action absent personal jurisdiction,the court concluded that there was no abuse of process,and absent sufficient allegations of misuse of process,banks actions in pursuing and executing upon the underlying judgment appear ed to be exactly the type of acts protected by the litigation privilege.the court found that dismissal of the abuse of process claim disposed of the unfair business practice claim.the court acknowledged that yu i set forth the law of the case and that yu i had cited the barquis decision for the general proposition that bringing suit in a distant forum could constitute tortious conduct.however,the court thought that barquis was distinguishable and that barquis was in any event limited to its facts.
ii.yus appeal 
law of the case 
the yus contend that they have stated viable abuse of process and unlawful business practice causes of action under the barquis decision,and that the trial court conclusions to the contrary violated the law of the case established in yu 
under the law of the case doctrine,the decision of an appellate court,stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.nally grace community church cal d.the doctrine applies to decisions of intermediate appellate courts as well as courts of last resort.people shuey cal d.the doctrine promotes finality by preventing relitigation of issues previously decided.george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d,searle allstate life ins.cal d,see also people stanley cal th,d.the doctrine does not apply to points of law that might have been determined,but were not decided in the prior appeal.nally grace community church,supra,cal d at.however,the doctrine does extend to questions that were implicitly determined because they were essential to the prior decision.estate of horman cal d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,and authorities cited.the doctrine is one of procedure rather than jurisdiction,and can be disregarded in exceptional circumstances.searle allstate life ins,supra,at.the principal ground for making an exception to the doctrine of law of the case is an intervening or contemporaneous change in the law.clemente state of california cal d.the doctrine can also be disregarded to avoid an unjust decision.people shuey,supra,cal d at.for the unjust decision exception to apply,there must at least be demonstrated a manifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in substantial injustice.ibid.
in yu i,we held that barquis was not distinguishable from the yus case and that,under barquis standards,there were triable issues as to banks knowledge and intent that precluded summary judgment against the yus on their abuse of process claim.yu i,supra,th at,d.we thereby necessarily determined that the yus had stated a cause of action for abuse of process,and that barquis remained good law.under the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph,those explicit and implicit conclusions of law established the law of the case,and could be reexamined only as required to account for changes in the law after yu i,or to avoid an injustice.since neither of those exceptions to the law of the case doctrine is applicable,the trial court decision is untenable.
the trial court cited donohue state of california d,to justify its departure from yu i.the donohue decision did not involve the law of the case doctrine it simply noted that denial of a summary judgment motion did not necessarily preclude a later judgment on the pleadings.id.at.failure to state a cause of action is an issue that can generally be raised at any time witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,but that ability may be circumscribed by the law of the case.once an appellate court has determined a point of law in the action,arguments inconsistent with that determination can not be entertained unless an exception to the law of the case doctrine is applicable.
banks arguments in support of their demurrer are inconsistent with our opinion in yu i because they rest on the proposition that barquis was wrongly decided.banks maintain that barquis was mistaken insofar as it indicated that the filing of a complaint could be an abuse of process.alternatively,banks contend that their collection action was absolutely privileged under the litigation privilege or the first amendment if either of these privileges applies,then no form of distant forum abuse would be actionable,not even the intrastate variety addressed in barquis.since yu i necessarily concluded that barquis remains good law,these new arguments were contrary to the law of the case 
banks new arguments are not based on developments in the law after yu i.the abuse of process and litigation privilege arguments are grounded on oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d,silberg anderson cal d,pacific gas bear stearns cal d,and rubin green cal th,d,a series of precedents which according to banks has so eroded barquis that barquis must now be disregarded.banks first amendment claim is likewise predicated on various i precedents.accordingly,the new arguments do not fall within the exception to the law of the case doctrine.
the unjust decision exception to the doctrine is also inapplicable.to address banks new arguments at length would defeat the doctrine principal purpose searle allstate life ins,supra,cal d at,promotion of judicial economy,but we would observe that none of the new cases banks now cite are directly on point.the new cases do not involve distant forum abuse,and do not establish that it was a manifest misapplication of existing principles to recognize a cause of action for that abuse in yu people shuey,supra,cal d at.banks contend that the filing of a lawsuit can not be an abuse of process,but barquis is a recognized exception to that general rule.com.to baji ed.the barquis court explained why distant forum abuse amounts to a tortious abuse of process barquis merchants collection ass,supra,cal d at,noting the broad reach of this tort,which had evolved as a category to cover improper uses of the judicial machinery that do not constitute malicious prosecution id.at,fn.nor are we persuaded by any of banks authorities,which do not remotely consider the question,that creditors have a first amendment right or other privilege to commit distant forum abuse 
banks observe that the law of the case doctrine does not extend to issues that might have been,but were not,raised in a prior oblique acknowledgement that the new arguments could have been asserted in yu however,the the yus have a cause of action for abuse of process under the same as before banks have simply refined their arguments as to that issue.in yu i we were told that barquis could not be applied because the distant forum abuse in this case involved a foreign judgment and conduct in another state now we are told that barquis can not be applied because,for various reasons,it is a dead letter even in california.
banks maintain that they are free to advance the new arguments because we did not previously address them in yu i,but if that were true,then banks could raise their arguments in piecemeal fashion and endlessly relitigate barquis applicability.after asserting in a first appeal that barquis application would violate principles of sovereignty,banks could assert in a second appeal that barquis application would be precluded by the litigation privilege,and assert in a third appeal that barquis application would be inconsistent with the first amendment,and so on.fortunately,fundamental rules of appellate review are specifically designed to preclude the possibility of this type of multiple litigation of the same issue.people shuey,supra,cal d at,discussing the law of the case doctrine.litigants are not free to continually reinvent their position on legal issues that have been resolved against them by an appellate court.it would be absurd that a party who has chosen not to argue a point on a first appeal should stand better as regards the law of the case than one who had argued and lost.fogel chestnutt cir.
banks suggest that they may raise their new arguments because our unqualified partial reversal in yu opposed to a partial reversal with the case at large for further proceedings,including any challenge to the legal sufficiency of the yus remaining claims.however,the law of the case doctrine applies following a general remand.note,law of the case stan.
therefore,we reiterate what we decided in yu i the yus have a cause of action under barquis for abuse of process based on banks practice of distant forum abuse.since the dismissal of the unfair business practice claim as well as the abuse of process claim was based on the trial court conclusion to the contrary,the judgment as to both causes of action must be reversed.
capital one demurrer 
capital one contends that the judgment in its favor can be sustained on the alternative theory advanced in its separate demurrer that although it participated in the program as signet successor,it was not involved in any abuse of process against the yus.since this argument does not depend on barquis invalidity,and it was not explicitly or implicitly addressed in yu i,it is not barred by the law of the case.the argument is nevertheless unsupported by the record.according to the third amended complaint,yu wages were garnished from november to may,and capital one took over the program from signet in november.the complaint thus effectively alleges that capital one took and received all,or substantially all,of the recovery generated by the collection action.consequently,capital one was not entitled to judgment on the ground that it did not participate in the abuse of process against the yus.
iii.banks appeal 
preliminary issues 
banks contend that the trial court erred in denying,as moot,their motion to strike the third amended complaint under the law when it sustained their demurrer to that complaint without leave to amend.banks argue that the sustaining of the demurrer did not obviate the motion to strike because they would have been entitled to attorney fees and costs if the motion succeeded,subd.c see pfeiffer venice properties bernard th,d liu moore th,d.entirely apart from that argument,the motion to strike is not moot in view of our reversal of the ruling on the demurrer.thus,the rationale for denial of the motion is no longer viable.
banks request that we rule on the motion,rather than returning it to the trial court to determine in the first instance.the yus do not object to this request,and the parties positions on the motion have been fully briefed herein.having been asked to rule by the party who would tend to benefit from further delay,we will address the issues to expedite the ultimate resolution of the case.
the yus threshold argument against the motion is that it should be denied as untimely.the statute provides that the motion may be filed within days of the service of the complaint or,in the court discretion,at any later time upon terms it deems proper,subd.f,and states that the word complaint includes and petition,subd.h.banks motion was filed years after the case commenced,but within days of service of the third amended complaint.the yus contend that the term complaint in the statute does not include an amended complaint,and thus that the motion could not be filed,without leave of the court,more than days after service of the original complaint.
in support of this construction,the yus cite history of the legislation that amended section by,among other things,adding subdivision h indicating that complaint includes and petition.stats,ch,deering legis.service.the bill as originally introduced had provided for the addition of the following italicized language to subdivision f,stating that an motion may be filed within days of the service of the complaint or any amended or supplemental complaint or,in the court discretion,at any later time upon terms it deems proper.bill.reg.sess.the italicized language was not included in the bill as enacted.stats,ch,deering legis.service.the yus submit that deletion of this language demonstrates that the term complaint should not be construed to include amended complaint.see,rich state board of optometry d.they further contend,pointing to the late stage in the case at which banks motion was filed,that allowance of an motion as a matter of right following service of an amended complaint would be inconsistent with the statutory design to prevent slapps by ending them early.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.
the yus position is contrary to the reported cases that have considered the issue.globetrotter software elan computer group d,concluded,in view of the statutory admonition that the law be broadly construed,subd.a,that the period for filing the motion runs from service of the most recent amended complaint,rather than the original complaint.lam ngo th,d,reached the same conclusion,pointing out among other things that if the statute were construed as the yus urge,a plaintiff might attempt to circumvent the law by waiting until an amended complaint to assert its slapp allegations.see also dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d.
in addition to the persuasive considerations cited in these cases,we note that the record herein points up another problem with the yus interpretation.it appears that the original complaint in this case was never served a first amended complaint was filed shortly after the original one,and it was evidently the first to be served.in this situation,it is unclear under the yus construction when banks would have been entitled as a matter of right to file their motion.
as for the legislative history cited by the yus,since there are other statutes in the code of civil procedure where the term complaint implicitly encompasses amended complaint,code civ,the legislature may have decided that it would have been superfluous to refer to amended complaints in section,subdivisions f or h.that reference might also have been regarded as unnecessary in view of the bill other provision directing that the statute be broadly construed.stats,ch,deering legis.service.thus,we are unable to read as much into the bill amendment as the yus advocate,and will adhere to the precedents on the timeliness issue.
admittedly,this is not a case where an motion was promptly made to counter slapp allegations first added to an amended pleading.banks could have filed their motion at the outset of the case and,like the arguments in their demurrer to the third amended complaint,their theory seems to have been an afterthought.banks opportunity to belatedly raise that theory arose as a matter of right only because the yus were required to file a third amended complaint,which deleted many more allegations than it added,and added nothing that implicated the law.we nevertheless conclude,for the reasons set forth above,that banks motion was timely because it was filed within days of service of the third amended complaint.
merits of the motion 
section,subdivision b provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.section,subdivision e sets forth four categories of act s in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech,including any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
ruling on an motion is a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.
arising from protected activity 
the yus contend that their case does not arise from protected activity because banks can not show that the action was brought with the intent to chill their exercise of constitutional speech or petition rights.however,our supreme court has recently ruled in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d,that there is no such proof requirement.to satisfy the arising from test,it need only be demonstrate d that the defendant conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls within one of the four categories described in section,subdivision e.id.at,d.from that fact the court may effectively presume the purpose of the action was to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.id.at,d.
t he statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citations.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.
it is ironic that a lawsuit challenging distant forum practice calculated to prevent the yus public participation in the collection action against itself meet the threshold definition of a slapp suit,but that is the result under the statute.since the yus case is based entirely on the collection action banks filed against them,we conclude that it satisfies the arising from standard.it is well established that filing a lawsuit is an exercise of a party constitutional right of petition.chavez mendoza th,d.a claim for relief filed in court indisputably is a statement or writing made before a judicial proceeding under,subd.e.navellier sletten cal th,d.
this conclusion does not imply that the distant forum abuse alleged by the yus was a valid exercise of banks constitutional rights.the lawfulness of the defendant petitioning activity is generally not at issue in the arising from prong of the inquiry that question is ordinarily addressed in the second,minimal merit prong of the inquiry relative to the plaintiff probability of success on the merits.the legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.that the legislature expressed a concern in the statute preamble with lawsuits that chill valid exercise of first amendment rights does not mean that a court may read a separate requirement into the operative sections of the statute.citations.rather,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.id.at,d.
probability of success 
a standards to be applied 
in order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b b,a plaintiff responding to an motion must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant,subd.b b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.wilson parker,covert chidester,supra,cal th,d.thus,a plaintiff burden as to the second prong of the test is akin to that of a party opposing a motion for summary judgment.kyle carmon th,d.the causes of action need only be shown to have minimal merit.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
b conclusion 
in yu i,we held that banks were not entitled to summary judgment on the yus abuse of process and unfair business practice claims.here,we likewise conclude that these claims have sufficient potential merit to withstand banks motion.
c points previously determined 
banks principal arguments in their motion are the same as those in their demurrer that the yus have no cause of action for abuse of process under precedents,or that,notwithstanding barquis,distant forum abuse is protected by the first amendment or the litigation privilege.our previous discussion of the law of the case has disposed of these arguments.our prior discussion has also disposed of capital one contention,advanced in the motion as well as capital one separate demurrer,that it can not be held liable because it was not involved in any abuse of process against the yus.
d jurisdiction 
banks argue that the yus have no viable claims because they can not demonstrate that virginia lacked personal jurisdiction over them.in yu i,we concluded that the yus case hinged on the fact that they were not subject to personal jurisdiction in the virginia court where their default judgment was taken.yu i,supra,th at,d.we explained why such jurisdiction was lacking on the record presented in yu i,where it appeared that the yus had no contact with virginia other than one signet credit card.id.at,d.it has since been confirmed that the yus had a second signet credit card,a secured card that required them to maintain a bank account in virginia.banks contend that this second credit card and related bank account distinguish the situation considered in yu i,and provide the
