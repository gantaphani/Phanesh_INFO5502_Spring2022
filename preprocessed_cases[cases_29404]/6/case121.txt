this case involves a protracted dispute over a portfolio of loans sold by,key financial services,key to,home owners savings bank home owners key appeals from a series of adverse rulings by the district court,culminating in a court order that key pay approximately million in restitution damages and interest.finding key arguments without merit,we affirm the rulings below.
in,key sold its interest in first and second residential mortgage loans with a total principal value of approximately million to home owners,a savings and loan institution whose business,in part,consisted of acquiring residential mortgage notes on the secondary market,at a price equal to the full outstanding balance on the loans plus of their principal value.the parties executed a mortgage loan purchase agreement agreement,specifying the terms of the transaction.section of the agreement delineated representations and warranties regarding the notes being transferred,and specified that the material breach of any representation or warranty contained in or other related sections would require key to repurchase,upon demand,the mortgages 
when the new england real estate market began to collapse in the early,certain loans acquired by home owners began to underperform.upon investigation,home owners determined that the original property appraisals that accompanied some of the purchased mortgages were artificially inflated.in addition,the title insurance policies accompanying some of the loans included exceptions that home owners believed were inconsistent with representations made by key in o of the contract.the key representation was that t here is in full force and effect an alta american land title association lender title insurance policy or other generally acceptable form of policy of insurance with standard condominium endorsements,if applicable,acceptable to fnma federal national mortgage association or fannie mae or fhlmc federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac.despite this guarantee,home owners identified over loans with policies.all of the mortgages in question were originated by funding of america and had title policies issued by stewart title company.most of the funding loans were second mortgages secured by residential properties and belonged to the c program,meaning that the consumer had a marginal credit history.
after key rebuffed home owners demand that the disputed mortgages be repurchased,home owners in filed suit in federal court count i of its complaint alleged breach of contract,asserting that key had materially breached its representation in o because the stewart title policies on the funding loans were not on alta forms and contained exceptions that did not comply with fannie mae and freddie mac guidelines.home owners sought relief under of the agreement,which required key to repurchase all loans.key filed a for summary judgment,alleging,inter alia,that the title policies issued for the subject properties were acceptable to fannie mae or freddie mac,and therefore complied with o.
applying new york law the district court ruled in favor of home owners in,finding that key had materially breached the representations and warranties contained in o in four distinct ways because the title policies did not insure against real estate taxes that were presently due or past due included a survey exception contained an exception regarding the rights of tenants in possession broader than fannie mae or freddie mac permits and were not on alta forms and contained exceptions that had the effect of neutralizing the standard alta protections thereby violat ing the relevant fhlmc sic or fnma guidelines,which required that title policies be fully protective of the lender.home owners savings bank key fin,slip op.at,hereinafter slip opinion.having found key liable the court gave the parties one week to submit a proposed final judgment to bring the matter to a close.id.at.
the question regarding the proper amount of final judgment turned out to be much more complicated than the district court order would have suggested,because a number of the funding loans had gone,meaning that the mortgages had been removed from home owners portfolio either because of foreclosure or because the interest in the loan had been sold.the parties disagreed as to how the loans should be taken into account when crafting a final judgment.unable to reach a mutually acceptable rationale,home owners filed a proposed judgment in may,which key opposed.home owners then filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of damages.
for some reason not ascertainable from the record,this motion sat idle for three years.in september,the case received a jump start when key filed a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution.at a status conference held shortly thereafter,the court denied key motion to dismiss and denied without prejudice home owners motion for entry of judgment and motion for summary judgment on the issue of damages to allow for further development of the record.in march,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment offering alternative theories regarding the appropriate relief to which home owners was entitled key insisted that under the agreement,its only obligation was to repurchase the defective loans still in home owners possession,whereas home owners insisted that the relief should also take into account the loans that had gone.a month later,the district court again ruled in favor of home owners.specifically,the court concluded that key failure to repurchase the loans upon demand,as required by,was an independent breach of the agreement.accordingly,it found that home owners was entitled to pursue general contract remedies for breach of contract.the calculation of damages,however,was left for further proceedings after both parties conducted discovery.
over the next three years,the district court was faced with numerous discovery disputes and motions in limine regarding the issue of damages.finally,in,the district court issued an order awarding home owners damages and prejudgment interest dating back to april.see supra note.finding that there were no outstanding issues of material fact regarding the computation of principal and interest,the district court on september,entered final judgment for home owners in the amount key timely appealed.
on appeal,key has not contested that the title insurance policies for the mortgage notes originating from funding are inconsistent with its representations in o of the agreement.instead,key asserts that whatever breach it committed was not material,and therefore it had no obligation to repurchase the loans at issue.specifically,key argues that the district court applied the wrong standard of materiality when it decided as a matter of law to grant partial summary judgment in favor of home owners with regard to the breach of contract claim.furthermore,key insists that the issue of materiality is highly fact dependent,thereby precluding resolution of the issue by motion for summary judgment.
the district court found that key materially breached the representations and warranties in o of the agreement in the various ways detailed supra.in determining whether key breaches were material,the district court cited the standard articulated in united states ex rel.roman schlesinger,which asks whether a misrepresentation concerns a fact likely to influence the process.slip opinion at.key,on the other hand,maintains that under new york law,a breach of contract is material only if it goes to the essence of the contract.that is,a breach is material if it defeats the object of the parties in making the contract and deprive s the injured party of the benefit that it justifiably expected.times mirror magazines,field stream licenses,d,internal quotations omitted.
we reiterate that key has not contested the determination that the title policies for the funding loans were deficient in the ways explained by the district court rather,key argues that these deficiencies should not be considered material in light of the intentions of the regarding loan the time they entered into the agreement.key proposed analysis of the issues in this case would be proper if home own
