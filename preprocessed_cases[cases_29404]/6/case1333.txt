this mortgage foreclosure action arises from a failed redevelopment of the hotel syracuse complex in downtown syracuse,new york.the complex consists of several properties interconnected by pedestrian bridges the hotel,built in and closed in,and its separate garage the hotel property a story tower constructed in the early as an addition to the hotel the tower building and a building formerly housing a major department store,vacant since the early the addis building.the lender for the redevelopment and numerous mechanic lienors dispute the priority of their respective claims to the foreclosure sale proceeds from the auction of the tower building,a matter governed by lien law.
in september,defendant gml tower llc gml tower purchased the tower building for million,and gml syracuse llc gml syracuse and gml addis llc gml addis bought the other two parcels making up the hotel complex for an additional million.the predecessor of a bank loaned the gml entities million for acquisition of these properties,as evidenced by a promissory note and secured by the mortgage in that amount,both dated september.the mortgage,recorded in the onondaga county clerk office on september,encumbered all three parcels.
on march,perfect provident fund,the predecessor of plaintiff altshuler shaham provident funds,collectively,altshuler entered into a loan agreement the loan agreement or the agreement with gml tower and its parent company,ameris holdings,ameris,whereby altshuler agreed to loan them million,bifurcated into tranches of and million.the entire principal amount of the loan was due and payable,with accrued interest at per annum,on march.to secure payment of the amounts owing to altshuler under the agreement,gml tower and ameris undertook to grant altshuler a first ranking senior l ien,mortgage,pledge,charge and security interest which the agreement referred to collectively as the security interest in,among other collateral,the property and improvements made thereon.
the loan proceeds were to be deposited in a trust account as of the date of the agreement execution and delivery,march,and released by the trustee on the closing date,april,for immediate repayment to the bank of the outstanding principal amount of the original million dollar acquisition financing the million tranche and for deposit into another dedicated bank account the restricted account to be held and disbursed,used and applied solely to finance improvements of the tower building,based upon construction progress as determined by an inspector appointed by altshuler the million tranche.the loan agreement seems to have contemplated redevelopment of the tower building into residential condominiums and commercial space 
when the transaction did not close on april,altshuler entered into a memorandum of understanding the mou with gml tower and ameris i n connection with the agreement.the mou,dated may,set closing dates for the million and million tranches of may and may,respectively.the first of the two tranches timely closed,resulting in transfer of million from the trust account to the bank on may.by an assignment of note and mortgage,executed april,the bank assigned the september,promissory note and mortgage to altshuler.altshuler recorded this instrument in the onondaga county clerk office on may,along with a mortgage extension and modification agreement,dated april,which established million as the maximum principal indebtedness secured by the mortgage covering the hotel complex the mortgage.
the parties failed to close on the million tranche in accordance with the mou.instead,on six separate occasions from may,though february,the trustee released monies totaling million from the trust account to gml tower,pursuant to the parties joint instructions and advance letters.these disbursements were personally guaranteed by ameris principal.
then on march,gml tower and ameris entered into amendment the amendment or the amendment of the loan agreement with altshuler.the amendment changed the improvements to be built and the terms and conditions of the release to gml tower and ameris of the remaining funds held in the trust account defined as the remaining loan proceeds in the principal sum of million plus accrued interest and less certain outstanding fees and expenses and provided for the delivery of additional collateral to altshuler as security for the million loan to these ends,the amendment called for construction of residential and commercial rental units in the tower building rather than condominiums added the addis building as collateral and eliminated the restricted account,providing instead for the trustee to release the remaining funds to gml tower on march,the new closing date,as an unrestricted lump sum.with the disbursement of these funds,the existing promissory note was canceled and replaced and restated by a replacement note the note,the guaranties covering the million were rescinded,and ameris principal gave a new personal guaranty in the principal sum of.additionally,the lien of the mortgage was apparently released with respect to the hotel property owned by gml syracuse.
concomitantly,gml tower and gml addis entered into a mortgage increase,modification,and spreader agreement the mortgage with altshuler on march.the mortgage extended the reach of the mortgage to cover the addis building in addition to the tower building,and increased the principal amount secured from to million.the mortgage was recorded in the onondaga county clerk office on march.to provide altshuler with additional collateral,gml tower and gml addis also executed an assignment of leases and rents with respect to the tower and addis buildings,dated march,and recorded in the onondaga county clerk office on march,the assignment.
on december,altshuler commenced this foreclosure action against ameris,gml tower and gml addis and other defendants,including the hayner hoyt corporation hayner,syracuse merit electric merit and the pike company,pike collectively,the mechanic lienors.hayner,merit and pike began work on the tower building on july,january,and september,respectively and filed notices of mechanic liens on october,december,and september,respectively.altshuler alleged that gml tower and ameris were in default under the terms of the loan agreement,as modified by the amendment,and the note,and that gml tower and gml addis were in default under the terms of the mortgage and the assignment because mechanic liens totaling more than million had been filed against the tower building,and because they failed to pay real property taxes on the tower and addis buildings.
altshuler sought foreclosure of both buildings and recoupment of the full amount of its million loan,together with interest and late charges,and first priority to the proceeds of the foreclosure sales of the two properties.the mechanic lienors,for their part,moved or for summary judgment,seeking an order that their liens were superior to the mortgage that altshuler sought to foreclose.the mechanic lienors also contested the priority of liens as amongst themselves.
in a decision dated may,supreme court observed that the parties acknowledged that lien law subordinates a building loan mortgage made pursuant to an unfiled building loan contract to subsequently filed mechanic liens,but disputed whether the loan agreement was a building loan contract see misc d,sup ct onondaga county.the judge ultimately concluded that it was the loan agreement was made between a lender and an owner of real property gml tower and ameris made an express promise to construct improvements to the property altshuler agreed to make periodic advances of million to fund these improvements altshuler was to be informed of construction progress and the million loan was to be secured by a mortgage on real property,and even label ed itself a construction loan transaction id.at.
the judge additionally rejected altshuler alternative argument that it was at least entitled to priority with respect to the million used to refinance the tower building acquisition.she concluded that the entire million mortgage was subordinate to the subsequently filed mechanic liens,relying on atlantic bank of new york forrest house holding,dept,and declining to follow yankee bank for finance savings,fsb task associates,nd.
accordingly,supreme court granted hayner motion and merit and pike cross motions to the extent they argued their mechanic liens were superior to altshuler mortgage.the judge further agreed with merit that its lien was superior to hayner under lien law because it was a subcontractor to hayner as general contractor id.at and turned down pike argument that its lien was superior to all others pursuant to section of the lien law because it performed labor id.altshuler appealed supreme court ensuing order,entered may.
on april,the appellate division affirmed for reasons stated in the decision at supreme court,dept.the court did not address altshuler argument that the loan agreement was merely a preliminary agreement that expired before the mortgage at issue was filed because this contention was raised for the first time on appeal and could have been obviated or cured by factual showings or legal countersteps in supreme court id.internal quotation marks omitted on july,the same panel denied altshuler motion for leave to appeal to us dept.
on october,supreme court issued an final order for judgment of foreclosure and sale,which awarded altshuler a judgment of million dismissed altshuler causes of action seeking a declaration that its mortgage enjoyed first priority set out the priority and amounts of the mechanic liens ordered sale of the tower and addis buildings and directed the referee to file his report afterwards.the order also stayed the foreclosure sale of the tower building pending disposition of altshuler appeal.since altshuler contested only the priority of rights to the proceeds from the sale,however,we declined to apply the exception to the finality rule for irreparable injury,and dismissed altshuler appeal on february,on may,we denied reargument.in the meantime,supreme court,by order signed march,vacated the stay of enforcement.
the tower building was sold at public auction on june,for,and supreme court confirmed the referee report on july.hayner was the purchaser altshuler then again sought leave to appeal,which we granted on october.
section of the lien law requires that a building loan contract,with or without the sale of land and before or simultaneously with the recording of a building loan mortgage made pursuant to it,must be filed in the clerk office of the county where land subject to the contract is located,along with a borrower affidavit stating the consideration paid or to be paid for the loan,any expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with the loan,and the net sum available for the construction project.section also mandates the filing of any subsequent modifications of a building loan contract within days after their execution.failure to comply with these filing requirements changes the ordinary priority of liens,with a properly filed mechanic lien taking priority over the interests of the parties to the contract thus,a construction lender must file the building loan contract in order to achieve lien priority,or,put the opposite way,the statute imposes a subordination penalty on a lender who does not do this.we have said that the legislature enacted section to permit contractors on construction projects to learn exactly what sum the loan in fact made available to the owner of the real estate for the project nanuet bank eckerson terrace,holding that section subjects a lender interest to the subordination penalty when the lender knowingly files a materially false borrower statement.
section of the lien law,defines a building loan contract as 
a contract whereby a lender,in consideration of the express promise of an owner to make an improvement upon real property,agrees to make advances to or for the account of such owner to be secured by a mortgage on such real property,whether such advances represent moneys to be loaned or represent moneys to be paid lien law.
and a building loan mortgage is a mortgage made pursuant to a building loan contract,includ ing an agreement wherein and whereby a building loan mortgage is consolidated with existing mortgages so as to constitute one lien upon the mortgaged property lien law.
the loan agreement is a building loan contract as defined under section of the lien law the agreement called for transfer of of the million deposited by altshuler into the trust account to a dedicated bank account of gml the restricted account,to be released if,when and as required to finance and pay for the construction of the improvements to the tower building,subject to the terms and conditions of the construction plans,and these loan proceeds were to be secured by a mortgage.because the loan agreement was a building loan contract,lien law obligated altshuler to file the agreement in the onondaga county clerk office prior to the recording of any mortgage made pursuant thereto,or suffer loss of lien priority.altshuler never filed the loan agreement it recorded the mortgage on may.
altshuler counters that the mortgage was not recorded pursuant to the loan agreement as required by lien law however,the recorded mortgage states that it is to secure payment performance of all indebtedness and obligations of gml tower ameris described in the loan agreement.additionally,the loan agreement directed that altshuler security interest in the property be perfected and duly recorded in onondaga county,and the agreement defined a security interest to include a mortgage.in short,the mortgage was made pursuant to the unfiled agreement.
next,the amendment is explicitly labeled an amendment to the loan agreement,designed to amend the terms and conditions for release of the r emaining f unds to gml tower and ameris,and to revise the improvement plans in the agreement to fit the new plan to construct rental apartments rather than condominiums.in fact,the amendment is not a document it is essentially a compilation of edits of various provisions in the loan agreement,and must be read together with that earlier document in order to be intelligible.altshuler never filed the amendment.this was another violation of section,which specifies that modifications of building loan contracts must be filed.
altshuler contends,though,that assuming the loan agreement is a building loan contract and we have now held that it is,the amendment converted the agreement into a standard loan contract,and the mortgage was recorded pursuant to the amendment,not the agreement.but even if altshuler is correct that the loan agreement,as modified by the amendment,was no longer a building loan contract as defined by lien law a question we need not and do not decide it does not follow that altshuler was relieved of the obligation to file the amendment.lien law does not state that modifications to a building loan contract must be filed only so long as the contract,as modified,remains a building loan contract within the meaning of the lien law.this makes sense,given that the reason for public filing is to allow any interested contractors,subcontractors and material suppliers to discover the level of financing available for construction so that they might guide their actions accordingly see nanuet,at.further,if the loan agreement had been filed,as it should have been,altshuler failure to file the amendment clearly would have violated the statute altshuler should not benefit from an earlier violation of the law.
finally,we consider whether altshuler is entitled to priority with respect to the million of the loan proceeds used to refinance the existing mortgage,which covered the tower building,the addis building,and the hotel property.before this litigation,the atlantic bank and yankee bank courts considered whether a subordination penalty applies to funds loaned in a building loan contract for financing the purchase of the property on which the improvements are to be made.they reached opposite conclusions.
in atlantic bank,a foreclosure action,the plaintiff bank sought summary judgment against the mechanic lienor defendants on the ground that its recorded mortgage had priority,at least to the extent of the million loan given by it to the borrower for land acquisition.applying a liberal interpretation,the appellate division took inclusion of the phrase either with or without the sale of land in section to impl y that if a lender fails to comply with the requirements of the lien law,its entire mortgage,including that part securing loan proceeds advanced for the purchase of the property,would become subordinate to any subsequently filed mechanic liens at emphasis added.
yankee bank was a foreclosure action that was removed to federal court when the federal home loan bank board found the plaintiff bank to be insolvent and appointed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver.the fdic was consequently effectively substituted for the bank as plaintiff.the subject of the litigation was another building in syracuse,new york,and the issue before the district court judge was the priority of rights to the foreclosure sale proceeds as between the fdic and the mechanic lienor defendants.
the judge first decided that new york law supplied the rule of decision.in this particular case,the building loan contract between the bank and the developers allowed the bank to advance up to for the acquisition of the building,and provided that no additional funds would be released until the developers obtained a surety payment bond.the bank,however,advanced funds beyond without the required bond being in place.the mechanic lienor defendants argued that this was an unfiled modification of the contract in violation of lien law.the judge agreed,and so held that the bank mortgage would be subordinated to the defendants interests.he then turned his attention to the question of the degree of subordination.
the building loan contract apparently earmarked this first advance of for acquisition of the building,and the parties do not seem to have disputed that money loaned for this purpose was not subject to the subordination penalty.in this regard,the judge observed that 
b y definition a building loan contract and building loan mortgage only operate with respect to money lent for improvements on real property.therefore,the proceeds from the loan which were lent for the purchase of the property are not subject to the subordination penalty of lien law.at,internal citation omitted.
in fact,though,the amount of the loan proceeds expended to buy the building was only approximately.as a result,the dispute between the fdic and the mechanic lienor defendants centered on whether the fdic had a first priority lien in the foreclosure sale proceeds for,or the lesser amount actually expended toward purchase of the building.the judge ruled that the fdic would enjoy first priority in an amount equivalent to what was actually spent to be determined by the magistrate rather than the full in the first advance,and the mechanic lienor defendants would be paid any foreclosure sale proceeds beyond this amount.
this result is consistent with the language of lien law and,and,and does not contravene the statute purpose,to give contractors and material suppliers notice of how much money a building loan makes available for construction.section does not state that the entire interest of each party to an unfiled building loan contract is subject to a notice of lien,and we do not infer such a limitation from the phrase either with or without the sale of land,as did the atlantic bank court.as the yankee bank court pointed out,the subordination penalty logically applies only to funds loaned to pay for improvements.here,the loan agreement allocated million of the loan proceeds to pay off the existing mortgage.this tranche closed before any monies were advanced for construction,and the mortgage in this amount was recorded before any contractor began work on the project.the mortgage,which altshuler foreclosed in this litigation,simply extended the reach of and increased the principal amount secured by the mortgage.we therefore conclude that million of the loan proceeds,secured by the and mortgages,was not subject to the subordination penalty.
accordingly,the judgment appealed from and the order of the appellate division brought up for review should be modified,without costs,in accordance with this opinion and,as so modified,affirmed.
i join that part of the majority opinion determining that the loan agreement was a building loan contract within the meaning of lien law.however,because i read the plain language of the subordination penalty in this statute to apply to the lender interest in the real property the total mortgage and not just the portion attributable to construction funds i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that million of the loan proceeds were not subject to the subordination penalty.
as the majority explains,lien law establishes a recording requirement relating to a building loan contract as follows 
a building loan contract either with or without the sale of land,and any modification thereof,must be in writing and duly acknowledged,and must contain a true statement under oath,verified by the borrower,showing the consideration paid,or to be paid,for the loan described therein,and showing all other expenses,if any incurred,or to be incurred in connection therewith,and the net sum available to the borrower for the improvement,and,on or before the date of recording the building loan mortgage made pursuant thereto,to be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which any part of the land is situated,except that any subsequent modification of any such building loan contract so filed must be filed within ten days after the execution of any such modification emphasis added.
as a consequence of the failure to comply with the recording requirement,lien law imposes what has come to be known as the subordination penalty,providing that if the building loan contract is not so filed the interest of each party to such contract in the real property affected thereby is subject to the lien and claim of a person who shall thereafter file a notice of lien under this chapter.in other words,even though a lender mortgage might have been recorded first,if it was issued pursuant to a building loan contract that was not properly recorded,the lender mortgage loses its priority and becomes subordinate to mechanics liens.
the recording requirement is intended to benefit contractors,laborers and material suppliers who work on construction projects.its purpose is to readily enable a contractor to learn exactly what sum the loan in fact made available to the owner of the real estate for the project nanuet bank eckerson terrace,inclusion of false information in building loan contract that was recorded triggered subordination penalty see also howard sav.bank lefcon partnership,dept,lv dismissed,and to preclude lenders and owners from entering into secret agreements in that regard.
plaintiff lender argues and the majority accepts that lien law does not require that the subordination penalty apply to the entire mortgage but covers only the portion relating to the advancement of construction funds.it further asserts that,since the purpose of the statute is to protect contractors,laborers and material suppliers,it makes no sense to preclude a lender from claiming priority with respect to the portion of the loan that had nothing to do with construction but related to the initial acquisition of the property.in my view,this argument should be rejected because the plain language of the statute directs that the full mortgage interest not just the part securing the funds used for construction purposes is subject to the subordination penalty,as two new york courts had held before the appellate division reached the same conclusion in this case see atlantic bank of forrest house holding,dept hnc realty golan hgts,misc d,sup ct.
critically,lien law begins by indicating that the statute applies to a building loan contract either with or without the sale of land,thereby contemplating building loan agreements in which money is loaned both to purchase the property and construct improvements.thus,just because some of the funds disbursed relate to the acquisition of the real property to be improved or,in this case,the refinance of a mortgage previously u
