this is an appeal from a final judgment of the court of chancery dismissing a derivative complaint against fifteen present and former directors of amsouth bancorporation amsouth,a delaware corporation.the,william and sandra stone,are amsouth shareholders and filed their derivative complaint without making a demand on amsouth board of directors the board.the court of chancery held that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead that such a demand would have been futile.the court,therefore,dismissed the derivative complaint under court of chancery rule.
the court of chancery characterized the allegations in the derivative complaint as a classic caremark claim,a claim that derives its name from in re caremark int l deriv.litig in caremark,the court of chancery recognized that g enerally where a claim of directorial liability for corporate loss is predicated upon ignorance of liability creating activities within the corporation only a sustained or systematic failure of the board to exercise as an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system establish the lack of good faith that is a necessary condition to liability.
in this appeal,the plaintiffs acknowledge that the directors neither knew n or should have known that violations of law were occurring,that there were no red flags before the directors.nevertheless,the plaintiffs argue that the court of chancery erred by dismissing the derivative complaint which alleged that the defendants had utterly failed to implement any sort of statutorily required monitoring,reporting or information controls that would have enabled them to learn of problems requiring their attention.the defendants argue that the plaintiffs assertions are contradicted by the derivative complaint itself and by the documents incorporated therein by reference.
consistent with our opinion in in re walt disney.deriv litig,we hold that caremark articulates the necessary conditions for assessing director oversight liability we also conclude that the caremark standard was properly applied to evaluate the derivative complaint in this case.accordingly,the judgment of the court of chancery must be affirmed.
this derivative action is brought on amsouth behalf by william and sandra stone,who allege that they owned amsouth common stock at all relevant times.the nominal defendant,amsouth,is a delaware corporation with its principal executive offices in birmingham,alabama.during the relevant period,amsouth subsidiary,amsouth bank,operated about commercial banking branches in six states throughout the southeastern united states and employed more than people.
in,amsouth and amsouth bank paid million in fines and million in civil penalties to resolve government and regulatory investigations pertaining principally to the failure by bank employees to file suspicious activity reports sars,as required by the federal bank secrecy act bsa and various aml regulations those investigations were conducted by the united states attorney office for the southern district of mississippi usao,the federal reserve,fincen and the alabama banking department.no fines or penalties were imposed on amsouth directors,and no other regulatory action was taken against them.
the government investigations arose originally from an unlawful ponzi scheme operated by louis hamric,ii and victor nance.in august,hamric,then a licensed attorney,and nance,then a registered investment advisor with mutual of new york,contacted an amsouth branch bank in tennessee to arrange for custodial trust accounts to be created for investors in a business venture.that venture hamric and nance represented involved the construction of medical clinics overseas.in reality,nance had convinced more than forty of his clients to invest in promissory notes bearing high rates of return,by misrepresenting the nature and the risk of that investment.relying on similar misrepresentations by hamric and nance,the amsouth branch employees in tennessee agreed to provide custodial accounts for the investors and to distribute monthly interest payments to each account upon receipt of a check from hamric and instructions from nance.
the scheme was discovered in march,when the investors did not receive their monthly interest payments.thereafter,hamric and nance became the subject of several civil actions brought by the defrauded investors in tennessee and mississippi and in which amsouth also was named as a defendant,and also the subject of a federal grand jury investigation in the southern district of mississippi.hamric and nance were indicted on federal charges,and both pled guilty.
the authorities examined amsouth compliance with its reporting and other obligations under the bsa.on november,the usao advised amsouth that it was the subject of a criminal investigation.on october,amsouth and the usao entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa in which amsouth agreed first,to the filing by usao of a information in the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi,charging amsouth with failing to file sars and second,to pay a million fine.in conjunction with the dpa,the usao issued a statement of facts,which noted that although in at least one amsouth employee suspected that hamric was involved in a possibly illegal scheme,amsouth failed to file sars in a timely manner.in neither the statement of facts nor anywhere else did the usao ascribe any blame to the board or to any individual director.
on october,the federal reserve and the alabama banking department concurrently issued a cease and desist order against amsouth,requiring it,for the first time,to improve its program.that cease and desist order required amsouth to among other things engage an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of the bank aml compliance program and make recommendations,as appropriate,for new policies and procedures to be implemented by the bank.kpmg forensic services kpmg performed the role of independent consultant and issued its report on december,the kpmg report.
also on october,fincen and the federal reserve jointly assessed a million civil penalty against amsouth for operating an inadequate program and for failing to file sars.in connection with that assessment,fincen issued a written assessment of civil money penalty the assessment,which included detailed determinations regarding amsouth bsa compliance procedures.fincen found that amsouth violated the suspicious activity reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act,and that s ince april,amsouth has been in violation of the program requirements of the bank secrecy act.among fincen specific determinations were its conclusions that amsouth aml compliance program lacked adequate board and management oversight,and that reporting to management for the purposes of monitoring and oversight of compliance activities was materially deficient.amsouth neither admitted nor denied fincen determinations in this or any other forum.
demand futility and director independence 
it is a fundamental principle of the delaware general corporation law that t he business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors thus,by its very nature a derivative action impinges on the managerial freedom of directors.therefore,the right of a stockholder to prosecute a derivative suit is limited to situations where either the stockholder has demanded the directors pursue a corporate claim and the directors have wrongfully refused to do so,or where demand is excused because the directors are incapable of making an impartial decision regarding whether to institute such litigation court of chancery rule,accordingly,requires that the complaint in a derivative action allege with particularity the efforts,if any,made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors or the reasons for the plaintiff failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.
in this appeal,the plaintiffs concede that t he standards for determining demand futility in the absence of a business decision are set forth in rales blasband to excuse demand under rales,a court must determine whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a derivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that,as of the time the complaint is filed,the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.the plaintiffs attempt to satisfy the rales test in this proceeding by asserting that the incumbent defendant directors face a substantial likelihood of liability that renders them personally interested in the outcome of the decision on whether to pursue the claims asserted in the complaint,and are therefore not disinterested or independent 
critical to this demand excused argument is the fact that the directors potential personal liability depends upon whether or not their conduct can be exculpated by the section b provision contained in the amsouth certificate of incorporation such a provision can exculpate directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care,but not for conduct that is not in good faith or a breach of the duty of loyalty the standard for assessing a director potential personal liability for failing to act in good faith in discharging his or her oversight responsibilities has evolved beginning with our decision in graham manufacturing company through the court of chancery caremark decision to our most recent decision in disney a brief discussion of that evolution will help illuminate the standard that we adopt in this case.
graham and caremark 
graham was a derivative action brought against the directors of for failure to prevent violations of federal laws by employees.there was no claim that the directors knew of the employees conduct that resulted in the corporation liability.rather,the plaintiffs claimed that the directors should have known of the illegal conduct by the corporation employees.in graham,this court held that absent cause for suspicion there is no duty upon the directors to install and operate a corporate system of espionage to ferret out wrongdoing which they have no reason to suspect exists.
in caremark,the court of chancery reassessed the applicability of our holding in graham when called upon to approve a settlement of a derivative lawsuit brought against the directors of caremark international.the plaintiffs claimed that the caremark directors should have known that certain officers and employees of caremark were involved in violations of the federal payments law.that law prohibits health care providers from paying any form of remuneration to induce the referral of medicare or medicaid patients.the plaintiffs claimed that the caremark directors breached their fiduciary duty for having allowed a situation to develop and continue which exposed the corporation to enormous legal liability and that in so doing they violated a duty to be active monitors of corporate performance.
in evaluating whether to approve the proposed settlement agreement in caremark,the court of chancery narrowly construed our holding in graham as standing for the proposition that,absent grounds to suspect deception,neither corporate boards nor senior officers can be charged with wrongdoing simply for assuming the integrity of employees and the honesty of their dealings on the company behalf.the caremark court opined it would be a mistake to interpret this court decision in graham to mean that 
corporate boards may satisfy their obligation to be reasonably informed concerning the corporation,without assuring themselves that information and reporting systems exist in the organization that are reasonably designed to provide to senior management and to the board itself timely,accurate information sufficient to allow management and the board,each within its scope,to reach informed judgments concerning both the corporation compliance with law and its business performance 
to the contrary,the caremark court stated,it is important that the board exercise a good faith judgment that the corporation information and reporting system is in concept and design adequate to assure the board that appropriate information will come to its attention in a timely manner as a matter of ordinary operations,so that it may satisfy its responsibility.the caremark court recognized,however,that the duty to act in good faith to be informed can not be thought to require directors to possess detailed information about all aspects of the operation of the enterprise.the court of chancery then formulated the following standard for assessing the liability of directors where the directors are unaware of employee misconduct that results in the corporation being held liable 
generally where a claim of directorial liability for corporate loss is predicated upon ignorance of liability creating activities within the corporation,as in graham or in this case,only a sustained or systematic failure of the board to exercise as an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system establish the lack of good faith that is a necessary condition to liability 
caremark standard approved 
as evidenced by the language quoted above,the caremark standard for oversight liability draws heavily upon the concept of director failure to act in good faith.that is consistent with the definition s of bad faith recently approved by this court in its recent decision,where we held that a failure to act in good faith requires conduct that is qualitatively different from,and more culpable than,the conduct giving rise to a violation of the fiduciary duty of care,gross negligence in disney,we identified the following examples of conduct that would establish a failure to act in good faith 
a failure to act in good faith may be shown,for instance,where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the best interests of the corporation,where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law,or where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act,demonstrating a conscious disregard for his duties.there may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged,but these three are the most salient 
the third of these examples describes,and is fully consistent with,the lack of good faith conduct that the caremark court held was a necessary condition for director oversight liability,a sustained or systematic failure of the board to exercise as an utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists indeed,our opinion in disney cited caremark with approval for that proposition accordingly,the court of chancery applied the correct standard in assessing whether demand was excused in this case where failure to exercise oversight was the basis or theory of the plaintiffs claim for relief.
it is important,in this context,to clarify a doctrinal issue that is critical to understanding fiduciary liability under caremark as we construe that case.the phraseology used in caremark and that we employ the lack of good faith as a necessary condition to liability is deliberate.the purpose of that formulation is to communicate that a failure to act in good faith is not conduct that results,ipso facto,in the direct imposition of fiduciary liability the failure to act in good faith may result in liability because the requirement to act in good faith is a subsidiary element,a condition,of the fundamental duty of loyalty.it follows that because a showing of bad faith conduct,in the sense described in disney and caremark,is essential to establish director oversight liability,the fiduciary duty violated by that conduct is the duty of loyalty.
this view of a failure to act in good faith results in two additional doctrinal consequences.first,although good faith may be described colloquially as part of a triad of fiduciary duties that includes the duties of care and loyalty the obligation to act in good faith does not establish an independent fiduciary duty that stands on the same footing as the duties of care and loyalty.only the latter two duties,where violated,may directly result in liability,whereas a failure to act in good faith may do so,but indirectl
