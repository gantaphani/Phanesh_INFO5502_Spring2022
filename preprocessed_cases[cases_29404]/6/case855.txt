defendant pavel ivanovich lazarenko,former prime minister of ukraine,laundered money from illegal activities through many banks worldwide,including the european federal credit bank eurofed,located in the sovereign nation of antigua and barbuda antigua.defendant activities raised prosecutorial eyebrows in both the united states and antigua.antiguan officials ordered the liquidation of eurofed,and the high court of antigua appointed several persons as liquidators of eurofed to assist in the collection and distribution of eurofed assets to its rightful,owners.meanwhile,the united states government indicted defendant on criminal charges,including money laundering.see united states lazarenko,cir.describing case history,cert.denied.
the united states government discovered that some of defendant assets at issue originally had been deposited with eurofed,were held in two eurofed correspondent accounts at bank of america in san francisco.the government seized those assets and sought criminal forfeiture.liquidators asserted ownership of the assets and sought to defeat criminal forfeiture.in an ancillary proceeding pursuant to n,the district court rejected liquidators arguments challenging the criminal forfeiture and entered a final order of forfeiture.liquidators timely appeal.we reverse and remand with instructions that the district court vacate the forfeiture order and that the district court order the government to return the assets to liquidators.
factual and procedural history 
we previously have detailed the factual and procedural history of defendant criminal convictions.lazarenko,at.relevant here,the final indictment,filed in,contained a criminal forfeiture allegation pursuant to.the indictment alleged that defendant shall forfeit to the united states all property,real and personal,involved in such offense,or any property traceable to such property,including but not limited to certain specified properties not including the assets at issue here.as part of the substantive allegations,the indictment referred to many different specific bank accounts and specific bank transfers,but the indictment nowhere referred to the assets presently in dispute.those assets are approximately million in funds and ukrainian bonds on deposit with bank of america.the government asserts that those assets are connected to defendant money laundering.
in,the jury convicted defendant of money laundering and,about six weeks later,the government filed a motion for criminal forfeiture.the motion sought forfeiture of the bank accounts and funds mentioned in the indictment,but the motion did not name the assets at issue here.likely because of the complexity of this case,the district court did not rule on the motion immediately.
several months later,in january,the government obtained a civil warrant to seize the assets at issue here.see united states lazarenko liquidators,cir describing history of civil forfeiture action united states seized from bank of,app x,cir unpublished decision same.in march,the government filed a civil complaint against the assets.liquidators moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.because the government learned of the underlying offenses by at the latest,the statute of limitations barred the civil forfeiture complaint.eventually,the government conceded that the statute of limitations barred its civil forfeiture action.on october,the district court therefore granted liquidators motion for summary judgment in the civil action 
that same day,at the government request,the district court also issued a criminal seizure warrant over the same assets.the government retained possession of the assets.in january,liquidators filed a motion for return of the illegally seized funds.additionally 
in march,liquidators applied ex parte to judge jenkins for an immediate hearing on their motion for return of the illegally seized funds.liquidators claimed that united states crozier,cir,afforded them the right to a constitutionally mandated and immediate hearing.they reasoned that waiting to commence the ancillary proceedings contemplated by.n until the district court sentenced lazarenko would not sufficiently protect their due process rights to a reasonably prompt opportunity to contest the seized property to which they claim ownership 
after holding a telephonic conference with all interested parties,the district court denied liquidators ex parte application.the district court found that setting a hearing on liquidators motion after sentencing lazarenko comported with due process,as congress has provided for ancillary proceedings on the heels of a sentence imposed upon conviction of a particular crime,n.soon thereafter,the district court granted the united states application for a preliminary order of forfeiture under u.a and federal rule of criminal procedure b.
liquidators,at some citations omitted.liquidators thereafter appealed from both orders and,alternatively,asked us to grant a writ of mandamus compelling the district court to order the government to return the assets to liquidators immediately.
in that interlocutory appeal,liquidators argued,among other things,that three legal doctrines independently barred this criminal forfeiture action the statute of limitations,res judicata,and the act of state doctrine.the government argued that we lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of those arguments because of the procedural posture of the appeals.specifically,the government asserted that there were no due process concerns because liquidators could raise their legal challenges to the criminal forfeiture action in a ancillary proceeding under n.
we dismissed the appeals and the mandamus petition for lack of jurisdiction.we summarized in the conclusion 
we hold that liquidators may adequately protect their interest in the funds and bonds in the ancillary proceeding under n.congress designated no other means for third parties to vindicate their interest in forfeited property.because liquidators may present all legal arguments that might bar the government forfeiture in the proceedings below,and because the district court is prepared to undertake the ancillary proceedings promptly,we further hold that liquidators fail to satisfy the constitutional and prudential components of standing and ripeness.
id.at emphasis added.in our reasoning,we clarified that,during the ancillary proceeding,liquidators could present its legal arguments concerning,among other theories,the statute of limitations,res judicata,and the act of state doctrine.id.at.
on remand,the district court initiated the ancillary proceeding under n.during that proceeding,the government to the earlier position that it had asserted to the relevant statutes and rules of criminal procedure barred liquidators from raising their legal challenges to the forfeiture.the district court agreed with the government but also held,in the alternative,that the three legal challenges fail on their merits.the district court also rejected liquidators factual challenges to the forfeiture.accordingly,the district court entered a final order of forfeiture in favor of the government.liquidators timely appeal

discussion 
as they have throughout these proceedings,liquidators seek resolution of their argument that three legal doctrines independently bar this criminal forfeiture action the statute of limitations,res judicata,and the act of state doctrine.before reaching those arguments,we must address the government contention that liquidators can not raise those arguments in the ancillary proceeding.
ancillary proceedings under n and judicial estoppel 
title and federal rule of criminal procedure govern defendant criminal forfeiture proceedings.defendant was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of.title a requires that t he court,in imposing sentence on a person convicted of an offense in violation of section of this title,shall order that the person forfeit to the united states any property,real or personal,involved in such offense,or any property traceable to such property.section b states that the forfeiture proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of.rule specifies the procedure governing criminal forfeiture proceedings under.
here,briefly,is how the system works.see generally liquidators,at.the government must provide notice to the defendant that it intends to seek forfeiture.rule a.the notice must be included in the indictment or information,but the notice need not identify the property subject to forfeiture.id.if the defendant is convicted on a count supporting forfeiture by statute,then the government may move for entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture.rule b.as soon as practical after a verdict or finding of guilty on any count in an indictment or information regarding which criminal forfeiture is sought,the court must determine what property is subject to forfeiture under the applicable statute.rule b a.if the government seeks forfeiture of specific property,the court must determine whether the government has established the requisite nexus between the property and the offense.id.
at no point may any third party intervene in the criminal trial or appeal.k.additionally,once the government has filed the criminal indictment or information against the defendant,no third party may commence an action at law or equity against the united states concerning the validity of his alleged interest in the property.id.k.instead,congress protected the interests of third parties through the operation of an ancillary proceeding.id.n rule b.as stated by rule b the court must enter the preliminary order of forfeiture without regard to any third party interest in the property.determining whether a third party has such an interest must be deferred until any third party files a claim in an ancillary proceeding under rule c.
the entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture permits the government to commence an ancillary proceeding to determine the rights of third parties.rule b.the preliminary order of forfeiture becomes final with respect to the defendant at sentencing or earlier,if the defendant agrees.rule b a.but the order is not final with respect to interested third parties until the conclusion of the ancillary proceeding.n.
the government must provide notice of its intended forfeiture of specific property,both generally and specifically to known third parties who may have an interest in the property.id.n rule b.if,as prescribed by statute,a third party files a petition asserting an interest in the property to be forfeited,the court must conduct an ancillary proceeding rule c.an ancillary proceeding is not part of sentencing.rule c.the rule and statute specify details concerning the timing and procedure of the ancillary proceeding,including a hearing to resolve factual disputes.n,rule c.on the substance of the ancillary proceeding,n states 
if,after the hearing,the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that 
a the petitioner has a legal right,title,or interest in the property,and such right,title,or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right,title,or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right,title,or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section or 
b the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right,title,or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section 
the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.
at the conclusion of the ancillary proceeding,the court enters a final order of forfeiture,which is final with respect to all third parties.rule c.third parties may appeal from a final order of forfeiture.rule c.
in most situations,this system adequately protects everyone interests.if the defendant believes that the property is his or hers,the defendant has an adequate incentive to challenge the forfeitability of the property.nothing prevents the defendant from raising legal challenges to the forfeitability of the property during the criminal proceeding itself.additionally,the statutory scheme usually provides adequate protection for the interests of third parties,because the statute permits bona fide purchasers and those with superior title to present their claims.if they have a superior interest in the property as to the defendant,n a,or if they are bona fide purchasers for value,n b,then they would prevail in the ancillary proceeding on the merits,regardless of any possible legal challenges to the forfeitability of the property generally.and,if the third parties do not have a superior interest and are not bona fide purchasers,then any ruling that the forfeitability of the property was legally deficient would not accrue value to the third parties,because they have no interest in the property.
liquidators assert,however,that this case might be an exception to the usual situation.the antiguan government has ordered the liquidation of eurofed.as a practical matter,defendant has no hope of ever obtaining the disputed assets because,even if forfeiture is defeated here,defendant almost certainly will not recover the funds from the liquidation proceedings that are underway in antigua.accordingly,defendant had no incentive to did not criminal forfeiture action brought by the united states government.
additionally,unlike most scenarios,in which the interests of the third parties are protected by n,here liquidators may not have a valid claim under either subsection of n.liquidators may lack a valid claim under subsection a because their interest in the property arose after defendant criminal,because their interest in the property,like the government interest in prosecuting defendant,arose because of defendant criminal conduct and liquidators may lack a valid claim under subsection b because they can not claim to be a bona fide purchaser for value they did not purchase the acquired it through other legal means,namely,by order of the high court of antigua.in short,liquidators may lack a valid claim under either subsection of n.but,as liquidators point out,a ruling that the criminal forfeiture action is invalid would,in fact,accrue value to liquidators,because liquidators had possession of the assets at the time of seizure,and a return of the assets therefore would benefit liquidators and,ultimately,the innocent depositors of eurofed.
liquidators view this case as the convergence of those unusual circumstances defendant had no incentive to challenge the forfeitability of the property,liquidators likely have no valid claim on the grounds described in n,and a successful challenge to forfeitability would benefit liquidators.in this odd scenario,liquidators argue,the government might have absolutely no right to forfeiture because of a patent and fatal flaw such as untimeliness or res judicata,yet the government nevertheless might prevail because defendant has no reason to challenge the forfeitability and,if liquidators are prohibited from raising legal challenges,the government nevertheless will retain possession and title to the assets.
the government disputes the extent to which the circumstances of this case are unusual.in any event,it argues,third parties can not raise legal challenges to the forfeitability of the property in an ancillary proceeding.the government argues that,by design,n provides the only theories by which a third party may challenge the forfeiture superior title and bona fide purchaser.according to the government,it follows that third parties may not assert any other challenges,such as res judicata,to the forfeitability of the property.many legal sources,including the advisory committee notes to rule,our previous statements on the scope of ancillary proceedings,and our sister circuits holdings,support the government view.see,united states nava,cir the petitioner may prevail only upon showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he possessed a vested or superior legal right,title,or interest in the property at the time the criminal acts took place,or that he was a bona fide purchaser for value.united states huntington bank,cir because n offers just two grounds for relief,only two closely related substantive questions may arise when a third party asserts an interest in forfeitable for the first time at a hearing.
liquidators response is,in short we saw this coming.
in the original appeal,liquidators strenuously asserted that the procedural scheme created by congress violated their due process rights.see liquidators,at liquidators essentially challenge the entire process congress prescribed for third parties to adjudicate their interest in property subject to forfeiture.liquidators foresaw the arguments now advanced by the government.they argued that,if we did not permit them to intervene in the criminal proceeding in order to make their legal challenges,the government would prevent them from raising those legal challenges in the ancillary proceeding,for the very reasons that the government now advances.in sum,liquidators argued that the procedural scheme violated due process because they would never be permitted to raise their legal challenges to forfeitability.
in that appeal,the government responded by pulling the rug out from under liquidators argument.in its briefing to us,the government affirmatively rebutted the premise of liquidators due process challenge.the government assured us that,in the eventual ancillary proceeding,liquidators could raise its legal challenges to forfeitability and that the courts could and would resolve those challenges on their merits.the government thus recharacterized liquidators due process argument as a demand for a hearing on their claims prematurely,before the ancillary proceeding took place.for instance,in its response to an emergency motion filed by liquidators,the government stated 
when the dust settles,the liquidators emergency motion is not about the merits of any of the liquidators arguments,all of which can be advanced and resolved in the ancillary proceeding and then appealed,if the resolution is adverse.rather,the emergency motion is about whether the liquidators have standing to demand a particular type of process 
emphasis added.the government response brief was worded even more strongly.in the introductory paragraph to a section entitled the liquidators claims,which are without merit,all can be raised and resolved in the ancillary proceeding,the government stated the ancillary proceeding provides a mechanism for resolving factual and legal disputes relating to third party ownership of forfeited property.all of the liquidators claims can be raised and resolved,with an appeal if necessary,at the conclusion of that proceeding.see,united states real property in waterboro,cir can not assert res judicata prior to ancillary proceeding.
in view of the government representations,we held 
liquidators present no reason why the ancillary proceeding would inadequately protect their interest in adjudicating their competing claim to the property.in the proceedings that we understand the district court will promptly commence below,liquidators may present all arguments and defenses to defeat the government forfeiture,including those raised in their seizure motion and on appeal.we express no opinion on the merits of those arguments,and the district court may freely apply the law to the facts as it finds them during the ancillary proceedings.
to clarify,these include whether the government seized the funds outside the limitation period,res judicata bars the criminal seizure,the criminal seizure violates the act of state doctrine,and other arguments irrelevant here.
liquidators,at see also id.at because liquidators may present all legal arguments that might bar the government forfeiture in the proceedings below,and because the district court is prepared to undertake the ancillary proceedings promptly,we further hold that liquidators fail to satisfy the constitutional and prudential components of standing and ripeness.
at oral argument in the original appeal,counsel for liquidators expressed his fear that the government was playing a shell game whereby the government asserts that liquidators can raise their arguments later,but subsequently states that liquidators can not raise the arguments at all.his concern turned out to be justified,as that is exactly what the government did at the ancillary proceeding following our remand.under the circumstances,judicial estoppel bars the government from effecting its sleight of hand.
judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.in determining whether to apply the doctrine,we typically consider whether a party later position is clearly inconsistent with its original position whether the party has successfully persuaded the court of the earlier position and whether allowing the inconsistent position would allow the party to derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party.
united states ibrahim,cir quoting new hampshire maine,some internal quotation marks omitted.all three elements are met here.
the government original position was that liquidators could raise its legal challenges in the ancillary proceeding.its later position is that liquidators can not raise its legal challenges in the ancillary proceeding.those are directly contradictory positions necessarily,they are clearly inconsistent.
the government disputes our characterization of its original position.according to the government,whatever it may have stated in the portions of its papers quoted above,it also made some statements in the original appeal that are consistent with its current position that liquidators can not raise their legal challenges at all.as a factual matter,the government is correct that,in the original appeal,it occasionally took the position,consistent with its current position,that liquidators legal arguments would be barred.but we can not overlook what the government now wishes it had not stated.it is inescapable that the government affirmatively and forcefully advanced a position clearly inconsistent with its current position.
the second prong of judicial estoppel is helpful here whether the party has successfully persuaded the court of the earlier position.ibrahim,at.as noted above,we plainly understood the government position in the original appeal as allowing liquidators to raise their arguments during the ancillary proceeding,and we were persuaded by that position.liquidators,at.in other words,even though the government took seemingly inconsistent positions at times,the panel was convinced by the position,squarely stated in the government brief,that a ll of the liquidators claims can be raised and resolved in the ancillary proceeding 
in conclusion,even though the government occasionally contradicted itself in the original appeal,it took a position clearly inconsistent with its current position and convinced the court of that position,to liquidators unfair detriment.we exercise our discretion and hold that judicial estoppel bars the government from arguing that liquidators can not raise its legal claims challenging forfeitability.
res judicata 
liquidators argue that res judicata bars the criminal forfeiture here.before addressing that issue,some discussion of civil and criminal forfeiture is in order.civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding against the res,on the legal fiction that the property itself is guilty.nava,at.to achieve civil forfeiture,the government generally must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,the culpability of the owner and a nexus between the property and the illegal activity.id.at.
by contrast,criminal forfeiture is an in personam proceeding against the defendant personally and is part of the defendant punishment.id.accordingly,to achieve criminal forfeiture,the government first must prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the defendant is guilty
