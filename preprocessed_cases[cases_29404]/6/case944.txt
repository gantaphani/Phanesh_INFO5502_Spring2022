background 
armed bandits planned and executed multiple robberies of oki semiconductor manufacturing plant in tualatin,oregon.between april,and september,the gang hit oki manufacturing plant five times,stealing approximately computer chips with a street value of nearly.unsatisfied,these industrious thieves perpetrated an impressive heist on october,escaping with nearly million worth of sophisticated semiconductors.when the fbi eventually infiltrated the gang,it identified tran as a central participant in a conspiracy conspiracy devoted to stealing and selling semiconductors and then laundering the proceeds through a network of dummy corporations and sham bank accounts.
wells fargo employed tran as a branch teller at a bank in california.tran used her position at wells fargo to orchestrate the conspiracy financial affairs.she established numerous bank accounts in the names of fictitious entities and,by transferring money from one entity to another,funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars through the conspiracy financial network.ultimately,the money emerged squeaky clean,laundered,and pressed,and then,it disappeared into the pockets of the conspiracy members.due to tran expertise,this financial legerdemain did not generate a suspicious activity report or raise a regulatory red flag.
oki filed suit in district court,alleging that tran engaged in racketeering activities in violation of rico.instead of suing tran directly,however,oki,in search of a deep pocket,claimed that wells fargo was vicariously liable for tran malfeasance.oki argued that wells fargo was liable because it reaped benefits from tran activities by obtaining numerous new accounts and receiving millions of dollars in deposits.oki further alleged that tran committed her crimes while acting within the course and scope of her employment using the training,offices,and other instrumentalities of her employment.
in addition,oki sued wells fargo for common law negligence.oki claimed wells fargo was negligent in hiring,retaining,and promoting tran when it knew or should have known that tran was involved in criminal activities supervising tran failing to detect tran suspicious transactions and allowing tran signatory rights on personal and corporate bank accounts.oki calculated its damages as the value of the stolen chips and consequential damages for lost profits,business interruption,and incidental expenses associated with the thefts.
wells fargo moved to dismiss oki rico claim because tran acts did not proximately cause oki loss.wells fargo sought also to dismiss oki negligence claim because it was not reasonably foreseeable that wells fargo alleged negligence would cause oki injury.the magistrate judge recommended granting wells fargo motion.oki sought reconsideration of the magistrate judge recommendation,claiming for the first time that wells fargo was liable because tran was responsible for all the acts of the conspiracy,even those acts in which she did not participate.unconvinced by this novel argument,the magistrate judge adhered to his recommendation.
the district court agreed with the magistrate recommendation and granted wells fargo motion to dismiss.the district court reasoned that because tran did not proximately cause oki loss,wells fargo was not liable to oki.it held also that wells fargo incurred no vicarious liability for the acts of tran rico conspirators,although those acts did proximately cause oki loss.finally,the district court dismissed the negligence claim because oki injury was not a reasonably foreseeable result of wells fargo alleged negligent conduct.
oki filed a reply memorandum after the district court granted wells fargo motion to dismiss.oki asked the district court to reconsider its decision or,in the alternative,to grant oki leave to allege additional aspects of the conspiracy and name tran as a defendant.although the district court considered oki reply memorandum,it denied oki motion for leave to amend.

discussion 
i proximate causation under rico 
oki filed suit pursuant to rico c,which provides that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains.c.section c contains a causation requirement a plaintiff must show that the defendant rico violation was not only a but for cause of his injury,but that it was a proximate cause as well.holmes sec.investor prot,d imagineering,kiewit pac,cir.a proximate cause is not the same thing as the sole cause.cox admin.united states steel carnegie,cir.instead,the proximate cause of an injury is a substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation.id.internal quotation omitted.some direct relationship between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct is necessary.holmes,at.
in holmes,for example,securities investor protection corporation sipc alleged that holmes conspired in a stock manipulation scheme that bankrupted two stock brokers and prevented them from meeting obligations to their customers,thus triggering sipc statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse those customers.at.the supreme court held that holmes acts did not proximately cause sipc loss.while holmes acts caused the stock brokers bankruptcy,only the bankruptcy caused the losses suffered by the customers and hence by the sipc.id.thus,holmes acts may have been a but for cause of the sipc loss,but they were not a proximate cause because there was no direct relationship between holmes alleged conduct and sipc asserted injury.id.
following the supreme court reasoning in holmes,we determined that proximate cause was lacking in imagineering,at.in that case,the defendant allegedly defrauded prime contractors out of specified projects,thereby depriving the plaintiffs those prime contractors subcontractors of profits they would have earned on those projects.id.we concluded that the defendant scheme directly harmed only the prime contractors,whereas it was the inability of the injured prime contractors to secure the contracts that directly caused the injuries.id.unable to show a direct relationship between their injuries and the defendant conduct,the could not demonstrate sufficient proximate causation to state a claim.in this case,oki seeks to hold wells fargo liable for the theft of its semic
