wachovia bank wachovia brought an action in north carolina state court against the federal reserve bank of richmond frb for breach of transfer and presentment warranties under article of the uniform commercial code,and under b regulation j.the frb removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina and filed a complaint against stores.the district court granted both wachovia and motions for summary judgment,and the frb appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgments entered in favor of wachovia and.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.massey coal,massanari,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the frb.see id.at.
issues million checks to its vendors annually.in any given year,approximately twenty of these checks are stolen.between april and april,six checks were stolen from dallas,texas.postal inspectors informed officials that the dallas thefts were not part of an organized scheme but were independent criminal acts.the inspectors also indicated that several individuals responsible for stealing the checks had been apprehended.
another check,written on a wachovia checking account,was stolen from dallas in late.on november of that year,issued a check made payable to alcon laboratories,alcon in the amount of.mailed the check from its headquarters in arkansas to alcon in dallas,but alcon never received the check.on december,an individual named pit foo wong deposited the check in his account at asia bank in flushing,new york.the payee on the check had been altered from alcon laboratories,to pit foo wong.
in accordance with federal reserve procedures,asia bank presented the check to the federal reserve bank of new york,which then presented the check to the frb in richmond.on december,the frb presented the check to wachovia,and wachovia issued payment before issuing payment,wachovia employed a fraud detection service known as positive pay on account.positive pay allows a paying bank to verify check numbers and amounts by comparing them to checks issued by the drawer.in this way,the paying bank can detect counterfeit and unauthorized checks before making payment.although positive pay prevents several types of fraud,it can not detect alterations of payee names.because the check presented by wong had been altered to change the name of the payee,positive pay did not detect the alteration.wachovia,in accordance with its internal policy,did not manually review the copy of the check presented by the frb.
although the employees at asia bank allowed wong to deposit the check,their suspicions were aroused by his deposit of over,and a hold was placed on the funds.at the time of deposit,wong account carried a balance of,and the highest balance it had ever carried was.on december,the day following wong deposit,asia bank employee sindy lee called wachovia to inquire about the check.at the time of this telephone call,wachovia had already issued payment.lee spoke to a customer service representative,who informed lee that the check was good.despite this information,the branch manager at asia bank remained suspicious and continued to hold the funds.
on december,alcon representative penny shaw called automated vendor support line and learned that the check to alcon had been paid.after determining that alcon had not received the check,shaw called employee paula king,who handled alcon accounts.although records indicated that the check had been paid,king informed shaw that policy was to wait thirty days before tracing missing checks.
on december,after asia bank hold on the funds had expired,wong attempted to wire large portions of the funds to accounts in malaysia by submitting five separate wire transfer applications to five different tellers.because of this unusual behavior,lee called wachovia for a second time and was informed that the check had been paid.shortly thereafter,another asia bank employee placed a call to to inquire about the check.the asia bank employee spoke to a customer service representative,kimberly feast,who was unable to confirm that wong was the proper payee.at the conclusion of this telephone call,feast did not notify her superiors of asia bank inquiry.subsequently,asia bank released the funds,and wong completed his wire transfers to malaysia.
when discovered that the alcon check had been altered,it notified wachovia,which sought reimbursement from asia bank.asia bank refused,and wachovia brought suit against the frb for breach of presentment and transfer warranties under the and federal regulations the frb filed a complaint against,alleging that failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributed to the alteration of the check.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both wachovia and this appeal followed.
we first address the district court award of summary judgment to wachovia on its claim for breach of presentment warranty under the wachovia brought its claim under of the,codified as,which establishes that a bank presenting a check for payment warrants that it has not been altered.the warranty is made at the time of presentment,and the paying bank,or drawee,that pays the draft in good faith may recover damages against the presenting bank for breach of the presentment warranty.id.
through presentment warranties,the general scheme of the shifts losses up the collection stream to presenting and depository banks.see white summers,uniform commercial code ed.this scheme is subject to certain exceptions,however,and the does not impose liability on presenting banks if a loss is more appropriately borne by other parties.there are several defenses available to presenting banks,two of which are relevant here.first,a presenting bank may defend a breach of warranty action on the ground that the paying bank lacked good faith.see.a.the defines good faith as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.a.the failure of the paying bank to exercise ordinary care is insufficient to establish a lack of good faith.b.second,a presenting bank may assert a defense if the drawer of the check is precluded from asserting a claim against the paying bank.c.a presenting bank may avail itself of this defense if the drawer failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration.thus,applying this defense to the facts here,wachovia may not recover its loss from the frb if failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributed to the alteration of the check.
the frb asserts both of these defenses,alleging that wachovia lacked good faith in paying the check and that failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributed to the alteration.we address each of these defenses in turn.
the frb argues that summary judgment was improperly granted for wachovia because a question of fact exists as to whether wachovia paid the check in good faith.in support of this argument,the frb alleges that the two telephone calls made by asia bank employee sindy lee to wachovia,after the payment of the check but before asia bank had released the funds,should have alerted wachovia to a problem.despite these phone calls,wachovia failed to take any action that may have averted the ultimate loss of the funds.wachovia inaction,according to the frb,demonstrates wachovia lack of good faith.
we conclude that the frb argument is foreclosed by the plain language of,which provides that the presenting bank warrants the check at the time of presentment to a drawee that pays in good faith.a.because the statute directs us to examine the question of wachovia good faith at the time of presentment,we do not consider wachovia acts,or its failure to act,subsequent to presentment.while the frb may be correct in its assertion that lee telephone calls should have prompted wachovia to investigate the check,these calls occurred after the check was presented and paid.we conclude,therefore,that the frb can not establish a defense to the warranty action based upon wachovia a
