plaintiff landlord sued the individual partners in a defunct law firm for rent due and owing under a commercial lease.the landlord sought damages for fraudulent conveyance,asserting the partners had drained the law firm of its assets by taking partnership draws instead of paying rent.the partners collectively filed three motions for summary judgment,each of which was granted the landlord appeals from the subsequently entered summary judgment in favor of the partners.it contends summary judgment was improper because there were triable issues of material fact as to whether the monetary transfers were made in good faith and for reasonably equivalent value.we disagree and affirm.
the hamilton samuels law firm,a general partnership,leased office space in newport beach from annod corporation,as trustee of the bayview trust annod the law firm ran into financial trouble and stopped making lease payments in september.in november,annod filed suit against the law firm,in annod corporation hamilton samuels,orange county superior court case.hamilton samuels dissolved in january.in,annod obtained a judgment against hamilton samuels in the amount of,but it never obtained payment on the judgment.
in,annod filed a complaint for avoidance of fraudulent transfers and damages for conspiracy to defraud creditors,against the hamilton samuels partners.annod accused the individual partners of transferring the assets of the firm with the intent to defraud annod.as annod would later explain,it viewed the draws the partners received during the period of time the law firm had stopped paying rent as fraudulent transfers.it asserted that the partners should not have received any draws during that time period,but should have used any funds available for draws to pay the rent instead.annod sought return of the partnership draws taken between august and february.the amount in controversy was roughly.
the individual law partners,in three groupings,collectively filed three motions for summary judgment in each of the three motions,the partners argued,inter alia,the lease was a nonrecourse lease as to them individually,and they had a defense to annod claims because the draws were made in good faith and for reasonably equivalent value.the trial court granted all three motions and entered judgment on behalf of all moving parties.
annod filed an appeal from the judgment.it filed a second appeal from a subsequent order granting a motion for attorney fees as costs and a motion to be declared the prevailing party and fixing attorney fees.
discussiona.standard of review 
on review of a summary judgment,we examine the record de novo and independently determine whether the decision is correct.citation.colarossi coty th,d.in undertaking our independent review of the evidence submitted,we apply the same process required of the trial court first,we identify the issues raised by the pleadings,since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond secondly,we determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which negate the opponent claims and justify a judgment in movant favor when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment,the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.citations.waschek department of motor vehicles th,d.
summary judgment 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.under summary judgment law,any party to an action,whether plaintiff or defendant,may move the court for summary judgment in his or her favor on a cause of action or defense code civ,subd.a a plaintiff contend ing that there is no defense to the action,a defendant contend ing that the action has no merit ibid.the court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,subd.c that is,there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and,ultimately,the law citations and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law code civ,subd.c.ibid.
i n moving for summary judgment,a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he or she has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto code civ,subd.o.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
just how a party moving for summary judgment carries his or her burden depends on the burden of proof at trial.in this case,annod,at trial,would be required to show fraudulent intent by a preponderance of the evidence.liodas sahadi cal d,gagan gouyd th,d whitehouse six th,d but see reddy gonzalez th,d using clear and convincing evidence standard based on case disapproved in liodas.a defendant moving for summary judgment against a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at trial must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than not aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
accordingly,the moving partners were required to present evidence that would require the trial court not to find fraudulent intent more likely than not.in an effort to do so,they presented evidence to show good faith and reasonably equivalent value.based on that evidence,the trial court held that the moving partners had established a complete defense to the fraudulent conveyance claim but that annod had failed to show a triable issue of material fact existed as to that claim.as we shall show,we agree.
uniform fraudulent transfer act 
civil code section et.
as annod points out,whether a conveyance is made with fraudulent intent is a question of fact.bulmash davis cal d.annod asserts the trial court erred in determining there were no triable issues of material fact as to whether the partners acted in good faith and gave reasonably equivalent value,within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision a,and whether the draws were fraudulent transfers under civil code sections.we shall examine each of these provisions in turn.
the uniform fraudulent transfer act the act is found in civil code section et.section provides a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred,if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation as follows a with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor.b without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,and the debtor was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction or intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that he or she would incur,debts beyond his or her ability to pay as they became due.section is construed to mean a transfer is fraudulent if the provisions of either subdivision a or subdivision b are satisfied.monastra konica business machines,th,d reddy gonzalez,supra,th at,d.
civil code section,subdivision a provides a defense to an action based on section,subdivision a.section,subdivision a states that a transfer or an obligation is not voidable under subdivision a of section,against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value thus,a showing of good faith and reasonably equivalent value is all that is required to defeat a creditor action based on section,subdivision a.obviously,if a transfer is made both in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value,then the transfer is not a fraudulent transfer under section,subdivision b,either,since subdivision b applies only to transfers made without receipt of reasonably equivalent value.
the same holds true with respect to civil code section,which provides a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.if the debtor received reasonably equivalent value,the inquiry ends there.
evidence of good faith and reasonably equivalent value 
a trial court findings 
the trial court,in three lengthy orders granting summary judgment,explained why there was no triable issue of material fact as to either good faith or reasonably equivalent value.in the order on the hamilton motion,the court found on issue of good faith,the evidence is uncontradicted that the transferees acted without actual fraudulent intent and that they did not collude with the debtor this is evidenced by the following if the draws were not paid,none of the former partners would have continued working and generating revenue for the struggling law practice the draws from august,forward were for a substantially lesser amount than those taken for previous periods these partnership draws represent undermarket values for the services performed by the former partners the draws taken by the former partners,or alternatively,withdrawals from capital taken by the former partners were less than the income credited to each former partner capital account in and and the lease between the parties contained a provision which provided that the former partners were not liable for the obligations of hamilton samuels to annod corporation and that annod corporation would not resort to the personal assets of the former partners to satisfy the lease obligation 
in the order on the hamilton motion the court further found that a s to the issue of reasonably equivalent value,the evidence is uncontroverted that the partnership draws resulted from legal work converted to billings undertaken by each of the former partners for the benefit of the partnership the draws received by the former partners from august,forward were considerably less than and paid on a much more sporadic basis than those which they had received promptly the draws were modest as compared to the remaining generated cash income of hamilton samuels and the draws from august,forward were a fraction of what the former partners generated in receivables for hamilton samuels.
in the orders on the adams and green motions,the court was even more detailed in its findings.the orders detailed the amount of time each of the moving partners billed in,his or her billing rate,his or her total receivables that year,and the amount of compensation each of those partners actually received in draws in.for example,in,partner frederick kranz billed hours at a billing rate of per hour,which generated in excess of in receivables.yet he received only in partnership draws for.while not cited in the order itself,further evidence of the good faith nature of the draws was provided by kranz in his declaration filed in support of the adams motion.in that declaration,kranz declared that in the year after leaving hamilton samuels his total compensation was nearly.
as the court further found in the order on the green motion,t he evidence was overwhelming that the moving partners were not looting the firm rather,the evidence showed they simply made the decision that in difficult times they would chose sic to pay creditors to whom they would bear individual liability,rather than a creditor who had agreed not to hold them personally liable.see,a debtor may pay one creditor in preference to another.
in addition,the court found the moving partners provided reasonably equivalent value for the draws which they received by continuing to work substantial hours after sic h s hamilton samuels during the entire period from august through february,by generating receivables in excess of the modest draws which they received and by leaving substantial assets,including cash income,in the firm which were then available to satisfy the claims of its creditors.the efforts of the moving partners during this period resulted in an increase in the amount of cash which was available to creditors over the amount which would have been available if they had ceased working on behalf of the firm in september.without the modest draws which they received during this period,the moving partners would have resigned immediately from h s the cash available to creditors of h s would have been reduced as a result.indeed,the record reflects that the partners made such an effort to increase funds available to creditors that at times hamilton samuel employees,including some of the secretaries,were being paid more than the partners.
b timing of partnership draws 
annod does not dispute the evidence supporting the trial court findings.it does,however,complain about the timing of the partners draws,implying the timing shows fraudulent intent.annod states that the partners were not paid with respect to work performed in the immediately preceding pay period.rather,it claims that,after payment of rent to annod had ceased,the partners received accrued but previously undisbursed draws relating to prior pay periods.
to the extent it is true that the partners were receiving delayed draws,this does not mean the monetary transfers were fraudulent.the statutory scheme does not treat delayed payments as suspect.to the contrary,civil code section provides that value is given for a transfer or an obligation if,in exchange for the transfer or obligation,property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied in this case,money was transferred in satisfaction of the antecedent debts of hamilton samuels,the overdue partnership draws.these were transfers for value under section.
annod also complains that partner paul hamilton received just over in draws in august,right before hamilton samuels quit paying rent.however,as hamilton explained in his declaration in support of the hamilton motion,this sum was largely to bring current his overdue draws for the first half of.as hamilton explained,long before h s defaulted on its rental obligation in september,draws distributed to the partners had been severely reduced.by the end of july,draws that ordinarily would have been disbursed at full rate for earlier time periods were being parsed out at draw at a time,representing fifty percent of the current draw entitlement set earlier in the year.as he further stated,his draws were short approximately for the first seven months of.in august,certain long outstanding accounts receivable were paid to h s,which permitted him to be paid approximately,which cured the default in his draw payments for the period january,to july,
c further evidence of good faith and reasonably equivalent value 
hamilton declaration also provides support for the trial court finding that the partner draws were modest and a fraction of the receivables the respective partners generated.hamilton declared that in,he billed hours,at a billing rate between and per hour.however,for the entire year he received.he remained on the leased premises for the first three months of as a liquidating partner and billed at least hours per month,at an hourly rate of between and.his billed time aggregated no less than for that time period.but he received no more than in draws in.finally,hamilton declared that t he draws he received in,and in were over less than draws and distributions which he had received in,and over less than draws and distributions he received in,and.
d badges of fraud 
in an effort to muster some evidence of fraudulent intent,however,annod refers to a legislative committee comment to civil code section,to the effect certain badges of fraud are evidence from which an inference of fraudulent intent may be drawn.legis.com,west ann.ed.foll.annod argues fraudu
