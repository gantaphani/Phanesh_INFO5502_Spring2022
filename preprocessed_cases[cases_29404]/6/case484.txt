appellants,robert fernandez and other investors the fernandez group in sharp capital,appeal the district court judgments approving settlements between sharp and third parties which settlements included permanent injunctions barring the fernandez group from pursuing their claims against those third parties in state court.for reasons that follow,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in using a summary judgment type proceeding to determine that the fernandez group had no direct claims against appellees or in entering an injunction barring the fernandez group from pursuing those claims,which belonged solely to sharp.therefore,we affirm.
in november,the securities and exchange commission sued sharp capital,mauricio gutierrez sharp principal and emerging markets capital advisors,emca invoking the district court equity powers and seeking to enjoin alleged violations of the federal securities laws.the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting anyone from interfering with sharp assets,signed an order taking jurisdiction of all of sharp and emca assets for the benefit of defrauded investors and appointing robert janvey,special master,to gather and distribute those assets.this appeal relates to orders of the special master approved by the district court enjoining individual investors from suing to recoup their individual losses from entities with whom sharp had business dealings.
the sec charged sharp and others with defrauding numerous investors.sharp was an investment advisory company registered with the sec.it entered into investment advisory agreements with over mexican nationals who invested approximately million.the fernandez are of sharp investors who invested approximately million.sharp promised to place the investors funds in safe,conservative investments such as eurobonds,euro cds and money market funds.instead it used the investors money to make highly leveraged purchases of investments in volatile emerging markets such as russia and latin america.sharp also pooled the funds in emca,a bahamian corporation,and used them to make substandard loans to entities affiliated with grupo protexa,a group of mexican companies,and others.by the time the sec stepped in,sharp had lost about of the investors money.
the investment advisory and custody agreement that each investor signed with sharp required sharp to deposit the funds in nationsbank bank of america the bank in an account owned by sharp.sharp was permitted to pool the funds in one account as long as all funds came from sharp investors.the investment agreement gave sharp exclusive authority to manage and make investment decisions regarding the funds.sharp did open a custodial account at the bank without investment advice which required the bank to follow sharp directions for use of the funds.
following his appointment,the special master began the process of settling claims of sharp for the benefit of the investors.in june,the special master began negotiations with grupo protexa who had borrowed substantial sums from sharp and whose loans were in default.
in october,the fernandez plaintiffs filed suit in state district court against grupo protexa,the bank and other defendants who had done business with sharp or acted as sharp agents,but who were not parties to the sec action.the suit raised various state law causes of action including fraud,negligent misrepresentation,violation of the texas dtpa,negligence,conversion,breach of trust,breach of fiduciary duty,misapplication of fiduciary property,violation of the texas securities act and constructive enrichment.the bank responded to the fernandez lawsuit by filing an action for contribution and contractual indemnity against sharp,asserting a right to recover over from sharp any damages the fernandez group might recover from the bank in the state court action.the bank suit was consolidated into the main sec suit.
in april,the special master applied to the district court in the sec action for approval of a settlement it had negotiated with grupo protexa.the special master concluded that the fernandez group claims against grupo protexa were derivative of sharp claims and requested that the settlement include a release of the fernandez group claims against grupo protexa and an injunction to prohibit them from further pursuing those claims in the state court suit.at the request of the special master,the district court ordered a summary proceeding to evaluate the settlement and give the fernandez claimants the opportunity to demonstrate that they had direct claims against grupo protexa.
in his application for approval of the grupo protexa settlement,the special master also requested authority to investigate sharp claims against the bank,which the district court granted.in its investigation the special master focused on whether the fernandez plaintiffs had any direct claims against the bank or were asserting claims derivative of sharp claims controlled by the special master.the special master sent questionnaires to all sharp investors asking them to identify all bank employees with whom they had contact and to disclose any facts that would support a direct claim against the bank.the fernandez plaintiffs refused to answer.the special master also reviewed discovery in the state court suit.the special master concluded that the fernandez group had no direct claims against the bank and were asserting derivative claims of sharp that were under his control.
the special master negotiated a settlement with the bank which included sharp claims against the bank and the bank contribution and indemnity action against sharp.the special master then asked the district court to approve the settlement.again the settlement called for release of all of sharp claims,a release of the bank contribution claims and an injunction to prevent the fernandez group from pursuing their claims against the bank in the state court suit.the district court ordered a summary proceeding to allow the fernandez group the opportunity to present evidence of direct claims against the bank.
the fernandez group filed responses to the special master applications for approval of the settlements with grupo protexa and the bank.their submissions included their original and amended petitions from the state court case,declarations from individual fernandez plaintiffs and the sharp brochure,fund receipt confirmations and portfolio analysis statements.the district court held separate hearings on each settlement and counsel had an opportunity to argue their position 
as to the bank settlement,the district court found that none of the fernandez litigants was able to attest to any direct contact with the bank and no evidence was submitted to support their allegations that the bank had made misrepresentations to them.further,no evidence was submitted to support their contention that the bank owed the fernandez group an independent duty.as to the grupo protexa settlement,the district court also found that no one opposing the settlement could attest to any direct contact with protexa or other related parties dealing with their sharp investments.as to both settlements,the district court found that the declarations and other evidence submitted by the fernandez plaintiffs failed to assert facts sufficient to establish direct claims against the grupo protexa parties or the bank or claims that were not derived from the losses they suffered due to their investments in sharp emca.
the district court ultimately approved both the grupo protexa and bank settlements and entered permanent injunctions barring the fernandez group from pursuing their claims against grupo protexa and the bank in state court.the fernandez group timely appealed from each order and their appeals were consolidated in this case.
all parties agree that the authority of the special master and the district court to marshal the assets of sharp extends only to assets that actually belong to sharp and emca.see caplin marine midland grace trust,d.the parties dispute whether the claims asserted by the fernandez group in the state court suit are derivative of rights of sharp,and therefore fall under the authority of
