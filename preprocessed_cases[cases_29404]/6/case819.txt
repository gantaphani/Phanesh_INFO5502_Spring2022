we also review whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint without granting leave to amend.id.citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
assignment and transfer of the note and deed of trust to bank of new york 
relying on in re veal,the zadroznys contend that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that bank of new york lacked standing to foreclose.the zadroznys maintain that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the note and deed of trust were never properly assigned to bank of new york.unfortunately,the allegations in the complaint can not elide the express provisions in the deed of trust for selling the note and for appointing a successor trustee without prior notice to the borrowers.paragraph of the deed of trust specifies 
sale of note change of loan servicer notice of grievance.the note or a partial interest in the note together with this security instrument can be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower.a sale might result in a change in the entity known as the loan servicer that collects periodic payments due under the note and this security instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the note,this security instrument,and applicable law.
paragraph similarly provides that lender may,for any reason or cause,from time to time remove trustee and appoint a successor trustee to any trustee appointed hereunder.without conveyance of the property,the successor trustee shall succeed to all the title,power and duties conferred upon trustee herein and by applicable law.the deed of trust terms explicitly foreclose the zadroznys claims premised on the sale or transfer of the note to a successor trustee.
in re veal does not compel a contrary result.in that case,the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap considered whether an entity had standing to seek relief from an automatic stay as a person entitled to enforce the note as defined by the uniform commercial code.in re veal,at internal quotation marks omitted.the bap opined that w hen a note is split from a deed of trust the note becomes,as a practical matter,unsecured.additionally,if the deed of trust was assigned without the note,then the assignee,having no interest in the underlying debt or obligation,has a worthless piece of paper.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the bap observed that illinois law govern ed the issues related to the mortgage enforcement,and illinois follow ed this rule.id.footnote reference omitted.illinois courts treat a mortgage as incident or accessory to the debt,and,an assignment of a mortgage without the note as a nullity.in order for the illinois courts to enforce a mortgage assignment,the assignor must assign the underlying debt secured by the mortgage debt.it is axiomatic that any attempt to assign the mortgage without transfer of the debt will not pass the mortgagee interest to the assignee.id.citations and alterations omitted.the parties also assumed that the uniform commercial code ucc applied to the note.see id.at.applying illinois law and the ucc,the bap held that,because the bank failed to demonstrate that it had actual possession of the note,it could not establish that it was a holder of the note,or a person entitled to enforce the note id.at footnote reference and internal quotation marks omitted.
in re veal is distinguishable from the present appeal because arizona law,not illinois law,governs,and because arizona law does not require possession of the note to effectuate a foreclosure.in hogan washington mutual bank,en banc,as amended,the arizona supreme court recently considered whether a trustee may foreclose on a deed of trust without the beneficiary first having to show ownership of the note that the deed secures the arizona supreme court observed that w hen parties execute a deed of trust and the debtor thereafter defaults,empowers the trustee to sell the real property securing the underlying note through a sale id.at.the arizona supreme court opined that there was no statutory requirement that before a trustee may exercise that power of sale,the beneficiary must show possession of,or otherwise document its right to enforce,the underlying note id.at.the arizona supreme court concluded that arizona foreclosure statutes do not require the beneficiary to prove its authority or show the note before the trustee may commence a nonjudicial foreclosure.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we are bound by this interpretation of arizona law by the state highest court.see kekauoha alisa ameriquest mortgage in re kekauoha alisa,cir when interpreting state law,we are bound by the decision of the highest state court citation omitted.
we agree with those courts that have distinguished in re veal as limited to bankruptcy cases involving relief from an automatic stay governed by the ucc rather than by arizona law.as the district court recognized in oraha metrocities mortgage,llc,no.cv phx jat,wl,at,
the veal court,in determining whether entities had standing to obtain relief from a bankruptcy stay to conduct a foreclosure,assumed that the ucc applied to the note on the veal property.in this case,the trustee sale is not governed by the ucc through the note,but is a sale pursuant to the deed of trust.trustee sales under a deed of trust are conducted on a contract theory under the power of sale authority of the trustee.the procedures for foreclosures in arizona are not codified in the ucc,therefore,but in.these deed of trust statutes set forth the only procedure for a valid trustee sale.

we have similarly held that,under arizona law,mers may serve as a beneficiary in foreclosures.in cervantes countrywide home loans,cir,we observed that t he legality of mers role as a beneficiary may be at issue where mers initiates foreclosure in its own name,or where the plaintiffs allege a violation of state recording and foreclosure statutes based on the designation id.at citations omitted.however,in the present case,mers did not initiate foreclosure the trustees initiated foreclosure in the name of the lenders.even if mers were a sham beneficiary,the lenders would still be entitled to repayment of the loans and would be the proper parties to initiate foreclosure after the plaintiffs defaulted on their loans id.further,the notes and deeds are not irreparably split the split only renders the mortgage unenforceable if mers or the trustee,as nominal holders of the deeds,are not agents of the lenders id.citation omitted.thus,the zadroznys,like the plaintiffs in cervantes,have not raised a plausible claim for wrongful foreclosure,and dismissal of their claims premised on mers involvement was completely warranted.id.
relying on a consent order between the treasury department and bank of america,the zadroznys also broach the similar argument that neither bank of new york nor any other related entity provided the zadroznys with a report from an independent consultant confirming that bank of new york had standing to foreclose and enforce the note.
a review of the zadroznys first amended complaint and their opposition to the motion to dismiss reflects that the zadroznys claims were not premised on the consent order.because t he plaintiffs neither pled this theory nor presented it to the district court in opposing dismissal,we may decline to reach it for the first time on appeal.sateriale reynolds tobacco,cir,as amended citation omitted.
in any event,the referenced consent order does not mandate utilization of an independent consultant for all nonjudicial foreclosures.the consent order was the product of an examination by the comptroller of the currency into bank of america real estate mortgage foreclosure practices and identified certain deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in residential mortgage servicing and in the bank initiation and handling of foreclosure proceedings the consent order required bank of america to retain an independent consultant to conduct an independent review of certain residential foreclosure actions regarding individual borrowers with respect to the bank mortgage servicing portfolio the purpose of the review was to ascertain whether the foreclosing party or agent of the party had properly documented ownership of the promissory note and mortgage or deed of trust under relevant state law,or was otherwise a proper party to the action as a result of agency or similar status notably,the consent order specified that n othing in the stipulation and consent or this order,express or implied,shall give to any person or entity,other than the parties hereto,and their successors hereunder,any benefit or any legal or equitable right,remedy or claim under the stipulation and consent or this order.as a result,the zadroznys claims premised on the consent order fail as a matter of law,as they can not establish any legal remedy under the consent order.see in re rigel.sec,cir rule b authorizes courts to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
because the provisions of the deed of trust foreclose the pleading of a plausible show me the note claim by the zadroznys,the district court appropriately dismissed this claim.see ibrahim of homeland,cir a complaint must state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
bank of new york authority to record the notice of substitution of trustee 
the zadroznys next assert that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that because bank of new york was never a beneficiary under the loan,it lacked authority to appoint reconstrust as successor trustee.however,the deed of trust explicitly notified the zadroznys that mers acted solely as a nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns.mers was designated as the nominee beneficiary under the deed of trust on behalf of the lender.mers subsequently assigned and transferred all beneficial interests in the deed of trust to bank of new york.as previously noted,this transfer was consistent with paragraph of the deed of trust,which explicitly provided that the note and its beneficial interests could be sold or transferred without notice to the borrowers.the notice of trustee sale identified recontrust as the current trustee under the deed of trust and bank of new york as the current beneficiary under the deed of trust.considering these facts,the zadroznys failed to allege a plausible claim that bank of new york was prohibited from appointing a successor trustee with the right to initiate a foreclosure.contrary to the zadroznys assertion,arizona law recognizes a successor trustee authority to initiate and conduct a foreclosure sale after the borrowers default,without any requirement that the beneficiary demonstrate possession of the note underlying the deed of trust.see hogan,at.
in sum,the district court properly dismissed the zadroznys claims premised on the unauthorized appointment of a successor trustee the lack of proof of ownership of the note.these claims lacked legal and factual plausibility.see id 
bank of new york security interest in the note 
relying on a report from the permanent editorial board for the ucc peb report,the zadroznys contend that,following securitization,bank of new york lacked a security interest in the note as required by the ucc,because the trustee did not take possession of the note pursuant to the security agreement.
