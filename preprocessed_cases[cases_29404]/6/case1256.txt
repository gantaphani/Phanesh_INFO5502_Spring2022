plaintiff omar dunlap,a former employee of defendant bank of america,bank,seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting the bank motion to strike certain portions of dunlap first amended class action complaint and to enter an order denying the motion to strike.
the essential issue presented is whether the trial court properly struck dunlap claims for statutory penalties on the ground he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in accordance with the labor code private attorneys general act of pag act,et 
dunlap second through fifth causes of action,which are at issue herein,did not seek any penalties which previously were recoverable only by the labor and workforce development agency lwda.the only penalties being sought therein were various statutory penalties,which penalties already were recoverable by employees under the labor code prior to the adoption of the pag act.therefore,dunlap was not required to comply with the pag act administrative prerequisites to filing suit before pursuing statutory penalties in said causes of action.
accordingly,the trial court erred in granting the motion to strike.we grant the relief requested.
factual and procedural background 
on march,dunlap filed the operative first amended proposed class action complaint individually and on behalf of current and former bank employees as well as the general public.the complaint,which seeks damages as well as statutory penalties for various alleged labor code violations,pleads the following causes of action violation of sections and overtime compensation violation of section,subdivision a requirements violation of sections and immediate payment of wages upon discharge,layoff or resignation violation of section duty to pay wages semimonthly violation of sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a mandated meal or rest periods conversion and theft of labor and violation of business and professions code section unlawful business acts and practices.
by way of relief,dunlap sought,inter alia,damages,statutory penalties pursuant to various labor code sections,prejudgment interest,costs and attorney fees.dunlap also requested the matter be certified as a class action 
bank filed a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint as irrelevant,false improper code civ,et on the ground dunlap had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his claims for statutory penalties pursuant to the pag act et as amended in august.the motion to strike was directed at specific language in the complaint relating to dunlap claims for statutory penalties.
bank contended the trial court lacked jurisdiction over dunlap claims for labor code penalties in counts two through five because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies the pag act amendments which took effect in august require that all claims for statutory penalties be administratively exhausted before a civil suit may be filed and the exhaustion requirement applies to the labor code penalties sought in dunlap complaint.
in opposition,dunlap argued the exhaustion requirements of the pag act do not apply to lawsuits brought directly under section,extant since.the pag act,at section,enumerates the labor code sections which are subject to the exhaustion requirement and section is absent from that list.had the legislature intended for the pag act to apply to actions brought pursuant to section,it would have included section among the statutes set forth in section.
in reply,bank asserted dunlap had a right of private action under section which pertains only to this article,sections to,but prior to seeking statutory penalties for substantive violations under that article,a plaintiff must follow the administrative exhaustion procedures outlined in section.
on june,the matter was heard and the trial court granted the motion to strike.the trial court concurred in the bank argument that dunlap interpretation would make section effectively meaningless.no private litigant would ever bring an action under section.they would always explain section was the tool they were using.
the formal order struck various penalty allegations from the complaint upon the grounds that dunlap failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his claims for statutory penalties under the california labor code as required by the pag act.
on august,dunlap filed the instant petition for writ of mandate,seeking the issuance of a writ directing the trial court to vacate its order granting the motion to strike and to enter a new order denying the motion.this court issued an order to show cause.
contentions 
dunlap contends the pag act exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement does not apply to a plaintiff who is not bringing an action or seeking penalties under the pag act.he contends he is entitled to sue directly under section for the broad relief that he is seeking on behalf of himself and others,and that such action is not subject to the pag act exhaustion requirement.
discussion 
overview of section et.
labor code division,part,chapter,article hereafter article,consisting of sections through,pertains to payment of wages.article was enacted in stats,ch,has been amended repeatedly over the years and remains extant.
the relevant substantive provisions of article,as pled in the complaint,are section,subdivision a second cause of action,sections,and third cause of action,section fourth cause of action and section,subdivision a fifth cause of action.
section,subdivision a,imposes various requirements with respect to wages,hours,deductions and the like.section,at subdivision e,authorizes an aggregate penalty not exceeding for violation of subdivision a of said statute.
sections and,respectively,require immediate payment of wages upon discharge or resignation.if an employer willfully fails to pay wages in accordance with sections or,section imposes the following penalty the wages of the employee shall continue from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days.
section provides that with certain exceptions,a ll wages are due and payable twice during each calendar month 
section,subdivision a,prohibits an employer from requiring an employee to work during any mandated meal or rest period.if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal period or rest period in accordance with an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided,subd.b.
with respect to enforcement of article,the statutory scheme provides at section the division of labor law enforcement shall inquire diligently for any violations of this article,and,in cases which it deems proper,shall institute the actions for the penalties provided for in this article and shall enforce this article.
section,upon which dunlap relies,addresses the authority of the district attorney as well as the wage claimant to enforce article.section provides nothing in this article shall limit the authority of the district attorney of any county or prosecuting attorney of any city to prosecute actions,either civil or criminal,for violations of this article or to enforce the provisions thereof independently and without specific direction of the division.nothing in this article shall limit the right of any wage claimant to sue directly or through an assignee for any wages or penalty due him under this article.italics added.thus,section empowered a wage claimant to sue directly to recover any wages or penalties personally due the employee under article.
the issue before us is the relationship of various provisions in article,section et,to the recently adopted pag act,section et.we now turn to this latest enactment.
the pag act created an alternative private attorney general system for labor law enforcement.
as explained below,the pag act was adopted to empower aggrieved employees,acting as private attorneys general,to seek civil penalties for labor code violations,penalties which previously could be assessed only by state agencies 
the pag act does not purport to be the exclusive remedy for addressing labor code violations.section states in pertinent part at subdivision g nothing in this part,the pag act shall operate to limit an employee right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law,either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.italics added.
a.the pag act was adopted to augment the enforcement abilities of the labor commissioner with a private attorney general system for labor law enforcement.
the pag act provides in relevant part at section,subdivision a notwithstanding any other provision of law,any provision of this code that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the lwda or any of its departments,divisions,commissions,boards,agencies,or employees,for a violation of this code,may,as an alternative,be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the procedures specified in section.italics added.
thus,the pag act empowers or deputizes an aggrieved employee to sue for civil penalties on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees,subd.a,as an alternative to enforcement by the lwda.
the legislature declared its intent as follows c staffing levels for state labor law enforcement agencies have,in general,declined over the last decade and are likely to fail to keep up with the growth of the labor market in the future.d it is therefore in the public interest to provide that civil penalties for violations of the labor code may also be assessed and collected by aggrieved employees acting as private attorneys general,while also ensuring that state labor law enforcement agencies enforcement actions have primacy over any private enforcement efforts undertaken pursuant to this act.stats,ch,italics added.
the final bill analysis for the legislation states this bill allows employees to sue their employers for civil penalties for employment law violations.this bill is intended to augment the enforcement abilities of the labor commissioner by creating an alternative private attorney general system for labor law enforcement.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added.

due to perceived abuses,the pag act was amended in to require exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to commencement of a civil action.
in august,senate bill was adopted as an urgency measure to amend the pag act.the amendment added a new section to the pag act,section,requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to commencement of a civil action 
the bill amendment imposed specified procedural and administrative requirements that must be met prior to bringing a private action to recover civil penalties for labor code violations.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.the senate floor analysis stated sb improves sb by allowing the labor agency to act first on more serious violations such as wage and hour violations and give employers an opportunity to cure less serious violations.the bill protects businesses from shakedown lawsuits,yet ensures that labor laws protecting california working men and women are through the labor agency or through the courts.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
section,subdivision a administrative procedures apply to actions to recover civil penalties for alleged violations of numerous labor code provisions specifically identified in section,subd.a.in particular,the provisions of subdivision a of section shall apply to any alleged violation of the following provisions section,subdivision a of section,section.
not all statutory penalties are civil penalties subject to the exhaustion requirements of the pag act.
as justice perluss cogently explained in caliber bodyworks,superior court th,d caliber,not all statutory penalties are civil penalties subject to the pag act.id.at,d.one must distinguish between a request for statutory penalties provided by the labor code for employer violations,which were recoverable directly by employees well before the pag act became part of the labor code,and a demand for civil penalties,previously enforceable only by the state labor law enforcement agencies.id.at,d,italics added.
an example of the former is section,which obligates an employer who willfully fails to pay wages due an employee who is discharged or quits to pay the employee,in addition to the unpaid wages,a penalty equal to the employee daily wages for each day,not exceeding days,that the wages are unpaid.caliber,supra,th at,d.
examples of the latter are section,which provides,in addition to any other penalty that may be assessed,an employer that unlawfully withholds wages in violation of certain specified provisions of the labor code is subject to a civil penalty in an enforcement action initiated by the labor commissioner in the sum of per employee for the initial violation and per employee for subsequent or willful violations,and section,which authorizes the labor commissioner to impose a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding days pay as waiting time under the terms of section.caliber,supra,th at,d.
caliber elaborated,an employer is potentially liable for unpaid wages and interest,statutory penalties and civil penalties for many violations of labor code provisions.for example,an employee not fully paid upon discharge or layoff as required by section one of the labor code provisions identified in section may be entitled to recover not only unpaid wages but also the statutory penalty provided by section another provision listed in section and the civil penalty provided by section.an action seeking the first two categories of damages,although requesting statutory penalties,is not subject to the pag act prefiling notice and exhaustion requirements an action seeking the third category of recoverable damages,whether alone or in combination with a prayer for other remedies,is to be subject to the pag act,the employee cause of action must allege a violation of one of the provisions listed in section,subd.a and seek recovery of a civil penalty assessable by the lwda,subds.a f.caliber,supra,th at,d,some italics added.
in other words,t he pag act requirements,including its administrative prerequisites to filing suit in section,subdivision a,are triggered when an aggrieved employee seeks civil penalties for violation of a labor code provision that previously provided for recovery of a civil penalty by the labor commissioner.caliber,supra,th at,d.
the statutory penalties pled in dunlap complaint already were recoverable by an employee prior to the adoption of the pag act and thus are not subject to the act exhaustion requirements.
the bank motion to strike dunlap claims for statutory penalties was directed at the second through fifth cause of action.we address them seriatim.
