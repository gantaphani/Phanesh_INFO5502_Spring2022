does a bank act illegally if when balancing customer accounts,it applies credits for social security benefits and other public benefit payments directly deposited to its customers checking accounts to cover debits for overdrafts and overdraft fees in kruger wells fargo bank cal d,kruger,the california supreme court prohibited a bank from utilizing the banker setoff against public benefits to recover on an account holder delinquent but separate credit card account.in this case,the trial court applied kruger to prohibit the defendant bank of america from collecting for overdrafts and fees by debiting directly deposited social security and other public benefit payments.this application of kruger is an extension of its holding that is unwarranted in light of significant differences between the banker setoff addressed in kruger and the facts of this case.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
background 
representative plaintiff paul miller receives social security disability benefits directly deposited into his bank of america the bank checking account.in january,the bank mistakenly credited to his account.when the bank discovered its error,it reversed or charged back the credit to miller account and he was substantially overdrawn.when miller may social security payment was directly deposited,it was automatically balanced against the larger overdraft to reduce his negative balance.
when miller discovered his account balance was negative,he complained to the bank local branch.in response the bank opened a new account for his social security benefits,while leaving the negative balance in the old account,reversed the debit against his may social security payment,and deposited the resulting balance into the new account.but on two later occasions,the bank again debited miller social security benefits to reduce the negative balance in his old account.each time,after miller complained,the bank reversed the debits and restored the funds to miller account.
miller first amended complaint included causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation,intentional infliction of emotional distress,unlawful levy against social security benefit payments code civ,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act clra,et,the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,and the false advertising act faa bus,et.the claims were based on two alleged misrepresentations by the bank that directly deposited social security benefits would be safe,secure,and instantly available to account holders and that the bank had the right to use social security funds from direct deposit accounts to cover overdrafts and insufficient funds nsf charges.
the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of the bank on the claims for unlawful levy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.but it denied summary judgment on the remaining causes of action,because a trial was necessary to determine whether the bank has a practice of debiting social security and other government benefit direct deposit accounts to collect overdrafts,erroneous credits or other claims or debts it has against the depositor without regard to the source of the funds in the account or the fact that the account is one into which such benefits are directly deposited.the court also found there were material issues of fact regarding whether the bank misrepresented the safety,security and accessibility of direct deposit accounts,and whether its alleged conduct was unfair or fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl.
when it ruled on summary judgment,the court also certified a plaintiff class consisting of all california residents who have,have had or will have,at any time after august,a checking or savings deposit account with bank of america into which payments of social security benefits or other public benefits are or have been directly deposited by the government or its agent.in,the bank had such accounts.each month more than million in government benefits is electronically deposited into class members accounts.between january and may,the bank debited at least in nsf and other overdraft fees from accounts containing social security direct deposits.
miller and four class members gave similar testimony at trial.each had social security or disability payments directly deposited to the bank checking account.like miller,class member barbara washington had other funds credited to her account due to a bank error and the bank froze her account when it discovered and reversed the error,thereby denying her access to her social security benefit payments.kevin scott anderson,lupe linda rios and william hawkridge each testified that their benefit payments were applied to cover overdrafts,nsf fees and service fees such as debit and automatic teller machine atm fees.
eric kingson was called as an expert in social security to testify about the general characteristics of social security and supplemental social security ssi recipients.in california,approximately three million people between the ages of and receive social security or ssi another recipients are years old or older.in the average monthly social security benefit in california was to the maximum ssi benefit was per month.
it is undisputed that the bank covers overdrafts and fees incurred within customers accounts with government benefits funds that are directly deposited.william zuendt,a banker and former president and chief operating officer of wells fargo bank,described standard industry practices.zuendt explained that all banks clear negative checking account balances from incoming deposits to those accounts irrespective of their source,including deposits of government benefits.his uncontradicted testimony explained that it is standard practice in the banking industry to apply incoming deposits against outstanding overdrafts regardless of the source of the funds.
zuendt testified that if state law precluded banks from using incoming deposits of benefit payments to clear negative balances banks would have to impose numerous restrictions on accounts containing government benefits to prevent them from becoming overdrawn.dan carretta,an executive at the bank,described the types of restrictions that would be required.the bank would refuse to honor any checks written against insufficient funds by account holders who directly deposit benefit payments,so there would be a higher incidence of dishonored,or bounced,checks.other measures would include preventing such customers from using atm cards at other banks,placing the longest permissible hold on all deposited checks to minimize the incidence of returned items,and restricting or disallowing their use of debit cards.
the trial court instructed the jury that the bank could not apply benefit funds to overdrafts and nsf fees.jury instruction number stated that governmental benefits,including social security funds,are exempt from collection by the bank for insufficient funds fees,overdrafts and money claims it has against the account holders.this action by the bank is called a.funds from other sources are not exempt under this procedure.
the jury found the bank violated the clra by falsely representing to depositors that it had the right to use directly deposited social security funds to pay overdrafts,insufficient funds fees and money claims it has against class members.based on that violation,the jury awarded the class in compensatory damages for amounts collected as nsf fees,awarded statutory damages of for each class member who suffered substantial economic or emotional damage as a result of the bank conduct and awarded miller in emotional distress damages.on the common law misrepresentation claims,the jury found the bank had made a false representation of an important fact to members of the class,but did not find reliance.it rejected miller clra claim that the bank falsely represent ed that its direct deposit accounts are safe and secure for holding government benefits and that the funds in those accounts are instantly available to the account holder.
while the jury was deliberating,the trial court heard additional evidence on nonjury claims under the ucl,the faa and the clra.the trial court found that the bank violated the clra,the ucl,and the faa.on all counts,the court decision turned on the interpretation that kruger prohibits banks from clearing overdrafts and nsf fees,or recovering any other monetary claims,from directly deposited benefit funds.based on this interpretation,the court concluded the bank violated the clra prohibition against misrepresenting legal rights or remedies,subd.a by asserting in a booklet distributed to account holders that t he law grants us the right of setoff,under certain circumstances,to use funds in your account to pay any debts you owe us.the court also concluded the bank violated the clra prohibition against unconscionable contract terms,subd.a,by attempting to insert that statement into its agreements with class members.
the court identified three distinct violations of the ucl.it concluded the bank violations of common law and the clra were unlawful business practices that its account balancing practices were unfair within the meaning of business and professions code section in light of the policy that governmental benefits are exempt from collection and that it committed a fraudulent practice by stating it had a right of setoff against its customers accounts.the court also determined the bank statement about setoff violated the faa prohibition against untrue or misleading statements.the court rejected the bank affirmative defenses,including its argument that miller claims are preempted by federal law.
the court awarded compensatory damages and restitution of,the amount of nsf fees it determined the bank had unlawfully collected from the class,and awarded miller.it found that any class member whose account was set off or assessed in violation of law has suffered substantial emotional or economic harm under the clra,and was therefore entitled to a statutory damages award of.the court enjoined the bank from making any representation or statement to california customers or potential customers that it has the right to set off or take nsf fees or other money claims it has against customers from directly deposited social security benefits and other public benefits in customer deposit accounts in california and taking any directly deposited social security benefits or other public benefits from customer accounts in california to satisfy nsf fees and other monetary claims it has against customers.
the bank filed a timely appeal.miller from the denial of his claim for prejudgment interest.we issued a writ of supersedeas staying enforcement of the judgment pending appeal,and accepted amicus briefs from a number of interested groups who asked to participate on both sides of the controversy 
discussion 
the variety of statutory and common law offenses embodied in the judgment turn entirely on the court determination that kruger prohibits the bank from clearing overdrafts and debiting nsf fees or other money claims in a deposit account when the credits against those charges are from government benefits directly deposited into that same account.that was the basis for the court instruction number,and the resulting conclusion that the bank misrepresented that it had the right to clear overdrafts and nsf fees from such deposits.this application of kruger is also essential to conclude that the bank violated the clra by attempting to enter into unconscionable contracts,and violated the ucl and the faa by representing that it had the right to apply government benefits to reconcile an account.
miller relies heavily upon the broadly worded holding of kruger that a bank may not exercise its right of setoff against deposits which,derived from unemployment and disability benefits,are protected from the claims of creditors.kruger,supra,cal d at.this phrasing,he asserts,was intended to prohibit a bank setoff in all situations in which it acts as a creditor and seeks to collect exempt funds to satisfy its claims.but the language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case,and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.moon superior court th,d.the fundamental question for us is whether the bank practices are sufficiently like the banker setoff in kruger as to fall within the rule announced in that case.in other words,we must examine whether the bank practices of debiting accounts containing government benefits to cover overdrafts,nsf fees and bank errors are different in ways such that they should not be governed by the common law rule expressed in kruger.
traditionally,the banker setoff is a common law practice derived from general principles of equity.kruger,supra,cal d at.it allows a bank to set off an account holder funds to satisfy an existing mature obligation owing to the bank without resorting to court action.gonsalves bank of america cal d.in kruger,the plaintiff maintained a checking account and a separate credit card account with the defendant bank.the only funds in her checking account came from disability and unemployment benefits.the question addressed was whether the bank,using the banker setoff,could debit those general deposit funds to collect a debt the plaintiff owed on her credit card account.
the supreme court held that it could not.by statute,funds derived from state disability insurance and unemployment compensation are exempt from attachment and execution.kruger,supra,cal d at.while the statutory exemption afforded to public benefit funds does not explicitly apply to the exercise of a banker setoff,as a matter of public policy the court extended those statutory exemptions to prohibit the common law setoff employed by the bank in that case.
the court focused on the desirability of protecting government benefit payments from third party creditors claims although the banker setoff differs from attachment and execution in that it does not require the aid of a state official,there is no relevant difference between the two procedures as to the state objective of protection of unemployment compensation and disability benefits from claims of creditors.the assertion of a banker setoff has exactly the same effect as a third party levy of execution on the deprives the depositor of the income which the state provided him to meet subsistence expenses,compelling the state either to give him additional money or leave him without means of physical survival.kruger,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
this concern,the court noted,had grown particularly pressing with the advent of commerce based increasingly on credit cards.with the growth of credit systems,a bank may gather unto itself the debts incurred by a depositor for past living expenses and satisfy by setoff debts which,in the days before master charge and bank americard,would have been held by many separate merchants and enforceable only through execution.to permit a bank which has thus collected the past obligations of its depositor to satisfy those claims from unemployment insurance deposits would completely defeat the state policy of preserving such deposits for the daily living expenses of the depositor.kruger,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.kruger thus prevented banks from circumventing the statutory exemptions of government benefits from attachment and execution when collecting credit card debts through setoff.
we agree with the trial court that this case implicates to some extent the legislative preference at stake in kruger to safeguard a basic income stream for recipients of public benefits.but allowing a bank to balance overdrafts,collect nsf fees and correct bank errors against deposits to the account in which they were incurred,even deposits of exempt funds,does not enable the bank to collect the customer third party debts to multiple creditors as did the setoff addressed in kruger.kruger,supra,cal d at.we realize that debiting overdrafts and associated bank fees can cause serious financial distress to recipients of public benefits.plaintiffs introduced evidence at trial that the likelihood and gravity of such financial distress may be compounded by the bank practice of paying the largest checks or charges first.because the larger items are more likely to overdraw an account,subsequently processed smaller checks
