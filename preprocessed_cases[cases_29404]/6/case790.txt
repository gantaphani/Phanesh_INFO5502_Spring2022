background 
named plaintiffs lonnie and dawn glover acquired an adjustable rate mortgage for the purchase of their home in the late.in,they refinanced their loan and obtained a mortgage.heartland brokered the transaction and standard federal funded and acquired the mortgage.
as part of the refinancing,heartland brokered a mortgage for the glovers with an above par interest rate and was subsequently paid a yield spread premium ysp by standard federal the payment of this ysp is the focus of the current dispute.
the glovers argue that the payment of the ysp constitutes a fee for the referral of a mortgage negotiated with interest rates that are disadvantageous to borrowers,and that this payment violates the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et.respa was enacted to initiate significant reforms in the real estate settlement process to insure that consumers throughout the nation are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices.a.respa prohibits the payment of some referral fees,stating 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.
a section.subsection c of section then qualifies subsection a by stating 
nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the payment of a fee c by a lender to its duly appointed agent for services actually performed in the making of a loan,or the payment to any person of compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed 
c.at issue in this case is whether payment of a ysp violates respa prohibition against referral fees,or whether a ysp might satisfy respa qualification of payments for goods and facilities actually furnished or services actually performed,which payments are not prohibited.a brief explanation of the industry practice regarding ysps provides helpful insight.
in the arena of retail and wholesale mortgages,banks such as standard federal fund mortgage loans originated by mortgage brokers.mortgage brokers provide origination services and bring a borrower and a lender together to complete a loan.the department of housing and urban development hud estimates that mortgage brokers initiate about half of all home mortgages each year in the united states.these brokers provide various services in processing mortgage loans,such as filling out the application,ordering required reports and documents,counseling the borrower and participating in the loan closing.real estate settlement procedures act respa statement of policy regarding lender payments to mortgage brokers,march,hereinafter hud policy statement i.brokers may also offer goods and facilities such as office space and equipment to carry out functions.id.
brokers are entitled to compensation for their work and borrowers may choose to pay these fees in a variety of ways.the fees may be paid by the borrower,they may be financed by adding the amount of such fees to the principal balance of their loan,or they may be paid indirectly by the borrower by way of a ysp paid by the lender to the broker.the second approach may not be available to all borrowers,however,if their ratio has already reached the maximum permitted by the lender.the payment of a ysp from the lender to the broker permits homebuyers to pay some or all of the settlement costs over the life of the mortgage through a higher interest rate.hud policy statement i,at.
in determining the amount of ysp to pay,wholesale lenders such as standard federal establish a wholesale price for originating loans and communicate this pricing schedule to brokers through daily rate sheets.rate sheets set forth the amount that the wholesale lender will pay brokers for various types of mortgage loans,taking into account a number of variables.these rate sheets discuss loans in terms of above par,at par,and below par.the term par rate refers to the rate offered to the broker at which the lender will fund of the loan with no premiums or discounts to the broker.hud policy statement i,at.if the mortgage carries a higher interest rate,the lender is able to sell it to an investor at a higher price.in turn,the lender pays the broker an amount reflective of this price difference.real estate settlement procedures act statement of policy clarification of statement of policy regarding lender payments to mortgage brokers,and guidance concerning unearned fees under section b,october,hereinafter hud policy statement ii.
regardless of how the broker compensation is handled,all costs are ultimately paid by the borrower,whether through direct fees paid to the broker,through the loan principal or through the interest rate arranged with the lender.so,when a mortgage broker originates a loan above par,the broker receives a ysp payment from the mortgage lender which is based upon the daily rate sheet and the interest rate of each loan offered by the broker to the borrower.hud policy statement i,at.in this way,as earlier indicated,the borrower indirectly finances the amount of that premium through the mortgage lender so as to avoid the necessity of a direct payment to her broker,thereby reducing the amount of expenses required at,or prior to,closing.id.some consumers,like the glovers,allege that this compensation system is illegal under respa because it fosters the payment of prohibited referral fees.others view this practice as an option that fosters homeownership because it reduces the amount of money required from borrowers and.hud policy statement ii,at.in any event,wholesale lenders such as standard federal claim,and apparently stand ready to attempt to prove at trial,that they ultimately receive the same compensation from each loan,whether or not a ysp is paid as part of the transaction.this is because,they argue,the increased amounts received from secondary investors for a higher interest rate loan are,as noted by hud policy statement ii,usually passed along to the broker for services rendered.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class action certification if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.the glovers argue that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court september,order because it was not an order granting or denying class certification.we disagree.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure sets forth the threshold requirements for certification of a class.a class may be certified if 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
in addition,to maintain a class action the court must find that one of the requisites of rule b is present,among them being that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.
on march,the district court held that the glovers met their burden under rule and defined the potential class as all people obtaining a mortgage brokered by heartland and financed by standard federal under circumstances which gave rise to any of the type of incentive payments described in the complaint.on september,pursuant to a request by the glovers to clarify the class,the district court recognized it did not previously define the class as the glovers requested.the district court concluded that a nationwide class was consistent with the common questions of law and fact discussed in the march,order,and certified a nationwide class of all people obtaining a mortgage during the appropriate time period,financed by standard federal bank under circumstances which gave rise to yield spread premiums or service release premiums,and brokered by any mortgage broker pursuant to a correspondent agreement identical to the correspondent agreement between standard federal bank to heartland mortgage appellant addendum at emphasis added.
the district court order at issue does not merely deal with a clarification of the scope and contour of the class as the glovers profess.the september,order opens up the class to individuals working through an entire network of mortgage brokers across the nation beyond the more limited group,outlined in the march,order,of those individuals who obtained a mortgage brokered only by heartland.clearly,as to both these newly defined class members and those described on march,the september order constitutes class certification.the district court labeling the order a clarification does not change this fact.
as we have done on two previous occasions in this case,we find jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f appropriate to review the district court order granting class certification.
standard of review 
we review a district court ruling granting or denying class certification for abuse of discretion.chaffin rheem,cir.
measure of deference provided hud statements of policy 
in march,and again in october,hud issued statements of policy regarding lender payments to mortgage brokers.hud policy statement i responded to a conference report on the departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act,directing hud to clarify its position on lender payments to mortgage brokers in october,hud published policy statement ii in order to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the department position with respect to those lender payments to mortgage brokers characterized as yield spread premiums as a result of questions raised by two recent court decisions,culpepper irwin mortgage and echevarria chicago title and trust,respectively.hud policy statement ii,at.policy statement ii specifically expresses hud disagreement with the judicial interpretation regarding section of respa and the statement of policy as set forth in culpepper.id.at.
whether or not we follow hud policy statements is dispositive in this case because if we endorse the test advocated by hud,the inquiry in each case must necessarily be made on a basis,therefore eliminating class treatment.the glovers argue that the policy statements issued by hud are contrary to respa and are thus entitled to no deference.
hud policy statement i sets forth a test to determine whether a payment from a lender to a mortgage broker is permissible under section of respa 
t he first question is whether goods or facilities were actually furnished or services were actually performed for the compensation paid.the fact that goods or facilities have been actually furnished or that services have been actually performed by the mortgage broker does not by itself make the payment legal.the second question is whether the payments are reasonably related to the value of the goods or facilities that were actually furnished or services that were actually performed.
in applying this test,hud believes that total compensation should be scrutinized to assure that it is reasonably related to goods,facilities,or services furnished or performed to determine whether it is legal under respa.total compensation to a broker includes direct origination and other fees paid by the borrower,indirect fees,including those that are derived from the interest rate paid by the borrower,or a combination of some or all.the department considers that higher interest rates alone can not justify higher total fees to mortgage brokers.all fees will be scrutinized as part of total compensation to determine that total compensation is reasonably related to the goods or facilities actually furnished or services actually performed.hud believes that total compensation should be carefully considered in relation to price structures and practices in similar transactions and in similar markets.
hud policy statement i,at.
hud policy statement ii sets forth,among other things,the following clarification of the hud test contained in policy statement i 
the first part of the hud test 
under the first part of hud test,the total compensation to a mortgage broker,of which a yield spread premium may be a component or the entire amount,must be for goods or facilities provided or services performed.hud position is that in order to discern whether a yield spread premium was for goods,facilities or services under the first part of the hud test,it is necessary to look at each transaction individually,including examining all of the goods or facilities provided or services performed by the broker in the transaction,whether the goods,facilities or services are paid for by the borrower,the lender,or partly by both.
it is hud position that neither section a of respa nor the statement of policy supports the conclusion that a yield spread premium can be presumed to be a referral fee based solely upon the fact that the lender pays the broker a yield spread premium that is based upon a rate sheet,or because the lender does not have specific knowledge of what services the broker has performed.
whether or not a yield spread premium is legal or illegal can not be determined by the use of a rate sheet,but by how hud test applies to the transaction involved.
hud policy statement ii,at.
when reviewing an agency construction of a statute it administers,a court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.defense council,d.the legality of a ysp payment or any other specific type of payment to a mortgage broker is not directly addressed by respa.neither is how one deals with the tension created by the words of sections a and c.thus,the intent of congress on this issue is not expressly set forth in the statute.therefore,under chevron,we must determine whether hud analysis as set forth in its regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.id.at.agency regulations promulgated under express congressional authority are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.in the instant case,it appears congress did intend to delegate authority to hud by expressly authorizing hud to prescribe such rules and regulations,to make such interpretations,and to grant such reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions,as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of respa.a.hud promulgated rules under respa at et,subject to.because these rules were promulgated under the express authority of congress and adjudicated with apparent congressional intent to carry the force of law,they are accorded chevron deference.united states mead,d.however,these regulations are not directly at issue today,as the language of the section a regulation issued by hud simply mirrors that of the statute 
we are called upon today to review hud two statements of policy,which interpret hud own regulations promulgated under respa and which set forth the test,to determine whether,or under what circumstance,a payment from a lender to a mortgage broker is permissible under section of respa.i nterpretations contained in policy statements which lack the force of not warrant deference.christensen harris county,d citing eeoc arabian american oil,d measuring deference given an eeoc policy statement interpreting a statute on skidmore swift.standards and not chevron standards.
in this case,however,we have a duly promulgated regulation,which has the force of law under chevron,but which for our purposes continues the statutory ambiguity.it remains unstated and unclear under the regulation,as under the statute,whether payment of a ysp to a mortgage broker does,or must,in whole or in part,constitute an unearned fee.thus we are not dealing with mead,and its corresponding line of cases,which address the issue of deference due regulations or other congressionally authorized interpretations of a guiding statute.see mead,d chevron,at.skidmore swift.giving lesser agency rulings,statements,interpretations and opinions concerning statutory meaning deference only proportional to their power to persuade given the agency specialized experience,investigations and available information.
we look,instead,to bowles seminole rock sand and its progeny for guidance in determining what deference is due an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.see christensen,at.giving deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation only if the language of the regulation is ambiguous auer robbins,d giving controlling deference to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation bowles seminole rock sand.since this involves an interpretation of an administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt t he ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation,which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.referring to this line of cases,we believe that hud policy statements interpreting its own ambiguous regulation are controlling authority unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or the purpose of respa.christensen,at.construing auer robbins,at.
however,if christensen does not contemplate situations,as here,where the agency regulation does nothing more than mirror the ambiguous language of the statute,our decision to give deference to hud policy statements remains steadfast.see cunningham scibana,cir holding that christensen does not apply if there is no ambiguous interpretive language in the regulation,that is if the agency simply repeated the statutory language in the regulation and left its interpretation of the statutory language to a program or policy statement,skidmore principles apply.hud policy statements in this instance pack sufficient power to persuade given hud specialized mission,experience and broad investigation into the consumer lending market.skidmore,at.
in sum then,applying either christensen or skidmore,we find that the policy statements issued by hud reflect a reasoned view of a responsible agency which is consistent with the statute and the regulation and which constitutes a body of experience and informed judgment that this court may look to as determinative authority.and,we do so.
d.the policy statements 
the glovers reject hud analysis.in support of the district court decision,the glovers argue that under the plain language of respa,the first inquiry is always whether the ysp premium is payment for a prohibited referral rather than for facilities,goods and services.if the ysp is really a referral fee,the payment violates respa regardless of the fact that the broker may actually perform services.thus,the first inquiry,says the glovers,focuses not on whether facilities,goods and services were provided,but on what the payment is for.
the glovers further argue that evidence of the nature,value and reasonableness of facilities,goods and services provided in a particular transaction is essentially irrelevant in this first inquiry.they assert that because the total dollar amount of a ysp paid to a broker depends solely on the rate of interest brokered for the borrower,and because the payment of these premiums by standard federal is based upon a course of business guided by identical correspondent agreements,there is no need for an individualized inquiry.class certification is appropriate,they say,because this evidence establishes that the ysp premium is payment for a referral,thus raising at least a presumption of liability.these are the questions of fact that preponderate,they contend.the glovers allege that standard federal practice focuses on a systematic marketing program of paying repeated fees and bonuses based only on the value and frequency of referrals without knowledge of the quantity or quality of services provided by each mortgage broker 
the eleventh circuit has arguably endorsed at least part of this line of reasoning in its recent decision in culpepper irwin mortgage,cir,cert.denied,d.in culpepper,a panel of the circuit affirmed class certification in a similar case where mortgagors brought a class action against a mortgage lender,arguing that the lender payment of ysps to a mortgage broker violated the provision of respa.id the court rejected the lender contrary argument,stating i f the lender has read the hud statement correctly hud has now decided that c deems some such referral fees is,referral fees that are paid by lenders and that would be reasonable service fees,if that what they were.id.at.the eleventh circuit interpreted hud policy statement i,an interpretation now repudiated by hud,see hud policy statement ii,and ultimately found that the first step in the test for liability under is not only whether the broker performed some of the services described in the hud statement,but also whether the yield spread premium is payment for those services rather than for a referral.culpepper,at.the court in culpepper reasoned that if the purpose of the lender payment is only for referrals and not for services,you do not get to step two of hud test.id.under this interpretation,focusing only on a purported search for the lender intent in each case,culpepper found that similar questions of fact predominate,justifying class treatment 
both the eleventh circuit and the glovers profess that they adopt hud statement that ysps are not per se illegal.hud policy statement i at,culpepper,at,appellees brief at.in doing so,they advance a few factual scenarios under which they claim a ysp payment might pass muster under respa.given the gloss the glovers would place on respa,we are not persuaded that they describe realistic examples.in the context of the residential loan industry as it exists today,we have difficulty seeing many,if any,factual situations in which a ysp could lawfully coexist with their contentions.using the glovers interpretation of the statute,inventive minds making clever arguments can turn virtually any payment flowing from a lender to a broker,in connection with the placement of a mortgage loan,into a purported payment for the unlawful referral of business.however,section c clashes with this result.it clearly states that reasonable payments for goods,facilities or services actually furnished are not prohibited by respa,even when done in connection with the referral of a particular loan to a particular lender.the glovers approach tends to turn the interrelated sections upside down,putting total emphasis on the prohibitory language of section a and no emphasis on the permissive language of section c.
hud policy statements,on the other hand,reconcile both facets of respa policy.hud requires a determination of whether goods or facilities were actually furnished or services were actually performed and whether the amounts of the payments are reasonably related to the value of these goods,facilities,or services.hud policy statement i,at hud policy statement ii,at.we agree with this approach because we believe that one can not take a tightly focused look at but one side of the equation.a lender reliance on a rate sheet to un
