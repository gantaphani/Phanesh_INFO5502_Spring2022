the primary issue presented in this appeal is whether a federally chartered credit union is subject to punitive damages.appellants,tucoemas federal credit union credit union and linda reese,the credit union chief executive officer,contend the punitive damages awarded in favor of respondent,kimberly mcgee,on her employment discrimination claims must be reversed on the ground of sovereign immunity.according to appellants,the credit union,as a federal instrumentality,can not be held liable for punitive damages absent an express waiver of its immunity from those claims.appellants further argue that,in any event,the trial court should have reduced the punitive damage award when it reduced the compensatory damage award.
as discussed below,in the absence of certain narrow exceptions,federal instrumentalities that are subject to a sue and be sued clause are presumed to have fully waived immunity.these exceptions were not established by appellants.accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded that appellants were not immune from the punitive damage award.further,despite the reduction in compensatory damages,there remains a reasonable relationship between the compensatory and the punitive damages.therefore,the judgment will be affirmed.

the credit union is not immune from punitive damages.
the united states government is immune from civil penalties absent an express and unequivocal waiver of that immunity.missouri pac.ault.however,the government does not become the conduit of its immunity in suits against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its work.keifer keifer.
congress has waived the sovereign immunity of certain federal government agencies and instrumentalities from the time of their inception by including a sue and be sued clause in the enabling legislation.loeffler frank,d.unlike waivers given by the federal government itself,such a sue and be sued waiver is to be given a is to say,postal service flamingo industries usa,d notwithstanding the general rule that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be read narrowly in favor of the sovereign.fdic meyer,d.

unlike certain other federal entities,such as production credit associations,federal credit unions have not been legislatively declared to be federal instrumentalities.nevertheless,while not federal agencies,federal credit unions have been judicially found to be,as a general matter,federal instrumentalities,lesser in scope and in responsibility than actual government agencies.ti federal credit union delbonis cir.
for purposes of this opinion,we will assume that the credit union is a federal instrumentality however,contrary to appellants position,this federal instrumentality status does not in and of itself provide the credit union with immunity from punitive damages.an entity is not entitled to the same immunities as the united states simply by virtue of its federal instrumentality status.arkansas farm credit servs.of central,d.rather,as a federal entity that congress has decreed can sue or be sued,a federal credit union is presumed to have fully waived immunity unless it can explain why it is immune under the test set forth above.fdic meyer,supra,at.
in asserting their immunity,appellants rely on a line of cases that began with the production credit association decision of matter of sparkman cir.there,a majority held that,as a legislatively declared instrumentality of the united states,a production credit association was not subject to liability for punitive damages absent an express waiver of such immunity.the sparkman majority concluded that,while the sue and be sued clause in the enabling legislation for production credit associations waives sovereign immunity from ordinary lawsuits,it does not subject production credit associations to liability for punitive damages.id.at.however,one judge disagreed concluding that,in light of the supreme court pronouncement that the sue and be sued waiver is to be liberally construed,no limitation of this waiver to actual damag
