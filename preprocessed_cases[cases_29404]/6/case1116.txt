in this case,barron bancshares,barron bancshares,and mssrs.oestreicher,masterson,teigen,martinsen,and zietlow investors collectively,barron and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic appeal from the decision of the united states court of federal claims i granting partial summary judgment in favor of the united states and ii granting the united states motion to dismiss counts one through eight and eleven of barron first amended complaint and count three of the fdic complaint.barron bancshares,united states.the court determined that the capital credit and goodwill provisions in barron contract with the united states were not contractual obligations,but merely statements of regulatory accounting principles.id.at.the court further determined that the united states was not liable for its breach of the forbearance provision of the contract by reason of the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of and firrea,and its implementing regulations.id.at.the court concluded that although the united states breached the forbearance provision of the contract,that breach was not the cause of the seizure of monycor,the thrift institution acquired by barron pursuant to its contract with the united states.id.
we conclude that the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of barron contract with the united states were contractual obligations,and that the united states breached those obligations.in addition,while we agree with the court of federal claims that the united states breached the contract forbearance provision,we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether that breach caused the seizure of monycor.the decision of the court of federal claims is therefore and.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the circumstances surrounding the thrift crisis of the early and the resulting enactment of firrea have been extensively set forth in opinions of the supreme court,this court,and the court of federal claims.see united states winstar,d winstar iv winstar united states,en banc winstar iii winstar united states.winstar ii winstar united states,winstar i.a brief summary of these circumstances may provide context for this particular dispute.
rising interest rates during the led to the insolvency of many savings and loan institutions thrifts.to attract new deposits,thrifts had to offer interest rates that far exceeded the income the thrifts were receiving from mortgage agreements previously entered into at lower rates.castle united states.between and,more than four hundred thrifts declared bankruptcy.this threatened to exhaust the insurance fund of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic,the agency charged with regulating the federally insured thrift industry and insuring consumer deposits in thrifts.winstar iv,at.
to deal with this crisis,the federal home loan bank board fhlbb or bank board,the agency authorized to charter and regulate federal savings and loan associations,encouraged healthy thrifts and outside investors to purchase insolvent thrifts in supervisory mergers.id.at.in such a transaction,the fhlbb would permit the acquiring investors to allocate any shortfall between liabilities and real assets to an intangible asset known as supervisory goodwill.see landmark land,fdic.the bank board would then allow the new or restructured thrift to count supervisory goodwill toward its reserve capital requirements,and to amortize the goodwill over a long period of time.winstar iv,at.in addition,the fslic offered cash contributions in the form of capital credits that acquiring thrifts were permitted to count as permanent credits to regulatory capital.id.at.finally,banking authorities granted regulatory forbearances whereby they would forbear from enforcing a thrift regulatory capital requirements for a specified period of time.see,cal.fed.bank,fsb united states,cal fed the brentwood and family transactions.
despite these various measures,the crisis in the savings and loan industry continued.as a result,on august,congress enacted firrea,in order to prevent the collapse of the industry,to attack the causes of the crisis,and to restore public confidence.winstar iv,at.firrea abolished the fhlbb and the fslic,transferred thrift insurance activities to the fdic,established the office of thrift supervision ots as the new thrift regulatory agency,created the resolution trust corporation rtc to liquidate or otherwise dispose of certain closed thrifts and their assets,and made substantial changes in the regulation of the savings and loan industry.id.in particular,firrea mandated a minimum capital requirement for thrifts and prohibited the use of supervisory goodwill.in its wake,many thrifts rapidly fell out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements and were seized by regulators.id.at.
barron county federal savings loan barron county,an ailing thrift located in barron,wisconsin,reported insolvency on may.barron bancshares.at.in response,the chicago office of the fhlbb decided to recapitalize barron county by converting it from a mutual association to a stock association and by selling its stock.id.at.after soliciting bids,the bank board selected the investors to acquire the stock of the reformed thrift,renamed monycor.id.at.the transaction was recorded in five documents three bank board resolutions,an assistance agreement,and a forbearance letter.id.
in bank board resolution,and,the fhlbb authorized the conversion of the thrift,the purchase of stock by the investors,the execution of the assistance agreement,and the issuance of the forbearance letter.id.resolution contained the various accounting principles applicable to the recapitalized thrift,including the capital credit and supervisory goodwill provisions at issue in this case.id.it directed the thrift to use the accounting method to record the value of the acquisition on its books.id.under that method,the thrift assets were to be marked to market,or valued as of the date of the transaction.id.application of this accounting method resulted in an excess of liabilities over assets,creating in supervisory goodwill that monycor was to record as an intangible asset.id.of this sum,constituted unallocated goodwill that monycor could count toward its regulatory capital requirements.id.the supervisory goodwill provision contained in the resolution provided for any intangible assets created by the acquisition to be amortized by the method over a period not to exceed years.id.resolution further established that the investors were entitled to record a capital credit equal to the ultimate contribution by the fslic.id.at.
pursuant to section a of the assistance agreement,the fslic contributed cash to monycor to assist the investors in making it a viable institution.id.the investors were to contribute million,see,while the fslic was to contribute million,subject to adjustment based on the initial audit mandated by section of the agreement.assistance agreement a.the fslic ultimately contributed approximately million to monycor.see barron bancshares.at.
section a iii of the assistance agreement related to capital credit it classified cash paid to the thrift by the flsic as a cash component of net worth rather than an offsetting deduction to supervisory goodwill.id.at.the assistance agreement also incorporated the accounting principles stated in the three bank board resolutions.id.section of the agreement stated that the regulations applicable to the transaction were those in effect at the time of the transaction,id.at,while section of the agreement set forth an integration clause that incorporated the bank board resolutions and the forbearance letter and excluded from the parties contract all parol agreements and discussions.id.at.
the forbearance letter completed the set of five documents constituting the contract.in it,the united states guaranteed monycor that the assets on its books prior to the acquisition would not be counted against the recapitalized thrift in satisfying its net worth requirements for five years,until december.id.at.the forbearance letter also specified the accounting treatment of losses on assets and operations acquired from monycor predecessor.id.at.
upon completion of the acquisition,the investors became the board of directors of monycor and barron bancshares,monycor holding company,with oestreicher serving as monycor president.during its operation,monycor adhered to generally accepted accounting principles gaap,which include the or purchase method of accounting set forth in bank board resolution.monycor never recorded a capital credit during its existence,nor did it amortize its goodwill in accordance with the bank board resolutions.id.at.rather,monycor opted for an accelerated schedule in accordance with gaap.id.
in december of,the ots informed monycor that it had failed firrea capital requirements shortly thereafter,in january of,the ots announced in thrift bulletin that firrea had eliminated previously granted capital and accounting forbearances.any thrift that failed to meet capital requirements as a result was required to submit a capital plan.monycor submitted its capital plan to the ots in march of supplemented in april and may,indicating that it would achieve capital compliance.the ots disapproved the plan on june,because it believed monycor should have more than the minimum amount of capital,and it planned to implement an individual minimum capital requirement for the thrift although the individual requirement was never approved by the ots in washington.in june of,the investors contributed to monycor an additional in an attempt to replenish its regulatory capital.id.at.even so,on july,the ots declared monycor to have substantially insufficient capital.it therefore seized the institution and appointed the rtc as receiver.
the investors and barron bancshares filed suit in the court of federal claims on august.in their action,they alleged that the united states had breached its contract with barron by failing to honor the forbearance letter and thereby placing monycor in receivership.they asserted that they were entitled to damages in the amount of million,representing the value of their investment in monycor.id.
like all cases similarly situated,barron suit was stayed pending the decision of the supreme court in winstar iv.in winstar iv,the court affirmed the decision of this court in winstar iii that the united states is liable to respondents three thrifts for breach of contract.at.the contracts in winstar iv permitted the three failed thrifts in the case to meet regulatory capital requirements by using supervisory goodwill and to amortize this asset over a substantial number of years.fdic united states,quoting landmark,at.
the fdic intervened in this action in march of,after winstar iv was decided,and filed a complaint on behalf of monycor,the seized thrift.in its complaint,the fdic alleged that the provisions of firrea and the ots capital regulations constituted,inter alia,a breach of monycor contract rights.the fdic sought to recover damages as established at trial,compensation for all monies expended and costs incurred,and the value of all benefits conferred on the government.
on february,the fdic moved for partial summary judgment as to liability.thereafter,in september,the government moved to dismiss portions of both barron and the fdic complaints and for partial summary judgment.in due course,barron renewed its previously filed motion for partial summary judgment as to liability,while the government filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the claims of the fdic barron bancshares.at.
on august,the court of federal claims granted partial summary judgment in favor of the united states and dismissed portions of both complaints.the court ruled that the capital credit provision in the assistance agreement had the effect that,for regulatory purposes,cash paid to monycor by the fslic would be taken into account as a cash component of net worth rather than being treated as an offsetting deduction to supervisory goodwill it was not a contractual undertaking binding upon the united states,but only a statement of regulatory policy.id.at.the court made a similar ruling with respect to the supervisory goodwill provision contained in bank board resolution that was incorporated into the assistance agreement.that provision allowed monycor to amortize supervisory goodwill under the accounting method over a period.id.the court determined that the fslic assistance payments and the forbearance letter supervisory forbearance constituted the limit of the government contractual undertaking.id.at.
the court of federal claims concluded that the united states had committed a breach of contract by failing to honor the forbearance promised in the forbearance letter.id.at.it determined,however,that monycor failure to meet its capital requirements,and not the government breach,had caused the seizure of the thrift.id.at see also barron bancshares,united states,c,order denying reconsideration.in reaching its conclusion,the court relied upon reports by the fdic that monycor was experiencing a myriad of problems unrelated to losses on assets.barron bancshares.at quoting an fdic report of examination.thus,according to the court,the evidence suggested that the problems at monycor were of investor plaintiffs own making.id.at.consequently,the court granted the government motion for partial summary judgment and to dismiss portions of barron and the fdic complaints.id.at.thereafter,the court entered judgment in accordance with court of federal claims rule b id.at.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.cl.c castle,at.in the setting of a motion for summary judgment,all justifiable factual inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmovant.southfork,united states,winstar iii,at citing anderson liberty lobby,d.we review a grant of summary judgment by the court of federal claims de novo to determine whether the summary judgment standard has been correctly applied.castle,at.whether a contract exists is a mixed question of law and fact.cienega gardens united states.contract interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.id.citing winstar iii,at.we generally review de novo the trial court legal conclusions.see,am.fed of gov t employees united states.before turning to the main issue in this case,we address two preliminary matters.
the first question is whether the fdic claim is barred by the statute of limitations.pursuant to,any claim over which the court of federal claims has jurisdiction is barred unless a complaint with respect to the claim is filed in the court within six years after such claim first accrues.the fdic moved to intervene in this case on march.this was more than six years after i the august,passage of firrea,ii the december,issuance of firrea implementing regulations,and iii the august,filing of barron suit.the government moved to dismiss the fdic suit on the ground that it was untimely.
in an order dated june,the court of federal claims denied the government motion.barron bancshares,united states,c.june,order denying dismissal of fdic claims.the court stated that u nder even the most generous calculation of the claims accrual date the fdic complaint,without more,is out of time,slip op.at citing ariadne fin.servs.united states.the court nevertheless allowed the fdic action to proceed based upon its rule c.that rule,titled relation back of amendments,provides that a n amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the claim arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth in the original pleading fed.cl.c.the court of federal claims pointed out that barron first amended complaint,filed on july,set forth all the operative facts from which the fdic claims arise,including the underlying contract documents,the reliance on forbearances,the passage of firrea,and firrea subsequent impact on the bank.order denying dismissal of fdic claims,slip op.at.the court also pointed out that a notice of related case had been filed on august,identifying the suit as a case,and that the its predecessor,the actively participated in the suit as early as.id.finally,the court noted,the fdic acts here as receiver for the failed thrift,a role coincident with plaintiffs pursuit of the failed thrift claims.id.in the court view,these facts,taken as a whole,placed the case within the purview of snoqualmie tribe united states.
in snoqualmie tribe,the court of claims addressed the application of rule c of the former indian claims commission,a rule identical to court of federal claims rule c.the court stated that the inquiry in a determination of whether a claim should relate back will focus on the notice given by the general fact situation set forth in the original pleading.id.at.the court went on to conclude that a claim,brought on behalf of the skykomish tribe of indians that technically presented a new cause of action,was not barred by the statute of limitations because it involved the claim of a closely related party,for the snoqualmie and skykomish tribes were culturally intertwined.additionally,the court noted that the claim arose under the same treaty that the snoqualmie tribe had invoked as the basis for its cause of action.id.at.the court ruled that,in view of this virtual identity of tribal interests,the claim of the skykomish tribe was sufficiently closely related to warrant the conclusion that the government received adequate notice of the possibility that it might have to defend against a broader claim.id.in this case,the court of federal claims reasoned that,as in snoqualmie tribe,it was faced with claims that arise out of the same transaction presented in plaintiffs suit and that present the interests of a related party whose subsequent appearance here as a litigant the government clearly could have anticipated on the basis of the facts that plaintiffs initially had put into issue.order denying dismissal of fdic claims,slip op.at.
the court of federal claims ruling on the statute of limitations issue presents us with a denial of the government motion to dismiss,a matter of law we review de novo because the facts themselves are not in dispute.see banks united states.we see no error in the court of federal claims treatment of the statute of limitations issue and have nothing to add to it.we agree with the court that the fdic complaint sufficiently relates back to barron original complaint to overcome the government challenge based upon the statute of limitations 
the second preliminary matter we must address is the government contention that the fdic does not possess a claim thatit can assert against the united states.the gist of the argument is that the fdic can not maintain the claims it is asserting on behalf of monycor,the failed thrift,because the rtc,as receiver for monycor,sold all of monycor legal claims to the rtc in its corporate capacity,an instrumentality of the united states.this sale,the government asserts,had the effect of extinguishing the claims at issue in this case.the reasoning is that because the fdic,in its corporate capacity as successor to the rtc,is an instrumentality of the united states,the fdic is actually bringing claims owned by the government against the government,thus presenting a classic nonjusticiable intragovernmental dispute.see,anderson,at finding on the facts that the fdic presence in this matter represents no more than an intergovernmental sic dispute which does not rise to the requisite level of a constitutional case or controversy.hence,according to the government,the claim must be deemed extinguished.
the pertinent facts are these in march of,the rtc was appointed receiver for monycor.on the day it was appointed receiver,it transferred various monycor assets,including the claims of the fdic at issue in this case,to.in exchange for those assets,agreed to pay the net proceeds of any recovery on the assets to the monycor receivership estate 
the rtc ceased to exist on december.see admiral,at.pursuant to m,upon the sunset of the rtc,all assets and liabilities of the corporation rtc were transferred to the fslic resolution fund frf this meant that when the rtc ceased to exist,all its assets and liabilities were transferred to the fdic in its capacity as manager of the frf id.at.the fdic thus became the owner of the monycor claims that are at issue in this case.it also became the owner of the assets of the fslic that the rtc had taken over and became subject to the obligations of the fslic that the rtc had assumed as manager of,the fdic is subject to the provisions of d,which provides in part as follows 
a in general.with respect to any asset acquired or liability assumed pursuant to this section,the corporation fdic shall have all of the rights,powers,privileges,and authorities of the fdic as receiver 
c fiduciary responsibility.in exercising any right,power,privilege,or authority described in subparagraph a,the fdic shall continue to be subject to the fiduciary duties and obligations of the fdic as receiver to claimants against the insured depository institution in receivership.
pursuant to a,corporation refers to the fdic.
we agree with the fdic that,as manager of and as to the rtc,it is required to remit any net recovery that it may obtain on monycor claims to the receiver for distribution to monycor creditors.in other words,the fdic is pursuing monycor claims for the benefit of the receivership and the receivership creditors.under these circumstances,the fdic possesses a claim that it can pursue against the united states.
the government argues that the fdic can not rely upon d c as requiring it to assert the claims set forth in its complaint.the government notes that section d c,by its terms,applies to assets acquired by the fdic under section w ith respect to any asset required or liability assumed pursuant to this section.see d,a,c.the government points out that the fdic did not acquire monycor assets pursuant to d any receiver appointed for any insured depository institution in default,including the fdic acting in such capacity,shall be entitled to offer the assets of such depository institutions for sale to the corporation.rather,as seen above,the fdic acquired monycor assets in its capacity as manager of when the rtc was extinguished.we are not persuaded by the government argument.pursuant to b a,the rtc was given the same powers that the fdic now has under.this would have included,of course,the right to pursue claims on behalf of monycor pursuant to section d.in glass united states,rev on other grounds,the court of federal claims ruled that the statutory language all assets and liabilities of the fdic shall be transferred to the fslic resolution fund meant that among the assets transferred was the right to maintain a lawsuit on behalf of a failed thrift for breach of contract arising from firrea and its implementing regulations.the court stated,
the government the statute did not also transfer the status of receiver to the mean,as the fdic points out,that congress chose deliberately to give in all cases fewer rights to collect on its assets than rtc had during its existence.even were the statutory succession not clear,such an interpretation of the statute would be illogical.
glass.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.we agree with the reasoning of the court of federal claims on this point.we turn now to the main issue on appeal.
as noted above,the court of federal claims ruled on summary judgment that the capital credit and supervisory goodwill provisions in the contract documents did not constitute contractual obligations.rather,they simply were statements of regulatory policy.the court also ruled that while the government did breach its contractual forbearance obligation,the thrift failure to meet its capital requirements,and not this breach,resulted in the seizure of monycor.barron bancshares.at,order denying reconsideration.plaintiffs challenge the court rulings on both of these issues,which we address in turn.
capital credits and supervisory goodwill 
the assistance agreement specified that the cash paid to monycor by the fslic shall be credited to monycor net worth account.assistance agreement a iii.this meant that,for capital compliance purposes,the fslic contributions were to be viewed as constituting a cash component of net worth rather than as an offsetting deduction to supervisory goodwill.see barron bancshares.at.supervisory goodwill was to be amortized by the method over a period of up to years,with unamortized supervisory goodwill permitted to be counted towards regulatory capital requirements.bank board resolution,at.although the court of federal claims recognized that these same provisions were part of the winstar contracts,it nevertheless determined that the case before it was in character.barron bancshares.at.according to the court,the assistance payments by the fslic,rather than particular capital credit and supervisory goodwill treatment,were the true focus of the parties agreements and interactions.id.at.the court concluded that the government intended to be contractually bound only with respect to assistance payments and the forbearance,but it found lacking a mutual intent to contract with regard to treatment of goodwill and capital credits.id.at.
in reaching its conclusion,the court of federal claims pointed out that,in contrast to the winstar transactions,the investors made no mention of purchase accounting,capital credits,or goodwill in their bid to acquire barron county,but requested only the supervisory forbearance.id.the court noted that the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of the contract as reflected in bank board resolution were not the subject of precontract negotiations.id.the court further noted that monycor failure either to record a capital credit or to maximize its supervisory goodwill over the permitted period confirmed to the court that those accounting treatments were not part of the parties shared understanding of the government contractual obligations.id.at.the court of federal claims also pointed out that the investors raised no objection,either in their responses to regulators or in their original or amended complaints filed in the court,to firrea abrogation of the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of the contract.id.it was only after the fdic intervention in that the investors raised these issues.id.the court therefore concluded that the investors understood these provisions to be nothing more than statements of accounting principles applicable to the thrift at the time of the contract.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that the decision of the court of federal claims is directly contrary to the supreme court precedent in winstar iv because,as the court of federal claims recognized,the language in the monycor contract is virtually identical to the language in the three contracts at issue in winstar.id.at.relying on winstar iv,plaintiffs argue that the court should have ruled that the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions in this case were contractual obligations binding upon the united states.
plaintiffs point out first that the assistance agreements in all three winstar contracts contained an accounting principles section virtually identical to the one in this case.second,plaintiffs note that the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions in the monycor bank board resolutions are indistinguishable from the same provisions in the bank board resolutions relating to statesman savings holding statesman bank,one of the failed thrifts in winstar.third,all three winstar contracts also included an integration clause,to use the court of federal claims phrase,essentially identical to the one in the monycor assistance agreement.accordingly,plaintiffs contend,the supreme court decision in winstar iv is controlling for this case the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions in the monycor contract constituted contractual obligations to which the united states was bound.
finally,it is asserted that without supervisory goodwill or capital credit,monycor,like the three winstar thrifts,would have been insolvent immediately upon completion of the acquisition.plaintiffs note that monycor audited financial statement demonstrates that as of the date of barron county acquisition and transformation into monycor,the thrift recorded million in intangible assets on its books,including million in supervisory goodwill.at the same time,monycor total stockholders equity was only million.without the ability to count the million in supervisory goodwill or without the capital credit,monycor would have been insolvent by at the close of the transaction.plaintiffs point out that the supreme court found like circumstances compelling evidence of contractual intent.see winstar iv,at.stating that if supervisory goodwill had not been available for meeting regulatory capital requirements,the merged thrift would have been subject to regulatory noncompliance and penalties from the moment of its creation and that it would have been irrational for glendale to stake its very existence upon continuation of current policies without seeking to embody those policies in some sort of contractual commitment.
plaintiffs assert that rather than considering extrinsic evidence to discern the intent of the parties,the court of federal claims first should have examined the contract language to determine its plain meaning.because the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions in the monycor documents are clear and unambiguous,plaintiffs argue,the court erred when it considered extrinsic evidence of the precontract bid and the parties postcontract dealings to determine the parties intent.pointing to the integration clause in the assistance agreement,plaintiffs invoke the parol evidence rule to characterize as inadmissible any evidence introduced to modify,supplement,or interpret the terms of the contract.
the government responds by pointing to what it contends are considerations that distinguish the monycor contract from the statesman bank contract in winstar iv.first,the government notes,the forbearance letter in the statesman bank transaction explicitly recognized a capital credit,while the forbearance letter in the monycor contract mentioned neither supervisory goodwill nor a capital credit.likewise,the bank board resolutions in the statesman bank transaction explicitly acknowledged the capital credit and supervisory goodwill provisions,while in this case,resolution only used the word contracted in reference to assistance payments.the government also points out that the capital maintenance agreement in the statesman bank transaction explained that any determination of required regulatory capital shall include amounts permitted by the fslic in the assistance agreement and in the forbearances issued in connection with the transactions discussed herein.in this case,by contrast,the capital maintenance agreement contained no such explanation.in fact,the government notes,the contract documents in this case state on four separate section e and f of the assistance agreement and in the similarly worded net worth maintenance stipulation executed by barron bancshares and personal net worth maintenance stipulation executed by investors that future capital requirements may change,and that,if they do,monycor is required to meet the greater requirement.
second,the government directs our attention to evidence of the facts and circumstances surrounding the monycor transaction.as the court of federal claims found persuasive,the investors did not include supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions in their bid,in memoranda summarizing their negotiations,or in their discussions or inquiries.moreover,they decided not to record any goodwill on monycor books immediately after the acquisition.rather,they chose to amortize the supervisory goodwill over fifteen years rather than,and they chose not to record a capital credit.in fact,the investors even recognized in their own board minutes that monycor bore the risk of changes in capital regulations.
finally,the government disputes plaintiffs assertion that without the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions,monycor would have been insolvent at the time the transaction closed.the government contends that barron bancshares and the investors admitted that they had the ability and resources to meet the new capital requirements,and furthermore that doing so would have entailed no costs.thus,in contrast to the situation before the supreme court in winstar iv,it was not irrational for the investors to enter into the monycor transaction without contractual commitments with respect to supervisory goodwill and capital credits.
we agree with plaintiffs that the united states was contractually obligated with respect to the regulatory treatment of i the fslic contributions to monycor and ii monycor supervisory goodwill.in the court of federal claims,it was not disputed that a contract existed between barron and the united states.barron bancshares.at.neither was it disputed that the integration clause in the assistance agreement,which expressly incorporated the bank board resolutions and the forbearance letter,was effective id.at the goodwill and capital credit provisions,though incorporated into the contract by the integration clause.we have stated that an integration clause conclusively establishes that the integration is total unless a the document is obviously incomplete or b the merger clause was included as a result of fraud or mistake or any other reason to set aside the contract.rumsfeld freedom,quoting john calamari joseph perillo,the law of contracts a ed.the government has asserted neither incompleteness of the assistance agreement nor fraud nor mistake in the inclusion of the integration clause.we therefore hold that the assistance agreement fully integrates both the bank board resolutions and the forbearance letter into an executed contract.as a result,the united states was contractually obligated in accordance with the terms of the resolutions and the forbearance letter.
it is in this regard that we part company with the court of federal claims.although the court recognized the effectiveness of the integration clause in the assistance agreement,it nevertheless evaluated extrinsic evidence in construing the terms of the contract.this we think was error.it is true,as the court explained,that mutual intent to contract is required to prove an enforceable agreement,and that there must be an offer,an acceptance,consideration,and governmental authority.see cal,at.in this case,however,the court was not faced with the question of whether a contract existed rather,the task before the court was to construe what was conceded to be a fully integrated agreement.
when construing a contract,a court first examines the plain meaning of its express terms.textron def.widnall.the parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law that prohibits the use of external evidence to add to or otherwise modify the terms of a written agreement in instances where the written agreement has been adopted by the parties as an expression of their final understanding.see,david nassif assocs.united states.the rule thus renders inadmissible evidence introduced to modify,supplement,or interpret the terms of an integrated agreement.mcabee,united states.evidence of the parties course of dealing constitutes this kind of parol evidence that is prohibited by the rule.alves united states.if the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous,they must be given their plain evidence is inadmissible to interpret them.mcabee,at.a contract provision is only ambiguous if susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning.edward marden united states.in this case,because the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of the contract are clear and unambiguous,we must construe them according to their plain meaning,without resort to parol evidence.in so doing,based upon the language of the transaction documents,we find the provisions to be contractually binding upon the government.
our conclusion is consistent with the precedent of winstar.in winstar iii,this court,en banc,held that the three plaintiff thrifts,glendale federal bank glendale,statesman savings holding corporation,the statesman group incorporated,and american life and casualty company also statesman bank,and winstar corporation winstar,negotiated contracts with the bank regulatory agencies that allowed them to include supervisory goodwill and capital credits as assets for regulatory capital purposes and to amortize that supervisory goodwill over extended periods of time.at.the court holding as to the contracts that were formed was based upon its examination of the pertinent contract documents.in the case of glendale,the contract documents were a supervisory action agreement,bank board resolution,and an opinion letter from glendale independent accountants.id.at.in the case of statesman bank,the documents were an assistance agreement,bank board resolution,and an opinion from statesman bank independent accountants.id.at.finally,in the case of winstar,the documents were an assistance agreement,a forbearance letter,bank board resolution,and an opinion letter from winstar independent accountants.id.at.in winstar iv,the supreme court affirmed the federal circuit holding with respect to the contracts that were formed between glendale,statesman bank,and winstar,respectively,and the united states.see at.glendale,at.winstar,at.statesman bank.the language of the monycor documents is virtually identical to the language of the documents in the three winstar transactions.
bank board resolution addressed supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions,providing that gaap was to be used except 
as it may be modified by the following procedures,which shall be employed 
a accounting shall be used to reflect the acquisition on the books of monycor 
b the cash contributions by the fslic to monycor,pursuant to the assistance agreement,may be deemed a contribution to net worth and may be booked as a direct credit to monycor net worth 
c the value of any intangible assets resulting from the acquisition shall be amortized by monycor over a period not to exceed years by the straight line method 
the capital credit was also addressed in section a iii of the assistance agreement,titled in part contributions by the fslic all cash contributions made under this a shall be credited to monycor net worth account.thus,pursuant to the bank board resolution,monycor was allowed to treat the cash contributions by the fslic as contributions to net worth and to book them as direct capital credits.monycor also was allowed to amortize the value of any intangible assets resulting from the acquisition,including supervisory goodwill,over a period of up to years by the method.
the goodwill and capital credit provisions in the statesman bank transaction in winstar iii were virtually identical to those before us.thus,bank board resolution approving the statesman bank transaction provided for the use of gaap 
except to the extent of the following departures from generally accepted accounting principles 
a million dollars of the initial contribution by the fslic to statesman bank,and five million dollars of the principal amount of the subordinated debenture issued to the fslic,pursuant to of the assistance agreement,shall be credited to the regulatory capital account of statesman bank and 
b the value of any unidentifiable intangible assets resulting from accounting for the acquisition and the mergers in accordance with the purchase method of accounting may be amortized by statesman bank over a period not in excess of years by the straight line method 
winstar iii,at.at the same time,as in the monycor transaction,the assistance agreement in the statesman bank transaction set forth the capital credit provision million of the contribution made by the fslic shall be credited to statesman bank regulatory capital account and shall constitute regulatory capital winstar iv,at.
section of monycor assistance agreement set forth the applicable accounting principles,stating,
except where such principles gaap conflict with the terms of the agreement,applicable regulations of the bank board or fslic,or any resolution or action of the bank board approving or relating to the acquisitions or to this agreement then this agreement,such regulations,or such resolution or action shall govern if there is a conflict between such regulations and the bank board resolution or action relating to the acquisitions or to this agreement,the bank board resolution or action shall govern.for purposes of this section,the accounting principles and governing regulations shall be those in effect on the effective date,as subsequently clarified or interpreted by the bank board 
thus,the principles set forth in the bank board resolution trump the regulations should a conflict arise.
the assistance agreements in both the winstar and statesman bank transactions contained virtually identical language 
except where such principles gaap conflict with the terms of this agreement,applicable regulations of the bank board or the fslic,or any resolution or action of the bank board approving or adopted concurrently with this agreement,then this agreement,such regulations,or such resolution or action shall govern if there is a conflict between such regulations and the bank board resolution or action,the bank board resolution or action shall govern.for purposes of this section,the governing regulations and the accounting principles shall be those in effect on the effective date or as subsequently clarified by the bank board 
winstar iv,at.winstar transaction,at.the assistance agreement between statesman bank and the fslic included an accounting principles clause virtually identical to winstar.
we are not persuaded by the government arguments regarding the differences between the contract documents in this case and those in the statesman bank transaction.the monycor assistance agreement fully integrated the three bank board resolutions and the forbearance letter into the executed,binding contract.because the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions were explicit in resolution,and the capital credit was recited again in the assistance agreement,they both were terms of the contract.it is thus immaterial that the forbearance letter in the statesman bank transaction explicitly recognized a capital credit,while the forbearance letter in this case did not.neither is it instructive that the capital maintenance agreement in the statesman bank transaction expressly included in the determination of statesman bank required capital any amounts permitted by the fslic in the assistance agreement and any forbearances issued in connection with the transaction,while the capital maintenance agreement in this case did not.it is enough that the provisions were unambiguously set forth in documents that were integrated into the entire agreement between the parties.
finally,as in winstar iii and winstar iv,we are persuaded by evidence to the effect that the recapitalized thrift would have been out of compliance with regulatory capital standards from its inception were it unable to include supervisory goodwill in the relevant calculations.see,winstar iii,at glendale transaction it is not disputed that if supervisory goodwill had not been available for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements,the merged thrift would have been subject to regulatory noncompliance and penalties from the moment of its creation.id.at glendale asserts,and the government does not disagree,that after merging glendale net worth would have been negative million if supervisory goodwill had not been counted as a capital asset.winstar iv,at.stating that it would have been irrational for glendale to enter into a transaction that would have rendered it immediately insolvent by approximately million were it unable to count goodwill as regulatory capital in this case,had monycor not been afforded the benefit of the capital credit or supervisory goodwill provisions,it would have been insolvent by at the moment the transaction closed.barron bancshares.at explaining that monycor had million in unallocated goodwill and sold million in capital stock.this is additional convincing evidence that the parties intended for the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions to be contractual obligations,not merely statements of regulatory accounting principles.
the court of federal claims ruled,however,that the goodwill and capital credit provisions of the monycor contract were not contractual obligations binding upon the united states.the court stated,
in the absence,then,of any indication that investor plaintiffs requested a capital credit and amortizable goodwill,that the parties negotiated for those accounting treatments,that the government evidenced an intent to be contractually bound by those provisions or that plaintiffs acted in a manner consistent with possessing those contract rights,we can not conclude that this case is governed by winstar.
barron bancshares.at footnote omitted.we are unable to agree with the court of federal claims.we have already noted that the parol evidence rule renders inadmissible evidence introduced to modify,supplement,or alter the terms of an integrated agreement.moreover,as discussed in winstar iii,we based our determination as to the terms of the glendale,statesman bank,and winstar contracts upon the contract documents themselves.neither we nor the supreme court relied upon parol evidence in determining the nature of the contracts between the three thrifts and the united states 
significantly,the government has not directed us to a case in which contract provisions set forth in clear and unambiguous language and accompanied by an integration clause were disregarded by reason of the absence of parol evidence reflecting negotiations for those provisions.indeed,we have consistently rejected such an approach.see coast fed.bank united states,where,as here,the provisions of the agreement are phrased in clear and unambiguous language,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning,and we may not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them.freedom,at w hen a document is integrated a party to a written contract can not supplement or interpret that agreement with oral or parol statements that conflict with,supplant,or controvert the language of the written agreement itself.quoting schism united states,en banc landmark,at because the agreement provisions are clear and unambiguous,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning.quoting alaska lumber pulp.madigan,mcabee,at stating that the parol evidence rule prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence to add to or modify the terms of a fully integrated agreement,and that if the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning,and the court may not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them citations omitted city of tacoma united states,outside evidence may not be brought in to create an ambiguity where the language is clear.beta united states,e xtrinsic evidence will not be received to change the terms of a contract that is clear on its face.in short,the contract terms speak for themselves.bound by the four corners of the contract,we hold that the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of the monycor transaction were contractual obligations binding on the united states.
we must now consider the consequences of our holding that supervisory goodwill and capital credits were obligations of the united states under the contract.in winstar iii,we stated,
there can be little question that the application of firrea and the regulations thereunder to deny or restrict plaintiffs contractual rights to use supervisory goodwill with the associated amortization periods,and for statesman capital credits,in partial satisfaction of their capital requirements was a breach of the fslic and the bank board agreements with them.firrea greatly reduced the amount of supervisory goodwill that could be used to meet regulatory capital requirements.see t.the ots by regulation treated capital credits in the same manner as supervisory goodwill,see w,thereby restricting the use of such credits for regulatory capital purposes.
at footnote omitted.in winstar iv,the supreme court stated,we accept the federal circuit conclusion that the government breached the glendale,statesman bank,and winstar contracts when,pursuant to the new regulatory capital requirements imposed by firrea,t,the federal regulatory agencies limited the use of supervisory goodwill and capital credits in calculating respondents net worth.at.winstar teaches that through firrea and its implementing regulations the united states breached its agreement,in contracts like the one at issue in this case,to afford specified regulatory treatment to supervisory goodwill and capital credits.this means that,in this case,firrea and its implementing regulations breached the government agreement with respect to the accounting treatment to be accorded monycor supervisory goodwill and capital credits.
this case presents a wrinkle,however.in the court of federal claims,the government argued that plaintiffs were precluded from recovering damages based upon the doctrine of prior material breach.barron bancshares.at.under that doctrine,when a party to a contract is sued for breach,it may defend on the ground that there existed a legal excuse for its nonperformance at the time of the alleged breach.coll.point boat united states.faced with two parties to a contract,each of whom claims breach by the other,courts will often impose liability on the party that committed the first material breach.allen farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,at see also christopher,united states.according to the restatement,the doctrine of prior material breach is 
based on the principle that where performances are to be exchanged under an exchange of promises,each party is entitled to the assurance that he will not be called upon to perform his remaining duties if there has already been an uncured material failure of performance by the other party.
restatement second of contracts cmt.b see also christopher,at.the government asserted in the court of federal claims that the investors committed a prior material breach of contract by failing to operate monycor in the manner represented in the application they submitted for the thrift acquisition.barron bancshares.at.
in the alternative,the government urged that the investors failure to operate monycor in the manner specified in their application constituted a material misrepresentation.id.if a party manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying,the contract is voidable by the recipient.restatement second of contracts see also brown constructors pena,citing restatement second of contracts cmt.a roseburg lumber madigan.in short,assuming the government was contractually obligated to afford monycor particular accounting treatment for its supervisory goodwill and capital credits and assuming further that obligation was breached,a prior material breach or a material misrepresentation on the part of the investors could excuse the government from its contractual obligations,rendering moot its breach in enacting firrea.
in making these arguments,the government asserted that barron had failed to operate monycor in the manner it had promised.the government pointed to barron bid to acquire barron county and its business plan,which stated it was barron intention to pursue a more conservative style of operation and the traditional lines of business for savings and loan associations,with emphasis on local residential mortgage financing.barron bancshares.at.instead,the government claimed,barron engaged in a practice of reckless lending,marked by its decision to enter the construction loan business,to open an office on the premises of a lumber yard in minnesota owned by one of the investors,and to extend unsecured loans to the lumber yard customers.id.the government also argued that barron did not run monycor in accordance with its business plan,for rather than building net worth,the investors extracted all of monycor income in its initial years of operation.id.in addition,the government cited loans made to business associates of one of the investors,which directly violated the first paragraph of the stipulation concerning directors and officers stipulation the government also noted the decision to make the investors the only members of monycor board of directors board,which violated the stipulation requirement in its second paragraph that no more than one third of the members of the board be salaried officers or employees of monycor.id.finally,the government contended that barron breached section f of the assistance agreement by violating various statutes and regulations regarding lending practices.id.at 
the court of federal claims rejected the government claim of prior material breach or material misrepresentation for two reasons.first,the court concluded that neither a prior material breach nor a material misrepresentation had occurred.the court determined that barron decision to expand the thrift lending program into the minnesota markets did not so violate the broad mission statement of emphasizing local real estate loans so as to constitute fraud or material misrepresentation.id.the court pointed out that business plans must necessarily be flexible and responsive to changes in business climate and that a policy statement such as monycor is simply too general to support a finding that the particular business decision sufficiently departed from the business strategy as to amount to fraud.id.furthermore,the court found lacking any evidence from the government that barron alleged violations were integral to the contract or anything other than regulatory violations for which the government had adequate remedies far less extreme than voiding the contract.id.had the regulatory violations been extreme,the court reasoned,the ots would have seized monycor immediately upon discovering them rather than giving repeated instructions on how to solve them.id.
second,the court determined that even if the government had proven a prior material breach,it had waived the claim.id.at.the court noted that an injured party may either cancel a contract based on a breach,or it may instead continue the contract,in which case the obligations of both parties remain in force id.quoting cities serv.helex,united states.the court concluded that by continuing to make payments pursuant to the assistance agreement which the court had found were at the very heart of the contractual undertaking until its obligations were completed in december of,the government chose to continue to perform under the contract.id.the court further relied upon the fact that the government did not allege that barron had breached the contract until after commencement of the litigation.id.the court ruled that the government continued performance under the contract despite perceived material breaches,thereby failing to reserve any claim of prior breach.id.quoting fin.united states.
on appeal,the government denies that it waived its claim for a prior material breach.in fact,rather than continuing to perform in the face of a breach,the government argues,it actually terminated the contract because of barron breaches by seizing monycor after it failed to cure its deficiencies.in addition,the government contends that any waiver that bars its claim for prior material breach would also bar barron claims to enforce the supervisory goodwill and capital credit provisions of the contract based on barron failure to assert them until long after the passage of firrea,the seizure of monycor,and the commencement of the litigation.in response,barron distinguishes its contractual rights to capital credit and supervisory goodwill treatment from the procedural right of the government to treat the contract as terminated upon establishing a breach by barron.by continuing performance despite claiming that barron had breached the contract,the government waived its right to terminate or cancel the contract,but barron by contrast waived none of its contractual rights to supervisory goodwill and a capital credit,which could only be waived by a written modification of the contract.thus,plaintiffs urge us to affirm the holding of the court that the government waived its defense of prior material breach or material misrepresentation.
we review de novo the court of federal claims decision to deny the government motion for summary judgment based on a prior material breach or material misrepresentation.see,castle,at.we agree with the court that through its continued performance of the contract,the government waived any claim for prior material breach or material misrepresentation giving rise to the right to terminate the contract.we therefore do not reach the merits of the prior material breach or material misrepresentation issue.
we are persuaded by the fact that the government continued its assistance payments to monycor until it completed its obligation to do so in december of.under these circumstances,it can not be disputed that by doing so,the government was performing under the contract.see cities serv.helex,at finding that the plaintiffs had elected to continue the contract because of their failure to take any action to end it,their continued performance,their insistence on continued government performance,and their acceptance of that performance.at these actions indicate that the government continued performance under the contract despite perceived material breaches the government did not reserve any claim of prior breach.
on the one hand,the government claims that investor plaintiffs almost immediately implemented a practice of reckless lending,barron bancshares.at yet on the other,it nevertheless continued to make its assistance payments for the full five years.in order to preserve its claim of a prior material breach giving rise to the right to terminate the contract,the government had to treat barron as if it had breached the contract.see williston on contracts ed explaining that faced with a material breach by the other party to a contract,one has the choice to continue to perform under the contract or to cease to perform,and conduct indicating an intention to continue the contract in effect waiv es the right to assert that the breach discharged any obligation to perform cities serv.helex,at discussing four approaches to the question of whether a party conduct precludes it from asserting prior material breach as a defense first heights bank,fsb united states,explaining the rule set forth in cities serv.helex.it did not do that.we conclude that the government waived its right to treat barron actions as having terminated the contract.
in sum,we reverse the decision of the court of federal claims that supervisory goodwill and capital credit treatment were not contractual obligations binding upon the united states.they were obligations of the government,and they were breached by firrea and its implementing regulations.at the same time,we affirm the decision of the court that by continuing to perform,the government waived any claim with respect to a prior material breach or material misrepresentation by barron.the case is remanded to the court of federal claims for a determination of the damages,if any,to which plaintiffs are entitled by reason of the government breach.
b.the government breach of the forbearance letter 
the court of federal claims did find contractually binding the fslic promise to forbear for a period of five years from holding monycor accountable to regulatory minimum net worth requirements.barron bancshares,fed.cl.at.the investors had requested this forbearance in their bid it had been discussed by the parties and it was specifically enumerated in the forbearance letter.id.the court thus ruled that the government failure to honor this provision constituted a breach of contract.id.
ultimately,however,the court of federal claims determined that the government could not be held liable for breach of the forbearance letter and the seizure of monycor.the government had argued that prior material breach and material misrepresentation on the part of the investors shielded it from liability for breach of the forbearance letter.see id.at.as just seen,the court rejected those arguments.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that it was not the government breach of the forbearance obligation,but monycor failure to meet its capital requirements,that caused the seizure of the thrift.id.at.the court stated that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the thrift was seized as a result of a capital impairment attributable to the government failure to honor the supervisory forbearance.id.at.the court added all indications point to the conclusion that the problems at monycor were of investor plaintiffs own making.id.at.subsequently,in denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,the court stated,
the simple fact,however,is that the bank did not meet its capital requirements,but instead was out of capital compliance with respect to its requirement by approximately million.and it was this capital not the bank poor we identified as the cause of the bank seizure.
order denying reconsideration,slip op.at.the court therefore entered summary judgment in favor of the government on plaintiffs claim for damages arising from the government breach of the forbearance letter.
on appeal,barron contends that summary judgment was inappropriate on the issue of the cause of monycor seizure.relying on other winstar cases,it notes that the court of federal claims has previously found it inappropriate to determine the cause of a thrift seizure at the summary judgment stage.see,hometown,united states,westfed holdings,united states,slattery united states.moreover,according to barron,the trial court ruling is unclear.the summary judgment opinion states that barron evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the thrift was seized as a result of a capital impairment attributable to the government failure to honor the supervisory forbearance but rather that a ll indications point to the conclusion that the problems at monycor were of investor plaintiffs own making.barron bancshares.at.yet,in its subsequent order denying reconsideration,the court identified capital not the bank poor management as the cause of the bank seizure.slip op.at.
the fdic separately urges that evidence submitted before the court of federal claims conflicts with the court decision and that summary judgment was inappropriate.according to the fdic,while the court relied upon critical examination reports issued long after monycor had lost its goodwill and capital credit,a,december financial report,barron bancshares.at,barron showed that prior to firrea,monycor was satisfying all of its capital requirements.the fdic notes that the investors offered a letter dated december,from an ots supervisory agent advising that if the government granted the forbearance in the forbearance letter,monycor would exceed the minimum capital requirements under firrea for the quarter ending september.
the government responds by relying on the arguments it asserted in the trial court with respect to alleged prior material breach or material misrepresentation.thus,it contends that barron failed to adhere to its business plan,the terms of the stipulation,and section f of the assistance agreement.
we agree with the court of federal claims that the government breached its obligations set forth in the forbearance letter.however,we decline to affirm the court ruling granting summary judgment in favor of the government.we think there are genuine issues of material fact surrounding the cause of the seizure of the thrift.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of barron as the nonmoving party,it can not be ruled as a matter of law that governmental breach did not result in monycor seizure.importantly,it is to be remembered that the court of federal claims decided the forbearance issue after holding that the assistance payments and the supervisory forbearance constituted the limit of the government contractual undertaking.id.at.we have held above,however,that the government obligations under the monycor contract also included affording accounting treatment to supervisory goodwill and capital credits.this holding,we think,has the effect of significantly changing the landscape of the case from what it was when the court of federal claims decided the forbearance issue.
the court of federal claims recognized that firrea had the effect,in part,of preventing monycor from counting either its capital credit or its unamortized goodwill toward regulatory capital.id.at.significantly,the banking authorities seized monycor and placed it in
