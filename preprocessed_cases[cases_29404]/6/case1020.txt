this appeal requires us to address,inter alia,whether a argument first made by,kimberly slomcenski upon a motion for reconsideration of the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of citibank,citibank provides a basis for denial of summary judgment in favor of citibank.the district refusing to void a provision limiting disability ltd benefits for conditions related to mental or nervous disorders,which slomcenski had challenged pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et that citibank denial of slomcenski claim for continued ltd benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of citibank on slomcenski erisa claim.in addition,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of citibank on slomcenski claim brought under the americans with disabilities act of ada,et.because we agree with the district court that slomcenski failed to carry her burden of demonstrating any genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of the limiting provision,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on slomcenski erisa claim.the district court disposition of slomcenski ada claim is also affirmed.
background 
slomcenski was hired as an information technology specialist in citibank human resources department in november.in this capacity,she was required to develop,implement,and maintain high quality systems,interface with managers about the department systems needs,and provide training and documentation for system users.this position required an employee with five to ten years of experience and strong analytical,organizational,and communications skills.
as a citibank employee,slomcenski was covered by citibank long term disability plan plan.the human resources policy committee of citibank committee was administrator of the plan.pursuant to the plan,the committee had the authority to interpret and construe the provision s of the plan and to finally decide any matters arising under the plan.exhibits,tab a,exh.at.the plan also specified that the committee might at any time,by written notice,amend or terminate th e plan in whole or in part.id.at.in addition,the plan provided the committee with the authority to delegate some or all of its responsibilities as it deemed appropriate.pursuant to this provision,citibank entered into an administrative services agreement with continental casualty company continental which granted continental sole responsibility for managing the plan and making final disability claim determinations.the agreement with continental remained in effect from january through december.thereafter,citibank entered into a similar administrative services agreement with metropolitan life insurance company metlife.this agreement,which has been in effect since january,provided that metlife had all discretionary authority for approving or denying plan benefits in whole or in part.id.exh.at.
eligibility and coverage provisions 
the plan was issued and made effective on october.employees became eligible to receive benefits under the plan on the first day of their employment at citibank.if an employee became disabled,then he or she was eligible to receive short term disability benefits std for days.if the employee remained disabled after the expiration of the std period,the receipt of ltd benefits was conditioned on an inability to perform each and every material duty pertaining to his or her regular occupation.after consecutive months of disability,inclusive of the initial std period,the employee could continue to receive ltd benefits only if unable to perform every occupation for which he or she was or could become qualified.
as required by erisa,citibank provided its employees with a summary plan description spd,which explained benefits options to employees in a straightforward manner.the spd in place at the time of slomcenski employment explained that a disabled employee could receive days of std benefits,followed by eighteen months of ltd benefits if the employee was medically unable to perform the material and substantial duties of the employee own occupation,followed by continued ltd benefits if the employee was medically unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation for which the employee was or could become reasonably qualified.if the employee was disabled due to a mental or nervous disorder,however,the spd reflected a limit on disability payments to a total of thirty months from the date the mental or nervous disorder began,unless the employee was confined as an inpatient in a hospital or other treatment center.
it is undisputed that this mental or nervous disorder benefits limitation was not included in the plan when it was issued in.because the issue of committee activity was raised for the first time after the summary judgment record had closed,that record contains no direct evidence of committee activity or lack thereof in connection with the adoption of a mental or nervous disorder limitation or its inclusion in the spd.the district court found that citibank first gave its employees notice of the new limitation by way of a summary of material modifications smm issued in.the amendment was included in the spd issued in march of,which was subsequently filed with the department of labor in compliance with.all spd issued from on,including the spd issued to slomcenski,contained the mental or nervous disorder limitations provision.
slomcenski disability 
on july,slomcenski applied for disability benefits.she claimed that she suffered from headaches,nausea,insomnia,depression,loss of caring,loss of interest,and allergies.according to slomcenski,these conditions developed following a change of management at her work.gilson webb,a psychiatrist who examined slomcenski,diagnosed her with major depressive disorder.on the basis of webb diagnoses and slomcenski failure to respond to antidepressants and psychotherapy,continental awarded slomcenski disability benefits under the plan.
following this initial benefits determination,slomcenski condition was routinely monitored and.in december,continental referred slomcenski to daniel sprehe for an independent psychiatric medical evaluation.sprehe confirmed that slomcenski still suffered from severe depression.under a category for physical medical problems,sprehe diagnosed slomcenski with hashimoto thyroid disease.in march,continental arranged for charles paskewicz,a licensed psychologist,to conduct an independent review of slomcenski file.paskewicz found that all the available evidence indicated that slomcenski was continuing to suffer from severe depression.as a result of these diagnoses,continental informed slomcenski that she would continue to receive benefits.however,in the benefits award letter,continental stated that,if slomcenski remained disabled,her receipt of benefits would be limited to thirty months because her disability was the result of a mental or nervous disorder.according to the letter,her benefits would terminate in january.
in october,robert gilbert diagnosed slomcenski with irritable bowel syndrome.in january,webb slomcenski and found that,while slomcenski continued to suffer from major depressive disorder,some of her symptoms appeared to be related to her physical condition.exhibits at.in september,paul winters examined slomcenski after she complained of fatigue,numbness on part of her foot,and lower back pain.winters noted that slomcenski was scheduled to be evaluated for fibromyalgia.during this time,slomcenski was also evaluated by a rheumatologist,michael burnette,for her complaints of persistent joint pain and chronic fatigue.burnette found that slomcenski had some trigger points for pain in her upper back and some pain with the movement of her spine.burnette concluded that slomcenski ha d manifestations of a fibromyalgia disorder,and that her history suggest ed chronic fatigue.id.at.
following burnette evaluation,slomcenski sent a letter to continental which indicated that she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.slomcenski also reported that she experienced severe pain on a daily basis.in december,continental responded that slomcenski letter and supporting documentation were insufficient to support the finding that slomcenski suffered from a physical impairment.accordingly,continental maintained that slomcenski benefits would be terminated in january pursuant to the mental or nervous disorder limitation.
slomcenski appealed continental determination and argued that her depression stemmed from the fibromyalgia,which was a physical condition.by this time,metlife had assumed responsibility for making benefits determinations under the plan and referred slomcenski file to amy hopkins for an independent review.based on her review of all the diagnoses in slomcenski file,hopkins observed that slomcenski ha d major depression,and all of her symptoms can be explained on that basis.id.at.she concluded that slomcenski did not have an objectively documented physical impairment and that her disability was related to a mental disorder.id.at.accordingly,the original determination by continental that slomcenski benefits would terminate in january was affirmed.
procedural history 
slomcenski filed suit against citibank and related entities in september.in an amended complaint,slomcenski alleged that citibank had violated erisa and the ada by denying her claim for continued ltd benefits under the plan pursuant to the mental or nervous disorder benefits limitation provision.the limitations provision appeared in the copies of the spd attached to the original and the amended complaints.neither complaint challenges the validity of the provision.both in her response to citibank motion for summary judgment on the erisa claim and in her for summary judgment,however,slomcenski argues that the provision was not properly part of the plan because it appears only in the spd,not in the original plan document.citibank responded with a supplemental affidavit by phyllis wade,a citigroup.benefits manager,stating that the plan had been properly amended to include the provision through an smm giving notice to employees,the revision of the spd adding the provision,and the filing of that new spd with the department of labor.the court found that slomcenski,far from showing the invalidity of the provision for the purposes of her own motion for summary judgment,had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as the validity of the provision for the purposes of citibank motion.accordingly,taking the mental or nervous disorder limitation into consideration,the court determined that citibank denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious and therefore entered summary judgment in favor of citibank on slomcenski erisa claim in addition,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of citibank on slomcenski ada claim because it found that she was unable to perform her job function,and was,therefore,not a qualified individual for the purposes of bringing an ada claim.
slomcenski filed a motion to reconsider,for the first time arguing that the provision was void because none of the documents in which it is included refer to any committee action in relation thereto the court observed that neither erisa nor the plan own amendment procedures required reissuance of the original plan document subsequent to an amendment and that the plan provision for written notice of any amendment to plan participants did not require reference to committee action.accordingly,the court ruled that in light of wade affidavit stating that the provision had been properly added to the plan,slomcenski bare contention that the committee had not participated in the amendment failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.the summary judgment order remained undisturbed.
on appeal,slomcenski argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of citibank on her erisa claim by finding that the mental or nervous disorder benefits limitation provision could be considered in determining whether the denial of her claim for ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious alternatively,assuming the benefits limitation provision was properly considered,slomcenski argues that citibank denial of her claim for benefits was arbitrary and capricious because citibank based its denial on the lack of objective evidence of a physical impairment,a proof requirement not found in any plan document.appellant br.at.slomcenski also challenges the district court disposition of her ada claim.
ii.discussion 
erisa claim 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in a case involving a claim for benefits governed by erisa.see williams bellsouth,cir.in making this inquiry,w e view all evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.burton tampa hous,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.
we exercise a complete and independent review of the district court grant of summary judgment to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact which preclude judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party.sutton bellsouth,cir per curiam.in determining whether an issue of fact is genuine for the purpose of defeating summary judgment,we ask whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.hudgens bell,cir citations omitted.here,these standards must be applied to evaluate slomcenski contention that the committee did not properly amend the plan to include the benefits limitation.we find that slomcenski has not carried this burden.
limitations provision 
erisa requires that every employee benefits plan provide a procedure for amending such plan,and for identifying the persons who have authority to amend the plan.b.in addition,once a company sponsoring a benefits plan has adopted a procedure for amending it,the company must follow that procedure when purporting to amend its benefits plan.see schoonejongen,d shaw.life ins,cir having created a particular amendment procedure,it seems evident to us that the parties to the agreement must follow that procedure in order to create enforceable amendments to their contract.for example,where a benefits plan required a participant to make a written request to amend a particular plan provision,we determined that an oral agreement to accomplish the same was insufficient to amend a benefits plan under erisa.see nachwalter christie,cir.likewise,where a benefits plan required that both the sponsoring company and the plan administrator sign a written document authorizing amendments to the plan,our court has found that an spd that was not formally approved by both parties,as specifically required by that plan amendment provision,was not a valid amendment to the plan.see shaw,at.
in addition to the requirement that amendment procedures,once adopted,must be followed for any amendment to be valid,erisa imposes restraints on the amendment procedures that can be adopted.for instance,we have determined that the erisa requirement that e very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,a,makes informal written notice memorializing an oral amendment,such as a posted notice,memo,letter,or brochure,an impermissible amendment mechanism.smith credit union admin,cir.a ny modification or amendment to an erisa plan can be implemented or applied only after the amendment has been appropriately adopted in a formal,complete and written form.smith,at emphasis in original see also rail employees ass atchison,topeka santa fe ry,d requiring formal procedures to amend a benefits plan.
based on this precedent and the summary judgment record currently before us,we conclude that slomcenski has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the validity of the amendment adding the ltd benefits limitation provision.although slomcenski contends that citibank did not follow the plan amendment procedures in purporting to adopt the mental or nervous disorder benefits limitation,the only suppo
