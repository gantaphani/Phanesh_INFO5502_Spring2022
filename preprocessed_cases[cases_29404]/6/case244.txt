background 
the following facts are not in dispute.in,connecticut bank of commerce cbc,having assets of approximately million,entered into a purchase and assumption agreement the p a agreement to acquire mtb bank mtb,a new york bank with approximately million in assets.cbc purchased substantially all of mtb assets,including its factoring unit.this transaction required federal deposit insurance corporation fdic approval,which mtb sought on august,and obtained on february.at the time mtb and cbc entered into the p a agreement,mtb had a insurance relationship with lloyd of london and was covered by a lloyd fidelity bond set to expire on june.
several events which occurred prior to the closing of the p a agreement bear on the contract dispute at hand.first,in september of,mtb management discovered that one or more of mtb agents advanced based on fraudulent invoices under a factoring agreement with a company called harmony designs.mtb submitted a claim for indemnity under the lloyd fidelity bond.however,mtb eventually settled with harmony designs for an amount which reduced its loss below the deductible of the lloyd bond therefore mtb never recovered payment from lloyd for this claim.additionally,in march,the president and several other officers of mtb were indicted in an alleged conspiracy involving the importation of argentinian minerals.mtb submitted a claim to lloyd for its losses relating to the conduct resulting in the indictments.on march,the p a agreement was finalized.
after the completion of the p a agreement,cbc was added to mtb insurance policy with lloyd.as the bond expired on june,cbc began to seek renewal of the lloyd policy.however,lloyd was concerned about the two claims that mtb had made,and it refused to renew coverage unless cbc representatives went to lloyds headquarters in london for a meeting.no one from cbc went to london.two weeks prior to the bond expiration,cbc requested a extension of coverage,but lloyd declined to offer any extension beyond the june,expiration date.
cbc then sought the assistance of an insurance broker to procure fidelity insurance to replace the lloyd policy.cbc chief financial officer,barbara van bergen van bergen,filled out an application for insurance from reliance insurance company the reliance application on behalf of cbc.van bergen signed the reliance application on june,and gave it to cbc insurance broker,who,following common practice in the industry,submitted it to multiple insurers to receive quotes.on june,cbc insurance broker submitted the reliance application to great american insurance company gaic.
the application contained the following questions 
list all losses sustained during the past three years,whether reimbursed or not 
does cbc have any knowledge of or information concerning any occurrence or circumstance whatsoever which might materially affect this insurance proposal 
has any insurance of this nature been declined or cancelled during the past three years 
van bergen on behalf of cbc answered none,no,and no,to these three questions,respectively.
the reliance application included the following affirmance above the signature line the applicant represents that the information furnished in this application is complete,true and correct.any misrepresentation,omission,concealment,or incorrect statement of a material fact,in this application or otherwise,shall be grounds for the rescission of any bond issued in reliance upon such information.
in late june,gaic issued a quote for fidelity insurance to cbc on the basis of information contained in the reliance application.on july,gaic issued a fidelity bond to cbc with coverage retroactive to june.after gaic bound coverage,cbc additionally completed a gaic insurance application.just as she did in the reliance application,van bergen stated in the gaic application that cbc had not sustained any losses and no insurance had been declined or cancelled in the prior three years however,the gaic application did not contain a question regarding any knowledge or information which might materially affect the insurance proposal.the gaic fidelity bond states that t he insured represents that the information furnished in the application for this bond is complete,true and correct.such application constitutes part of this bond.any misrepresentation,omission,concealment or any incorrect statement of a material fact,in the application or otherwise,shall be grounds for the rescission of this bond.the fidelity bond further specified that gaic issued coverage in reliance upon all statements made and information furnished to the underwriter by the insured in applying for this bond.
when the reliance application was completed and submitted,cbc knew about both the harmony designs claim and the indictments of mtb officers.cbc also knew that lloyd had declined to renew or extend coverage of its fidelity bond.the gaic agent who reviewed cbc application testified that gaic would not have issued the fidelity bond had cbc disclosed this information.
cbc went into fdic receivership on june.on january,the fdic,standing in the shoes of cbc,brought this suit claiming that gaic breached its contractual duty by dishonoring claims for coverage under the fidelity bond for losses sustained by cbc related to a loan scheme that was used to fund the acquisition of mtb.the district court granted summary judgment to gaic on the ground that it properly rescinded the fidelity bond due to omissions and misstatements made by cbc in its application for the fidelity bond.

the fdic argues that e,which protects the fdic from defenses not apparent on the face of an asset it acquires as receiver of a failed bank,bars gaic misrepresentation defense.in pertinent part,section e reads as follows 
no agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the fdic in any asset acquired by it as receiver of any insured depository institution,shall be valid against the fdic unless such agreement 
a is in writing,
b was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder,including the obligor,contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution,
c was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee,which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee,and 
d has been,continuously,from the time of its execution,an official record of the depository institution.
the fdic contends that the district court erred by limiting the statute definition of asset to exclude fidelity bonds,and thus the rescission clause of the bond should not apply.two courts of appeals previously have decided this issue the sixth circuit,which held similarly to the district court that fidelity bonds are not assets under the purview of section e,and the tenth circuit,whic
