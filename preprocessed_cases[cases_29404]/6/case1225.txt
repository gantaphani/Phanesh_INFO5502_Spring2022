yoko dominguez appeals from the separate summary judgments entered in favor of defendants washington mutual bank and javier gutierrez in her action for job discrimination based upon her sexual orientation because triable issues of fact exist concerning whether she timely exhausted her administrative remedies and as to the existence of discrimination,we reverse the judgments.because dominguez may not maintain an action for job retaliation against gutierrez,we remand with directions to enter an order granting him summary adjudication of that claim only.we affirm,however,as to washington mutual assertion that dominguez can not raise triable issues of fact on her punitive damages claim,and,on remand,direct the trial court to grant summary adjudication on that issue only.
facts and procedural history 
yoko dominguez sued washington mutual bank wamu and wamu employee javier gutierrez for violating the fair employment and housing act feha,et,alleging that she had been harassed by gutierrez and eventually fired from her job at wamu because she was a lesbian.dominguez began working at wamu in march as a temporary employee assigned to processing outgoing mail within two weeks time,it became known that she was a lesbian.soon after,mail services coworker gutierrez began making crude and offensive comments to dominguez relating to her sexual orientation these included asking about her favorite sexual position,whether she liked giving or getting oral sex,and whether she was the stud with her girlfriend.gutierrez also called her macho,told her she needed a man,and said she would turn a female coworker into a lesbian.
russell rough was the direct supervisor of both dominguez and gutierrez.instead of complaining to rough about gutierrez conduct,sometime in late april,dominguez went to rough supervisor,shelly ferrel,who was also a lesbian.in addition to describing some of the statements gutierrez made about her,dominguez also told ferrel about comments gutierrez made about ferrel,including calling ferrel a fucking lesbian,a fucking macho,and saying that ferrel thought of herself as handsome.according to dominguez,ferrel promised to talk to rough about gutierrez behavior.
gutierrez then stopped making the offensive comments but began interfering with dominguez work by several means throwing balls of paper that would jam up the wheels of her pallet jack stacking heavy boxes in areas that blocked her access to various work stations and by telling her that he had no mail to send,then later changing his mind after she had prepared all the other mail for distribution,forcing her to the mail and revise her written report about her work output.gutierrez also began to whistle an offensive tune whenever he walked by dominguez.according to dominguez,the tune was widely known in mexico as the melodic accompaniment for the spanish phrase,chinga tu madre,cabron.dominguez testified that chinga tu madre means go fuck your mother,while cabron is a term commonly used to insult men.
in may,dominguez complained again to ferrel about gutierrez conduct.although she did not mention the whistling incidents,she told ferrel how gutierrez was interfering with her ability to do her job.she also told ferrel that she had overheard gutierrez say,fucking lesbian asshole.i am going to fuck her.according to dominguez,ferrel told her it was obvious that rough was not doing his job and promised to talk to rough again about gutierrez behavior.however,gutierrez continued to interfere with dominguez work and whistle the offensive tune.between may and august dominguez complained to rough at least times about the work interference issue,but with no effect.in fact,in july of,dominguez was assigned to work directly with gutierrez.according to rough,he might have given gutierrez verbal warnings,but he never gave gutierrez a written warning about his conduct.
according to the deposition testimony of rough and ferrel,dominguez was an excellent worker with a great attitude.sometime in august,rough asked dominguez if she wanted to become a permanent wamu employee and when she answered yes told her to apply for the job.she did so,but two days later,on august,was fired because rough and ferrel claimed she was frequently late for work.on august,dominguez filed an administrative complaint for sexual orientation discrimination with the state department of fair employment and housing dfeh.when the dfeh issued her a letter,dominguez sued wamu and gutierrez.although the complaint listed only one cause of action,it expressly included three separate feha violations against respondents section,subdivision a,which makes it unlawful to fire an employee due to,among others,her sexual orientation section,subdivision h,which makes it unlawful to fire an employee in retaliation for her opposition to any practices that violate feha and section,subdivision j,which makes it unlawful to harass an employee providing services pursuant to a contract based on,among others,the employee sexual orientation.
wamu moved for summary judgment on three primary grounds dominguez did not file the mandatory administrative complaint with the dfeh within one year of the last discriminatory act,meaning she failed to timely exhaust her administrative remedies,subd.d she could not show that wamu knew or had reason to know what gutierrez was doing gutierrez conduct was not bad enough to constitute unlawful harassment and discrimination and wamu fired dominguez for a legitimate reason based on her frequent tardiness.
the trial court granted wamu motion.underlying its ruling was the finding that gutierrez misconduct as it related to dominguez sexual orientation ended sometime in may when he stopped making his offensive comments.his conduct after that with dominguez work and whistling the offensive so different and unrelated in nature,the court found,that it did not extend the limitations period under the continuing violation doctrine the court also found that dominguez had no evidence to rebut wamu claim that it fired her for a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason due to her tardiness.
soon after,gutierrez brought his own summary judgment motion on two of the same grounds dominguez action was barred because she did not file a dfeh complaint until august,and his alleged misconduct was not serious enough or frequent enough to constitute actionable discrimination.the trial court agreed,finding as it had with wamu summary judgment motion that the harassment stopped in may,and that gutierrez alleged actions after that time were too dissimilar to invoke the continuing violation doctrine.the court also found that gutierrez actions after that time were insufficient to constitute a feha violation.
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.as such,we will strictly scrutinize the moving party papers,but the declarations of the party opposing summary judgment will be liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.although we must review a summary judgment motion by the same standards as the trial court,we must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented.santillan roman catholic bishop of fresno th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subds.o p.if the defendant does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action or defense.in doing so,the plaintiff can not rely on the mere allegations in his pleadings,but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.p.a triable issue of material fact exists only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.santillan roman catholic bishop of fresno,supra,th at,d.
discussion 
dominguez offered sufficient evidence that she timely filed her dfeh administrative complaint 
a prerequisite to bringing a civil action under feha is the filing of an administrative complaint with dfeh no later than one year after the violation occurred.morgan regents of university of california th,d morgan.dominguez was fired on august,and filed her dfeh complaint on august.wamu and gutierrez argued,and the trial court agreed,that because gutierrez stopped his verbal taunts no later than may,well before dominguez was fired,dominguez dfeh complaint was.as a result,they contend,she failed to exhaust her administrative remedy and therefore could not maintain her civil action.okoli lockheed technical operations th,d.
dominguez argued below,as she does on appeal,that her dfeh complaint was timely under an equitable exception to the deadline known as the continuing violation doctrine.morgan,supra,th at,d.under this doctrine,a feha complaint is timely if discriminatory practices occurring outside the limitations period continued into that period.accardi superior court th,d.a continuing violation exists if the conduct occurring within the limitations period is similar in kind to the conduct that falls outside the period the conduct was reasonably frequent and it had not yet acquired a degree of permanence.richards hill,cal th,d,richards.taking each requirement in turn,we conclude dominguez raised triable issues of fact on all three.
respondents contend that in evaluating this issue,we should not consider the chinga tu madre tune that gutierrez whistled,or certain offensive remarks gutierrez supposedly made to others that the trial court excluded as hearsay.without reaching the validity of those contentions,we will not factor those matters into our analysis accordingly,for purposes of our analysis,once gutierrez stopped making his offensive remarks in or about may of,all that remained was conduct that respondents characterize as nothing more than gutierrez failure to perform his own job properly,or as improper mail processing.this conduct was too dissimilar from the verbal abuse that was expressly based on dominguez sexual orientation,and occurred too sporadically,respondents contend,to qualify as continuing violations.we disagree.
the richards court suggested a flexible approach to determining similarity.the plaintiff in richards suffered from multiple sclerosis and asked her employer to make certain accommodations to her condition.over the course of several years,the employer failed to accommodate her in several ways,including persistently blocking access to hallways and a supply room not preparing a fire escape plan and not adjusting the timing of the elevator door to provide access to the lunchroom.some of these occurred within the limitations period,and some occurred outside of it.in holding that all of this together amounted to a continuous course of conduct for purposes of the continuing violation doctrine,the court said that reasonable accommodation of an employee disability is often an ongoing process rather than a single action.as this case well illustrates,this process may have many facets and take a number of different forms.as with harassment,an instance of an employer failure to accommodate that in isolation may seem trivial can assume greater significance and constitute a greater injury when viewed as one of a series of such failures.richards,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.citing fielder ual cir,fielder,the richards court said that similar kinds of unlawful employer conduct,such as acts of harassment or failures to reasonably accommodate disability,may take a number of different forms.richards,at,d,italics added.
the plaintiff in fielder was an airline employee who,pursuant to federal laws,sued united airlines for sexual harassment and retaliation for having reported the harassment the federal district court granted summary judgment for the employer in part because it found the plaintiff filed her administrative complaint too late.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that a variety of different discriminatory acts that occurred both within and outside of the limitations period constituted a continuing violation.these included reprimanding the plaintiff for escorting her mother onto a flight refusing her transfer request refusing to give her required job assistance and making abusive and insulting comments.the fielder court said that not every incident of discrimination before the limitations period had to be of the same type,so long as there was a corresponding type of discrimination within the period.fielder,supra,at.a continuing violation could be shown by a series of related acts so long as there is sufficient evidence to show that those acts are related closely enough to constitute a continuing violation.id.at.
one decision cited by the fielder court for this proposition was draper coeur rochester,cir draper.the plaintiff in draper was sexually harassed by her supervisor for several years despite repeated complaints to company management.when the frustrated plaintiff confronted her abuser about his continued harassment,he laughed snidely,picked up the phone to call a supervisor,and said the plaintiff was digging up old bones.because management had never before properly responded to her complaints,the plaintiff quit,then sued for sexual harassment.the defendant was granted summary judgment because the only incident that happened within the applicable limitations period was the last one,where the abuser did no more than derisively dismiss plaintiff complaint.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that the incident qualified as a continuing violation of the prior acts of abuse that took place outside the limitations period,thereby bringing within the limitations period those acts occurring outside of it.citing oncale sundowner offshore services,d,the draper court said that the harassing supervisor seemingly isolated act had to be viewed in context with all the circumstances.discriminatory behavior comes in all shapes and sizes,and what might be an innocuous occurrence in some circumstances may,in the context of a pattern of discriminatory harassment,take on an altogether different character,causing a worker to feel demeaned,humiliated,or intimidated on account of her gender.draper,at.
because the draper plaintiff described an occurrence that can be understood only in light of the circumstances that preceded it,the ninth circuit held that the supervisor snide laughter and humiliating response to her allegations of harassment could reasonably have been perceived by her as an act of hostility that was clearly related to the authority he customarily exercised over her and to his prior,as well as his future,discriminatory treatment of her.draper,supra,at.combined with management previous ineffectual responses,this suggested that management would likely take no corrective action.as a result,those events not only constituted a final hostile act by plaintiff supervisor,but served as a sharp reminder to her of all that had already occurred and all that could be expected in the future.ibid.based on this,the draper court held that the harasser comments and actions at that last meeting were part of a continuing violation for purposes of the limitations period.ibid.
similar reasoning was applied in birschtein new united motor manufacturing,th,d birschtein,where the plaintiff employee sued for sexual harassment and the defendant employer was granted summary judgment in part based on the contention that the plaintiff dfeh complaint was filed more than one year after the overt acts of harassment had stopped.the evidence showed that after the plaintiff complained to management that a coworker was harassing her with frequent sexual and crude remarks,the harassing employee stopped that conduct.instead,the harasser began to pass by plaintiff work station several times a da
