as the district court correctly observed,we routinely apply a tripartite test to determine whether a party has waived its right to arbitration.we find waiver when the party knew of its existing right to arbitration acted inconsistently with that right and prejudiced the other party by its inconsistent actions.dumont,at citing ritzel,at.we now apply this test to the record before us.
