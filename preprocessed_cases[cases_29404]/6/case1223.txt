this case comes to us on an appeal from the trial court order denying a motion to compel arbitration.while this case arises in the context of an attempt to enforce an arbitration clause,the dispositive issue is whether there was fraud in the execution of the entire brokerage account agreement,of which the arbitration clause was only a part.this case,therefore,is not really about arbitration but rather involves a bank creation of a fiduciary relationship with one of its customers and the consequences that flow therefrom.
the defendants are various wells fargo entities the plaintiffs are elderly wells fargo customers with substantial assets.in order to ensure that wells fargo managed all of plaintiffs assets,wells fargo assigned a relationship manager to plaintiffs.the relationship manager was a wells fargo vice president,who made biweekly visits to the plaintiffs home office in order to manage their financial paperwork.she also introduced the plaintiffs to an estate attorney,an accountant,and a wells fargo financial consultant.in short,the relationship manager induced the plaintiffs to rely on her to help provide for their financial well being.
at the relationship manager urging,the plaintiffs met with the wells fargo financial consultant,and opened a brokerage account with him.that brokerage account agreement contains the arbitration clause which led to the trial court ruling.in executing the agreement,wells fargo treated the plaintiffs as any other customers opening a brokerage account.in other words,wells fargo approached the execution of the brokerage account agreement as though it were part of an arm length transaction.
the trial court denied wells fargo motion to compel arbitration on the basis that the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable.while we do not disagree with that conclusion,an agreement must also be substantively unconscionable in order for it to be unenforceable for unconscionability.the agreement,which provided for arbitration conducted by the national association of securities dealers,nasd,is not,as a matter of law,substantively unconscionable.
significantly,the trial court also concluded that wells fargo had established a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs,and that this relationship may have given rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of wells fargo to make certain that the plaintiffs understood the material terms of the contract they were signing.we agree.the trial court,however,failed to consider and rule upon the consequences of this conclusion.that is,whether,under the circumstances,there was fraud in the execution of the brokerage account agreement,which conclusion would necessarily preclude enforcement of any part of that agreement,including the arbitration clause.we will therefore reverse the trial court order and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the parties 
plaintiffs and respondents are the brown family trust and ronnie brown,individually and as trustee of the brown family trust.defendants and appellants are wells fargo bank,na and certain related entities also named as defendants and appellants are two wells fargo employees,jack harold keleshian keleshian and lisa jill tepper tepper.
on june,plaintiff ronnie brown and her now deceased husband,ira brown,executed an the acknowledgement,by which they entered into a brokerage account agreement the agreement with well fargo investments as for the brown family trust.the agreement allowed wells fargo to make stock trades requested by the browns.
plaintiff ronnie brown was born in.at the time that she signed the agreement,she was years old ira brown was a of drug store in the.he had amassed more than shares of stock,which was valued at more than million as of june.at the time he signed the agreement,he was years old,in failing health and legally blind.
tepper was a wells fargo vice president and senior trust administrator from october to august.in june,tepper was also a licensed stock broker and a relationship manager.in deposition testimony,tepper stated,t he relationship manager oversees the relationship and as needs are uncovered or requests are made by clients,i would introduce another employee of wells fargo that could address that particular need.although tepper herself did not manage the assets in trust accounts,she received additional compensation when the browns opened the brown family trust.
keleshian was a licensed stock broker as well as senior vice president and senior financial consultant for wells fargo.keleshian assisted the browns with opening the brokerage account for the brown family trust.
plaintiffs relationship with defendants prior to the execution of the agreement 
the browns were customers of wells fargo bank prior to the june,meeting the meeting with defendants.they had accounts at wells fargo and a branch manager,david whitesell,assisted ronnie brown with paying the browns bills.
in late or early,the browns met tepper,who was assigned to assist them as their relationship manager.during the initial meeting,tepper learned that ira brown had limited vision.tepper testified that when she met brown,he was a little slow.
beginning in early,tepper worked in the browns home office on a biweekly basis and organized and managed their significant financial paperwork.the browns provided tepper with access to all of their financial information while the browns believed that tepper had been assigned simply to assist them with the management of their financial paperwork,tepper actual job was to gather information about the browns,and to make certain all of their assets remained under the management of wells fargo.
tepper introduced the browns to an estate attorney and a certified public accountant.as tepper started to learn about the browns investments,she did not agree with the browns investment choices.she then began giving the browns advice as to their investments.tepper advised the browns to change their investment strategy because she did not think their investments were appropriate for people the browns age.
tepper advised the browns that the easiest method for straightening out their investment portfolio was to open a brokerage account with wells fargo.she represented that keleshian was a stock expert who could handle the browns stock portfolio.at the insistence and repeated urging of tepper over the months,the browns ultimately agreed to meet with keleshian.
during this time period,tepper also helped the browns with organizing their documents.as she worked in their home office,she helped them decide which documents to keep and which to shred.
the june,meeting and the execution of the agreement 
prior to the meeting,the browns had met with keleshian on one prior occasion for an introduction.following that introductory meeting,tepper then set up the meeting to open the brokerage account.
on june,tepper and keleshian traveled to the browns office in el segundo,california,and met with the browns for thirty minutes.at that time,the browns opened three investment accounts the brown family trust,the ira brown trust,and the ronnie brown trust.this litigation concerns the brown family trust.defendants assert,and plaintiffs do not dispute,that the relevant documents establishing the ira brown trust and the ronnie brown trust contained arbitration provisions identical to the one at issue in this litigation.
at the meeting,the browns signed the acknowledgement and a trust certificate of investment power.the acknowledgement,a document,provided that the browns had read the terms and conditions of the wells fargo investments brokerage account agreement and agreed to be bound by them.the acknowledgement also stated at paragraph in fine print capital letters by signing below acknowledge receipt of a copy of the wells fargo investments brokerage account agreement which contains a arbitration clause in section,number.my signature also acknowledges that i have read and understand the disclosures stated above.
page three,section of the corresponding agreement included the arbitration provision entitled arbitration agreement.in fine print capital letters,the arbitration provision provided the following introductory statements arbitration is final and binding on the parties.the parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court,including the right to jury trial.discovery is generally more limited than and different from court proceedings.the arbitrators award is not required to include factual findings or legal reasoning and any party right to appeal,or to seek modification of rulings by the arbitrators is strictly limited.the panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.
the arbitration provision then provided i agree that all claims,controversies and other disputes between me and wells fargo investments and any of its directors,officers,employees,or agents arising out of or relating to the brokerage account or any orders or transactions therein or the continuation,performance or breach of the brokerage account agreement or any other agreement between you and me,whether entered into before,on,or after the date this account is opened,shall be determined by arbitration conducted by,and subject to the arbitration rules then in effect of,the new york stock exchange or the national association of securities dealers.as i may elect.if i make no written election addressed to wells fargo investments by registered mail then i authorize wells fargo investments to elect one of the forums for me.this agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under prevailing law and procedures.the award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final,and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction over the parties.counsel can advise me on how this provision may affect me.
the browns apparently did not read the wells fargo documents,including the agreement.they signed the documents almost immediately after they received them from keleshian.the browns believed that,by signing the agreements,they were agreeing to open brokerage accounts only.indeed,tepper agreed that,as far as she knew,the browns signed the agreement believing that they were opening accounts.
the browns were unable to read the fine print in the agreement.ira brown was visibly frail and could not sign his name where indicated keleshian knew that ira brown was unable to read the documents,and had been told of ira brown limitations during the meeting.
keleshian,however,did not explain the purpose of the documents to be signed and said nothing about the arbitration provision.keleshian also did not ask the browns whether they had any questions and did not offer to read any portions of the agreement to them 
ronnie brown was unaware of the existence of the arbitration provision until after this litigation commenced and defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.ronnie brown claims keleshian did not give me a chance to read any of the documents outside of his presence before asking us to sign them,nor did he tell us we could take the documents home and review them before signing them.to the contrary,everything seemed rushed,as if all keleshian wanted was to close the deal.wells fargo seemed intent on ensuring that we signed the brokerage agreement and then turned over the stock certificates to their custody.
keleshian testified that tepper was present at the meeting because the browns felt it would be more comfortable for them if she was at the meeting.during the meeting,tepper took custody of the browns stock certificates and later placed them in the wells fargo vault.tepper did not think it prudent to inform the browns to have an attorney present at the meeting.nor did she think it was prudent to advise the browns to have their attorney read the agreement prior to execution.tepper did not read any of the agreement language to the browns nor did she point out any particular portions of the agreement to the browns.she did not ensure that the browns had their glasses or determine whether they could read the documents.she did not ask the browns if they had any questions about the agreement before they signed it.counsel for the browns asked tepper at deposition so what did you do to protect the browns regarding this purported agreement tepper responded i did do anything.
plaintiffs allegations 
in may,plaintiffs commenced the present lawsuit.in their operative first amended complaint,plaintiffs assert seven causes of action breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,negligence and professional negligence.
plaintiffs allege that in september ira brown was in hospice care and that he was sick and dying.because she was the primary,ronnie brown was mentally fatigued and physically weary.
at approximately one night,keleshian allegedly telephoned the browns at home and represented to the browns that they must immediately sell shares of stock or that it would be worthless within days.the shares were held in the brown family trust.
ronnie brown allegedly stated this should be handled in the morning.keleshian,however,allegedly pressured her to provide telephonic consent for the sale,which she did.ronnie brown allegedly tried to cancel the sale the following morning.defendants,however,informed her that the sale had already occurred.
plaintiffs allege that wells fargo sold shares of stock at a price of per share.they also allege that the during the week following the sale,the stock price rose to a share and that the price never decreased to less than a share in the next two weeks.
plaintiffs allege that wells fargo breached its duties to plaintiffs with respect to the sale of stock.plaintiffs claim that they had almost no cost basis in the stock,thus causing them to suffer significant capital gains taxes and that wells fargo was unjustly enriched by the commission on the stock trade.
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of million,as well as attorney fees,punitive damages and trebling of all damages and penalties pursuant to civil code section.
defendants motion to compel arbitration 
in july,defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.defendants asserted that the arbitration provision was a binding and enforceable contract.defendants further asserted that all of plaintiffs claims fell within the scope of the arbitration provision.
in their opposition,plaintiffs asserted that the arbitration provision was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.plaintiffs also argued that based upon their prior relationship with tepper,wells fargo and tepper were the browns fiduciaries and that they owed plaintiffs a duty to protect them when entering into the agreement with respect to the brown family trust.
initially,the trial court was of the tentative opinion that the motion to compel arbitration should be granted.the browns sought further discovery,however,and the trial court continued the hearing on the motion in order to allow the browns to conduct discovery on the relevant issues.specifically,the browns were permitted to conduct discovery regarding the circumstances of the execution of the arbitration agreement,in order to determine whether there was evidence of fraud or unconscionability.
the browns then filed a further opposition to the motion to compel,in which they emphasized the fiduciary relationship tepper had established with them.they relied on excerpts from tepper deposition,in addition to a declaration from ronnie brown.this evidence set forth tepper course of activity in which she purportedly established a relationship with the browns by which they became dependent on her to handle their financial needs.plaintiffs claimed that defendants failure to orally disclose the arbitration provision constituted constructive fraud.
in their supplemental reply in support of the motion to compel,the defendants responded that the parties dealt at arm length.they also submitted the declaration of john maine,an expert in the securities industry,to the effect that it would be contrary to accepted industry practice for a stock broker or other investment professional to read a customer agreement aloud to a prospective customer before the customer signs the agreement,attempt to explain it to the customer,advise the customer to consult with an attorney before signing it.as investment professionals are usually not licensed attorneys,he took that position that it would be a mistake to suggest that they should attempt to interpret contracts for prospective customers.in doing so they could create more misinterpreting phrases or leaving out essential they might be expected to solve.
a hearing was held on january.at the hearing,the court stated its conclusion that there was a fiduciary relationship between the browns and wells fargo.the court stated,however,i do think that i in a position to make any rulings relative to constructive fraud.i think that is up to a jury panel to decide.the court also did not expressly state whether it found the arbitration provision substantively unconscionable.instead,the court ruled that this arbitration agreement under the facts of this case is unfair and it is procedurally unconscionable.under the unusual particular facts,the court concluded that wells fargo had been required to do more to assist the browns in reviewing and understanding the documents they were signing.on that basis,the court denied the motion to compel arbitration.defendants timely filed a notice of appeal.
contentions 
defendants contend that the trial court erred by denying the motion to compel arbitration.the browns respond that the motion to compel was properly denied because the arbitration clause was unconscionable and void for fraud in the execution.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court ruling on a petition to compel arbitration must resolve the factual issues raised by the petition,not simply determine whether factual disputes exist.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.there is no right to a jury trial on the issue of whether arbitration agreements should be specifically enforced.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal.thus,the trial court errs if it determines only that factual disputes exist with respect to a plaintiff argument that an arbitration clause is void for fraud.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.w hen a petition to compel arbitration is filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy,the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists and,if any defense to its enforcement is raised,whether it is enforceable.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.
the issues of the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement are to be resolved by the trial court in the manner provided for the hearing and decision of motions citation,either on the basis of affidavits or declarations or,in the exercise of the court discretion where necessary to resolve material conflicts in the written evidence,upon live testimony.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.

state and federal policy in favor of arbitration 
in deciding whether the parties are required to arbitrate this dispute,we bear in mind the state and federal statutory schemes relating to arbitration and the policies they were designed to further.through the california arbitration act caa,code of civil procedure section et,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citations.consequently,courts will indulge every intendment to give effect to such proceedings.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.
likewise,the federal arbitration act faa,et,was intended to reverse long standing judicial hostility to arbitration.express,mcmahon,d.faa establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration.id.at.
the court can not treat the arbitration provision differently than other contract provisions 
section of the faa provides that written arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.italics added.g enerally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening.citations courts may not,however,invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.doctor associates,casarotto,d doctor associates.by enacting section of the faa,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.ibid.
in doctor associates,the united states supreme court struck down a montana statute which required arbitration provisions to be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract.id.at.the court held that because the statute treated arbitration contracts differently than other contracts,it was preempted by section of the faa.ibid.
the rule of enforceability established by section of the faa preempts any contrary state law and is binding on state courts as well as federal.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.in most respects,the caa is similar to the faa.id.at,d.in particular,code of civil procedure section,like section of the faa,provides that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.
nasd arbitration 
the arbitration provision of the agreement states that the parties must submit their claims to arbitration conducted by the nasd or the new york stock exchange.defendants moved for an order compelling nasd arbitration.
nasd is a organization sro that licenses and regulates in the national securities industry.through its wholly owned subsidiary,it has adopted a code of arbitration procedure the nasd code to govern the arbitration of disputes between its members and their customers.jevne superior court cal th,d,jevne.under the authority of the securities and exchange act of sea,et,the united states securities and exchange commission sec has approved the nasd code jevne,supra,cal th at,d.
the primary purposes of the sea are fair dealing and investor protection in securities transactions.id.at,d.to the extent the nasd code furthers the primary purposes of the sea,and was intended to have preemptive effect,state laws which conflict with the nasd code are preempted by the sea.ibid.
the arbitration provision in the agreement was not unconscionable 
unconscionability constitutes a generally applicable defense to enforcement of contracts.courts have specifically held that unconscionability constitutes a defense against agreements to arbitrate.see szetela,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs,as the party opposing arbitration,had the burden of establishing that the arbitration provision was unconscionable.ibid.
unconscionability has a procedural and a substantive element.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for the court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,see also ontiveros dhl express usa,th,d.
in parr superior court d,the court reviewed nyse arbitration rules,which it found to be essentially identical to the nasd code.id.at.the nyse,like the nasd,is an sro that administers an arbitration program under rules approved by the sec.jevne,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also parr,supra,d at.the parr court held without some basis for doing so,we are reluctant to find unconscionable procedures which have been approved by the sec.we find that the procedures outlined in the nyse rules display beyond any doubt much more than the requisite minimal integrity.id.at.see also thomas perry d.
we likewise are reluctant to find that the nasd code is unconscionable.for the reasons stated below,we find that the procedures of the nasd code are not on their face substantively unconscionable.in light of this finding,we need not address whether the arbitration provision in the agreement is procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability addresses the fairness of the term in dispute.substantive unconscionability traditionally involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.szetela,supra,th at,d.
the trial court did not make any express findings regarding substantive unconscionability.however,the court did state that it was concerned with certain aspects of the arbitration provision,namely that the arbitrators award is not required to include any factual findings or legal reasoning and that the parties right to appeal is strictly limited.
an award issued under the nasd code must contain,inter alia,a summary of the issues,a statement of the issues resolved,and a statement of the damages or other relief awarded.nasd code,rule e.an award,however,need not include factual findings or legal reasoning.but this does not,as plaintiffs contend,favor one side,and thus does not make the nasd code substantively unconscionable.it is worth noting that under the caa,an arbitration award can not be vacated on the grounds that an arbitrator made an error in law or that there was insufficient evidence to support the arbitrator findings of fact.code of civ,moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.
likewise,the limited ability of the parties to appeal an award does not necessarily make the arbitration provision.a limitation on appeals is consistent with the california public policy of encouraging expeditious,binding and final resolutions of disputes through arbitration.see moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs argue that nasd arbitration is substantively unconscionable because under the nasd code,a minority of arbitrators may be affiliated with the securities industry.this will result,plaintiffs contend,in a lack of impartiality of some nasd arbitrators and an unfair bias in defendants favor 
the nasd code provides that a majority of the arbitration panel must be comprised of people not from the securities industry.nasd code,rule.the parties have a right to strike and rank arbitrators from a list of potential arbitrators produced by nasd.nasd code,rules.arbitrators are required to disclose conflicts of interest arising from direct or indirect financial or personal interest in the outcome of the arbitration and other circumstances affecting their impartiality.nasd code,rule.the director of nasd dispute resolution may remove an arbitrator for conflict of interest or bias,either upon request of a party or on the director own initiative.nasd code,rule a.we do not find these provisions so as to shock to conscience.
plaintiffs argue that the arbitration clause is one sided because they allegedly can not pursue their civil code section and punitive damages claims in nasd arbitration.under the nasd code,however,arbitrators may award damages and other relief.nasd code,rule e.interpreting this same language in the predecessor nasd code,the united states supreme court stated while not a clear authorization of punitive damages,this provision appears broad enough at least to contemplate such a remedy.mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.
finally,plaintiffs argue that the discouragement of depositions in nasd arbitration makes nasd arbitration substantively unconscionable.under the nasd code,depositions are generally only allowed to preserve testimony,to accommodate essential witnesses who are unable or unwilling to travel long distances for a hearing,or if other exceptional circumstances exist.nasd code,rule.such limitations on depositions,however,do not make nasd arbitration substantively unconscionable.under the caa,these same restrictions apply to all injury arbitrations,unless the parties agree otherwise.see code of civ.
in sum,the arbitration clause the browns signed was not substantively unconscionable.as such,the finding of procedural unconscionability is irrelevant.without substantive unconscionability,procedural unconscionability is an insufficient basis on which to deny a motion to compel arbitration.
the trial court must decide the browns constructive fraud defense 
the browns next argue that the arbitration clause is void for fraud in the execution.specifically,they argue that wells fargo had established a fiduciary relationship with them,such that the failure to draw their attention to the arbitration clause at the time of execution constituted constructive fraud.
this argument is governed by the california supreme court decision in rosenthal.in that case,the court explained the difference between two different theories of fraud,fraud in the inducement and fraud in the execution.when a plaintiff alleges fraud in the inducement,the plaintiff is asserting that it understood the contract it was signing,but that its consent to the contract was induced by fraud.in contrast,when a plaintiff alleges fraud in the execution,the plaintiff is asserting that it was deceived as to the very nature of contract execution,and did not know what it was signing.a contract fraudulently induced is voidable but a contract fraudulently executed is void,because there never was an agreement.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.
when these theories are asserted with respect to an arbitration clause,different procedures apply.this is because arbitration clauses are considered separable from the agreements in which they appear.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.when a party to a contract containing an arbitration clause asserts fraud in the inducement of the contract generally,the assertion is no bar to the arbitration of the contract.the separable arbitration clause is considered valid,and the parties must arbitrate whether the contract was induced by fraud even though a finding of fraud in the inducement may result in rescission of the contract as a whole id.at,d.however,claims of fraud in the execution of the entire agreement are not arbitrable under either state or federal law.if the entire contract is void ab initio because of fraud,the parties have not agreed to arbitrate any controversy.id.at,d.thus,claims of fraud in the execution are to be resolved by the trial court,not an arbitrator.ibid.
a necessary element of the defense of fraud in the execution is reasonable reliance.that is,when a plaintiff asserts that the defendant misrepresented the nature of the contract,the contract is not considered void due to the fraud if the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to discover the true terms of the contract.the contract is only considered void when the plaintiff failure to discover the true nature of the document executed was without negligence on the plaintiff part.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.
this issue usually arises when the plaintiff failed to read the terms of the contract,relying instead on the defendant representation as to the effect of the contract.generally,it is not reasonable to fail to read a contract this is true even if the plaintiff relied on the defendant assertion that it was not necessary to read the contract.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.reasonable diligence requires a party to read a contract before signing it.brookwood bank of america th,d.this presumes,however,that the parties were dealing at arm length.when the parties are in a fiduciary relationship,the same degree of diligence is not required of the party.stafford shultz cal d.if the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff which requires the defendant to explain the terms of a contract between them the plaintiff failure to read the contract would be reasonable.lynch cruttenden th,d see also bruni didion th,d rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d,finding no such fiduciary obligation.in such a situation,the defendant fiduciary failure to perform its duty would constitute constructive fraud van de kamp bank of america d,the plaintiff failure to read the contract would be justifiable twomey mitc
