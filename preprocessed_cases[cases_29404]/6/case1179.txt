delaware continuous ownership rule requires a plaintiff in a shareholder derivative action to retain stock ownership for the duration of the litigation.a plaintiff who ceases to be a shareholder as a result of a merger,or for any other reason,loses standing to maintain a derivative action.the delaware supreme court has stated in several opinions,however,that a former shareholder will retain standing to maintain a derivative action despite a merger if the sole purpose of the merger was to eliminate potential derivative claims.this is known as the fraud exception to the continuous ownership rule.

shareholder derivative actions and individual actions 
a shareholder derivative action is an action in which a corporate shareholder acting on behalf of the corporation asserts a cause of action for harm done to the corporation,typically involving a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the corporation by its officers or directors.kramer western pacific industries,kramer.the harm to individual shareholders resulting from an injury to the corporation is indirect and arises solely by virtue of their stock ownership.tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette,tooley.a derivative action and any recovery in such an action belong to the corporation.id.at.a direct individual action by a shareholder,in contrast,alleges an injury to the plaintiff interests as a shareholder separate and apart from any injury to the corporation as a whole.id.at.any recovery in such an action belongs to the individual plaintiff.id.at.
under delaware law,a test is applied to determine the question of whether the action is derivative or direct.that issue must turn solely on the following questions who suffered the alleged harm the corporation or the suing stockholders,individually and who would receive the benefit of any recovery or other remedy the corporation or the stockholders,individually tooley,supra,at italics in original.a helpful approach to this issue would be to look at the body of the plaintiff complaint and the relief requested and ask,has plaintiff demonstrated that he or she can prevail without showing an injury to the corporation id.at.as we discuss below,plaintiff entire claim is based upon allegations asserting that the misconduct of the individual defendants damaged the corporation,countrywide.he does not claim he is bringing a direct individual action.
another aspect of a derivative action was potentially presented in this case.that is the shareholder action known as a double derivative suit.the double derivative claims asserted by plaintiff on behalf of bank of america are analytically distinct from his derivative claims asserted on behalf of countrywide.lambrecht,lambrecht.b y its nature,a double derivative suit is one brought by a shareholder of a parent corporation to enforce a claim belonging to a subsidiary that is either wholly owned or majority controlled.normally,such a claim is one that only the parent corporation,acting through its board of directors,is empowered to enforce.cases may arise,however,where the parent corporation board is shown to be incapable of making an impartial business judgment regarding whether to assert the subsidiary claim.in those cases a shareholder of the parent will be permitted to enforce that claim on the parent corporation behalf,that is,double derivatively.id.at.
as we have noted,during the pendency of this action countrywide was merged with bank of america.thus,any causes of action belonging to countrywide,including the derivative claims alleged by plaintiff,became the property of bank of america.although plaintiff had expressly reserved the right to do so,he does not challenge on appeal the order sustaining the demurrer to his double derivative claims.he therefore has abandoned any appeal as to the dismissal of those claims.city of industry city of fillmore th,fn.
continuous ownership rule and the fraud exception 
the continuous ownership rule limits a plaintiff standing to maintain a shareholder derivative action the rule provides that a plaintiff in a derivative action not only must have been a shareholder in the corporation at the time of the alleged wrong as well as at the time of the commencement of suit,but also must remain a shareholder throughout the litigation.lewis anderson,anderson.a plaintiff who ceases to be a shareholder as a result of a merger or for any other reason loses standing to maintain a derivative suit.id.at see grosset wenaas,supra,at discussing the continuous ownership requirement under delaware law.the derivative claims become the property of the surviving corporation,which then has the sole right and standing to prosecute the action ward,supra,at alabama by products cede.
the delaware supreme court in anderson stated that there were two recognized exceptions to the general rule depriving a former shareholder of standing to maintain a derivative action,as applied to mergers where the merger itself is the subject of a claim of fraud and where the merger is in reality a reorganization which does not affect plaintiff ownership of the business enterprise.citations.anderson,supra,at fn.anderson stated that the exceptions were inapplicable in that case because plaintiff has not asserted that the merger was perpetrated to deprive old conoco of its claim against the individual defendants and the merger was clearly not a reorganization resulting in a holding company id.at,fn.anderson,however,did not elaborate further on the scope of the fraud exception.
kramer,supra,held that the continuous ownership rule deprived the plaintiff of standing to maintain a derivative action and that the fraud exception was inapplicable.id.at.kramer first rejected the plaintiff argument that his claims were direct rather than derivative.kramer stated in this regard that the plaintiff allegations of premerger mismanagement resulting in waste of corporate assets constituted derivative claims and did not implicate the fairness of the merger terms or directly challenge the merger as resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty.kramer,supra,at.kramer then concluded that the fraud exception was inapplicable because the plaintiff failed to allege that the merger was fraudulent,perpetrated merely to deprive the corporation of its claim against the defendants.id.at.
ward,supra,stated that the continuous ownership rule deprives a former shareholder of standing to maintain a derivative action unless facts are alleged that fall within one of the two exceptions.citations.id.at.the ward court stated,although subsequent cases have paraphrased this court language in lewis anderson,the substance remains the same a complaint seeking to invoke the fraud exception must demonstrate that the merger was fraudulent and done merely to eliminate derivative claims.citations.id.at italics added.ward concluded that the plaintiff had failed to adequately allege with particularity that the board of directors pursued the merger simply to avoid defending the derivative suit rather than for other valid business reasons.id.at.
in feldman cutaia,supra,at page,the court stated,it is now well established that a plaintiff may avoid dismissal of his derivative claims following a merger in only two distinct circumstances where the claims asserted are direct,rather than derivative,or where one of the exceptions recognized in lewis anderson,supra,applies.the feldman court stated further,in anderson,this court set forth two exceptions in the merger context to its holding that only a current shareholder has standing to maintain an action that is derivative in nature first,if the merger itself is the subject of a claim of fraud,being perpetrated merely to deprive shareholders of the standing to bring a derivative action or second,if the merger is in reality merely a reorganization which does not affect plaintiff ownership in the business enterprise.citations.id.at,fn.
the foregoing is a summary of the law of delaware,as it has existed for over a quarter of a century,on the application of the continuous ownership rule and the very limited exceptions that apply thereto.plaintiff nonetheless argues that all of this was superseded by the statements of the delaware supreme court in in arkansas teacher,supra.as we explain,we find his arguments unpersuasive.
