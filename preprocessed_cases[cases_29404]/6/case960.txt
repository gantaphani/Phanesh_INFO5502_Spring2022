daniel bowling appeals his conviction and sentence for bank fraud.the underlying conduct relates to his oklahoma cattle ranching operation he obtained a consolidated by his cattle,property,and farmers exchange bank feb and less than six months later both the money and the cattle were gone.
we have jurisdiction under.in a previous order and judgment,we reversed bowling conviction and remanded for a new trial based entirely on our application of united states hopkins,cir,to the good faith instruction issue.see united states bowling,app x,cir.the government subsequently filed,and we granted,a petition for rehearing en banc regarding hopkins.hopkins required a good faith instruction where the defendant interposed a good faith defense,requested the instruction,and provided sufficient evidence to support it.see bowling,app x,cir.sitting en banc,this court by order overturned hopkins and remanded for reconsideration.see united states bowling,order,en banc.
as a result of the overturning of hopkins,we must now consider additional arguments for reversal raised by bowling.he challenges the district court denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal,exclusion of some of his proffered evidence and refusal to instruct the jury regarding his waiver theory,refusal to instruct the jury on his good faith theory,denial of his motion to suppress evidence,denial of his motion for a new trial,and order of restitution.bowling also argues the district court accumulated errors warrant a reversal.
as we discuss below,we find no error by the district court.we therefore vacate our previous decision and affirm bowling conviction and sentence.
background 
bowling ranching operations 
daniel bowling is a cattle rancher and farmer in oklahoma.since the,feb and its predecessor,service exchange bank,have financed bowling cattle ranching operations as well as his land,personal vehicles,and ranching equipment.
according to bowling,he bought and sold cattle for two types of commercial ranching activities.one type,which he describes as cow farming,involved purchasing adult cows and breeding them to produce calves.the second,a stocker operation,consisted of purchasing smaller cattle,increasing their weight,and then selling them.
bowling and feb executed dozens of loan agreements over the decade preceding the indictment.in exchange for a security interest in bowling cattle,feb loaned hundreds of thousands of dollars to bowling for use in his ranching to purchase cattle.each loan agreement contained similar provisions bowling was required to provide invoices evidencing any cattle purchases obtain prior written approval for any cattle sales remit any proceeds to the order of feb and himself as and make principal and interest payments as necessary.
throughout the years,bowling made payments on his loans,but rarely,if ever,obtained prior written approval from feb for his sales.likewise,bowling did not always provide feb his cattle purchase invoices or have the proceeds from his cattle sales written to the order of feb as a.in some instances,bowling sold cattle in the name of his mother,edna bowling,and his son,brian bowling.it appears as though feb officers at least tacitly,if not explicitly,approved of bowling practices despite the loan agreements express terms to the contrary.
between october and march,bowling obtained six loans from feb totaling.according to the loan documents,bowling requested these loans to purchase stocker cattle.under the terms of these loans and their associated security agreements,feb obtained,among other things,a perfected security interest in bowling ranching operations,including 
all farm products,inventory,documents and accounts,all proceeds thereof,including but not limited to all cattle and their products and offspring,feed additives and any other farm products and inventory now owned or hereafter acquired and wherever located and all increases or substitutions thereof and all proceeds therefrom.
supp.app x at.as with all previous agreements between bowling and feb,these security agreements also required bowling to obtain prior written permission from feb to sell any of his cattle,and make any proceeds from such cattle sales payable to the order of both feb and himself.bowling and feb,however,continued to operate informally under these agreements.bowling never obtained written permission for his cattle sales,and he usually did not have the proceeds remitted to feb as a.
despite this business as usual approach,by late the relationship between bowling and feb began to deteriorate.
september loan consolidation 
during,although bowling made several substantial payments on his indebtedness to feb,he also began to request loan advances to purchase more cattle.additionally,bowling checking account with feb had several substantial overdrafts.because of feb concern over bowling financial situation,on september,feb required bowling to consolidate his outstanding cattle loans and these overdrafts into one note totaling.this note also included a line of credit for bowling ranching operations.
at the same time as the loan restructuring,feb conducted a cattle inspection at bowling various locations.during this inspection,bowling directed his feb loan officer and an feb director to his various grazing lands in and around tonkawa,oklahoma.the feb loan officer counted the cattle,noted their brands,and recorded their approximate weight and dollar value.bowling also stated he had cattle at a pratt,kansas location.an feb shareholder audited that location sometime later.based on these audits,feb determined bowling had a total of steers.
bowling and feb then executed a new agreement to secure the consolidated loan.in addition to a perfected security interest in bowling cattle and farm products,the agreement granted feb an interest in all of bowling accounts,inventory,and equipment.and,just like all the previous loans,this agreement imposed the same conditions on bowling with respect to his cattle sales and proceeds.
in october,within a month of executing the new loan,bowling wrote several checks on the new credit line,ostensibly for cattle purchases and supplies.he did not,however,submit invoices evidencing any cattle purchases.nor did bowling respond to requests by feb to come to the bank and address several other notes on his real estate that had matured and were up for renewal.later,in january,feb attempted to schedule another cattle inspection but was unsuccessful,allegedly because of bowling lack of cooperation.
by february,bowling had not made any payments on the consolidated loan yet continued to draw upon his line of credit under the new note.it also appears bowling was past due on his home and real estate mortgages with feb at that time.as a result,feb declared bowling in default on all his indebtedness,including the september consolidated loan,and sued in state court to foreclose on bowling property,cattle,and ranching operations.
in july,during the pendency of the state foreclosure action,feb deposed bowling.feb counsel asked bowling where his cattle were then located feb had been unable to locate the cattle at any of the previous locations bowling had formerly permitted feb to inspect.bowling responded the cattle were either missing or stolen.upon receiving this information,feb contacted joe rector,a special ranger with the oklahoma state bureau of investigation osbi and field inspector with the texas and southwestern cattle raisers association,to investigate the cattle disappearance.
rector obtained documents relating to bowling loans and security agreements with feb,as well as records from local cattle barns.as part of his investigation,rector prepared an affidavit to search bowling home.the affidavit and an application for a warrant were presented to a kay county,oklahoma judge,who issued a warrant.rector subsequently searched bowling home with assistance from an osbi agent and tonkawa police department officers.
as a result of this investigation,rector discovered that beginning in february,bowling had sold much of his cattle at sale barns in oklahoma and kansas.many of these sales were made in the names of bowling mother and son.the proceeds from these sales were then allegedly deposited in bowling accounts at other banks not feb and were never remitted to.upon learning this information,feb contacted the federal bureau of investigation fbi and filed a suspicious activity report.
indictment on bank fraud and trial 
based upon the fbi independent investigation into bowling business dealings since the beginning of,bowling was indicted on one count of bank fraud,a violation of.the indictment alleged bowling february knowingly executed and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud feb in a material manner.app x,vol.i at.specifically,the government contended bowling,as part of his scheme,sold the cattle he had pledged to feb in names of other people,and then used the proceeds for his own personal benefit rather than applying the proceeds to his indebtedness at id.
at trial,bowling attempted to raise two defenses.first,he argued feb had waived its security interest in his cattle as well as in any proceeds as a matter of commercial law.feb loan officers testified on that bowling had never been required to obtain written permission from feb before any sales of his collateralized cattle despite the security agreements express terms otherwise.similarly,feb officers testified that bowling did not always have proceeds from these sales made payable to feb as a.bowling also admitted evidence that he had routinely made cattle sales in others names.
bowling argued feb,by not enforcing the specific terms of its security agreements,had waived its interest in his cattle and proceeds through its course of conduct over the previous decade.he relied on the uniform commercial code ucc as adopted by oklahoma to support this defense.according to bowling,if feb waived its interest in his cattle and the associated proceeds,he could not have engaged in a scheme to defraud feb by selling his cattle.he requested the district court submit jury instructions on this theory.the district court,determining the oklahoma ucc precluded a waiver based on a course of conduct,denied bowling request.
second,bowling requested a jury instruction on a good faith defense.he argued the evidence and testimony introduced at trial established that he had simply been operating his cattle ranching business in the same way he always had never obtained prior written permission from feb,he had previously made sales in other people names,and rarely had proceeds from those cattle sales issued in feb name.he contended this evidence suggested he did not have any intent to defraud.the district court refused to instruct the jury on this theory as well,concluding there is no evidence that the jury could apply this instruction to and it should not be given.app x,vol.iv at.
on november,a jury found bowling guilty of bank fraud.the district court subsequently sentenced bowling to months imprisonment,ordered a forfeiture of,and imposed in restitution.
ii.discussion 
bowling raises a series of challenges to his conviction and sentence.he contends the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal based on feb alleged waiver of its security interest in his cattle and proceeds excluding some of his proffered evidence and refusing to instruct the jury regarding his waiver theory refusing to instruct the jury on his good faith theory denying his motion to suppress evidence based on his challenges to rector authority to obtain a warrant and the impartiality of the state judge who issued the warrant denying his motion for a new trial and imposing the amount of restitution it did bowling also argues the district court accumulated errors warrant a reversal.
we address each argument in turn.
judgment of acquittal 
bowling first argues the district court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal.he contends the government needed to prove feb officers conduct had not waived the bank security interest in the cattle or in the proceeds from the sale of the cattle under commercial law to convict him of bank fraud and that the government failed to do so.we do not agree.
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see united states swanson,cir.
bowling was charged and convicted of bank fraud in violation of.under this provision 
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice 
to defraud a financial institution 
shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
to obtain a conviction under,the government must prove the following elements the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution the defendant had the intent to defraud a financial institution and the bank involved was federally insured.united states gallant,cir,cert.denied.the government does not have to prove the financial institution suffered a monetary loss,but only that the scheme to defraud put the institution at potential risk.see united states young,cir.and,the risk,potential risk,or risk of loss aspect is subsumed within the first element of swanson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
whether feb officers actions constituted a waiver under commercial law has no bearing on bowling criminal liability under.see bowling,app x at.bowling points to state dahmer,in support of this theory.but in that case the state bank fraud statute required a security interest in the property to be shown at the time of the alleged authorized transfer as an element of the offense.id.at.that is not the case with.and,besides,the government introduced evidence that bowling misrepresented his intentions with respect to the september consolidated loan,including whether the cattle would be available as collateral for the transaction.according to this testimony,bowling not only understood the cattle were securing the loan,but also understood that the proceeds from the sale were supposed to pay down his debts to.since the government proved a scheme or artifice to defraud,it was not also obligated to prove feb had an existing security interest in the cattle or the proceeds from the cattle sales to sustain a conviction.
bowling also contends the government should have proved the bank had a security interest since this was mentioned in the indictment.the indictment referenced security interest,collateral,and proceeds throughout its recitation of the alleged misconduct.see app x,vol.i at.we conclude reversal is not warranted on this basis.
a variance between the indictment and the proof is only reversible error if it is is,if it affects the substantial rights of the accused.united states carnagie,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.such a variance can prejudice a defendant sixth amendment right to notice of the charges against him if he could not have anticipated from the allegations in the indictment what the evidence would be at trial.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.here,bowling was fully aware of the charges brought against him and the factual circumstances alleged.further,he could fully anticipate the evidence to be used at,his representations to feb,his cattle dealings,and his use of the proceeds from the cattle sales.
accordingly,the district court did not err by denying bowling motion for a judgment of acquittal based on the government failure to demonstrate feb had a security interest in the cattle.
waiver theory 
bowling next contends the district court erred by excluding evidence and refusing to provide instructions to the jury regarding his ucc waiver argues the district court incorrectly concluded his waiver theory was unavailable as a matter of law.this contention relates to bowling argument the government was required to prove feb officers had not waived the bank security interest in the cattle or the proceeds of the cattle sale under commercial law to sustain a conviction.at trial,bowling attempted to assert feb waived its security interest and thus that he could not be convicted of bank fraud.
in our previous order and judgment,we rejected bowling ucc waiver argument.we can not fault the district court for refusing to admit evidence regarding feb waiver of its security interest because such evidence was not relevant see fed.evid.fed evid.relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.similarly,the district court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on the waiver theory,because any such instruction would have been an incorrect statement of the law.see united states,cir 
good faith instruction 
bowling next argues the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on his good faith theory.
in our previous order and judgment,we concluded bowling conviction should be reversed based solely on hopkins.our reversal recognized that hopkins mandated district courts provide separate good faith instructions in fraud cases where defendants advance the defense of good faith,request the instruction,and present sufficient evidence to support it.see at see also united states overholt,cir.we concluded bowling had submitted sufficient evidence to support his good faith theory.see bowling,app x at.we also determined bowling satisfied hopkins other elements.see id.accordingly,we held the district court failure to give a separate good faith instruction warranted reversal.see id.
subsequently,the government requested rehearing en banc regarding hopkins.the government request was granted and,sitting en banc,this court overturned hopkins.see bowling,order.we joined the majority of courts that hold a separate good faith instruction is no longer necessary where a district court properly instructs the jury on the element of intent,because a finding of the intent to defraud necessarily implies that there was no good faith.see id.internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.in full,we stated 
o ur prior decision in hopkins is overruled for two reasons.first,in the years since we issued hopkins,every one of our sister circuits has come to reject the idea that district courts must give a separate good faith jury instruction in fraud cases.as they have explained,and we agree,a separate good faith instruction is not necessary because a finding of the intent to defraud necessarily implies that there was no good faith.united states chavis,n cir cataloguing the views of every other circuit.second,while we indicated in hopkins that failure to give a good faith instruction was per se reversible error,the supreme court has since explained that a trial court failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense is subject to analysis.mitchell esparza,per curiam see also neder united states,a n instruction that omits an element of the offense does not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.a.
id.the overturning of hopkins thus affects our assessment of the good faith instruction issue in this case.
we review instructions as a whole to determine whether they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.see united states pinson,cir.a theory of defense instruction is required only if,without the instruction,the district court instructions were erroneous or inadequate.united states williams,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense where some evidence and the law supports the theory,such an instruction is not required if it would simply give the jury a clearer understanding of the issues.see id.we review a district court judge refusal to give a requested instruction under this standard for an abuse of discretion.see pinson,at.
as we held in our previous decision,bowling presented sufficient evidence to support his good faith theory see bowling,app x at.the district court did not commit reversible error by refusing to give bowling proposed good faith instruction,however,because the instruction he proffered would have only served to provide additional appreciation of the issues.
the district court instructions stated 
to find the defendant guilty of this crime you must be convinced that the government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt 
first the defendant knowingly executed a scheme or artifice to defraud the bank 
second the bank was a financial institution whose deposits were insured by the fdic 
third the defendant acted with intent to defraud the bank in a material manner and 
fourth the defendant placed the bank at risk of civil liability or financial loss 
a defendant acts with the requisite intent to defraud if the defendant acted knowingly and with the specific intent or purpose to deceive,ordinarily for the purpose of causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to the defendant.
when the word knowingly is used in these instructions,it means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally,and not because of mistake or accident 
app x,vol.iii at.the district court more than adequately its use and explanation of the term knowingly that the jury could not find bowling guilty of bank fraud if the jury found he acted in good faith.a separate good faith instruction was not necessary because a finding of the intent to defraud necessarily implies that there was no good faith.chavis,at citation omitted and,the district court charge to the jury provided a correct statement of the law.see gallant,at listing the elements that must be proved to sustain a conviction under.
bowling argues the intent instruction is too narrow to encompass his theory of defense.but these instructions are correct and complete as a matter of law.it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse additional instruction on this record.
accordingly,the district court decision not to give bowling requested good faith instruction was not in error.
suppression motion 
bowling further contends the district court erred in two ways by denying his motion to suppress.first,he challenges whether the special ranger investigating him possessed the legal authority to seek a search warrant,and,second,he claims the state judge was biased against him and should have recused himself from any role in issuing a search warrant.we find no fault in the district court determination.
we review the ultimate question of a search reasonableness under the fourth amendment de novo and any factual findings made by the district court for clear error.see united states basham,cir,cert.denied.in doing so,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see id.
special ranger 
bowling argues the fruits of the search conducted pursuant to the warrant special ranger rector obtained should have been suppressed,because rector did not have the authority to seek the warrant in the first place.bowling asserts rector exceeded his limited statutory authority as an osbi special ranger when he applied for a warrant to investigate bank fraud and the sale of mortgaged property,since oklahoma law dictates special rangers may only enforce laws pertaining to the larceny of livestock 
we considered this exact argument in addressing the suit bowling brought against rector relating to the warrant in question.see bowling rector,cir.our analysis of the issue in that case applies equally here.there,we noted a violation does not necessarily rise to the level of a fourth amendment violation.see id.at.we then found rector alleged violation of oklahoma law was not particularly relevant to assessing the validity of the warrant he obtained.see id.at.instead,we stated 
to be valid under the fourth amendment,the warrant to search bowling residence must meet three requirements it must have been issued by a neutral,disinterested magistrate those seeking the warrant must have demonstrated to the magistrate their probable cause to believe that the evidence sought would aid in a particular apprehension or conviction for a particular offense and the warrant must particularly describe the things to be seized,as well as the place to be searched.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.employing that test,based on rector affidavit,we concluded the warrant was constitutional,and that rector was prote
