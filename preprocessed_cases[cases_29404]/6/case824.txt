defendant appellant federal housing finance agency fhfa is the regulator and conservator of freddie mac and fannie mae the enterprises.the enterprises are entities that purchase and securitize residential mortgages.fhfa issued a directive preventing the enterprises from buying mortgages on properties encumbered by liens made under clean energy pace programs,which finance environmental improvements on residential properties and in return take an interest in those properties senior to any mortgagees interest.plaintiffs appellees,including the state of california and several of its counties,are stakeholders in pace programs.plaintiffs appellees contend that fhfa acted as a regulator,and not a conservator,when it directed the enterprises to cease purchasing mortgages on properties.and in acting as a regulator,plaintiffs appellees argued in the district court,fhfa would require more than a fiat to order the enterprises to stop buying mortgages on properties as a regulator,plaintiffs appellees contended,fhfa must issue a regulation to effectuate its order.
the district court entered a preliminary injunction requiring fhfa to complete a formal rulemaking under the administrative procedure act apa,et,in order to implement its directive on properties properly.fhfa appealed,and we stayed the injunction insofar as it required fhfa to issue a final rule.we then deferred any further action on fhfa appeal until after the district court ruled on the parties motions for summary judgment.the district court entered summary judgment in plaintiffs appellees favor,finding that fhfa failed to comply with the apa notice and comment requirement.the district court enjoined fhfa to complete rulemaking within days from the issuance of its judgment.fhfa again appealed.
we now conclude that fhfa decision to cease purchasing mortgages on properties is a lawful exercise of its statutory authority as conservator of the enterprises.because the courts have no jurisdiction to review actions that fhfa takes as conservator,we vacate the district court order and dismiss the case.
