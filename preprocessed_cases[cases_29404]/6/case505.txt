plaintiffs david tullis and michael mack are two physicians from toledo who maintained pension funds through the toledo clinic employees k profit sharing plan plan,an,defined contribution pension plan in the early,the plaintiffs chose william davis of continental capital corporation capital as their investment advisor.in october,the securities and exchange commission entered a temporary restraining order against capital because two of its brokers were engaged in fraudulent activities.the plaintiffs contend that the defendant,umb bank,which served as the trustee for the plan,knew of the fraud yet failed to inform them.
in april,the defendant bank filed suit against davis and a subsidiary of capital on behalf of the plan,alleging that several investments were improper,severely declined in value immediately after being purchased,or simply never took place.the plaintiffs allege that the defendant again failed to inform them of either davis or capital fraudulent activities,a required duty of a fiduciary.additionally,the defendant continued to accept and honor allegedly forged investment directives from davis without consulting or warning the plaintiffs.consequently,according to the complaint,the plaintiffs continued to maintain their investment account with davis.
in the spring of,a court order ended capital ability to conduct business and appointed the security investor protection program as trustee.during the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings,it was discovered that a number of davis investments were nonexistent.at this point,the plaintiffs discovered the full extent of the losses to the value of their pension plans.tullis alleges that as of february,umb bank represented the value of his retirement assets to be,while the actual value was,a difference of mack contends that on july,the defendant represented the value of his retirement assets to be.when mack attempted to withdraw those assets,however,he discovered that they were only worth,a difference of.
the plaintiffs initially filed suit against davis,capital,the defendant,and others in the lucas county court of common pleas.those cases were stayed pending the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings.the plaintiffs then requested that the toledo pension plan,which administers the k program,bring suit against the defendant for the bank alleged breach of fiduciary duties as an erisa trustee.the plan declined to do so,citing a master trust agreement mta that includes an indemnification clause holding the bank harmless from claims.consequently,the plaintiffs filed this action in the northern district of ohio on january.the defendant,in turn,filed a motion to dismiss.
the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss the plaintiffs case after finding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their erisa claims that erisa preempts any state law causes of action and that claims based on the securities exchange act did not meet the pleading requirements imposed by the private securities litigation reform act pslra.as to the standing to bring the breach of fiduciary duties claims,the district court agreed with the defendant that an action under erisa section a,a,had to be brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the plan as a whole and that the plaintiffs had only sought recovery for individual losses to their plan accounts.tullis umb bank,d,emphasis added.

plaintiffs standing under erisa 
the employee retirement income security act erisa governs employee benefit plans and establishes both the obligations of plan fiduciaries and the remedies for any breach of those duties.erisa permits civil actions to be brought by the secretary of labor,or by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section.see erisa a,a.erisa section,in turn,governs liability for breaches of fiduciary duty and reads in relevant part 
a any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this title shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach,and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary,and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate
