thereafter,on august,noname filed a motion to dismiss clerici panama lawsuit,alleging that clerici had failed to prosecute his civil lawsuit.on february,the panamanian court granted noname motion to dismiss clerici lawsuit,and the attachment of noname property was vacated.the resolution of clerici civil lawsuit was appealed and affirmed by panama first superior court of justice on november.
noname proceedings in panama 
on april,noname filed an incidental proceeding in the panamanian court claiming damages arising from clerici civil lawsuit and the attachment proceeding.specifically,noname alleged that it was a new business in panama and in the process of expanding,but that clerici lawsuit changed the commercial image of the company.noname alleged that clerici lawsuit negatively impacted noname credit with various banks and its image in the community,resulted in the denial of its request for an increase in credit,and led to lost sales and profits.on september,the panamanian court entered judicial decree,in which clerici was condemn ed to pay noname,in balboas in damages and in costs.thus,noname obtained a sizable foreign judgment against clerici in panama.
it is undisputed that noname foreign judgment against clerici has not been domesticated and is not currently enforceable in florida.while noname filed a domestication action,noname never pursued it

because clerici resided in the united states,noname petition suggested that the panamanian court obtain this evidence through the issuance of a letter rogatory 
the panamanian court granted noname petition,finding that 
the petition is based in the provisions of article of the judicial code,allowing the executant,when the obligation is not paid within the respective term,to interrogate the debtor,or request the judge to do it,in order that under oath he may answer the questions made in relation to his properties,rights,credits,sustenance means,source of income,as from the date of this claimed obligation.
because clerici resided in florida,the panamanian court issued a letter rogatory to the judicial authorities of the city of miami requesting assistance with obtaining answers from clerici,while under oath,to noname proposed questions.the panamanian court letter rogatory stated that the evidence obtained will be used in the civil process before this court,and the panamanian court cited as authority for its request the convention regarding letters rogatory the convention.the questions listed in the panamanian court letter rogatory were substantially similar to the questions proposed by noname 
section application in district court 
on october,the united states filed an ex parte application in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,pursuant to,for an order appointing an assistant united states attorney as a commissioner for the purpose of obtaining the evidence requested by the panamanian court in its letter rogatory.section a provides that the district court where clerici resides may order him to give his testimony or statement for use in a proceeding in a foreign tribunal.a on october,the district court granted the government application and appointed a commissioner to take such steps as are necessary to obtain the evidence in conformity with the letters rogatory.the commissioner then sent a letter to clerici requesting that he sit for a deposition to answer the panamanian court questions.
on december,clerici filed a memorandum in opposition to the government application.the district court construed clerici memorandum as a motion to vacate its previous order granting the application and appointing a commissioner.in the motion,clerici asserted that noname judgment against him is invalid,is being challenged in panama,and in any event,is unenforceable in florida because it has not been domesticated.clerici argued that the application should be denied because the panamanian court letter rogatory does not contain the necessary documentation under the terms of the convention and can not be used to enforce a foreign judgment pursuant to a letter rogatory.clerici also argued that,even if authorized the requested assistance,the district court should,in its discretion,decline to grant judicial assistance because the letter rogatory is an attempt to enforce a foreign judgment that has not been domesticated,and therefore,is unenforceable and the application is unduly intrusive.
in response,the government argued that its application for judicial assistance was properly made pursuant to despite the content of the panamanian court letter rogatory.the government explained that,although the letter rogatory claimed to be sent under the terms of the convention,a s a matter of comity and assistance to foreign litigants,it generally treated such mislabel ed requests for assistance as requests made pursuant to.
the government also emphasized that the panamanian court was not requesting that the district court enforce the foreign judgment.rather,the government pointed out that the panamanian court was seeking only assistance in obtaining evidence and that this was a proper use of.
the district court denied clerici motion to vacate.first,the district court found that,n otwithstanding the form used to draft the panamanian c ourt request,the application for judicial assistance was filed pursuant to,and therefore,did not have to comply with the requirements of the convention next,the district court rejected clerici argument that was being used to enforce a foreign judgment through a letter rogatory.instead,the district court found that the application and exhibits demonstrate clearly that the panamanian c ourt is seeking assistance in obtaining a sworn statement from clerici it is not requesting that the district court enforce the judgment noname received against him.the district court concluded that this was a proper request under for assistance in procuring evidence.finally,the district court declined to exercise its discretion to deny the requested assistance,noting that clerici still was free to argue against a domestication of the panamanian judgment in florida state court and to proceed with his appeal of the foreign judgment in panama.
as to the scope of the evidence requested,the district court noted that clerici had argued,in the alternative,that it was unduly intrusive but had failed to identify specifically the terms of the request which he contends are overly broad,a legal basis for these contentions,and how the scope of the request should be narrowed.the district court then denied clerici unduly intrusive argument without prejudice.the district court indicated that if clerici wished to pursue this argument,clerici shall file a motion to limit the scope of the request on or before monday,february.
clerici did not file a motion to limit the scope of the request.rather,on february,clerici timely appealed the district court order denying his motion to vacate the district court earlier order granting the government application for judicial assistance.clerici also moved for a stay pending appeal,which the district court granted.
ii.standard of review 
beginning in,congress substantially broadened the scope of assistance federal courts could provide for foreign proceedings,pursuant to.intel advanced micro devices,d reviewing at length the history of congressional efforts to provide judicial assistance to foreign tribunals and amendments designed to broaden the scope of.the history of section reveals congress wish to strengthen the power of district courts to respond to requests for international assistance.lo ka chun lo to,cir.
because congress has given the district courts such broad discretion in granting judicial assistance to foreign countries,this court may overturn the district court decision only for abuse of discretion.united kingdom united states,cir quotation marks omitted.this review is extremely limited and highly deferential.id.further,t his deferential standard is identical to that used in reviewing the district court ordinary discovery rulings.id.
however,to the extent the district court decision is based on an interpretation of law,our review is de novo.id.at.thus,this court reviews de novo the district court interpretation of a treaty or a federal statute such as.in re comm r subpoenas,cir.
iii.discussion 
a district court has the authority to grant an application for judicial assistance if the following statutory requirements in a are met the request must be made by a foreign or international tribunal,or by any interested person the request must seek evidence,whether it be the testimony or statement of a person or the production of a document or other thing the evidence must be for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal and the person from whom discovery is sought must reside or be found in the district of the district court ruling on the application for assistance.a if these requirements are met,then authorizes,but does not require,a federal district court to provide assistance intel,at.at see also united kingdom,at a district court compliance with a request is not mandatory.
here,clerici does not dispute that the panamanian court is a foreign tribunal or that he resides within the southern district of florida.therefore,the first and fourth requirements for a proper request under are met.
as to the second statutory the request must seek argues that the panamanian court is not seeking evidence,but rather is attempting to enforce its judgment through a request.we disagree because the panamanian court asked for assistance in obtaining only clerici sworn answers to questions regarding his assets and other financial matters.the district court recognized this key distinction and properly concluded that the request for assistance was limited to seeking evidence from clerici,and therefore,was proper under.unlike the requests for judicial assistance in the cases cited in clerici brief,see,in re letter rogatory issued by second part of iii civil reg l court of,sao paulo,wl,denying request to order to deposit into an account with the court tacul,hartford bank trust,quashing writ of execution against the assets of issued by the clerk based on a letter rogatory,the panamanian court never requested that the district court sequester,levy on,or seize control of clerici assets or otherwise help enforce noname judgment the panamanian court requested only assistance in obtaining answers from clerici to written this is the primary purpose of.therefore,the second requirement for a proper request under is met.
as to the third statutory requirement,we reject clerici contention that the requested evidence was not for use in a proceeding before the panamanian court.here,there is a proceeding currently pending before the panamanian court that allows noname or the panamanian court to question clerici under oath about his properties,rights,credits,sustenance means,and other sources of income from the date of his obligation.had clerici been residing in panama,noname or the panamanian court would have been able to interrogate clerici directly with the questions proposed by noname.because clerici was residing in florida,however,the panamanian court issued a letter rogatory seeking international assistance in order to obtain this evidence.the panamanian court letter rogatory itself stated that this evidence will be used in the civil process before this court.such a request is clearly within the range of discovery authorized under and comports with the purpose of the statute to provide assistance to foreign tribunals.
given the pending proceeding before the panamanian court,clerici is reduced to arguing that a proceeding means an adjudicative proceeding,and thus,noname petition regarding a judgment that already has been rendered is not a proceeding within the meaning of the statute.this argument is also without merit for several reasons first,only states that the evidence must be for use in a proceeding,and nothing in the plain language of requires that the proceeding be adjudicative in nature.see a.in fact,the statute specifically provides that the evidence obtained through can be used in criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation,even though such investigations are not adjudicative proceedings.id.emphasis added.
second,the supreme court has recognized the broad range of discovery authorized under and has held that is not limited to proceedings that are pending or imminent.intel,at.at see also hans smit,american assistance to litigation in foreign and international tribunals section of title of the revisited,syracuse int l com,the purpose of section is to liberalize the assistance given to foreign and international tribunals.rather,the proceeding for which discovery is sought need only be within reasonable contemplation.intel,at.at.here,the proceeding actually was filed before the letter rogatory was even issued,and the third statutory requirement for a proper request under is satisfied.
because all four statutory requirements are met,the panamanian court request for assistance in obtaining clerici sworn answers for use in the proceeding in panama was proper under accordingly,the district court had authority to grant the discovery application.
even so,a district court is not required to grant a a discovery application simply because it has the authority to do so.intel,at.at a district court compliance with a request is not mandatory.quoting united kingdom,at.once the prima facie requirements are satisfied,the supreme court in intel noted these factors to be considered in exercising the discretion granted under a whether the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding,because the need for a aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant the nature of the foreign tribunal,the character of the proceedings underway abroad,and the receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency abroad to judicial assistance whether the a request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the united states and whether the request is otherwise unduly intrusive or burdensome.id.at.at.the supreme court in intel added that unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed.id.at.at.
our review of the intel factors reveals that none of the factors favors clerici,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the application 
as to the first intel factor,because clerici is a party in the foreign proceeding,this factor normally would favor clerici and suggest that assistance is not necessary.see intel,at.at a foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it,and can itself order them to produce evidence.in this case,however,the first factor does not favor clerici because clerici has left panama and the panamanian court can not enforce its order against clerici directly while clerici is in the united states.given the particular factual circumstances in this case,the first intel factor does not favor clerici.
as to the second and third intel factors,there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court should have declined to grant the application based on the nature of the foreign tribunal or the character of the proceedings in panama,or that the panamanian court request is merely an attempt to circumvent foreign restrictions.rather,these factors all support the district court decision to grant the application given that the foreign tribunal here is the panamanian court and the panamanian court itself issued the letter rogatory requesting assistance due to clerici presence in the united states.
finally,as to the fourth intel the request is unduly district court order granting the application specifically indicated that if clerici wished to pursue his unduly intrusive argument,clerici should file a motion to limit discovery.clerici never did so and instead chose to appeal the grant of any discovery whatsoever.on appeal,as in the district court,clerici does not identify the terms of the written request that are overly broad or assert how the scope of the request should be narrowed.thus,we,like the district court,have no occasion to address the scope of the panamanian court discovery request.
in sum,the district court had authority to grant the application,and clerici has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in doing so.
federal rules of civil procedure 
clerici alternatively asserts that,even if the district court had authority to grant the discovery application under,rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure bars any discovery in this case.more specifically,clerici contends that any evidence must be obtained in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure federal rule a is applicable because the panamanian court is seeking discovery to aid noname in the execution of its judgment and no discovery is authorized under rule a until noname obtains a valid,domesticated judgment in this country.we agree that the discovery rules in the federal rules of civil procedure apply here but conclude that rule a does not.we explain why.
the district court authority to order clerici to give testimony for use in a proceeding in a foreign tribunal stems from.a.section a then provides that,in its order granting assistance,the district court may prescribe the practice and procedure for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing.id.emphasis added.this practice and procedure may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal.id.to the extent that the district court does not otherwise prescribe the practice and procedure,a provides that the testimony or statement shall be taken,and the document or other thing produced,in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.id.
here,the district court order did not prescribe the practice and procedure for taking clerici testimony.thus,under,this testimony must be taken in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.section a refers to the federal rules,not for whether the district court can order clerici to give any testimony,but only for the procedures or manner in which that testimony is to be taken.
once discovery is authorized under,the federal discovery rules,contain the relevant practices and procedures for the taking of testimony and the production of documents.for example,rule a authorizes the taking of testimony by deposition upon written questions and rule provides the specific practices and procedures for taking depositions upon written questions see.a.
in contrast,rule a provides the process by which a judgment creditor can enforce a money judgment and authorizes discovery in aid of execution of that judgment.a.rule a itself does not prescribe a practice and procedure for gathering evidence,but gives the judgment creditor the choice of federal or state discovery rules.rule a simply authorizes a setting,execution,in which discovery may take place,not the specific manner or procedures in which testimony should be taken or documents should be produced.id.because a refers to the federal rules only for the manner or procedure in which evidence is to be obtained,and rule a prescribes no such manner or procedure,rule a is inapplicable to orders.
even assuming arguendo that the discovery authorized by the district court order had to comply with rule a,clerici testimony still could be taken in this case as long as it was taken in accordance with the federal discovery rules.rule a itself expressly permits a judgment creditor to obtain discovery i n aid of the judgment or execution,and gives the judgment creditor the choice of federal or state discovery procedures to conduct discovery.a see also legrand,cir rejecting judgment debtor argument that state procedural rules apply to the determination of the discovery issue.thus,similar to,rule a gives a judgment creditor the option of taking a judgment debtor testimony in accordance with the federal discovery rules.nothing in rule a conflicts with.in any event,the request for judicial assistance here was made by the panamanian court after noname had obtained a judgment against clerici.at a minimum,nothing in rule a requires domestication of a foreign judgment before discovery is permitted under for use in a proceeding in a foreign tribunal.
moreover,imposing a requirement that a foreign judgment first must be domesticated in the united states before a application for assistance can be granted by the district court to a foreign court would render unnecessary in many circumstances.for example,in this case after clerici testimony is taken regarding his assets in panama if he has assets in panama,noname may be able to execute on its judgment in panama and have no need to domesticate its judgment in this country.
in sum,rule a does not bar the discovery authorized in this case by the district court order just because noname foreign judgment has not been domesticated in the united states.however,we do agree that until noname foreign judgment has been domesticated in this country,noname can not sequester,levy on,or seize control of,any assets of clerici in this country.further,although we affirm the district court order granting the application,clerici remains free to argue against domestication of the panamanian court judgment in this country when and if noname pursues domestication.
iv.conclusion 
for all of these re
