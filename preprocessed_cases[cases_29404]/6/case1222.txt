introduction 
the california corporations commissioner the commissioner,as the head of the department of corporations the department,issued an investigatory administrative subpoena duces tecum to financial management,and financial management collectively financial management pursuant to government code sections through and financial code section.through his subpoena,the commissioner sought various records from financial management relevant to his investigation regarding the company suspected violation of section et the prorater law.financial management refused to fully comply with the subpoena.among other objections,financial management objected to the request for records pertaining to its activities involving residents,on the ground that the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to investigate such activities.
the commissioner filed a petition in the trial court seeking an order compelling financial management to comply with the subpoena.the commissioner alleged that financial management is a california corporation and a company engaged in prorating with clients from both california and other states.in response,financial management claimed that the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to investigate its activities with residents.the trial court ordered financial management to fully comply with the commissioner subpoena,including providing documents pertaining to residents.
on appeal,financial management claims that the trial court erred in ordering it to comply with the commissioner subpoena.financial management sole argument is that the commissioner lacks jurisdiction to investigate its activities involving residents.we conclude that the commissioner has the authority to investigate conduct on the part of financial management,a california corporation whose principal place of business is in california,even where that conduct involves only nonresidents therefore,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in october,the commissioner filed a petition seeking an order compelling financial management compliance with a june,subpoena duces tecum.in his petition,the commissioner alleged that the department is responsible for administering and enforcing the prorater law 
the commissioner noted that a n individual or entity must first obtain a license from the commissioner before acting as a prorater,or be exempt.the commissioner alleged that financial management was acting as a prorater with both california and clients,without a license.
the commissioner stated that in july,the department properly served a subpoena duces tecum on financial management,requesting the production of certain documents in the course of an investigation into possible violations of the prorater law.the commissioner stated that the department received a letter from financial management attorney in august admitting that financial management had engaged in unlicensed prorating.
in september,financial management sent the commissioner a document entitled responses and objections to subpoena duces tecum,in which it outlined various grounds on which it based its refusal to produce certain documents.the commissioner further noted that financial management had failed and refused to produce any documents relevant to past and current prorating clients,in responding to the subpoena.
the commissioner supported his petition with,among other items,a brief setting forth legal points and authorities,a copy of the subpoena,various correspondence between the commissioner and financial management regarding financial management obligations pursuant to the subpoena,financial management responses and objections to the subpoena,and a declaration attesting to the commissioner efforts to gain financial management compliance with the subpoena.
in its opposition to the commissioner petition,financial management stated,although financial management ha s debt settlement clients who are california residents,and financial management office is in san diego,financial management conduct s most of its business outside of california with its resident debt settlement clients.financial management argued that the commissioner did not have the authority to regulate occurrences outside the state,but did not specify which of the commissioner requests sought information related to such occurrences.financial management also argued that the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to investigate any of its activities with respect to residents.
financial management supported its opposition with,among other items,a declaration from its president,john tran.in his declaration,tran stated that financial management operates a debt settlement business.tran explained,in simple form,a debt settlement company negotiates with creditors for creditors to accept a lump sum payoff of a consumer debt,the lump sum being at a lower amount than what is owed to the creditor.tran explained that a creditor may be willing to accept such a payoff because the consumer is often in a position to file for bankruptcy protection.tran stated although financial management ha s debt settlement clients who are california residents,and financial management office is in san diego,most of financial management customers reside outside of california and,therefore,most of financial management business occurs outside of california.
in his reply to financial management opposition,the commissioner noted that financial management web site indicates that its headquarters is located in san diego,california.the commissioner claimed,as a prorater,all of financial management activities originate from california.the commissioner argued,t he department has the authority to request and review documents relating to financial management prorating activities with respect to both california and merely to determine whether those business activities are within the department jurisdiction 
in november,the trial court heard oral argument on the matter.after hearing argument,the court stated that it would grant the petition.on december,the court entered an order entitled order to produce number one.the trial court ordered financial management to produce the documents requested by the commissioner subpoena duces tecum,including a list containing the contact information of past and current prorating clients,executed applications,contracts or other agreements entered into between financial management and past and current prorating clients,documents reflecting payment of settlement fees by past and current prorating clients,and scripts,brochures,advertising materials,summaries,booklets,illustrations,and other documents describing financial management services to past and current prorating clients 
financial management timely appeals from the trial court order to produce number one.
discussiona.the trial court order to produce number one is appealable as a final judgment 
at the outset,we address whether this court has appellate jurisdiction to consider financial management appeal.
in state ex rel.of pesticide regulation pet food express th,d state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,the court noted,confusion exists regarding appealability of orders enforcing administrative subpoenas,at,d compare,millan rest.enters.group,th,d millan holding that the better view is that orders requiring compliance with the subpoenas are appealable as final judgments in special proceedings,with bishop merging capital,th,d bishop concluding that orders compelling compliance with administrative subpoenas are not appealable.
the bishop court noted that an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena is not an appealable order.bishop,supra,th at,d.further,the bishop court suggested that such an order is not a final judgment,in light of the possibility of subsequent contempt proceedings to gain compliance with the order.see id.at,d stating that any ruling rendered by this court would be in the nature of an advisory opinion,in light of the possibility of subsequent contempt proceedings.
in following millan and implicitly rejecting bishop,the court in state ex rel.of pesticide regulation concluded that an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena is appealable as a final judgment 
a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.citation.the statutory scheme citation provides for an original proceeding in the superior court,which results in an order directing the respondent to comply with the administrative subpoena.citations.the court order enforcing the administrative subpoena is tantamount to a superior court judgment in mandamus which,with limited exceptions,is appealable under code of civil procedure section.citation.whether the matter is properly characterized as an action citation or a special proceeding citation,it is a final determination of the parties rights.it is final because it leaves nothing for further judicial determination between the parties except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with its terms.citation.the fact that an intransigent respondent may be subject to a contempt order does not mean the court order is not final,because the same possibility exists with injunctions and final judgments which form the basis for contempt citations.the purpose of any judicial order which commands or prohibits specific conduct is to make the sanction of contempt available for disobedience.this fact does not render such an order nonfinal.indeed,the contempt judgment is not appealable but must be reviewed,if at all,by writ,and therefore review of the underlying order can reliably be had only if that order is appealable.citation.state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,supra,th at,d.
the state ex rel.of pesticide regulation court rejected the argument that an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena is akin to a nonappealable discovery order 
we reject the department argument that we should analogize to discovery orders in civil litigation,which are not considered final,appealable orders.such discovery orders,however,are made in connection with pending lawsuits which have yet to be resolved.a discovery order does not determine all of the parties rights and liabilities at issue in the litigation.the department argues the same applies here,because even with the documents,the department can not impose administrative penalties unless an administrative hearing is held if such a hearing is requested.however,it is possible an administrative hearing may not be requested and,even if it is requested,it will not necessarily end up in court.fn.omitted.in contrast to this case,pending civil litigation in which a discovery order occurs already involves the court and will continue to do so.state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,supra,th at,d.
we agree with the court analysis in state ex rel.of pesticide regulation.in this case,the trial court order compelling compliance with the commissioner administrative subpoena constituted a final determination of the parties rights,notwithstanding the possibility that further proceedings might be required to gain financial management compliance with that order.see state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,supra,th at,d.as such,the order constitutes an appealable final judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.see state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,supra,th at,d.
by failing to raise the argument below,the commissioner forfeited his right to argue that financial management is required to exhaust its administrative remedies 
in his respondent brief,the commissioner claims that financial management appeal should be dismissed on the ground that it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.citing public employment relations bd.superior court th,d,the commissioner further argues that financial management must wait to raise its jurisdictional objections to the commissioner subpoena until the completion of any administrative proceeding that the commissioner may take based upon his investigation.
in,the court held 
t he scope of judicial authority to inquire into the jurisdiction of an agency,as a predicate to denial of enforcement of an administrative subpoena,is governed by the general doctrine concerning the exhaustion of administrative remedies.a subpoena should be enforced regardless of objections based upon claimed defenses to the charges in the administrative proceeding unless those claims present a sufficient ground to overcome the ordinary rule that a litigant may not pursue a judicial remedy until the administrative agency has reached a final decision.otherwise the doctrine concerning exhaustion would function fitfully,permitting litigants to or cripple administrative proceedings based upon the happenstance that obtaining evidence needed to advance the administrative proceeding requires the assistance of the courts in enforcing a subpoena,supra,th at,d.
while the court noted that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies generally applies in proceedings involving an administrative subpoena,the court also noted that,there are numerous exceptions to the rule including situations where the agency indulges in unreasonable delay,when the subject matter lies outside the administrative agency jurisdiction,when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm,when the agency is incapable of granting an adequate remedy,and when resort to the administrative process would be futile because it is clear what the agency decision would be.id.at,d,quoting green city of oceanside d.green.
we need not decide whether to follow,nor whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine requires dismissal of this appeal,because the commissioner failed to raise his claim of failure to exhaust administrative remedies in the trial court.the commissioner has thus forfeited his right to assert this argument on appeal.see mokler county of orange th,d mokler the county may not assert exhaustion of administrative remedies for the first time on appeal,italics omitted.
in mokler,the court noted that although earlier cases tended to view the exhaustion doctrine as invalidating a court subject matter jurisdiction,thus allowing a defendant to raise it at any time,more recent cases have followed green,supra,d at page,in concluding a defendant waives the defense by failing to timely assert it.mokler,supra,th at,d.while the supreme court in abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira,declared the exhaustion of administrative remedies to be jurisdictional mokler,supra,th at,d,the mokler court held,this does not mean a party may raise the issue for the first time on appeal.ibid.this is because the abelleira court did not hold that the exhaustion doctrine implicated a court subject matter jurisdiction mokler,supra,th at,d.rather,the doctrine is a fundamental rule of procedure laid down by courts of last resort,followed under the doctrine of stare decisis,and binding upon all courts.mokler,supra,th at,d,quoting abelleira,supra,cal d at.
the mokler court further noted that there are strong jurisprudential reasons for requiring a litigant who wishes to assert the exhaustion doctrine to raise the claim in the trial court 
application of the exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine may require a qualitative analysis on a basis with concentration on whether a p aramount need for agency expertise outweighs other factors.citations.application of a procedural doctrine subject to numerous exceptions and which may require analysis is not the sort of issue which should fall outside the general rule of civil litigation that arguments and objections not raised and preserved in the trial court are waived on appeal.mokler,supra,th at,d,quoting green,supra,d at.
we find the mokler court reasoning to be persuasive.accordingly,we conclude that by failing to raise the claim in the trial court,the commissioner has forfeited his claim that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies in this case.
c.the trial court properly ordered financial management to comply with the commissioner subpoena 
financial management claims that the commissioner lacks jurisdiction under the prorater law to investigate its activities with respect to residents.financial management further contends that both conflict of law principles,and the federal constitution,preclude the commissioner from undertaking such an investigation.financial management claims that the trial court therefore erred in ordering it to comply with the commissioner subpoena,insofar as the subpoena seeks records pertaining to financial management transactions with residents.
we review de novo,as a question of law,whether the trial court erred in compelling financial management compliance with the commissioner subpoena.see state ex rel.of pesticide regulation,supra,th at,d accord karuk tribe housing authority cir.
the commissioner has jurisdiction under the prorater law to investigate financial management activities with respect to residents 
financial management claims that the commissioner lacks jurisdiction under the prorater law to investigate its activities with respect to residents financial management contends that the presumption against the extraterritorial application of laws applies because the prorater law does not expressly state that it governs transactions involving nonresidents.
governing law 
i the commissioner investigatory powers under the government code 
government code section provides the head of each department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning a all matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department.in order to conduct such an investigation,an agency may i ssue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers,books,accounts,documents,any writing as defined by section of the evidence code,tangible things,and testimony pertinent or material to any inquiry,investigation,hearing,proceeding,or action conducted in any part of the state,subd.e.
ii the prorater law 
section defines a prorater under the law.see part ii,fn,ante.section provides a list of the persons and types of transactions that are exempt from the scope of the law.for example,services offered by persons licensed to practice law,subd.c,and services provided by persons licensed as certified public accountants,subd.i may be exempt.particular types of transactions may also be subject to an exemption.see,subds.d,h providing the prorater law does not apply to,a ny transaction in which money or other property is paid to a joint control agent for disbursal or use in payment of the cost of labor,materials,services,permits,fees,or other items of expense incurred in construction of improvements upon real property,or a common law or statutory assignment for the benefit of creditors or the operation or liquidation of property or a business enterprise under supervision of a creditor committee.section provides,in any proceeding under this law,the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.
section requires persons who propose to engage in prorating to obtain a license from the commissioner 
no person shall engage in the business,for compensation,of selling checks,drafts,money orders,or other commercial paper serving the same purpose,or of receiving money as agent of an obligor for the purpose of paying bills,invoices,or accounts of such obligor,or acting as a prorater,nor shall any person,without direct compensation and not as an authorized agent for a utility company,accept money for the purpose of forwarding it to others in payment of utility bills,without first obtaining a license from the commissioner.
sections through contain numerous provisions that regulate the practice of prorating.see,prohibiting proraters from charging various fees,requiring that creditors be given notice of the services being provided by a prorater.
the prorater law specifically authorizes the commissioner to conduct investigations and issue subpoenas.section provides for the purpose of discovering violations of this division the commissioner may at any time investigate the business and examine the books,accounts,records,and files used therein,of any licensee,of any agent,and of any person who the commissioner has reason to believe is engaging in the business defined in this division.section,subdivision b provides for the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this section,the commissioner or any officer designated by the commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations,subpoena witnesses,compel their attendance,take evidence,and require the production of any books,papers,correspondence,memoranda,agreements,or other documents or records the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry.
section also outlines in part the commissioner investigatory powers.that section provides in relevant part 
a the commissioner may do the following,at his or her discretion 
make public or private investigations within or outside of this state necessary to determine whether any person has violated,or is about to violate,any provision of this division or any rule or order promulgated pursuant to this division,or to aid in the enforcement of the law.
iii the presumption against the extraterritorial application of law 
in diamond multimedia systems,superior court of santa clara county cal th,d,diamond multimedia systems,the california supreme court described the presumption against extraterritoriality,as outlined in north alaska salmon pillsbury cal,
in north alaska salmon pillsbury a worker who entered into a contract with a california corporation for employment as a fisherman was injured in alaska.the industrial accident commission awarded compensation.on the employer appeal this court annulled the award,holding that the right to compensation was controlled by the applicable statutes,not the contract,and the statute did not give the commission jurisdiction to award compensation for injuries.
the court also stated although a state may have the power to legislate concerning the rights and obligations of its citizens with regard to transactions occurring beyond its boundaries,the presumption is that it did not intend to give its statutes any extraterritorial effect.the intention to make the act operative,with respect to occurrences outside the state,will not be declared to exist unless such intention is clearly expressed or reasonably to be inferred from the language of the act or from its purpose,subject matter or history.north alaska salmon pillsbury,supra,cal.at.we found nothing in the workmen compensation,insurance and safety act,to indicate that the compensation provisions of that law were intended to apply to injuries suffered in other jurisdictions and also noted that there was strong authority that workers compensation statutes are not to be given extraterritorial effect absent an express declaration that do so.on that basis we held that the commission had exceeded its jurisdiction.id.at.diamond multimedia systems,supra,cal th at,d.
the diamond multimedia systems,court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality did not preclude a resident from prevailing on a cause of action alleging a violation of corporations code section based on conduct occurring in california 
the presumption applied in north alaska salmon pillsbury to a workers compensation statute has never been applied to an injured person right to recover damages suffered as a result of an unlawful act or omission committed in california.fn.omitted.civil code section provides that e very person who suffers detriment from unlawful acts or omissions in california may recover damages from the person at fault.product liability actions against california manufacturers by persons injured elsewhere by a defective product manufactured in california are a prime example of actions authorized by civil code section.citations.we see no reason to conclude that the legislature intended a different result for actions based on violation of section.diamond multimedia systems,supra,cal th at,d.
application 
the prorater law contains broad language concerning both those persons who fall within its scope,and the commissioner investigatory powers.see.none of these provisions,nor any other provision of the prorater law,states that the law is inapplicable to transactions involving residents.financial management does not contend otherwise,and does not claim that any specific provision of the prorater law precludes the commissioner from investigat
