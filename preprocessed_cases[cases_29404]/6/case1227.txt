introduction 
plaintiff and appellant westamerica bank filed an amended complaint against defendants and respondents michelle ross and mbg industries,for breach of contract when respondents defaulted on a line of credit respondents filed a against appellant,alleged appellant refused to renew or extend the line of credit because of gender discrimination against ross,and raised causes of action based on state and federal laws.respondents extended a pretrial offer to compromise pursuant to code of civil procedure section,only as to the allegations of appellant amended complaint on the money owed on the defaulted note,and not on the gender discrimination issues raised by their.as we will explain,section is a statute which encourages the settlement of actions,by penalizing parties who fail to accept reasonable pretrial settlement offers.a plaintiff who refuses a reasonable pretrial settlement offer and subsequently fails to obtain a more favorable judgment is penalized by a loss of prevailing party costs and an award of costs in the defendant favor.heritage engineering construction,city of industry th,d.an offer made by one party to any other party to the action must allow judgment to be taken in order to be valid under section,subd.b.
appellant did not accept respondents offer.the court subsequently granted appellant motion for summary judgment on the.thereafter,the parties entered into a stipulated judgment in appellant favor on the amended complaint,but on terms not as favorable as the terms of respondents previous offer to settle.the trial court found respondents offer to settle only the amended complaint was valid to trigger the provisions of section,and granted respondents motion for postoffer attorney fees and costs.
we are presented with the question of whether respondents offer to settle only the amended complaint was valid under section,even though it would have left a pending between the identical parties unresolved,or whether it would have allow ed judgment to be taken against respondents on the amended complaint,subd.b.we will review the purposes behind the various statutory and legal principles raised in this case,and conclude that respondents offer to settle only the amended complaint was valid to trigger the provisions of section,even though it would not have resulted in an appealable final judgment,because it was an offer to the other party in the separate and independent action of the amended complaint which would have allowed judgment to be taken,subd.b.
in december,michael ross formed and operated pacific control company in fresno,which provided commercial electrical contracting and installation of electrical controls.michelle ross,his wife,was an employee of the company and served as its office and business manager.

respondents 
on november,united security bank issued a conditional commitment to respondents for a revolving line of credit,pending an appraisal of business real property.on november,respondents notified appellant of united security bank conditional loan commitment,and that respondents intended to use the loan from united security bank to satisfy appellant claims in the amended complaint.
on december,respondents filed an answer to the amended complaint and denied the allegations.on the same day,respondents filed a against appellant.respondents alleged that after ross death,ross and mbg applied for and sought an extension of the line of credit from appellant using the same and additional collateral as to the existing line of credit,appellant refused to extend the terms or the maturity date,refused to accept interest payments,and instead filed suit for breach of contract.respondents alleged they were qualified for the credit for which they applied,and subsequently obtained a line of credit from united security bank.
respondents alleged appellant denied the extension request because of ross gender,that ross was of equal credit stature as ross,ross repeatedly obtained extensions and increased his line of credit from to,and ross succeeded to all of ross interest in mbg and pacific control after his death,such that mbg became a corporation.
despite their equal financial and credit worthy status,michelle ross and her company,mbg industries,were denied credit.michael ross,a male,was extended credit and treated more favorably than michelle ross,a female and mbg industries,a female owned business in the application and credit consideration process by westamerica bank.
respondents alleged ross subsequent receipt of the line of credit from united security bank was further evidence of the credit worthiness of ross and mbg.
michelle ross and mbg industries,allege,on information and belief,that other males or married females of similar credit worthiness and credit stature were given loans or were treated more favorably by westamerica bank than were michelle ross and her company,mbg industries,in the credit application and consideration process.
respondents raised three causes of action against appellant,all of which alleged appellant denied ross request to extend the line of credit because of her protected status as a female and mbg status as a business,there was no rational,economic or other business reason to justify the decision,and a male managing and controlling the same amount of earnings and assets would have received credit.

respondents requested acceptance of the offer prior to the beginning of trial or within days,whichever occurred first,or it would be deemed withdrawn.
as we will discuss post,respondents stated that they made the section offer b ased on the accounting provided as to the remaining amount due on the note,minus appellant claim for attorney fees and costs.respondents allege the section offer allowed judgment to be taken on the complaint in the amount of,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs,if recoverable,as determined by the court.also according to respondents,they were willing to pay the claimed amount still due on the note,but not inclined to pay what they believed were exorbitant and absolutely unnecessary attorneys fees.
as we will discuss post,the parties agree that respondents section offer was only to settle all issues in appellant amended complaint for the default on the line of credit,and the offer did not extend to the legal claims raised in respondents.the parties also agree that appellant did not respond to respondents offer and it lapsed.
resolution of respondents 
on june,appellant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the second cause of action in respondents.on july,appellant filed a motion for summary judgment or adjudication of the first,second,and third causes of action in respondents.
on august,the court granted appellant motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action in respondents.
on october,the court granted appellant motion for summary judgment on respondents,and found no triable issues of material fact existed as to any of the three causes of action in the.as to the first and third causes of action,violations of the unruh civil rights act and the equal credit opportunity act,the court found mbg financial status presented a nondiscriminatory reason for appellant denial of the request to extend the line of credit.the court found that as of july,the balance sheet which mbg submitted with its loan application to appellant showed it had a negative shareholder equity in excess of and a negative net profit of for the first seven months of.mbg net loss for was.the balance sheet also indicated a loan of to mbg from either michelle ross or michael ross.in august or september mbg borrowed money from its shareholder to meet its ongoing business operations.
the court further found while mbg and ross attempt to show that appellant decision not to extend credit was a prohibited discriminatory practice,they offer little in the form of direct evidence.appellant thus presented creditable,and,justification for denying mbg credit application.mbg and ross have not presented substantial evidence to refute appellant evidence.as to the second cause of action,discriminatory denial of credit,the court found ross never applied for,nor was denied,credit in her own name,and the credit application clearly indicated the applicant was mbg.
on october,the court entered judgment on the in favor of appellant and against respondents,and deemed appellant the prevailing party on the.on november,the notice of entry of judgment on the was filed.
resolution of the amended complaint 
on january,the parties entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment on appellant amended complaint.the parties stipulated that judgment would be entered in the amended complaint,in favor of appellant and against respondents for,as of november,plus daily interest.the stipulated judgment included a provision for attorney fees and costs 
the court will determine the prevailing party with respect to any attorney fees costs incurred by the parties hereto.any memorandum of costs motion for attorney fees shall be made in accordance with california law.
the stipulated judgment stated that respondents had asserted certain claims for abuse of process against appellant arising out of the superior court action.appellant denied those claims,and respondents presently intend to pursue those claims in a separate action the stipulation did not address any issues arising from the alleged abuse of process claim.
on january,a judgment pursuant to stipulation was filed in favor of appellant,and against respondents,jointly and severally,for,plus daily interest.it was further ordered that appellant was entitled to possession of mbg personal property,consisting of all accounts,equipment,and proceeds.if appellant levied on the personal property,the net proceeds of mbg personal property shall be applied to satisfy the judgment,with any excess remitted to the judgment debtor.on january,the notice of entry of the judgment pursuant to stipulation was filed.
respondents motions for costs and attorney fees 
as explained ante,on january,respondents served appellant with a section offer to compromise on all issues in appellant amended complaint for.at the time of the offer,both the amended complaint and the were still at issue.the parties agree that respondents offer was not addressed to any issues arising from respondents,and appellant did not respond to the offer.after the resolution of the amended complaint and,as set forth ante,the parties filed various motions for attorney fees and costs.
on february,respondents filed a motion to tax costs and alleged they were the prevailing party on the amended complaint pursuant to section because appellant failed to accept a valid offer to compromise,appellant did not obtain a more favorable judgment,and appellant was not entitled to postoffer costs incurred on the amended complaint after january.respondents set forth the procedural history of its failed attempts to extend the line of credit with appellant,that united security bank issued a line of credit for,and,on january,respondents used that loan to pay appellant on the outstanding note.respondent asserted that it requested an accounting from appellant as to the remaining amounts due on the note,and appellant advised them that it was claiming was due on the note,which included in attorney fees and costs.
according to respondents,they were willing to pay the claimed amount on the note,but not inclined to pay what they believed were exorbitant and absolutely unnecessary attorneys fees.respondents asserted that its section offer to appellant on january,was b ased on the accounting provided as to the remaining amount due on the note,minus the claimed attorney fees and costs.respondents alleged the section offer allowed judgment to be taken on the complaint in the amount of,plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs,if recoverable,as determined by the court.
respondents acknowledged the stipulated judgment on the amended complaint was for,plus daily interest.respondents cited to the deposition testimony of larry larison of westamerica,who stated that as of january,the principal amount due on the note was and that as january,the total amount due on the note was,excluding claimed fees and costs.
the stipulated judgment amount superficially exceeds the offered in the section offer,but is merely reflective of the interest that accrued on the note between january,and november.simple math and the testimony of larison establish that due to the section offer,appellant is not the prevailing party.
based on these circumstances,respondents argued they were the prevailing party on the amended complaint because they submitted a valid section offer to settle all issues raised in the amended complaint,the offer exceeded the actual amount owed on the note,appellant inexplicably failed to accept the offer,and the amount of the stipulated judgment did not exceed the offer.
respondents acknowledged that appellant would argue the january,offer was not valid under section because it only addressed the legal claims raised in appellant amended complaint,and did not address any causes of action alleged in respondents.however,respondents argued a section offer could be made only on the amended complaint and still be valid,section only required service of an offer that would allow judgment to be taken on an action,a complaint was a separate action,and the one final judgment rule did not apply to section offers.
on february,appellant filed a motion to strike respondents memorandum of costs and argued appellant was the prevailing party on the amended complaint with a net monetary recovery,as defined in section,subdivision b,and respondents failed to establish appellant liability for costs and fees.
on february,respondents filed a motion for postoffer attorney fees and again argued they were the prevailing parties on the amended complaint pursuant to section because of appellant failure to accept the january,offer to compromise,and respondents could recover postoffer costs under section,and postoffer attorney fees under civil code section and the terms of the promissory note and the stipulated judgment.
respondents argued the section offer had to be evaluated based on the amount which was due on the note at the time of that offer w hether the plaintiff has obtained a more favorable judgment is determined at the time of the offer,and damages incurred after the time of the offer do not allow the plaintiff to avoid section penalty.citation.judged against the amount owed on the note at the time of the offer,westamerica failed to obtain a more favorable judgment.
in addition,respondents argued they were entitled to postoffer attorney fees pursuant to both section and civil code section,because attorney fees are considered costs under sections and,and the penalty applies to attorneys fees.respondents claimed attorney fees of.
on march,appellant filed opposition to respondents motion to tax costs.appellant argued section contemplated a settlement offer which would result in one final judgment,respondents offer was limited to the amended complaint and excluded the,and acceptance of that offer would not have resulted in a final judgment to resolve the entire lawsuit between the parties.
on march,appellant filed a motion to fix attorney fees as costs pursuant to civil code section.appellant noted the stipulated judgment on the amended complaint provided that the court would determine the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees and costs,and appellant was the prevailing party on both the amended complaint and the.in addition,the july agreement and the security agreement,upon which appellant sued,provided for an award of attorney fees if respondents did not pay the underlying indebtedness.appellant claimed attorney fees of.
the court tentative ruling 
on march,the trial court issued a tentative ruling on the competing motions to tax costs,and noted the issue was whether respondents section offer was valid even though it only addressed the amended complaint and did not resolve the entirety of the action.the court held appellant reliance on the one final judgment rule was incorrect and appellant erroneously relied on cases which addressed the appealability of final judgments,as opposed to the application of a section offer.
a final judgment is not necessarily the last one in an action.a judgment that is conclusive of any question in a case is final as to that question.the code provides for an appeal from a final judgment,not from the final judgment in an action.sharon sharon cal.code of civil procedure section states an appeal may be had f rom a judgment,it does not refer to the final judgment in an action.
here the resolution of appellant contract claims against respondents was not dependent upon a resolution of respondents for discrimination.the cases cited by appellant are therefore distinguishable.people ex rel.department of public works clausen d.italics in original.
the court held respondents offer was valid under section,and appellant rejection of that offer precludes it from recovering its costs.
the court also determined appellant did not obtain a more favorable judgment and was not entitled to its postoffer costs.the court explained that respondents section offer included recovery of appellant costs and attorney fees,upon determination by the court,as well as payment of.elite show services,staffpro,th,d.respondents have established that at the time of the offer,january,appellant was claiming the amount then due,including interest was.the court noted that when a section offer includes costs,it is compared with the judgment,including preoffer costs and attorney fees.in this case,those costs and fees were to be later determined by the court.
the court also granted respondents claim for postoffer attorney fees,and noted the prevailing party was entitled to attorney fees under the terms of the note.respondents had established that appellant did not obtain a more favorable judgment after rejecting respondents offer,which entitled respondents to their postoffer costs,including attorney fees under civil code section.the court limited those fees to reasonable attorney fees incurred solely as a result of defending appellant contractual causes of action,and not those fees incurred in prosecuting the separate and distinct causes of action in respondents.
the court ordered certain costs and attorney fees claimed by respondent stricken because they were not allowable or reasonably related to the contractual cause of action.the court awarded to respondents as reasonable attorney fees incurred after appellant rejected the section offer.
on april,appellant filed further briefing,challenged the correctness of the court tentative ruling,and argued the actual judgment was more favorable than respondents offer because the judgment on the amended complaint was for money and possession of respondents personal property.thus,appellant was entitled to actual possession of the equipment listed in the judgment,as opposed to a simple money judgment.thus,appellant obtained a more favorable judgment than that offered by respondents,and appellant was the prevailing party for purposes of sections and.
the court hearing 
on april,the court conducted a hearing on the validity of the section offer and the parties restated their positions.appellant argued respondents offer would not have resolved the entire litigation between the parties and was not valid under section.appellant asserted the court tentative ruling,which found the offer valid under section,stated a position never taken by any court on this issue.appellant insisted that a section offer must resolve all aspects of the litigation between the parties in order to be consistent with the legislative purpose of resolving lawsuits.respondents countered the amended complaint was a separate action,their offer would have completely resolved the amended complaint,and the offer was valid under section.the court took the matter under submission.
the court order 
on may,the court issued its order and found respondents made a valid offer under section to resolve appellant lawsuit against them,even though it would not have settled the pending.
appellant rejection of that offer,and its failure to obtain a more favorable judgment in its favor,precludes it from recovering its attorney fees and costs,related to the litigation of appellant complaint.appellant rejection of that offer,and its failure to obtain a more favorable judgment,entitles respondents to the recovery of their attorney fees and costs related to litigation of appellant complaint.
the court awarded to appellant as its reasonable preoffer attorney fees,and as allowable preoffer costs.the court noted that at the hearing,respondents conceded they had previously claimed costs that were not related to appellant amended complaint and the court disallowed those claims.the court awarded to respondents as reasonable postoffer attorney fees,and as postoffer costs.
thereafter,appellant field a motion for new trial and argued the court ruling was contrary to the facts and law.respondents filed opposition.on august,the court denied appellant motion for new trial without comment.on august,the court filed the order denying the new trial motion.on september,the notice of entry of order was filed.
on september,appellant filed a timely notice of appeal of the court orders of may,august,and august.
issues on appeal 
the instant appeal essentially presents one issue whether the trial court properly found that respondents offer to compromise of january,was a valid offer under section to support the court award of postoffer attorney fees and costs to respondents,or whether appellant correctly asserts the offer was not valid under section because it only addressed the allegations in the amended complaint,it did not resolve the pending,and it would have violated the one final judgment rule.appellant raises this issue in the context of its new trial motion,and contends the court should have granted the new trial motion based on its erroneous legal determination of the prevailing party.
the contested appellate issue is easily phrased but difficult to answer,and has not been directly addressed by a published case.we must thus proceed step by step scott blount,cal th,d,through various provisions of the code of civil procedure,and examine the nature of complaints,prevailing parties,attorney fees and costs,and judgments.
discussion 
fees,costs,and section 
we begin with basic legal principles underlying awards of attorney fees and costs in civil litigation.the costs of a civil action consist of the expenses of litigation,usually excluding attorney fees.under the common law rule,parties to litigation must bear their own costs.the right to recover any of such costs is determined entirely by statute.it is axiomatic that the right to recover costs is purely statutory,and,in the absence of an authorizing statute,no costs can be recovered by either party.citations.davis,cal th,d,see lockheed martin th,d.
this general rule is subject to numerous exceptions,including those found in section,subdivision b,which provides that unless otherwise statutorily prohibited,the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs.the primary statutory provision with respect to the types of expenses that may or may not be included in a cost award under section is found in section of that code.ripley pappadopoulos th,d see,supra,th at,d.prevailing party includes the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not,subd.a.however,section does not purport to define the term prevailing party for all purposes.galan wolfriver holding th,d.
the costs allowed under section do not include the attorney fees which the prevailing party has incurred in the litigation.lourdeaux th,d.section provides that attorney fees are allowable as costs under section when authorized by contract,statute,or law,including civil code section,subds.a a c,c.
when authorized by contract,the right to attorney fees is made reciprocal by civil code section,which states 
in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs,subd.a.
as applicable to the instant case,the parties entered into two agreements which contained attorney fees clauses.the july agreement,in which appellant extended a line of credit to ross,provided for the borrower to pay the lender attorney fees and costs if the lender hired someone to enforce the obligation.appellant filed the amended complaint against respondents to recover the amount owed under the agreement given respondents default.the parties subsequently entered into a stipulated judgment which resolved the amended complaint in appellant favor,and also provided for the court to determine the prevailing party with respect to any attorney fees costs incurred by the parties hereto.
as explained ante,the trial court granted appellant motion for summary judgment as to all claims in respondents.thereafter,the parties entered into the stipulated judgment in favor of appellant and against respondents for.it was further ordered that appellant was entitled to possession of mbg personal property,consisting of all accounts,equipment,and proceeds.if appellant levied on the personal property,the net proceeds of mbg personal property would be applied to satisfy the judgment,with any excess remitted to the judgment debtor.it would thus seem that appellant would be the prevailing party as to both its amended complaint and respondents,and would be entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to sections and,the attorney fees clauses in the agreement and stipulated judgment,and civil code section.
however,section provides that the prevailing party is entitled to all of his costs unless another statute provides otherwise.citation.absent such statutory authority,the court has no discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party.citation.nelson anderson th,d,italics added see,supra,th at,d.
section,the statute at issue in this case,states that the costs allowed under section shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section,subd.a.
not less than days prior to commencement of trial or arbitration of a dispute to be resolved by arbitration,any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time.the written offer shall include a statement of the offer,containing the terms and conditions of the judgment or award,and a provision that allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is accepted if the offer is accepted,the offer with proof of acceptance shall be filed and the clerk or the judge shall enter judgment accordingly if the offer is not accepted prior to trial or within days after it is made,whichever occurs first,it shall be deemed withdrawn,and can not be given in evidence,subd.b,italics added.
section,subdivision c states 
if an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer.in addition,the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses,who are not regular employees of any party,actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,or both,preparation for trial or arbitration,or during trial or arbitration,of the case by the defendant.
thus,while the general rule provides for the prevailing party in a civil lawsuit to recover its costs,section establishes a procedure for shifting the costs upon a party refusal to settle.if the party who prevailed at trial obtained a judgment less favorable than a pretrial settlement offer submitted by the other party,then the prevailing party may not recover its own postoffer costs and,moreover,must pay its opponent postoffer costs,including,potentially,expert witness costs,subd.c.barella exchange bank th,d barella see scott blount,supra,cal th at,d.
section has been part of california law since citation,and although it has undergone some modification over the years,it remains essentially unchanged in substance.taing johnson scaffolding th,d taing.as such,section provides that any party to an action may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time,subd.b,italics added.if the offer is accepted,the offer with proof of acceptance shall be filed and the clerk or the judge shall enter judgment accordingly,subd.b.an offer is deemed withdrawn if it is not accepted before trial,or within days after it is made,subd.b.if a defense offer is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment,the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer,which may include expert witness fees,subd.c.

as recognized in numerous court of appeal decisions,the clear purpose of section is to encourage the settlement of lawsuits prior to trial.cobb superior court cal d.section achieves its aim by punishing a party who fails to accept a reasonable offer from the other party.citations.elrod oregon cummins diesel,d,italics in original see taing,supra,th at,d.in that situation,the prevailing party is precluded from recovering its own postoffer costs and must pay its opponent postoffer costs,including expert witness fees,if awarded in the court discretion.citations.the purpose of the statute is to encourage the settlement of litigation without trial,by punishing the party who fails to accept a reasonable settlement offer from its opponent.citation.elite show services,staffpro,th,d elite show services.
fundamental rules of statutory construction require that,in construing section,we attempt to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.citation.that purpose is clear section is intended to encourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a it be a plaintiff or a fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent settlement offer.this is the stick.the carrot is that by awarding costs to the putative settler the statute provides a financial incentive to make reasonable settlement offers.citation.berg,supra,th at,d.
