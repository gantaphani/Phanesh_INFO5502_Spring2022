in this action arising from a home foreclosure,the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,defendant lender demurrer to plaintiff borrowers complaint.the complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and fraud based on intentional misrepresentation or false promise.specifically,plaintiffs allege that defendant,under a trial modification mortgage plan,offered to permanently modify the plaintiffs mortgage loan,provided plaintiffs complied with the terms of the trial modification plan by returning certain requested documents,making timely trial modification payments,and qualifying under a federal program that seeks to reduce home foreclosures,the home affordable mortgage program hereafter,hamp.
two recent appellate decisions provide guidance on this subject,one from the california court of appeal,fourth appellate district,division three west jpmorgan chase bank,th,d west and the other from the federal seventh circuit court of appeals wigod wells fargo bank,cir wigod.these two decisions,which were issued after the trial court ruled here,concluded that when a borrower has alleged that he or she has complied with all the terms of a trial modification plan offered under hamp including making all required payments and providing all required documentation and if the borrower representations on which the modification is based remain true and correct,the lender or loan servicer collectively hereafter,the lender must offer the borrower a good faith permanent modification and if the lender fails to do so,the borrower may sue the lender,under state law,for breach of contract of the trial modification plan,among other causes of action.
we conclude plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged causes of action for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and fraud based on false promise.therefore,we shall reverse on those bases

the complaint at issue here,the plaintiffs first amended complaint,alleges the following facts.
in may,plaintiffs richard and susan bushell obtained a loan from then defendant washington mutual bank to purchase a home in roseville.plaintiffs executed a deed of trust encumbering the property as security.subsequently,defendant jpmorgan chase bank,acquired certain assets and liabilities of washington mutual,including plaintiffs loan and deed of trust we will refer collectively to these defendants as chase in december,plaintiffs defaulted on their loan.
in may,plaintiffs received from chase a trial modification plan called a trial period plan or tpp,which stated in part if you qualify under the federal government home affordable modification p rogram hamp and comply with the terms of the trial modification plan,we will modify your mortgage loan and you can avoid foreclosure.in the trial modification plan,chase requested that plaintiffs sign and return certain documents the plan itself,if they accepted it a financial hardship affidavit a tax return disclosure form and documentation to verify previously stated income,and submit the first trial period payment in the amount of,calculated from income and loan information chase already had and calculations chase had already performed pursuant to hamp guidelines.see treasury,hamp supplemental directive,hereafter,supplemental directive.plaintiffs signed and provided all the requested documents and made the first trial period payment.
in june,plaintiffs received a letter from chase confirming the trial modification plan and specifying in part if you make all trial period payments on time under the trial modification plan and comply with all of the applicable hamp program guidelines,you will have qualified for a final permanent modification.the letter also contained four coupons with which to return the trial modification payments,and instructed plaintiffs to continue making the trial modification payments after the first three in the event of a paperwork delay.
after making the first four trial period payments,plaintiffs inquired about the status of their loan modification.chase advised them to continue making the trial payments.plaintiffs did,making trial modification payments between june and august.
plaintiffs contacted chase multiple times between november and june,inquiring about the status of their loan modification.between november and december,chase indicated it was processing the paperwork.then,on december,when plaintiffs again inquired,chase told plaintiffs the loan modification had been denied by the investor and chase could not accept any more payments.in the ensuing months,plaintiffs requested written explanation,but received nothing.plaintiffs called chase and were told to stop making payments because chase was crunching the numbers for the modification and payment schedule,and additional payments at that point would skew the outcome.and then in june,plaintiffs were told that their file had been reviewed and cleared to resume the trial modification payments,which plaintiffs resumed.in november,plaintiffs received a letter from chase requesting updated information.this was the first written communication from chase since the trial modification plan provided to plaintiffs in may and the confirming letter sent in june.plaintiffs provided the requested information in person on december.the next written communication plaintiffs received from chase was on january,a notice of trustee sale regarding the property posted on their front door.
procedural background 
after chase demurred to plaintiffs original complaint,plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint alleging breach of contract,including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,promissory estoppel,and fraud intentional misrepresentation and false promise.
the trial court,which ruled before west and wigod were decided,sustained chase demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the case,finding as to breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the trial modification plan was not,on its face,a binding contract for a loan modification plaintiffs did not allege they qualified under hamp and the implied covenant theory fell with the lack of a contract as to promissory estoppel the alleged promise was conditional rather than clear and unambiguous as required and plaintiffs failed to allege detrimental reliance damages because monthly mortgage payments that plaintiffs were already obligated to make can not constitute damages and as to fraud plaintiffs failed to allege their facts with the requisite level of specificity,and similarly failed to allege detrimental reliance.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
plaintiffs state a cause of action for breach of contract including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealinga.breach of contract 
to allege a cause of action for breach of contract,a plaintiff must allege,the contract,plaintiff performance or excuse for nonperformance,defendant breach,and the resulting damages to plaintiff.reichert general ins.cal d.
the alleged contract here is the trial modification plan the trial period plan or tpp that chase provided plaintiffs under hamp.as noted,the principal contractual language of the tpp provides if you qualify under the federal government home affordable modification p rogram hamp and comply with the terms of the tpp,we will modify your mortgage loan and you can avoid foreclosure and if you make all trial period payments on time and comply with all of the applicable hamp guidelines,you will have qualified for a final modification this latter quote is from the letter chase sent plaintiffs in june.
plaintiffs contend that the tpp here constituted a valid,binding contract entitling them to a permanent loan modification under hamp upon their performance of certain conditions precedent complying with the terms of the tpp and qualifying under hamp that they performed those conditions precedent and that chase breached the contract by not providing them a permanent modification.
chase counters that no contract existed rather,chase gave nothing more than a promise to consider plaintiffs for a permanent modification,a mere agreement to agree on conditions,which is unenforceable as a matter of law.italics added.chase explains that qualification under hamp was a condition precedent to permanent modification,and plaintiffs failed to allege they qualified under that program.
as is evident from the parties respective contentions,the allegation of a breach of contract cause of action here turns on whether plaintiffs have alleged performance of certain conditions precedent complying with the tpp terms and qualifying under hamp necessary to form a tpp contract to permanently modify the terms of their loan.consequently,we must understand hamp to understand the contractual status,if any,of the tpp here.we pause now to examine hamp 
when financial markets nearly collapsed in the late summer and early fall of,congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of.stat.wigod,supra,at.the centerpiece of this act was the federal troubled asset relief program tarp which,in addition to providing a massive infusion of liquidation to the banking system,required the united states department of the treasury hereafter,treasury to implement a plan to minimize home foreclosures.see wigod,at a.
that plan was hamp,introduced in february,and funded by a billion of tarp monies to induce lenders to refinance mortgages to reduce monthly payments for struggling homeowners.wigod,supra,at.specifically,hamp enables certain homeowners who are in default or at imminent risk of default to obtain permanent loan modifications,by which their monthly mortgage payments are reduced to no more than percent of their gross monthly income for a period of at least five years.lenders receive from the government a incentive payment for each permanent hamp modification,along with other incentives.west,supra,th at,d wigod,supra,at,supplemental directive,supra,see chiles mitchell,hamp an overview of the program and recent litigation trends consumer fin,hereafter,chiles mitchell.
supplemental directive,a regulation the treasury issued in april,delineates hamp eligibility requirements and modification procedures.supplemental directive,supra.lenders must perform hamp loan modifications in accordance with treasury regulations.west,supra,th at,d wigod,supra,at.
as for hamp eligibility requirements,under supplemental directive,before a lender offers a tpp to a distressed borrower,the lender has already found that the borrower satisfies certain simple threshold requirements under hamp regarding the basic nature of the loan obligation,a certain loan amount balance property is primary residence monthly mortgage payment greater than percent of monthly gross income has already calculated a trial modification payment amount using a waterfall method of specified steps that drops the borrower monthly mortgage payment to the hamp target figure of percent of monthly gross income and most significantly from the lender perspective,has already determined,pursuant to application of a net present value npv test based in part on representations provided by the borrower,that it is more profitable to modify the loan under hamp than to foreclose upon it.west,supra,th at,d wigod,supra,at,supplemental directive,supra,see supplemental directive,if the npv result for the modification scenario is greater than the npv result for no modification,the lender must offer the modification,even if a third party investor is involved emphasis in original see chiles mitchell,supra,consumer fin.furthermore,supplemental directive specifies that,upon receiving the signed tpp from the borrower with the income verification documents,the lender must confirm that the borrower continues to meet these hamp eligibility criteria and,if not,the lender should promptly communicate that fact in writing to the borrower and consider the borrower for another foreclosure prevention alternative.supplemental directive,supra.
in short,then,when a lender offers a tpp to a distressed borrower,the lender effectively has already determined that the borrower qualifies for hamp,assuming that the borrower representations on which modification is based remain true and correct.supplemental directive,supra.
after determining a borrower qualifies under hamp in this manner,the lender implements the hamp modification process in two steps.
in step one,the lender provides the borrower with a tpp that sets forth the trial payment terms the lender has calculated using the waterfall method instructs the borrower to sign and return the tpp,a financial hardship affidavit,and income verification documents if not previously obtained from the borrower and requests the first trial payment west,supra,th at,d wigod,supra,at supplemental directive,supra,chiles mitchell,supra,consumer fin.
as for step two of the hamp modification process,after the trial period,if the borrower has complied with all terms of the tpp including making all required trial payments and providing all required documentation and if the borrower representations on which modification is based remain true and correct,the lender must offer the borrower a permanent loan modification in step two,the lender calculates the terms of the permanent modification using the verified income information.west,supra,th at,d wigod,supra,at supplemental directive,supra,chiles mitchell,supra consumer fin.
this must offer mandate is because,as west explains,citing wigod,when a lender received public tax dollars under tarp,it agreed to offer tpp and loan modifications under hamp according to regulations issued by the department of the treasury.wigod,supra,at.under the hamp s upplemental d irective regulation,if the lender approves,offers a tpp,and the borrower complies with all the terms of the tpp and all of the borrower representations remain true and correct,the lender must offer a permanent loan modification.wigod,supra,at.supplemental directive,supra,at page states if the borrower complies with the terms and conditions of the tpp,the loan modification will become effective on the first day of the month following the trial period west,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
with this hamp primer in mind,we turn to plaintiffs breach of contract allegations.
breach of contract cause of action.
plaintiffs have attached to,and incorporated within,their first amended complaint their tpp with chase,which states as pertinent,if you qualify under the federal government home affordable modification p rogram hamp and comply with the terms of the tpp,we will modify your mortgage loan and you can avoid foreclosure if you make all trial period payments on time and comply with all of the applicable hamp guidelines,you will have qualified for a final permanent modification and let us know that you accept this offer please let us know no later than may,that you accept the tpp by returning the signed tpp,along with other required documents financial hardship affidavit tax return disclosure form certain documents to verify income and first payment.
as we have just seen,in light of the hamp supplemental directive,if a borrower complies with all terms of the tpp including making all required payments and providing all required documentation and if the borrower representations on which modification is based remain true and correct,the lender must offer the borrower a good faith permanent loan modification,because the borrower has qualified under hamp and has complied with the tpp.
in their first amended complaint,plaintiffs allege they accepted chase tpp offer they provid ed all the tpp documents chase requested they made four timely trial payments as initially called for by the tpp and an additional more through august as directed by chase in response to plaintiffs repeated requests of what to do next they qualif ied for the modification under hamp in late december,they were told the loan modification had been denied by the investor in
