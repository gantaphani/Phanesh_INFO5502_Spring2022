in this case,we consider whether the district court erred in holding that morgan keegan company,morgan keegan,a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra,is not subject to finra arbitration proceedings initiated by louise silverman,max silverman,and the louise silverman trust collectively,the defendants.in their finra arbitration claim,the defendants asserted that morgan keegan engaged in misconduct relating to the valuation and marketing of certain bond funds purchased by the defendants through their brokerage firm,legg mason investor services,llc legg mason 
morgan keegan filed an action in the district court seeking to enjoin the arbitration proceedings on the ground that under the controlling finra rule,the defendants were not customers of morgan keegan entitled to compel arbitration of their dispute.the district court agreed with morgan keegan position,permanently enjoining the arbitration proceedings.upon our review,we affirm the district court judgment because the defendants were not customers of morgan keegan,within the meaning of the disputed finra rule,and,therefore,were not entitled to invoke the mandatory arbitration provision contained in that rule.
finra is a registered,organization authorized under the securities exchange act of see a,b.finra has the authority to create and enforce rules for its members to provide regulatory oversight of all securities firms that do business with the public.securities and exchange commission release,july.at issue in this appeal is the portion of the finra rules,known as the customer code,which establishes the conditions for an arbitration proceeding between finra members and their customers before a finra arbitration panel finra arbitration the code of arbitration procedure contained in the finra rules the finra code or the code provides in rule that parties must arbitrate a dispute if the following conditions are met 
arbitration under the code is either 
required by written agreement,or 
requested by the customer 
the dispute is between a customer and a member or associated person of a member and 
the dispute arises in connection with the business activities of the member or the associated person,except disputes involving the insurance business activities of a member that is also an insurance company.
thus,in the absence of a separate arbitration agreement,a party can compel a finra member to participate in finra arbitration if the party is a customer of the finra member and there is a dispute between the customer and the finra member,or the member associated person,arising in connection with the business activities of the finra member or a member associated person.
morgan keegan,a member of finra,engages in business services that include the brokerage and dealing of securities,as well as providing investment advice.morgan keegan was the principal distributor and underwriter of certain bond funds,known as the regions morgan keegan funds the funds,which were traded on the new york stock exchange.
the defendants did not invest in the funds during their initial public offering,which occurred before the end of.instead,in,the defendants purchased shares of the funds from a third party,through the defendants securities broker at legg mason,a firm unaffiliated with morgan keegan.
in late,the defendants suffered financial losses when the value of the funds dropped dramatically.the defendants asserted that their losses resulted,in part,because morgan keegan failed to disclose critical information about the nature of the funds and falsely inflated the funds asset values.to resolve this claim and other related claims,the defendants initiated finra arbitration proceedings against morgan keegan,asserting that they were entitled to do so under rule as customers of morgan keegan 
although the defendants acknowledged that they never held a brokerage account with morgan keegan,they nonetheless claimed a customer relationship with morgan keegan as a result of their brokerage dealings with legg mason,another finra member.the defendants contended that employees of morgan keegan encouraged the legg mason broker to purchase the funds and that,in executing these purchases,the legg mason broker relied on morgan keegan marketing materials describing the funds.the defendants,however,did not receive or review personally the information that their broker obtained from morgan keegan.
morgan keegan filed suit in the district court seeking,among other things,an injunction prohibiting the defendants from pursuing their finra arbitration claim.morgan keegan alleged that it was not required to submit to arbitration under rule,because the defendants were not morgan keegan customers asserting a dispute arising from its business activities.
the district court granted morgan keegan request for a preliminary injunction.morgan keegan,louise silverman trust,no.jfm,dist.lexis.in addressing the issue whether morgan keegan was likely to succeed on the merits,the district court determined that the defendants did not qualify as customers,within the meaning of that term in rule,because there was no evidence of any relationship at all between the parties or representatives of the parties.id.at.the district court ultimately entered final judgment on the same basis,permanently enjoining the defendants from pursuing their finra arbitration claim.the defendants timely filed the present appeal.
on appeal,the defendants argue that the district court erred in enjoining the arbitration proceedings because,under rule,the defendants were customers of morgan keegan engaged in a dispute arising from morgan keegan conduct of its business activities.we review this question de novo ubs fin,carilion clinic,slip op.at cir.
in asserting that they have a customer relationship with morgan keegan,the defendants primarily contend that the finra code provides a complete definition of the term customer,by stating in rule i that,unless otherwise defined in the code,a customer shall not include a broker or dealer.according to the defendants,this broad definition of customer applies to rule,because that rule does not provide an alternate definition of the term,in contrast to two other finra rules,which define the term in a more specific manner applicable only to those rules.see finra rules,a.therefore,the defendants contend that they are customers of morgan keegan under the description of the term provided in rule i,because the defendants are not brokers or dealers.
the defendants further assert that the scope of the term customer is limited only by the language of rule,which requires that arbitrable disputes arise from the business activities of the finra member.the defendants contend that the term business activities necessarily includes conduct by a finra member that violates finra rules,such as morgan keegan alleged misconduct in manipulating the value of funds and in negligently marketing those funds.thus,the defendants maintain that because their financial losses are traceable to morgan keegan alleged misconduct,the defendants qualify as customers of morgan keegan,within the meaning of rule,and are entitled to pursue their finra arbitration claim against morgan keegan.we disagree with the defendants arguments.
after the parties presented oral argument in this case,we issued an opinion in ubs financial services,carilion clinic,which addressed the meaning of the term customer as used in rule.in that case,we considered whether an issuer of bonds was a customer of two finra members,who had entered into agreements with the bond issuer to assist in the structuring and financing of those bonds.carilion clinic,slip op.at.the finra members asserted that the bond issuer was not a customer under rule,because the issuer did not have a brokerage or investment relationship with the members.id.at.although we rejected this narrow view of the term advocated by the finra members,we nevertheless declined to adopt the broad scope of the term customer advanced by the defendants in the present case.
we began our analysis in carilion clinic by addressing the language in rule i that describes the term customer.id.at.contrary to the defendants position here,we
