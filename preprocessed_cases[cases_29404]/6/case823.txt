we consider here an issue of first impression whether the protecting tenants at foreclosure act of ptfa or the act provides a private right of action,stat.karen logan sought injunctive relief and damages against bank national association us bank after it filed an unlawful detainer action against her in state court without giving days notice to vacate the foreclosed property as required by the act.although we disagree with the district court abstention from exercising jurisdiction over logan injunctive relief claim under younger harris,we nevertheless affirm dismissal of the complaint because the act does not create a private right of action allowing logan to enforce its requirements.
background 
logan claims that she was the tenant of the former owner of a property located in westlake village,california us bank took title to the property at foreclosure in june.according to logan,bank served her with a notice of termination and then immediately initiated an unlawful detainer action in los angeles superior court.logan alleges that these actions contravened the ptfa,which required bank to serve a day notice of termination prior to eviction.
after the unlawful detainer action was initiated in june,logan filed a demurrer raising the ptfa issue,but the demurrer was overruled.logan twice attempted,albeit unsuccessfully,to remove the unlawful detainer action to federal court.
logan filed her action in federal court in december,seeking temporary,preliminary,and permanent injunctive relief compelling obediance sic to the federal law,as well as damages.the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that younger harris required it to abstain from exercising jurisdiction because logan sought to enjoin an action that was pending in state court at the time she filed her case in federal court.the district court further reasoned that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over logan claim for damages under the ptfa because the act does not create a private right of action.
as a threshold matter,we address whether logan appeal is moot given bank voluntary dismissal of the unlawful detainer action in february,just two months before she filed this appeal.article iii of the constitution limits federal courts to the adjudication of actual,ongoing cases or controversies between litigants.if a live controversy ceases to exist because of changed circumstances after the complaint is filed,the claim is moot and no longer justiciable.am.civil liberties union of lomax,cir.however,when the basis for mootness is defendant voluntary conduct,a federal court is not deprive d of its power to determine the legality of the practice,leaving the defendant free to return to its old ways.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.rather,the defendant must bear the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.id.at citing united states concentrated phosphate export ass.
us bank has not met this formidable burden.its voluntary dismissal of the unlawful detainer action without prejudice does not make it absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful eviction could not reasonably be expected to recur.id.the bank has offered no evidence or reassurance that it either could not or would not reinitiate the unlawful detainer action against logan at another time,should she remain in possession of the property.additionally,even if the request for injunctive relief were moot,logan pursuit of monetary relief ensures that the case remains definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.havens realty coleman,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.dismissal of the state unlawful detainer proceedings did not moot logan claim.
ii.younger abstention 
as a general rule,a federal court has a virtually unflagging obligation to adjudicate controversies properly before it.deakins monaghan,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in carrying out this duty,federal courts may well affect,or for practical purposes a pending state court action,but there is no doctrine that the pendency of state judicial proceedings excludes the federal courts.new orleans pub.serv.nopsi council of new orleans.to the contrary,a pending action in state court is generally no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the federal court having jurisdiction.river water conservation dist.united states,quoting mcclellan carland.
against this backdrop,the supreme court has carved out an extraordinary and narrow exception.river water conservation,at quoting cnty.of allegheny frank mashuda.in younger harris,the supreme court held that a federal court may not interfere with a pending state criminal prosecution absent extraordinary circumstances.this principle has also been extended to limited classes of civil proceedings.see nopsi,at.for example,in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar association,the supreme court applied younger abstention to state attorney disciplinary proceedings,but was careful to limit its application in the context to those cases where there is an ongoing state proceeding,the state proceeding implicates important state interests,and the state proceeding provides an adequate opportunity to raise federal questions.interpreting the supreme court directive,the ninth circuit has emphasized another criterion that the federal action would enjoin the state proceeding or have the practical effect of doing so.san jose silicon valley chamber of commerce political action comm.city of san jose,cir.all four elements must be satisfied to warrant abstention.amerisourcebergen roden,cir.
us bank unlawful detainer action meets three of the four requirements.to begin,there was an ongoing proceeding in state court when logan filed the federal action in december.although bank later voluntarily dismissed the state action without prejudice in february,the relevant date for evaluating abstention is the date the federal action is filed.gilbertson albright,cir en banc kitchens bowen,cir t he critical question is not whether the state proceedings are still ongoing,but whether the state proceedings were underway before initiation of the federal proceedings.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.second,logan had the opportunity to litigate her federal question in state court.although she was unsuccessful,the pertinent inquiry in the abstention context is whether plaintiffs federal claims could have been raised in the pending state proceedings.moore sims.logan also meets the third prong the purpose of her federal action is either to enjoin the state proceeding directly or to have the practical effect of doing so by limiting bank ability to pursue its state court action.
despite satisfying these three requirements,abstention is not warranted because the state unlawful detainer action does not implicate important state interests.notwithstanding its apparent breadth,that tag line is not an invitation to abstain simply because a suit implicates a state law,even one involving a traditional state concern.while recognizing important state interests in a number of civil proceedings,neither we nor the supreme court has held younger to apply generally to ordinary civil litigation.potrero hills landfill,cnty.of solano,cir.in middlesex,the supreme court offered three types of civil proceedings in which a state might have a vital interest noncriminal proceedings that bear a close relationship to proceedings criminal in nature,p roceedings necessary for the vindication of important state policies,and p roceedings necessary for the functioning of the state judicial system.at.the first two categories implicate the state executive interest and encompass cases in which the state or an agent of the state is a party in an enforcement posture,potrero hills landfill,at the third category encompasses cases including those between private parties where the operation of the state judicial system is itself at issue 
an unlawful detainer action does not fall into any of these categories.obviously it does not bear a close relationship to proceedings that are criminal in nature,nor does it implicate the functioning of the state judicial system.the only question for discussion is whether the suit vindicates important state interests or policies.but the eviction action does not fit in that category either because it is garden variety civil litigation between private parties,not a state enforcement action.
it is not enough that the state court action concerns real property transfers,leasehold estates,and tenant rights,all of which are historically the domain of state regulation.i t is not the bare subject matter of the underlying state law that determine s whether the state proceeding implicates an important state interest for younger purposes.potrero hills landfill,at.instead,the content of state laws becomes important for younger purposes only when coupled with the state executive interest in enforcing such laws or the state judiciary interest in the operation of the judicial system.id.at see also cate oldham,cir application of the younger doctrine to ongoing state civil proceedings has been limited to those civil actions in aid of criminal jurisdiction or involving proceedings in which vital interests of the state qua state are involved.by contrast,the unlawful detainer action here is simply a private dispute between two private parties over possession of a property.the state has not stepped in as a party to enforce its tenancy laws,and no core aspect of the administration of the state judicial system is at issue this is not to say that the state does not have a significant interest in protecting tenants,only that such interest does not warrant abstention.
although the district court cited to several district court decisions holding that unlawful detainer actions represent a sufficient state interest to warrant younger abstention,we are not persuaded.logan bank ass n,no.cv,wl,at cal.april,see,mcglothin santos,wl,at,hicks superior court of,cnty.of kern,cv,wl,at.march.those decisions,like the district court decision here,fall prey to the logic that the state has a significant concern simply because property law,including eviction,has long been a state concern.the difficulty with this assumption is that it would require federal courts to abstain from state litigation in virtually every area of state law from consumer protection to real estate even where the dispute is purely private.we agree with the third circuit that the regulation of eviction proceedings does not implicate an important state interest under younger.ayers phila.hous,cir holding that an eviction action brought by philadelphia city housing authority did not implicate an important state interest.
iii.no private right of action under the protecting tenants at foreclosure act 
although logan claims are neither moot nor precluded by younger,they fail because she has no cognizable claim under the ptfa.the supreme court has repeatedly held that private rights of action,like substantive federal law itself,must be created by congress.see,alexander sandoval.our challenge is to determine whether the ptfa,either explicitly or by implication,evinces a congressional intent to create a private right of action.touche ross redington.without clear evidence of such intent,courts may not create a cause of action no matter how desirable as a policy matter,or how compatible with the statute.sandoval,at.this issue is a question of first impression for this court,but a number of district courts within this circuit have held that there is no such right.see,wells fargo bank lapeen,no,wl,at cal.june,concluding that the ptfa only provides tenants with federal defenses to eviction but does not create a federal ejectment claim or any private right of action nativi deutsche bank trust,wl,at.may,holding that the ptfa does not provide for an implied private right of action.we conclude that the statute neither explicitly nor impliedly creates a private right of action allowing logan to enforce the ptfa.
section a of the ptfa provides 
in the case of any foreclosure on a mortgage loan or on any dwelling or residential real property after the date of enactment of this title,any immediate successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to 
the provision,by such successor in interest of a notice to vacate to any bona fide tenant at least days before the effective date of such notice and 
the rights of any bona fide tenant,as of the date of such notice of foreclosure 
a under any bona fide lease entered into before the notice of foreclosure to occupy the premises until the end of the remaining term of the lease,except that a successor in interest may terminate a lease effective on the date of sale of the unit to a purchaser who will occupy the unit as a primary residence,subject to the receipt by the tenant of the day notice under paragraph or 
b without a lease or with a lease terminable at will under state law,subject to the receipt by the tenant of the day notice under subsection.
the parties acknowledge that the statute does not explicitly create a private cause of action because nothing in the text of a references the availability of any action to enforce the statute provisions,describes a forum in which an enforcement suit may be brought,or identifies a plaintiff for whom such a forum is available.accordingly,any private right of action within a must be implied from the statute language,structure,context,and legislative history.see opera plaza residential parcel homeowners ass hoang,cir.
in cort ash,the supreme court identified four factors that are relevant for determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted whether there is any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one whether an implied private cause of action for the plaintiff is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the cort test replaced the understanding of private rights of action that had previously held sway that it was the duty of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective the congressional purpose expressed by a statute.sandoval,at quoting case borak.cort represented a retreat from the supreme court previous willingness to imply a cause of action where congress ha d not provided one.corr.serv.malesko.
in later cases,the supreme court essentially collapsed the cort test into a single focus t he central inquiry remains whether congress intended to create,either expressly or by implication,a private cause of action.touche ross,at see also cal.sierra club,t he ultimate issue is whether congress intended to create a private right of action.thompson thompson,scalia,concurring w e effectively overruled the cort ash analysis in touche ross converting one of its four factors congressional intent into the determinative factor emphasis in original.nonetheless,our court has found the four factor test helpful,and has continued to employ it to guide the central project of discerning congress intent.orkin taylor,cir.
because the supreme court has elevated intent into a supreme factor,we start there and do not feel constrained by the cort framework as with any case involving congressional intent,we presume that congress expressed its intent through the statutory language it chose.bank germain.we begin our search for congressional intent with the language and structure of the statute,and then look to legislative history only if the language is unclear,alarcon keller,cir,or if there is a clearly expressed contrary intention in the legislative history that may overcome the strong presumption that the statutory language represents congressional intent,flores arellano,cir.
nothing in the language and structure of a reflects a clear and unambiguous intent to create a private right of action.see gonzag
