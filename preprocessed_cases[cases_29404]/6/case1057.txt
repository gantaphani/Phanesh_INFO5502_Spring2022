on summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of norwest bank minnesota national association holding that norwest had overpaid insurance premiums to the federal deposit insurance corporation and awarding norwest a refund of million,with interest.the overpayments resulted from what the court viewed as the fdic misinterpretation of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of.we hold that norwest complaint was filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations.we therefore vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss.
in,in response to the crisis,congress reformed the national system of deposit insurance,creating two insurance funds under the control of the fdic the bank insurance fund bif to insure banks and the savings association insurance fund saif to insure associations.the funds were to be separately funded and administered.congress anticipated that the bif would be in stronger financial condition for some time and strictly limited the ability of an insured institution to transfer deposits from one fund to the other fund.an exception was the oakar amendment,named after its sponsor,which allowed a member of one fund to acquire a member of the other fund.a saif member,after being acquired by a bif member,would continue to have its acquired deposits insured by the saif,while the acquirer deposits would remain insured by the bif.the financial institution paid the saif rate on part of its deposits and the bif rate on the remainder of its deposits.
to determine the portion of the deposits to be insured by the saif,congress required oakar institutions to calculate their adjusted attributable deposit amount aada by adding three components.the first component was and still is the amount of deposits acquired from the saif bank.d c i.the second component was and still is cumulative adjustments made over time using the third component.d c ii.the third component,prior to the amendments,was the amount the first two components would have increased at a rate of growth equal to the greater of a annual increase or the actual annual rate of growth of deposits of the bank excluding any deposits acquired by further acquisitions.d c iii supp.ii.
on december,congress enacted the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act,modifying the formula for calculating the aada.section a of the act eliminated the portion of the third component that provided for a minimum annual increase of and instead provided that the actual annual growth of deposits would be used in all cases.federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of,stat,codified at d c iii.section b provided that the amendment shall apply with respect to semiannual periods beginning after the date of the enactment of this act,stat.at see also note.the dispute over the proper amount of the insurance assessment stems from the parties disagreement about the meaning of the effective date provision.the fdic believes that the amendment did not take effect for purposes of calculating norwest insurance premiums until.norwest contends that its actual growth rate should have been applied to the calculation of premiums beginning in january.
norwest owed premiums to both the bif and the saif as a result of its acquisition of first minnesota savings bank,fsb,in december.in january,it filed the appropriate fdic form calculating its aada based on the greater of and its actual growth rate,which was.applying the calculation method,norwest calculated its aada on the appropriate form supplied by the fdic based on the growth rate,which resulted in an inflated aada,if norwest is correct.there was no immediate effect on the total amount of insurance premiums norwest owed the fdic because at that time the insurance rates for the bif and the saif were equal.
in,the fdic reduced the bif assessment rate.the result was that if the fdic had erroneously interpreted the statute in to overstate norwest aada,norwest paid a higher total premium than it should have in and later years,because deposits that should have been assessed at the preferential bif rate were assessed at the higher saif rate.the error,if any,was preserved by the second component of the formula,d c ii,which carries forward an increase in the aada and does not allow an error in the growth rate in a given year to be corrected by further changes in a bank deposit amounts in later years.in addition,there were special assessments based on the amount of deposits assessed at the saif rate.norwest overpaid these amounts as well if it incorrectly calculated its aada.
norwest disputed the alleged overcharge in a letter to the fdic dated may,requesting a refund of the overpayment of assessments resulting from the artificially high aada.the fdic division of finance denied the request on september,as did the assessment appeals committee on june.norwest then filed suit against the fdic in the district court on june,more than eight years after the alleged miscalculation.
the district court found norwest action timely.applying the limitations period in a the court measured from the date of the denial by the assessment appeals committee on june.norwest bank minnesota,fdic,slip op.at.in the alternative,the court applied the period of g measured from the time of the first alleged overpayment in june.id.
norwest and the fdic agree that the proper statute of limitations for refund claims is g,rather than a.the statute of a is a general,catchall provision for civil actions against the united states.the statute of g applies specifically to an action for the recovery of any amount paid to the fdic in excess of the amount due to it,which precisely describes norwest complaint.when both specific and general provisions cover the same subject,the specific provision will control,especially if applying the general provision would render the specific provision superfluous,as it would here.see,crawford fitting gibbons,d.
statutes of limitations commonly begin the running of the period from the date the cause of action accrued.browner,note,developments in the of limitations,harv.revv.section g is no exception the triggering event is when the right accrued for which the claim is made.if,as the fdic urges,the right of action accrued in january,the period had already run when norwest sent its letter to the fdic in may and when it filed its suit in june.
a claim normally accrues when the factual and legal prerequisites for filing suit are in place,at see bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of,d united states lindsay.rawlings ray.oppenheim campbell.section g governs not only the time for an action in court,but also the time for a proceeding.we held in with respect to another statute of limitations that a proceeding included an administrative proceeding,at.if we followed this line,norwest claim accrued when the legal and factual prerequisites for an administrative proceeding were in place.in january,when the alleged miscalculation of norwest aada occurred,norwest could have requested a refund from the agency or it could have brought suit in court,alleging that the miscalculation resulted in an overpayment to the saif.in other words,the legal prerequisites for an action or proceeding were then in place.norwest maintains that at that time a lawsuit or a complaint to the agency would have booted it nothing.in january the assessment rates for the saif and the bif were the same.and so if norwest had prevailed in court or in the agency,the fdic likely would have responded by billing it for the identical amount as an underpayment to the bif.
one might fdic even if norwest succeeded in and wound up with no net recovery,it still would have brought about a determination of the proper construction of the statutory amendment and the fdic would have readjusted saif and bif accounts accordingly,not only for norwest but also for all the other institutions in a similar position.the fdic assessment appeals committee estimated that of the oakar institutions would be directly affected.that would have had a future financial impact for the regulated institutions if and when bif assessment rates were lowered,and it might also h
