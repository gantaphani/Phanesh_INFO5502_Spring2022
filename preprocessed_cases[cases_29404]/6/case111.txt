this case requires us to resolve a dispute over the provision of a surety bond that limits the surety liability to the original beneficiaries named in the bond.in the midst of litigation between the surety and one of the named beneficiaries,the beneficiary assigned its interests under the bond to a third party.the district court allowed the third party to take the place of the beneficiary in the litigation,but then dismissed the third party complaint because the bond limited the surety liability to the original named beneficiaries.agreeing with this disposition,we affirm.
in the summer of,grupo cupey,arranged for the development and financing of a residential real estate project,known as vista de cupey,in trujillo alto,puerto rico.on june,it engaged juncos al construction corporation juncos al to serve as contractor.on july,the american international insurance company of puerto rico aiico issued a performance bond the bond for the amount of for the benefit of grupo cupey in the event that juncos al defaulted on its obligations.that same day,aiico issued a dual obligee rider to the bond the rider.the rider added citibank,as an obligee under the bond in anticipation of citibank providing financing to grupo cupey for the vista cupey project.
on july,citibank executed a loan agreement in which it extended to grupo cupey a line of credit for a maximum amount of.under that agreement,citibank advanced to grupo cupey.as collateral for the loan,grupo cupey executed a promissory note and a mortgage.citibank also procured a personal guarantee of the loan from a businessman,ramón.
on november,after several delays in construction,grupo cupey declared juncos al to be in default on its obligations as contractor with the project stalled,grupo cupey failed to make loan payments to citibank.on january,citibank filed claims in the district court in puerto rico against grupo cupey,ramón as a guarantor of the grupo cupey loan,and aiico in its capacity as surety for juncos.subsequently,citibank,grupo cupey,and entered into settlement agreements.the sole remaining claim in this appeal is the claim against aiico.

the parties agree that puerto rico law governs our interpretation of the bond and the rider.where the parties have agreed to the choice of law,this court is free to forgo an independent analysis and accept the parties agreement.hershey donaldson,lufkin jenrette sec,cir quotation omitted.
the relevant provision of the rider reads as follows no right of action shall be accrue sic on this bond to or for the use of benefit sic of any person or corporation other than the owner and lender herein named the rider names grupo cupey as the owner and citibank as the lender.thus,the above quoted provision of the rider purports to limit aiico liability under the bond only to grupo cupey and citibank.the plain language of this provision prevents grupo catalán from sustaining a cause of action against aiico under the bond because grupo catalán is not named as an owner or lender.
grupo catalán argues that,under puerto rico law,surety contracts are to be construed liberally in favor of the beneficiary,and that this rule of construction requires us to find that grupo catalán can sustain a claim against aiico as the assignee of citibank rights under the rider.although t he prevailing doctrine is that a surety bond should be liberally interpreted in favor of its beneficiary,that principle is not a blank check to the judicial power to rule out the pacts and agreements between the parties.luan inv.rexach constr,wl at internal quotation and citation omitted.rather,the rule of liberal construction applies only where the text of the agreement is ambiguous.i f the text of a bond agreement is clear,or the true meaning of its clauses can be easily discerned,the courts should adhere to its text.cagus plumbing,continental const,wl at see also id.at the principle of liberal construction does not mean or justify going beyond the clear language of the obligation.it is not a carte blanche for imposing,through judicial construction,obligations that a surety never thought of assuming.internal quotation omitted.
the adherence to the clear text of a surety agreement is consistent with the puerto rico civil code,which provides that c ontracting parties may make the agreement and establish the clauses and conditions which they may deem advisable,provided they are not in contravention of the laws,morals,or public order.laws ann.tit.the code specifically allows sureties to bargain for contractual concessions from beneficiaries.the surety may bind himself to less but not to more than the principal debtor as to quantity as well as the burden of the conditions.laws ann.tit.we see no overriding principle that should prevent a surety from bargaining for a contractual provision that prevents parties other than those named in the original transaction from pursuing a cause of action under the bond.
in this case,the text of the rider is clear.it explicitly limits aiico liability under the bond to citibank and grupo cupey.moreover,it does not provide any means by which those parties can assign their rights to pursue a cause of action under the bond.thus,by the plain language of the rider,grupo catalán can not sustain a claim against aiico as citibank assignee.
appellant devotes much of its brief to the argument that grupo catalán can sustain a cause of action against aiico as a successor to citibank.implicit in this argument is the contention that paragraph of the unamended bond,rather than the language of the rider,governs causes of action against aiico.paragraph states that n o right of action shall accrue on this bond to any person or entity other than the owner or its heirs,executors,administrators or successors.we do not have to determine whether grupo catalán qualifies as a successor of citibank because the more restrictive language of the rider,not the language of paragraph of the unamended bond,governs grupo catalán rights against aiico.the rider,by its own terms,amended the bond in several respects,including the addition of new,more restrictive language that limited causes of action against aiico to the owner and lender herein named,and did not extend rights to successors.
finally,appellant argues that the district court explicitly recognized that grupo catalán could pursue a cause of action against aiico when it allowed grupo catalán to replace citibank pursuant to.c.however,rule c is a procedural vehicle not designed to create new relationships among parties to a suit.cabrero,cir quoting pacamor bearings,minebea.it involves a discretionary determination by the trial court to facilitate the conduct of the litigation.id.thus,rule does not substantively determine what actions survive the tran
