the owner of a parcel of real property with a building on it demolishes the building to make way for new development.unfortunately,the owner is unable to complete the development and ends up defaulting on a purchase money promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the property.the holder of the note and deed of trust exercises the power of sale under the deed of trust and buys the property back at a foreclosure sale for less than the amount due under the note.the note holder then sues the former owner and others for waste and impairment of security based on their demolition of the building,seeking as damages the loss of value in the property that resulted from the destruction of the building.is such an action barred by the antideficiency statutes code civ.proc,under the reasoning of cornelison kornbluth cal d 
the answer to that question is no.while the supreme court in cornelison limited actions for waste following a foreclosure sale under a deed of trust securing a purchase money note to bad faith waste,the court defined bad faith waste as any waste that is not committed as a result of the economic pressures of a market downturn.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.accordingly,it is no defense to an action for waste based on the demolition of a building to simply claim that the demolition was part of a good faith attempt to improve the property.the impairment of security that results from the destruction of a building is actionable waste,notwithstanding the antideficiency statutes,unless the destruction itself was somehow caused by the economic pressures of a depressed market.
based on this conclusion,and a few others,we will reverse the judgment the trial court summarily granted in this case.
factual and procedural background 
defendant allen warren is the sole owner and director of defendant new faze development,a company warren set up to carry out t he functional development responsibilities for a variety of entities.defendant new faze holdings is also wholly owned by warren.new faze holdings was set up to own and house property prior to going into construction.
defendant wendy saunders was employed by new faze development from april through december as its director of project development.defendant jay rivinius was employed by new faze development as its director of construction.
in february,new faze holdings and another company,soul first properties,llc jointly,the purchasers,purchased from the harrison holland fait and barbara fait trust the trust the real estate located at and del paso boulevard for.the purchasers made a down payment of and executed a promissory note to the trust secured by a deed of trust on the property.
at the time of the sale in february,there was a building on the property that housed two tenants a church and a small social services agency.a new roof had been installed on the building in january,and a new ceiling with new light fixtures had been installed in the space rented by the church in the summer of.at the time of sale the building had fully functioning electrical and plumbing systems,the doors and windows were working and intact,and the building was free of graffiti.
the purchasers bought the property with the intent to redevelop it into a mixed use development including retail,residential,garage,office,and restaurant services.the redevelopment plans required demolition of the existing building and,thus,eviction of the existing tenants,which was accomplished in the fall of.the demolition occurred a year later in october.warren was the one who decided to demolish the building.as project manager,saunders ordered the demolition.rivinius signed an agreement to hold the city harmless from liability for the demolition.
in april,the trust transferred its interest in the note and deed of trust to donna fait and the glenn fait trust the faits.
ultimately,the purchasers defaulted on their payments under the promissory note and failed to pay taxes and insurance on the property.as a result,the faits initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings under the deed of trust.in may,the faits bought the property at a public foreclosure sale for.at the time of the sale,there were more than in property taxes owed on the property.
in july,the faits brought this action against the purchasers,new faze development,warren,saunders,and rivinius among others for bad faith waste and intentional and negligent impairment of security the cause of action for bad faith waste alleged that the purchasers and warren committed waste by demolishing the building and failing to pay taxes on the property.the causes of action for intentional and negligent impairment of security alleged that all of the defendants impaired the faits security interest by demolishing the building.
in august,new faze holdings,new faze development,warren,saunders,and rivinius moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.as to the first cause of action,they asserted there was no evidence that any defendant acted with the required bad faith.as to the second and third causes of action,they asserted there was no evidence of improper intent and that such a cause of action can not be asserted against a borrower,its agents or employees.
the gist of their argument on the claim of bad faith waste was that they did not intend to harm the property,and they did not act maliciously or recklessly by demolishing the building because the demolition was based on a good faith belief that the property could be developed into a legitimate mixed use commercial project.as for the claims for impairment of security,they first argued those causes of action were entirely derivative of the cause of action for bad faith waste and,as to the nonborrower defendants,it would be nonsensical for the court to hold the nonborrowers liable on a lesser standard than the bad faith standard applicable to a borrower.thus,in their view,if the first cause of action fell,then the impairment claims had to fall as well.they also argued there was no evidence of the wrongful intent necessary for intentional impairment of security and as to the claim of negligent impairment the individual defendants should be dismissed because they we re innocent agents of new faze and we re therefore not liable for the mere alleged torts of new faze.
in opposing the motion,the faits argued they could prevail on the claim of bad faith waste because defendants acted intentionally in demolishing the building.in their view,when waste was not committed solely or primarily as a result of the economic pressures of a market depression,the lender can recover for bad faith waste.the faits also argued summary judgment should be denied on the impairment of security claims because there was a triable issue of fact as to whether defendants knew of the security interest and they owed a duty to exercise reasonable care not to eliminate that interest.
relying on cornelison,the trial court concluded that t he issue of bad faith waste hinges on whether defendants conduct in demolishing the building was reckless,intentional despoilment,or malicious.because defendants had shown that the building demolition was based on a good faith belief that the property could be developed,and they made substantial efforts to get the development project underway,the court concluded there was an absence of recklessness and intent to despoil at the time of the demolition.accordingly,the bad faith waste cause of action could not be maintained based on the demolition.because the court found that new faze holdings failure to pay the property taxes could qualify as bad faith waste,the court denied summary adjudication as to new faze holdings on the bad faith claim,but the court granted the motion as to the other four defendants.
with respect to the cause of action for intentional impairment of security,the court held it was derivative of the first cause of action and therefore the court granted summary adjudication for the reasons stated in connection with the bad faith waste claim.the court also agreed it would be nonsensical to hold the borrower agents and employees liable when the borrower itself was protected from liability for all but bad faith waste.
as for the cause of action for negligent impairment of security,the court reached the same conclusions as it did with respect to the intentional impairment claim.the court also concluded that regardless of whether defendants were aware of the deed of trust provisions,plaintiffs make no showing that the building demolition was a negligent act.
having granted summary adjudication on all causes of action as to new faze development,warren,saunders,and rivinius,the trial court granted summary judgment in their favor.new faze holdings remained in the case on the claim of bad faith waste for failure to pay taxes on the property.
the faits timely appealed the judgment in favor of new faze development,warren,saunders,and rivinius.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a defendant may move for summary judgment if it is contended that the action has no merit,subd.a.a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto,subd.p.the motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.
when the defendant moves for summary judgment,in those circumstances in which the plaintiff would have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence,the defendant must present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it was more likely than not that the material fact was true citation,or the defendant must establish that an element of the claim can not be established,by presenting evidence that the plaintiff does not possess and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th.
because the trial court determination on a motion for summary judgment is one of law based upon the papers submitted,the appellate court must make its own independent determination regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers.we apply the same analysis required of the trial court.we begin by identifying the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond.we then determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which justify a judgment in movant favor.when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment,the final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.hernandez modesto portuguese pentecost th.

as we will explain,on independent review,we conclude the trial court here erred in summarily adjudicating each cause of action against the faits and therefore also erred in entering summary judgment against them.
bad faith waste 
the faits contend the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because,among other things,there are triable issues of fact as to whether bad faith waste was committed.they make this argument,even though the bad faith waste claim against new faze holdings is not directly before us on appeal,because the trial court determined that the causes of action for impairment of security were derivative of the bad faith waste claim and summarily adjudicated the impairment causes of action against the faits because the faits had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to bad faith waste.
as we will explain,the trial court erred in determining that the cause of action for bad faith waste based on the demolition of the building could not be maintained here because of an absence of recklessness and intent to despoil at the time of the demolition.under cornelison,any waste that is not committed solely or primarily as a result of the economic pressures of a market depression qualifies as bad faith waste.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.thus,it does not strictly matter whether those who demolished the building on the property did so based on a good faith belief that the property could be developed,or that they made substantial efforts to get the development project underway.as long as the demolition did not occur solely or primarily as a result of the economic pressures of a market depression,they can be liable for what the supreme court in cornelison labeled bad faith waste.
to properly understand cornelison,we begin with the facts of the case.there,the plaintiff sold a house and took back a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the property.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.the buyers later sold the property to the defendant,who,after nearly four years,sold it to another.ibid.the house was condemned as unfit for habitation,and because the original buyers were in default on the promissory note,the plaintiff commenced nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings and purchased the property at the trustee sale with a full credit bid.ibid.thereafter,the plaintiff brought an action for damages alleging breach of contract and waste.ibid.the trial court granted summary judgment in the defendant favor on the ground that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff arising by contract or otherwise.id.at fn.
on review,the defendant argued that because the plaintiff purchased the property for a full credit bid an action for waste is precluded both by reason of the antideficiency legislation citations and by reason of the extinguishment of the security interest through a full credit bid at the trustee sale.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.the plaintiff contended that an action for waste may be maintained independently of the antideficiency provisions of sections and of the code of civil procedure.ibid.
the supreme court began by explaining that waste is conduct on the part of a person in possession of property that substantially impairs a security interest in the property cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.while the defendant was not personally liable on the promissory note because he never assumed the obligations of the note,he was as a nonassuming grantee of the property subject to the deed of trust under a duty not to commit waste.id.at.
the court then addressed whether recovery for waste was barred because such recovery would amount to a deficiency judgment proscribed by sections and.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.the court reviewed at length the genesis of the antideficiency statutes id.at,then turned to the effect of this antideficiency legislation upon the statutory action for waste id.at,explaining as follows 
it will be recalled that damages in an action for waste are measured by the amount of injury to the security caused by the mortgagor acts,that is by the substantial harm which impair s the value of the property subject to the lien so as to render it an inadequate security for the mortgage debt.citation.a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against the for the difference between the fair market value of the property held as security and the outstanding indebtedness.citation.it is clear that the two judgments against the mortgagor,one for waste and the other for a deficiency,are closely interrelated and may often reflect identical amounts.if property values in general are declining,a deficiency judgment and a judgment for waste would be identical up to the point at which the harm caused by the mortgagor is equal to or less than the general decline in property values resulting from market conditions.when waste is committed in a depressed market,a deficiency judgment,although reflecting the amount of the waste,will of course exceed it if the decline of property values is greater.however,when waste is committed in a rising market,there will be no deficiency judgment,unless the property was originally overvalued in this event,there would be no damages for waste unless the impairment due to waste exceeded the general increase in property values.
mindful of the foregoing,we now proceed to arrive at an assessment of the effect of sections and upon an action for waste.first,we examine the proscription of a deficiency judgment after any foreclosure sale,private or judicial,of property securing a purchase money mortgage.the primary purpose of section is in the event of a depression in land values,to prevent the aggravation of the downturn that would result if defaulting purchasers lost the land and were burdened with personal liability.citation.it is clear that allowing an action for waste following a foreclosure sale of property securing purchase money mortgages may often frustrate this purpose.damages for waste would burden the defaulting purchaser with both loss of land and personal liability and the acts giving rise to that liability would have been caused in many cases by the economic downturn itself.for example,a purchaser caught in such circumstances may be compelled in the normal course of events to forego the general maintenance and repair of the property in order to keep up his payments on the mortgage debt.if he eventually defaults and loses the property,to hold him subject to additional liability for waste would seem to run counter to the purpose of section and to permit the purchase money lender to obtain what is in effect a deficiency judgment.it is of course true that not all owners of real property subject to a purchase money mortgage commit waste solely or primarily as a result of the economic pressures of a market depression indeed many are reckless,intentional,and at times even malicious despoilers of property.in these latter circumstances to which we shall refer for convenience as waste committed in bad faith,the purchase money lender should not go remediless since they do not involve the type of risk intended to be borne by him in promoting the objectives of section alluded to above.
accordingly,we hold that section should apply to bar recovery in actions for waste following foreclosure sale in the first instance but should not so apply in the second instance of bad faith waste.we further hold that it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine on a case by case basis to what,if any,extent the impairment of the mortgagee security has been caused as in the first instance by the general decline of real property values and to what,if any,extent as in the second instance by the bad faith acts of the mortgagor,such determination,in either instance,being subject to review under the established rule of appellate review.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.
the cornelison court also assessed the effect upon an action for waste of section which applies to a nonpurchase money mortgage.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.under that statute,the mortgagee can get a deficiency judgment following a judicial foreclosure sale but not following a private foreclosure sale under the power of sale in a deed of trust.cornelison,at.the court explained that i f following a nonjudicial sale the mortgagee were allowed to obtain a judgment for damages for waste against the mortgagor,he would have the double benefits of an irredeemable title to the property and a personal judgment against the mortgagor for the impairment of the value of the property.this would essentially destroy the parity between judicial foreclosure and private foreclosure in all instances where the waste is actually caused by general economic conditions,since as we have explained,such recovery is in effect a deficiency judgment.if,however,the recovery is limited to waste committed in bad faith,then the personal judgment would be entirely independent of the problems encompassed by the antideficiency legislation and would not affect the parity of remedies.accordingly,we hold that in situations arising under section,recovery for waste against the mortgagor following nonjudicial foreclosure sale is barred by the section proscription against deficiency judgments when the waste actually results from the depressed condition of the general real estate market but not when the waste is caused by the bad faith acts of the mortgagor.cornelison,at.
having determined that the antideficiency statutes barred recovery for all but bad faith waste,the supreme court concluded that whether the defendant was liable for committing bad faith waste need not be resolved because even if he was liable on that basis,the plaintiff could not recover any damages because she purchased the property by making a full credit bid,thereby establishing that the value of the security was equal to the outstanding indebtedness and ipso facto the nonexistence of any impairment of the security.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.
we now turn back to the case before us.in the trial court,defendants argued that cornelison defined bad faith waste as reckless,intentional,or malicious conduct,and they argued there was no such conduct here because t he building demolition was based on a good faith belief that the property could be developed.the trial court accepted this argument.we do not.
to understand our conclusion requires a proper understanding of cornelison,and to properly understand cornelison it is critical to remember that what the supreme court was called on to do there was determine when a cause of action for waste is foreclosed by the policies behind the antideficiency statutes for our purposes,especially section.in that regard,the court noted that t he primary purpose of section is in the event of a depression in land values,to prevent the aggravation of the downturn that would result if defaulting purchasers lost the land and were burdened with the personal liability of a deficiency judgment.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.the court recognized that section accomplishes this by plac ing the risk of inadequate security on the purchase money mortgagee.a vendor is thus discouraged from overvaluing the security and i f inadequacy of security results,not from overvaluing,but from a decline in property values during a general or local depression,section prevents the aggravation of the downturn that would result if defaulting purchasers were burdened with large personal liability and thus the statute serves as a stabilizing factor in land sales.id.at,quoting roseleaf chierighino cal d.
having identified the purpose behind section,the court in cornelison sought to identify the circumstances in which an action for waste following a foreclosure sale of property securing purchase money mortgages would frustrate this purpose.cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at.the court recognized that this would happen when the acts giving rise to liability for waste were caused by the economic downturn itself.ibid.in such circumstances,to hold the purchaser subject to liability for waste would permit the purchase money lender to obtain what is in effect a deficiency judgment.ibid.
in other words,when the owner of property subject to a deed of trust that secures a purchase money loan engages in conduct that impairs the value of the property as security for the loan,commits waste because of the economic pressures of a market depression,the reduction in the value of the property that results is,for all intents and purposes,the same as if the loss in value had resulted directly from the general decline in property values due to the depression.it is in that circumstance that damages for waste would be the functional equivalent of a deficiency judgment.
on the other hand,when the conduct that impairs the value of the property as security is not solely or primarily a result of the economic pressures of a market depression cornelison kornbluth,supra,cal d at,then damages for waste are not the functional equivalent of a deficiency judgment.this is so because such circumstances do not involve the type of risk intended to be borne by the purchase money lender ibid.that is,the risk the security will be inadequate because of a decline
