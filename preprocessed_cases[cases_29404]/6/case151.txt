this is an appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul oetken,judge dismissing the plaintiff claims without prejudice for lack of standing.the plaintiff appeals from that decision and from the district court denial of the plaintiff request to attempt to cure the standing defect by having the real party in interest ratify,join,or be substituted into the action pursuant to.a.because we agree that the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue its stated claims,and because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow ratification,joinder,or substitution under rule a,we affirm.
background 
cortlandt street recovery cortlandt,a new york corporation,is attempting to collect approximately million allegedly owed to it under defaulted subordinated notes sub notes issued in by a entity,hellas telecommunications luxembourg ii,hellas ii.cortlandt alleges that the holders of the sub notes,citizens severally of greece,the british virgin islands,the cayman islands,and gibraltar assigned cortlandt a portion of the notes in,thereby authorizing cortlandt to bring the present action 
cortlandt contends,in substance,that the private equity firms tpg capital,tpg and apax partners,llp apax,which are not parties to the present suit,used the sub notes to defraud their creditors.according to cortlandt,tpg and apax owned a group of related foreign companies including hellas ii and defendants hellas telecommunications.and hellas telecommunications i,also luxembourg entities the hellas defendants.cortlandt alleges that tpg and apax issued promissory notes,in the name of one of the hellas defendants,pledging tpg and apax equity in the company and its subsidiaries as collateral.according to cortlandt,the firms then used the proceeds from this sale to buy their own collateral,rendering the hellas entities insolvent.
cortlandt argues that this process termed a rendered both the hellas defendants and several foreign investment funds that owned or financed the hellas the sponsor defendants liable to the noteholders or their assignees.in november,cortlandt,as purported assignee of the sub notes,filed a complaint against both sets of defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming,inter alia,the right to payment under the sub notes,breach of contract,violations of prohibitions on distributions,fraudulent conveyances,and unjust enrichment.cortlandt requested relief in the form of payment of the amounts owed on the sub notes,plus interest,and fees,costs,and expenses.
cortlandt also filed several other lawsuits in state and federal court seeking to collect on the sub notes and on another tranche of notes it claims it was assigned,the pik notes,which are not at issue in this case.see,cortlandt recovery aliberti,civ.jpo,wl,dist.lexis,on reconsideration,wl,dist.lexis,cortlandt recovery deutsche bank ag,london branch,civ.jpo,wl,dist.lexis july,appeal dismissed,cortlandt recovery hellas,consolidating four actions initiated by cortlandt on the sub and pik notes.
in one of these other actions,cortlandt brought suit on the sub notes against deutsche bank ag,london branch deutsche bank,alleging it to be an underwriter of the sub notes.cortlandt recovery deutsche bank ag,london branch,civ.jpo,wl,dist.lexis july,the deutsche bank opinion,appeal dismissed,see also complaint at,cortlandt recovery deutsche bank ag,london branch,civ.jpo.in both the deutsche bank action and the present one,the defendants moved to dismiss on several grounds,including that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.see.b.specifically,the defendants argued that cortlandt lacked title to the sub notes and therefore lacked article iii standing to bring claims related to those notes.see deutsche bank,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss in both cases.in july,the court issued an order and opinion in the deutsche bank case concluding that cortlandt had failed adequately to plead title to claims arising under the sub notes and that cortlandt had therefore failed adequately to plead facts on which article iii standing could be based.see deutsche bank,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in august,the court issued an order in the present action explaining that the action was dismissed without prejudice f or the reasons set forth in the deutsche bank opinion.order,cortlandt recovery aliberti,civ.jpo,

discussion 
cortlandt argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants motion to dismiss its complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.b.cortlandt further asserts that the district court erred in failing to grant to it the opportunity to cure any standing defect under.a,which allows for the real party in interest to ratify,join,or be substituted into a pending action.we disagree with both contentions.

a district court properly dismisses an action under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it,makarova united states,cir,such as when as in the case at bar the plaintiff lacks constitutional standing to bring the action.see huff asset mgmt,llc deloitte touche llp,cir see also alliance for envtl.renewal,pyramid crossgates,cir t he proper procedural route for standing challenges at the pleadings stage is a motion under rule b.on appeal from a dismissal under rule b,we review the court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.makarova,at.

ii.standing 
in its constitutional dimension,standing imports justiciability whether the plaintiff has made out a case or controversy between himself and the defendant within the meaning of art.iii.warth seldin.to have such article iii standing,the plaintiff must have alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant its invocation of jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court remedial powers on its behalf.id.at quoting baker carr.others may benefit collaterally from a resolution favorable to the plaintiff,id.at,or suffer from an unfavorable one,but the plaintiff genuinely personal stake ensures the presence of that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which a court so largely depends.baker,at.
a plaintiff claiming such a stake must establish,first,that it has sustained an injury in fact which is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted second,that the injury was in some sense caused by the opponent action or omission,and finally,that a favorable resolution of the case is likely to redress the injury,id.at.these elements form an irreducible constitutional minimum without which a federal court may not proceed to the merits of a claim.id.at.t he jurisdictional issue must be resolved before the merits issue alliance for envtl.renewal,at.
cortlandt does not allege that it has suffered direct injury as a result of the defendants actions.it points instead to the principle that l awsuits by assignees are cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to,and resolved by,the judicial process.sprint commc ns,l.apcc,quoting.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens.the defendants,for their part,do not dispute that an assignment of claims from the noteholders to cortlandt would allow cortlandt to stand in the place of the injured party and satisfy constitutional standing requirements.huff,at.neither do they dispute that the noteholders could have assigned their claims to cortlandt.see advanced magnetics,bayfront partners,cir in general,claims or choses in action may be freely transferred or assigned to others.instead,the parties dispute whether the noteholders actually did assign the claims such that cortlandt has standing to bring suit on the sub notes.
to assign a claim effectively,the claim owner must manifest an intention to make the assignee the owner of the claim.id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.a assignor need not use any particular language to validly assign its claim so long as the language manifests the assignor intention to transfer at least title or ownership,to accomplish a completed transfer of the entire interest of the assignor in the particular subject of assignment.id.emphasis added citations omitted.an assignor grant of,for example,the power to commence and prosecute to final consummation or compromise any suits,actions or proceedings,id.at quoting agreements that were the subject of that appeal,may validly create a power of attorney,but that language would not validly assign a claim,because it does not purport to transfer title or ownership of one.id.
cortlandt has not carried its burden of showing a valid assignment of a claim.first,cortlandt complaint does not allege a completed transfer of the noteholders entire interest in any claim arising under the sub notes.id.at.the complaint alleges that cortlandt was assigned full rights under the assignments to collect principal and interest due and to pursue all remedies,pl.first am.compl,and that cortlandt is authorized to sue and collect on the sub notes on behalf of the assignors,id.it does not,however,indicate that cortlandt was assigned ownership of the claims.cortlandt argues that an assignment of full rights to collect is sufficient to satisfy the requirement.appellant br.at.but,as we have explained,
a provision by which one person grants another the power to sue on and collect on a claim confers on the grantee a power of attorney with respect to that claim.the grant of a power of attorney,however,is not the equivalent of an assignment of ownership and,standing alone,a power of attorney does not enable the grantee to bring suit in his own name.
advanced magnetics,at citations omitted charles alan wright et,fed.prac.proc.civ.ed.t he mere transfer of a general power of attorney does not create a sufficient interest or right in the chose and the grantor of the power remains the only real party in interest.
nor has cortlandt pointed to anything in the assignment,or to other evidence in the record,suggesting that title to claims arising under the sub notes was assigned to it the assignment reads 
the noteholder hereby assigns to cortlandt street recovery corp full rights to collect amounts of principal and interest due on the notes,and to pursue all remedies with respect to the notes against hellas finance or various other related entities and any other person or entity who may be liable to noteholder.the noteholder remains the owner of the notes and person in whose name the notes are registered.
the noteholder hereby irrevocably appoints cortlandt its true and lawful attorney and proxy,with full power of substitution,to pursue collection and all remedies with respect to the notes under this appointment cortlandt shall have all requisite power and authority to make any request or demand or to take any other action under or with respect to the notes,or under the december,indenture under which the notes were issued.
the language of the assignment confirms that cortlandt was authorized to collect payment on behalf of the noteholders,but it does not so much as hint that title to the claims at issue was being transferred.an assignment such as the one in issue,which does not transfer ownership of claims,is,on its own,insufficient to permit a purported assignee to sue on those claims in its name.advanced magnetics,at.
cortlandt urges us to reconsider the approach of advanced magnetics in light of sprint communications,apcc services.we think advanced magnetics remains persuasive.in sprint,payphone operators had assigned their right to collect specified payments from telephone carriers to collection firms called aggregators.id.at.through a separate agreement,the aggregators agreed to remit any payments obtained from the carriers to the payphone operators,less a fee for the aggregators services.id.at.the aggregators brought suit against the carriers.id.the carriers moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the remittance agreement deprived the aggregators mere assignees for collection of any real interest in the claims and,therefore,of standing to pursue them,despite the valid assignment.id.
the court rejected the carriers challenge,recognizing the longstanding historical tradition of suits by assignees,including assignees for collection.id.at.whatever the aggregators did with their payments,the court reasoned,was of no constitutional moment.after all,the aggregators injuries would be redressed whether the aggregators remit ted the litigation proceeds to the payphone operators,donate d them to charity,or use d them to build new corporate headquarters.id.at.
cortlandt argues that n othing in sprint suggests that title or ownership must be recited in an assignment to confer standing upon an assignee.appellant reply br.at.but sprint did not focus on the aggregators title to the claims because there was no reason to believe the assignment was anything less than a complete transfer to the aggregator s of the injury and resulting claim.sprint,at internal quotation marks omitted.the assignment at issue in sprint assign ed,transfer red and set over to the aggregator for purposes of collection,all rights,title and interest of the payphone operators in the operators claims,demands,or causes of action.id.at emphases added.the assignment here,by contrast,confers only full rights to collect amounts of principal and interest due on the notes,and to pursue all remedies with respect to the notes,making no mention of title to,or ownership of,the claims.whereas the payphone operators in sprint assigned their claims to the aggregators lock,stock,and barrel,id.at,the noteholders in the case at bar assigned to cortlandt only the ability to collect under the claims.although sprint confirms that an assignee need not possess more than title to a claim to bring suit upon that claim,nothing in that case suggests that an assignee may proceed with less.
if there was any doubt about the continuing relevance of advanced magnetics in light of sprint,it was settled by w.huff asset management,llc deloitte touche llp,cir.there we concluded that sprint implicitly supports the holding of advanced magnetics that a mere does not confer standing to sue in the holder own right.id.at.it is still true that the minimum requirement for an is that the plaintiff have legal title to,or a proprietary interest in,the claim.id.
cortlandt argues,finally on this score,that an assignment of rights to collect payments under the notes and to pursue all remedies under the notes confers an interest at least as broad as that conferred by an assignment of title.appellant br.at.the dispositive inquiry does not go to the breadth of the assignment,however,but rather to its nature.there is an important distinction between simply hiring a lawyer and assigning a claim to a lawyer the latter confers a property right which creditors might attach the former does not.sprint,at.our caselaw confirms that a purported assignee of a claim must plead a proprietary interest in that claim,and not simply the ability to pursue the claim on behalf of another,to bring the claim in his or her own name and satisfy the requirements of constitutional standing.
cortlandt further argues that even if it lacked constitutional standing,the district court erred by not providing cortlandt with the opportunity to cure this deficiency under.a.as noted above,a district court decision whether to dismiss pursuant to rule a is reviewed for abuse of discretion.schreiber,at.
rule a requires that an action be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.in part ii of our opinion,above,we concluded that the district court was correct in deciding that,absent an assignment of the claims in issue,this lawsuit was not brought or prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.but rule a prohibits a court from dismissing an action for failure to comply with subsection a until,after an objection,a reasonable time has been allowed for the real party in interest to ratify,join,or be substituted into the action.
the real party in interest principle embodied in rule ensures that only a person who possesses the right to enforce a claim and who has a significant interest in the litigation can bring the claim.schreiber,at quoting.power westinghouse,cir see also oscar gruss son,hollander,cir a n action must be brought by the person who,according to the governing substantive law,is entitled to enforce the right.internal quotation marks omitted.the rule was initially adopted to ensure that assignees could bring suit in their own names,contrary to the practice.see.advisory committee notes,amendment.however,the modern function of the rule is to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover,and to insure generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res judicata.see also gogolin stelter karn auto imports,cir the purpose of the rule is to prevent multiple or conflicting lawsuits by persons such as assignees,executors,or beneficiaries,who would not be bound by res judicata principles.the dismissal provision in rule a was added later to avoid forfeiture and injustice when an understandable mistake has been made in selecting the party in whose name the action should be brought.charles alan wright et,fed.prac.proc.civ.ed.that provision codifies the modern judicial tendency to be lenient when an honest mistake has been made in selecting the proper plaintiff.id.
if a party successfully moves for ratification,joinder,or substitution,the action proceeds as if it had been originally commenced by the real party in interest.a.crucially for statute of limitations purposes,the claim of the real party in interest therefore dates back to the filing of the complaint.cortlandt argues that although its lawsuit was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the dismissal was based solely on the fact that cortlandt was not the real party in interest.it should therefore have been permitted either to amend the complaint to substitute the parties who actually held the claims at issue as plaintiffs in the lawsuit,or to amend its agreement with the real parties in interest to transfer title to the claims to cortlandt,thereby making it the real party interest.
the defendants first argument to the contrary is that cortlandt forfeited any rule a objection by failing to raise the issue before the district court.i t is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.bogle assegai connecticut,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.cortlandt asserts that it preserved the objection by requesting the opportunity to amend its complaint if the c ourt conclude d there were any defects or deficiencies.mem.in opp to the sponsor defs.mot.to dismiss at,dkt,cortlandt recovery aliberti,civ.jpo,mem.in opp to the mot.to dismiss of the hellas defs.at,dkt,cortlandt recovery aliberti,civ.jpo.
cortlandt did not explicitly refer to rule or specify a means by which it hoped to remedy any standing deficiency in the action as filed.but it did invoke rule in the context of the defendant standing objection in the deutsche bank action,arguing that it should have been given the opportunity to substitute the noteholders as the real parties in interest or to obtain a new assignment.deutsche bank,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.and the district court squarely addressed those arguments,denying the requests,wl,at,dist.lexis at.because the district court dismissed the present action f or the reasons set forth in the deutsche bank opinion,order,cortlandt recovery aliberti,civ.jpo,thus reaching and rejecting cortlandt implied a objection,and because we may in any event exercise our discretion to consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal where the argument presents a question of law and there is no need for additional,bogle assegai,at internal quotation marks omitted,we decline to conclude that cortlandt has forfeited its rights under rule.
the question then is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying an amendment request under rule.we have had few occasions on which to address this issue.see schreiber,at noting that as of this c ircuit appears never to have stated the proper standard of review for a district court application of the curative procedures set forth in that rule.in advanced magnetics,our circuit leading case interpreting the rule,we concluded that the assignment agreements in issue were insufficient to transfer to the plaintiff ownership of the claims of the assignors and hence were insufficient to permit the plaintiff to sue on those claims in its name.at emphasis added.
we nonetheless returned the case to the district court directing that leave to file the proposed amended complaint substituting the assignors as plaintiffs to pursue their own claims be granted under rule a.id.at.we reasoned that such substitution was warranted for three reasons first,t he complaint only pertinent flaw was the identity of the party pursuing those claims.id.at.in other words,the proposed amended complaint sought only to substitute one name for another the factual and legal allegations of the complaint would remain unaltered.second,there was no indication of bad faith or an effort to deceive or prejudice the defendants.id.at.finally,the proposed substitution did not threaten to prejudice the defendants,who had timely notice of the substance of the allegations,the relevant parties,and their claims.id.
but the facts underlying our decision in advanced magnetics differ from those in the case at bar in at least one significant respect there,unlike here,the named plaintiff had standing irrespective of any amendment under rule to pursue at least some of its claims against the defendants cortlandt did not.the district court here followed the lead of several other district courts in this circuit by distinguishing advanced magnetics based on that difference see,clarex natixis sec.am.llc,civ.pae,wl,at,u.dist.lexis,at,in re slm.sec.
in cortlandt case,absent a complete assignment of the only claims on which the lawsuit was based,there was no valid lawsuit pending before the district court in which to permit an amended complaint.the district court reasoned that s tanding is to be determined as of the commencement of suit.lujan,at.a court may not permit an action to continue,even where the jurisdictional deficiencies have been subsequently cured,if jurisdiction was lacking at the commencement of a suit disability advocates,coal.for quality assisted living,cir.deutsche bank,wl,at,dist.lexis,at second ellipsis in original.the court also noted that where courts in this circuit have used rule a to remedy defects in standing,they have generally done so where the plaintiff clearly had standing on another claim that it brought,dist.lexis,at quoting clarex,wl,at,dist.lexis,at brackets in original.in other words,in the absence of a plaintiff with standing,this lawsuit was a nullity,and there was therefore no lawsuit pending for the real party in interest to ratify,join,or be substituted into under rule a or otherwise.
the question whether a plaintiff may use rule a to remedy a standing deficiency when it lacks standing as to all of its claims as is the case here appears to be an issue of first impression in this court,if not the district courts in this circuit.see huff,at avoiding rule a question where only issue on appeal was constitutional standing lunney united states,cir avoiding rule a question by affirming dismissal on other jurisdiction
