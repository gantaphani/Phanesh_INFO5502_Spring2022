in this appeal we are asked to determine a question of first impression.do the protections in code of civil procedure section apply to a borrower after she,with the approval of her lender,sells her residence to a third party for a price that is less than the outstanding balance owed the lender on the borrower mortgage loan,which was obtained to purchase the residence we conclude that section protections do apply in this situation.
here,we are faced with an all too familiar and unfortunate fact pattern in the wake of the collapse of the residential real estate market in.a borrower obtained a mortgage loan to buy a house.the loan was secured by a deed of trust recorded against the residence.after property values fell and the economy declined,the borrower was no longer able to make payments on her loan,and the mortgage lender began the nonjudicial foreclosure process.to avoid foreclosure,the borrower agreed to sell her house to a third party.however,the sale price was less than the amount the borrower owed on her loan.the mortgage lender agreed to the sale,but,as a condition of approval,stated that the borrower would be responsible for any deficiency,the difference between the outstanding balance on the loan and the money received by the lender after the sale to the third party.
after the sale,the mortgage lender pursued the borrower for the deficiency.in response,the borrower filed a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a judicial declaration,among other things,that section prohibits the lender from obtaining a deficiency judgment after the sale.the mortgage lender demurred to the complaint,and the superior court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend finding section applies only after a foreclosure.the court subsequently entered judgment dismissing the borrower complaint with prejudice.
the borrower appeals,arguing that the court incorrectly interpreted section in finding that it does not prevent a lender from seeking a deficiency judgment after a sale of the property to a third party.we agree and thus reverse the judgment and remand this matter to the superior court with directions.
factual and procedural background 
carol coker was the owner of certain real property located at second avenue,d,san diego,california.to purchase the property,she obtained a loan memorialized by a promissory note.the note was secured by a deed of trust recorded against the property.
the original lender was valley vista mortgage corporation,a company that went defunct.chase home finance was the successor in interest to valley vista,and the alter ego,subsidiary,successor in interest,or a division of jp morgan chase bank,chase bank.
coker stopped paying on the loan and a notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust was recorded.coker subsequently negotiated a sale of the property to a third party,but the sale price was less than the outstanding balance under the loan.thus,coker asked chase bank to agree to the sale.
chase bank approved the sale subject to several conditions,one of which stated that the amount of the sale proceeds paid to chase bank was for the release of chase bank security interest only,and coker was still responsible for any deficiency balance remaining on the loan after application of the proceeds received by chase bank.
the sale closed and chase bank received the agreed upon proceeds from the sale.a grant deed was recorded evidencing the transfer of the property from coker to the buyer.in addition,chase bank executed and recorded a substitution of trustee and full reconveyance of coker deed of trust.
after the sale closed,allied international credit,on behalf of chase bank,sent coker a collection letter demanding coker pay based on the unsatisfied portion of the loan.in response,coker filed a complaint for declaratory relief,which she later amended.the first amended complaint listed three causes of action for declaratory relief.these causes of action alleged sections and as well as the common law prohibited chase bank from collecting a deficiency based on the loan.
chase bank demurred to the first amended complaint.the superior court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,finding section only applied after a property was sold by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure section was not applicable because it did not apply retroactively and there was no common law protections.the court subsequently entered judgment,dismissing the first amended complaint with prejudice as to chase bank.
coker timely appealed.

coker assertions 
coker asserts the superior court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend because a demurrer is inappropriate for declaratory relief actions section does not require a foreclosure section does not have to be applied retroactively and she did or could have adequately pled a claim for estoppel.
here,we focus on coker section argument.coker maintains section does not require a foreclosure and its protection applies to a sale like the one at issue here.chase bank disagrees,contending section only applies after a foreclosure.in making its argument,chase bank relies on the text of both sections and.as we explain below,we conclude that section applies to any loan used to purchase residential real property purchase money loan regardless of the mode of sale.as such,section protections prohibit a deficiency judgment following any sale of the subject real property.because we conclude the superior court incorrectly interpreted section and sustained the demurrer in error,we do not reach any of the other issues coker raises.
foreclosures,short sales,and deficiency judgments 
california recognizes two types of foreclosure.the first and more common is a nonjudicial foreclosure.in a nonjudicial foreclosure,also known as a trustee sale,the trustee exercises the power of sale given by the deed of trust.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th.nonjudicial foreclosure is less expensive and more quickly concluded than judicial foreclosure,since there is no oversight by a court,n either appraisal nor judicial determination of fair value is required,and the debtor has no postsale right of redemption.ibid.the recording of a notice of default begins the nonjudicial foreclosure process,which concludes with the trustee sale.see civ.code,subd.a.the creditor,however,may not seek a deficiency judgment following the trustee sale.see roseleaf chierighino cal d,roseleaf.this prohibition exists even if the loan was not a purchase money loan.see.
a judicial foreclosure requires the foreclosing party to file a lawsuit.in that action,the plaintiff must establish the subject loan is in default and the amount of default.arabia bac home loans servicing,th.while a judicial foreclosure typically is more costly and time consuming than a nonjudicial foreclosure and the borrower retains the right of redemption,the plaintiff may seek a deficiency judgment in certain circumstances.id.at.the amount of the deficiency judgment will be the difference between the fair market value of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale as determined by the court and the amount of indebtedness.ibid.nevertheless,the plaintiff may not recover a deficiency judgment after judicially foreclosing on a purchase money loan.see,subd.a,subd.b.
thus,section prohibits a deficiency judgment following a foreclosure on a purchase money loan.see budget realty,hunter d,budget realty.section further extends this protection to include any loan secured by a deed of trust recorded against residential real property after a nonjudicial foreclosure.national enterprises,woods th.however,here,it is undisputed that there was no foreclosure,either judicial or nonjudicial.instead,coker sold the property to a third party,with chase bank consent,for less than what coker owed on the loan.this is what is commonly known as a short sale because the sale price is less than the balance of the outstanding debt secured by the deed of trust.see bernhardt,mortgages,deeds of trust,and foreclosure litigation cont.ed.bar ed.debtor strategies,a.
in california,short sales are becoming increasingly more common,increasing from a few thousand in to approximately in.see com.on judiciary,analysis on bill reg.sess.as amended march.because short sales have only recently become prevalent in california,it is not surprising that there is no reported california case determining if section protections extend to a short sale involving real property secured by a deed of trust based on a purchase money loan.we therefore must answer this novel question.
section.statutory interpretation 
in construing statutes,we determine and effectuate legislative intent.people woodhead cal d,people ex rel.younger superior court cal d.to ascertain intent,we look first to the words of the statutes.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,woodhead,supra,at.words must be construed in context,and statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d.
b.the interpretation of section 
section is part of a collection of statutes created by the legislature during the great depression.section states in relevant part no deficiency judgment shall lie in any event a fter a sale of real property for failure of the purchaser to complete his or her contract of sale u nder a deed of trust or mortgage on a dwelling given to a lender to secure repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the purchase price of that dwelling.it was amended in to add,among other things,a clause extending section to the kind of real property at issue in this case,namely a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure repayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the purchase price of that dwelling,occupied entirely or in part by the purchaser.see barash wood d,stats,ch.
section addresses purchase money loans and establishes that they are loans under california law.in a nonrecourse loan,the borrower has no personal liability and the lender sole recourse is against the security for the obligation.aozora bank,north california boulevard th.section prohibits a deficiency judgment after any sale of real property under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the vendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price.thus in the event of a default in payment under a purchase money debt owed to the vendor and secured by the property purchased,the vendor can only look to the security for the recovery of the debt.budget realty,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
in interpreting section,we recognize that it,like other components of the statutes,has been liberally construed to effectuate the specific legislative purpose behind it t he courts have exhibited a very hospitable attitude toward the legislative policy underlying the legislation and have given it a broad and liberal construction that often goes beyond the narrow bounds of the statutory language.prunty bank of america d.indeed,our high court has consistently rejected any interpretations that undermine the purpose of the statute.see,deberard properties lim cal th,deberard rejecting interpretation that would allow creditor to circumvent section and thus flout its purpose.
the legislature passed section for two reasons to stabilize purchase money secured land sales prices by preventing overvaluing the property and ensure purchasers as a class are harmed less than they might otherwise be during a time of economic decline because if property values drop,the purchaser loss is limited to the land that he or she used as security in the transaction.deberard,supra,cal th at.
these two public policy goals are achieved by shifting the risk of falling property values to the lender.as our supreme court explained section places the risk of inadequate security on the purchase money mortgagee.a vendor is thus discouraged from overvaluing the security.precarious land promotion schemes are discouraged,for the security value of the land gives purchasers a clue as to its true market value.citation.if inadequacy of the security results,not from overvaluing,but from a decline in property values during a general or local depression,section prevents the aggravation of the downturn that would result if defaulting purchasers were burdened with large personal liability.section thus serves as a stabilizing factor in land sales.roseleaf,supra,cal d at.
with the text and purpose of section in mind,we see nothing in section that leads us to believe it only applies after a foreclosure sale as chase bank urges.section plain language does not limit the mode of sale no deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property.there is no language modifying the term sale.moreover,the use of the phrase in any event further indicates that the legislature intended section to apply to all sales.put differently,section does not address a specific mode of sale.instead,it focuses on a particular type of loan the purchase money loan.see prunty bank of america,supra,d at budget realty,supra,d at.the plain language of section therefore supports an interpretation that its protections apply after any sale,not just a foreclosure.
while no california court has specifically addressed whether section applies to a short sale involving a purchase money loan,courts have consistently held that a foreclosure is not a prerequisite to trigger section protections.see frangipani boeker th,holding that barred beneficiary of junior purchase money trust deed from collecting deficiency where property was not foreclosed because beneficiary cancel ed the notice of foreclosure venable harmon d,holding that applied to prevent a deficiency judgment after the defendants tendered the property to the plaintiffs and the fact that there has not been a prior sale is of no moment.
our interpretation that section applies to all sales of property encumbered by a deed of trust securing a purchase money loan is further buttressed by california newest statute section section bars deficiencies where there is a deed of trust or mortgage for a dwelling of not more than four units if the trustor or mortgagor sells the dwelling for a sale price less than the remaining amount of the indebtedness outstanding at the time of sale,in accordance with the written consent of the holder of the deed of trust or mortgage,subds.a.section expands the protection found in section by prohibiting a deficiency judgment arising out of a short sale approved by the creditor of any mortgage loan,not just purchase money loans.unlike section,however,section only applies to a specific mode of sale the short sale.see.
moreover,the legislative history of section introduced as senate bill shows the legislature knew section applied to short sales.for example,the section of the senate floor analyses devoted to e xisting law states that section provide s protection to a purchase money note that becomes the subject of a short sale.rules,off.of floor analyses,unfinished business of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
in addition,the legislative history of section reveals that it was enacted to extend protections beyond the purchase money loans covered by section to include nonpurchase money loans.as the assembly floor analysis expressly states according to the author t he purpose of this proposed legislation is primarily to protect distressed homeowners who have money recourse loans on residential property assem.floor analysis,reading of bill reg.sess.as amended june,assem.floor analysis.the legislature further made clear that senate bill seeks to clear up any legal confusion between purchase money and money loans in reg
