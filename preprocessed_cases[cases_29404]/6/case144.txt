in this action,plaintiff bank of new york mellon trust company,bny or trustee appeals an award of summary judgment in favor of defendant morgan stanley mortgage capital,morgan stanley entered on june,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge.bny argues that the district court erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that morgan stanley was not contractually obliged to repurchase a mortgage loan allegedly issued in breach of a contract representation because the trustee duty to give notice to cure within three business days of becoming aware of a material breach was a condition precedent to the seller repurchase obligation,bank of mellon tr.morgan stanley mortg.capital,civ.cm gwg bny i,wl june,and that condition was not performed within the specified three days,but two to four weeks later,see bank of mellon tr.morgan stanley mortg.capital,civ.cm gwg bny ii,wl june.
for reasons explained herein,we conclude that the contract at issue did not require notice to cure as a condition precedent to morgan stanley remedying breach.indeed,the phrase notice to cure does not appear in the contract.rather,the contract contains distinct provisions for giving notice of breach and making request for cure,neither of which is cast in the express language of condition.to the extent a condition precedent might be inferred from the fact that notice of breach is a necessary trigger for the day cure period,that rationale would pertain only to the giving of that notice,not to its timeliness,and much less to request for cure,which performs no triggering role.thus,request for cure is not a condition precedent to morgan stanley remedy obligations,and the timeliness of a request for cure,as well as of a notice of breach,is properly construed as a promise and reviewed for substantial performance.
on review of the record,we further conclude that the notice of breach and request for cure in this case can not be held untimely as a matter of law,particularly when reviewed for substantial performance.accordingly,we vacate the award of summary judgment in favor of morgan stanley,and we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the mortgage loan purchase agreement 
the contract at issue is a may,mortgage loan purchase agreement mlpa,pertaining to an million mortgage loan that morgan stanley issued to city view center,llc the city view loan on december,for the purchase of a retail center in garfield heights,ohio the city view property.pursuant to the mlpa,morgan stanley sold the city view loan to morgan stanley capital i,which,pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement psa of the same date,placed the city view loan into morgan stanley capital i trust the trust,then valued at nearly five billion dollars.the trust was later securitized and sold to investors.
the psa designated bny as trustee of the trust and,thus,the entity entitled to enforce various agreements,including the mlpa here at issue.the psa also designated wells fargo national association wells fargo as a master servicer,responsible for administering the trust loans and collecting payments,and centerline servicing centerline as special servicer,responsible for servicing any defaulted loans on may,trustee bny granted the master and special servicers authority to act on its behalf when servicing and administering the trust loans.
city view default on the loan 
on september,master servicer wells fargo informed special servicer centerline that the city view loan would likely go into default within days because city view had received numerous notices of lease default from wal mart,the anchor tenant of the city view property,based on methane gas intrusion into the store the ohio attorney general had filed a complaint against city view and others for regulatory violations on the city view property,including the failure to control the migration of combustible gases and the ohio agency for toxic substances disease registry had determined that conditions at the city view property amounted to an urgent public hazard.on september,wal mart in fact closed its city view property store and,soon after,canceled its lease.on november,city view defaulted on a payment.four days later,wells fargo transferred the city view loan to centerline for special servicing.
notice of breach and request for cure 
upon transfer,centerline director of special servicing,jennifer wilkicki,began investigating morgan stanley possible breach of the mlpa on february,wilkicki sent a document captioned representation and warranty claim to centerline associate general counsel,jenna unell.that document appears to be a draft notice of breach to the seller in that its opening sentence states as follows the special servicer believes it has discovered a material breach of the seller representations and warranties and hereby provides notice as required by the governing pooling and servicing agreement.the document proceeds to identify as the provision breached insofar as morgan stanley had represented that it had no knowledge of any material and adverse environmental condition or circumstance affecting the city view property not disclosed in a referenced environmental report when it had,in fact,learned otherwise.id.internal quotation marks omitted the document supports this conclusion by citing morgan stanley january,closing counsel transaction summary,which acknowledged the environmental report failure to address the fact that the city view property was subject to state regulation as a closed land fill and that the property had received numerous notices of violation issued by the ohio environmental protection agency.id the document also details additional facts to demonstrate the material and adverse effect the noticed breach had on the interests of the holders of the certificates in the mortgage loan.see id.at.among these were wal mart departure from the city view property and its cessation of rent payments,as a result of which other tenants exercised clauses resulting in terminated leases,reduced rents,or discontinued rent payments.the document also explains that this left city view with insufficient operating income,causing it to discontinue loan payments to the trust,which now faced the legal expenses of petitioning the federal court to place a receiver at the property,proceeding against defaulting tenants,and appealing the rejection of city view insurance claim.id.at.attributing the catalogued adverse effects to morgan stanley breach of representation,the document concluded,t he mortgage loan should be repurchased pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the psa and the applicable mlpa.id.
three days later,on february,unell advised wilkicki that she had reviewed pertinent materials and agreed that there was evidence that morgan stanley knew that there were material environmental conditions or circumstances affecting the property that were not disclosed in the phase i report.id.at.unell asked wilkicki to call her to discuss further,concluding,i think that the breach notice should be sent.id.
a breach notice was sent approximately one month later,on march.in the interim,wilkicki secured an appraisal,which on february,valued the city view property at million,a steep decline from the million appraisal of two years earlier.another appraisal,confirming the million valuation,was received on march.
between receipt of these two appraisals,on march,wilkicki sent unell a more formally worded draft breach notice and request for cure,and solicited her comments.on march,unell emailed wilkicki her edits to the draft notice.the next day,wilkicki sent the revised draft to her supervisor,chris crouch,who approved it on march and directed wilkicki to send it on to centerline president,paul smyth,for go ahead to release.id.at.after receiving smyth authorization for release,wilkicki sent morgan stanley a formal notice of breach and request for cure on march.tracking language in the mlpa and psa,the notice stated that if the material breach were not corrected or cured within days of receipt,morgan stanley would be contractually obligated to repurchase or to replace the city view loan.it is,in fact,undisputed on this appeal that the breach was one that could not be cured.
approximately two months later,by letter dated may,morgan stanley replied that it disagreed with centerline characterization of the facts and circumstances and intend ed to vigorously defend its underwriting and disclosures made in the psa and the mortgage loan.id.at.thus,it did not repurchase or replace the city view loan.
on september,the special servicer sent morgan stanley a second and supplemental notification of material breach.in addition to alleging more facts to support the earlier noticed breach of representation,it asserted a breach of representation,the mlpa no material default representation in its december,reply,morgan stanley reiterated its intent to defend its representations,and asserted that the special servicer march,and september,letters were,in any event,deficient because they constitute d late notice.id.at.
district court proceedings 
on january,bny filed this lawsuit against morgan stanley for breach of the mlpa.following amended pleadings and discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.on june,the district court granted morgan stanley partial summary judgment on bny breach claim as to the no material default representation provision that ruling is not at issue on this appeal.as to the claimed breach of the environmental conditions representation,the district court granted bny summary judgment on morgan stanley waiver defense,but concluded that many issues of disputed fact precluded a general award in favor of bny.bny i,wl,at.although the district court agreed with morgan stanley that timely notice to cure was a condition precedent to any buyback obligation for breach of the environmental conditions representation,it decided that further discovery was needed to determine when the special servicer became aware of that alleged breach.id.at see id.at.
after discovery closed,the district court determined,as a matter of law,that bny special servicer became aware of a material breach of the environmental representation more than three business days before march,making its breach notice on that date untimely,thereby failing to satisfy that condition precedent to morgan stanley repurchase obligation.bny ii,wl,at.accordingly,on june,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of morgan stanley on the environmental representation breach claim.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
this appeal presents two questions for de novo review whether the mlpa obligation is a condition precedent that must be timely performed by the servicer before morgan stanley has any obligation to cure or to repurchase a noticed defective loan and whether it can be determined as a matter of law on the existing record that the request for cure in this case was untimely.see lynch city of new york,cir reviewing award of summary judgment de novo and upholding only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law phillips audio active,cir interpreting contract de novo.we answer both questions in the negative and,therefore,vacate the award of summary judgment in favor of morgan stanley and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
mlpa section remedies provision 
the district court derived the condition precedent it identified an obligation to give notice to cure within three business days of the servicer becoming aware of a material breach from mlpa section,titled remedies upon breach of representations and warranties made by the seller.thus,we begin by examining the relevant text,which states as follows 
i f there is a breach of any of the representations and warranties required to be made by the seller regarding the characteristics of the mortgage loans the related mortgaged properties and such breach,either i materially and adversely affects the interests of the holders of the certificates in the related mortgage loan,or ii both a the breach materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan and b the mortgage loan is a specially serviced mortgage loan,the party discovering such material breach shall promptly notify,in writing,the other party promptly but in any event within three business days upon becoming aware of any such material breach,the master servicer shall,and the special servicer may,request that the seller,not later than days from the seller receipt of the notice of such material breach,cure such material breach 
the seller hereby covenants and agrees that,if any such material breach can not be corrected or cured in all material aspects within the above cure period,the seller shall,on or before the termination of such cure period,either i repurchase the affected mortgage loan from the purchaser or its assignee at the purchase price as defined in the pooling and servicing agreement,or ii if within the period commencing on the closing date,at its option replace,without recourse,any mortgage loan to which such defect relates with a qualifying substitute mortgage loan.if such material breach would cause the mortgage loan to be other than a qualified mortgage as defined in the code,then notwithstanding the previous sentence,such repurchase or substitution must occur within days from the earlier of the date the seller discovered or was notified of the breach or defect.
emphasis added 
in fact,the quoted language identifies three obligations corresponding to the inserted highlighted numbers.first,a obligation,which requires any party whether the trustee,master servicer,special servicer,or even the seller discovering a material breach of representation promptly to notify the other party of its discovery of such breach.second,a obligation,which requires the master servicer,and permits the special servicer,promptly,but in any event within three business days of becoming aware of the material breach,to request that the seller cure breach within days of the receipt of notice.third,a obligation,which requires the seller either a to cure the material breach within days of receiving notice,or b if the breach can not be cured,to repurchase or to replace the defective mortgage loan.
as this parsing demonstrates,section nowhere references notice to cure.we understand the district court to have used that phrase as a shorthand reference for both the and obligations,concluding that where,as in this case,the servicer is the party discovering the material breach,it can be said to have become aware of the breach triggering its obligation at the same time it discovered it triggering its obligation.see bny i,wl,at.as we explain in the next section of this opinion,that reasoning is not without some force in explaining how a common trigger date applies to these two mlpa obligations in the circumstances of this case.see infra.but,it does not support merging the provisions for purposes of review.indeed,morgan stanley defends the district court identification of a condition precedent only by reference to the obligation.accordingly,we here decide whether request for cure is a condition precedent to morgan stanley obligation to cure or repurchase.
request for cure is not a condition precedent to cure or repurchase 
under new york law,which controls our construction of the mlpa,a condition precedent is an act or event,other than a lapse of time,which,unless the condition is excused,must occur before a duty to perform a promise in the agreement arises.oppenheimer oppenheim,appel,dixon,internal quotation marks omitted.conditions precedent are not readily assumed.while specific,talismanic words are not required,the law nevertheless demands that conditions precedent be expressed in unmistakable language.id.at,at,quoting restatement second of contracts,cmt.a,at.thus,i n determining whether a particular agreement makes an event a condition,courts will interpret doubtful language as embodying a promise or constructive condition rather than an express condition.see unigard sec.ins.river ins,see also israel chabra,cir citing oppenheimer in acknowledging new york courts caution when interpreting contract clause as condition precedent.applying these principles here,we conclude that,under the mlpa,the servicer obligation to request cure within three business days of becoming aware of a material breach is not unmistakably cast as a condition precedent to morgan stanley obligation,and,therefore,must be construed as a promise.
certainly,the mlpa does not caption or otherwise label the provision as a condition precedent to section remedies,as one might expect sophisticated parties to do if that were their intent.see,lindenbaum royco prop,dep t concluding that contract clearly imposed condition precedent where,under heading conditions of loan approval,parties expressly noted that certain conditions must be satisfied prior to the issuance of closing instructions emphasis omitted.
nor does mlpa section employ any recognized linguistic conventions of condition such as if,on condition that,provided that,in the event that,and subject to,to make plain that morgan stanley remedy obligations do not arise unless and until the servicer requests cure.israel chabra,at quoting ginett comput.task,cir identifying notice obligation introduced by underscored phrase provided,however,as condition precedent to immediately preceding guaranties see oppenheimer oppenheim,appel,dixon,at,at,recognizing if and unless and until as unmistakable language of condition.
the failure to couch the provision in the explicit language of condition is particularly significant here because the sophisticated drafters elsewhere employed precisely such language to establish undoubted conditions precedent.see,providing in mlpa for certain actions in the event that the mortgage loans are held to be the property of the seller emphasis added id.at,providing in mlpa for agent or designee to exercise purchaser rights provided the purchaser has provided the seller with prior notice of the identity of such designee or agent emphasis added see also id.at,stating in psa that successor master servicer must assume all of the obligations of the terminated master servicer as a condition precedent to its becoming master servicer hereunder emphasis added id.at,stating in psa that,as a condition precedent to the indemnification provided for in this section,indemnitee must notify the applicable indemnifying party in writing of commencement of any action emphasis added 
indeed,even within mlpa section,its drafters employed the unmistakable language of condition in detailing morgan stanley repurchase obligation.see id.at,stating that seller covenants and agrees that,if any such material breach can not be corrected or cured in all material aspects within the day cure period,the seller shall either i repurchase the affected mortgage loan or ii replace,without recourse,any mortgage loan emphasis added.in short,section makes plain that morgan stanley is required to repurchase or replace a defective loan only if it is unable to cure the defective representation within the day period afforded by the mlpa.there is no comparable contract language,however,that conditions this remedy obligation on a request for cure,much less on such a request being made within three business days.see realtime data,llc melone,dep t invoking canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius to conclude that contract language conditioning employee bonus upon sale of assets implies that bonus does not apply to distributions otherwise based see also international fid.ins.county of rockland,d,recognizing that s ophisticated lawyers must be presumed to know how to use parallel construction and identical wording to impart identical meaning when they intend to do so,and how to use different words and construction to establish distinctions in meaning.
thus,the very contract language employed by the parties undermines our dissenting colleague conclusion that morgan stanley can not be expected to cure breaches of which it has been notified but for which it has not received a formal request for cure.see dissenting,post at.in fact,its obligation to repurchase is conditioned only on its inability to cure within the day cure period.and,as the mlpa makes clear,that cure period is triggered exclusively by the seller receipt of the notice of material breach,not the servicer request for cure.emphasis added.
while new york courts have construed some triggering events as conditions precedent,they have done so only when the trigger is necessary to a party ability to perform the obligation at issue.see,alj capital i,david joseph,misc d a,wl,at,holding notice of disallowance a condition precedent to defendant repayment obligation because notice was necessary to afford defendant opportunity to cure disallowance within cure period,upon failure of which plaintiff could demand repayment,aff,dep t see also assured guar.mun.db structured,misc d.july,assuming that notice of breach triggering day cure period was condition precedent to repurchase obligation in holding notice adequate morgan guar.tr.bay view franchise mortg.acceptance,civ.sas,wl,at,applying new york law in recognizing request to cure as condition precedent where it was exclusive trigger for day cure period,which,if not met,gave rise to repurchase obligation.
even if the mlpa provision might be construed as a condition precedent because it is the necessary trigger for the cure period afforded morgan stanley its provision serves no comparable essential function without which morgan stanley could not understand or perform its cure obligation.because we are not free to rewrite into a contract conditions the parties did not insert by adding or excising terms under the guise of construction,slamow del col,dep t,we here conclude simply that whatever triggering rationale might apply to notice of breach,it does not extend to request for cure.the plain language of the mlpa obligates morgan stanley to cure or to repurchase a noticed defective loan within days of the receipt of a notice of breach.the obligation makes no mention of receipt of a request for cure 
thus,when the district court held that sending a notice to cure is unmistakably required to trigger the cure period and the buyback obligation,bny i,wl,at emphasis added,it could only have been referring to the mlpa obligation,the exclusive trigger for the day period.that same conclusion pertains to the district court statement that,because the mlpa repurchase provision expressly refers back to the notice to cure,morgan stanley obligation to repurchase is dependent on that notice.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.what the repurchase provision expressly refers back to is the date the seller discovered or was notified of the breach or defect,it nowhere mentions notice to cure.the district court went on,however,to conclude that notice to cure was a condition precedent that had to be performed within three business days the notice to cure is a condition precedent to the repurchase obligation,and the parties plainly bargained for the three day provision in the contract.bny i,wl,at.we disagree.even if the first part of the quoted sentence might find support in the mlpa obligation,the parties did not plainly bargain to subject notice of breach to the limitation applicable only to request for cure.indeed,when it recited that t he mlpa gave the special servicer three days to send out notice of any breach,bny ii,wl,at,the district court misstated the contract.
in sum,because the obligation to request cure within three business days is neither framed in conditional language nor a necessary trigger for morgan stanley remedy obligations notice of breach is,in fact,the exclusive trigger for the day period within which morgan stanley was obligated to cure or to repurchase and the timeliness of notice of breach is not contractually limited to three days,we conclude that the mlpa can not be construed to make either notice of breach within three business days or request for cure conditions precedent to morgan stanley remedy obligations.see oppenheimer oppenheim,appel,dixon,at,at.rather,timely request for cure is properly construed as a promise,which on remand should be reviewed only for substantial performance.see israel chabra,at.
c.the timing of the servicer request for cure can not preclude a finding of substantial performance as a matter of law 
the district court determined,as a matter of law,that the servicer march,communication to morgan stanley of notice of breach and request for cure was untimely.see bny ii,wl,at.we here conclude that the timing of the servicer request for cure can not preclude a finding of substantial performance as a matter of law.in explaining this conclusion,we first examine the reasoning informing the district court timeliness analysis,some of which we accept,but other parts of which are at odds with the plain language of the mlpa.
as already detailed,the mlpa requires a party to give notice of breach promptly upon discovering a material breach of representation.it also requires a servicer to act promptly in requesting cure after becoming aware of the breach.but it is only as to the latter obligation that the mlpa cabins promptness to three business days.the district court,however,appears to have concluded that where,as here,the servicer is the discovering party,notice of breach is not prompt if not made within three days.see id.at the mlpa gave the special servicer three days to send out notice of any breach.id.at holding that,because servicer notice to morgan stanley was not sent within three business days of what court found to be absolute,date for awareness of breach,breach notice was therefore untimely.in view of the servicer having discovered the breach,the district court concluded that any difference in the obligations triggering words discovering,and becoming aware of was of no moment,bny i,wl,at awareness,like discovery,occurs only at the conclusion of an investigation of the suspected breach,provided the investigation is concluded within a reasonable time,see id.at the servicer had reasonably concluded its investigation and,thus,become aware of morgan stanley alleged breach a by february,when wilkicki prepared her memorandum to unell,or certainly b by february,when unell agreed with wilkicki assessment and instructed her to send the breach notice,but in no event later than c february,when the draft appraisal came in,bny ii,wl,at.thus,the servicer delay of some two weeks after the last of these dates to transmit a request for cure was held untimely as a matter of law.
bny faults this reasoning on several grounds.we focus here on the argument it derives from the well established principle that,where contract provisions use different language,courts must assume the parties intended different meanings.see frank hall of orient overseas.thus,bny argues,discovering breach must mean something different from becoming aware of breach,with awareness necessarily coming after discovery indeed,after communication of the notice of breach triggered by discovery to avoid the absurdity of requiring a servicer to request cure within three business days of awareness before requiring the party discovering the breach to give notice subject to an undefined promptness obligation,thereby triggering the cure period.
bny argument makes sense when the servicer is not the party discovering the breach.in that circumstance,it will generally only be upon receipt of the discoverer notice of breach that the servicer acquires the awareness necessary for it to request cure.further,to the extent the discoverer conducted an investigation of the breach that the servicer has no need to duplicate,the latter can reasonably be expected to make its request for cure within three business days of receiving the notice of breach.
but,when the servicer is the party discovering breach,we can not categorically conclude,as bny urges,that it does not become aware of the breach until it transmits its own notice of breach to others.dictionary definitions may admit the possibility of discovery without awareness.compare webster third new int l dictionary defining discover as to obtain for the first time sight or knowledge of or to detect the presence of,with id.at,defining aware as marked by realization,perception,or knowledge the conclusion,however,does not transfer here,where,as the district court correctly observed,the law charges a party with discovery of breach only after it has had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and confirm its suspicions in short,when it effectively becomes aware,rather than simply suspicious,of breach.the reason the law thus delays discovery of a breach is to avoid creating an incentive for litigation before a party knows that it has suffered injury.see bny i,wl,at collecting cases id.at acknowledging that,in complex circumstances,confirming investigation can take several months.
we therefore decline to hold as a matter of law that a servicer who discovers a breach can not be charged with awareness until it transmits notice.the fact that the servicer in this case simultaneously transmitted its request for cure with its notice of breach does not necessarily mean that the former was filed within the requisite three business days.rather,the timeliness of both notice of breach and request for cure may depend,as the district court recognized,on whether they were sent promptly after the special servicer reasonably concluded its investigation of breach.
where we depart from the district court is in its conclusion that notice of breach,as well as request for cure,had to be communicated within three business days to be deemed prompt.as already discussed,the mlpa imposes a limitation on the word promptly only as to requests for cure.the absence of such a limitation from the obligation indicates that the word is to be construed more flexibly in light of the totality of circumstances.see united states fid.guar.annunziata,recognizing that where condition included in one provision is omitted from another,it must be assumed to have been intentional under accepted canons of contract construction sterling inv r,nobo,llc,dep t same.
we further conclude that the district court could not identify the reasonable conclusion date for the special servicer breach investigation or even three possible conclusion dates as a matter of law.where the promptness of breach discovery is questioned,resolution depends on an assessment of the totality of circumstances,necessarily including the credibility of witnesses and the weight particular evidence will bear.such matters are generally determined by the trier of fact rather than the court,particularly when the ultimate question is reasonableness.see hartford ins.county of nassau,noting that question whether a notice has been sent as soon as is reasonably possible is a question of fact which depends on all the facts and circumstances,especially the length of and the reasons for the delay,and that i t is only in the exceptional case that it may be decided as a matter of law deso london lancashire indem.of,explaining that reasonableness of a delay in timely written notice is usually question for jury vale.mut.ins,dep t stating that where party fails to comply with condition precedent requiring timely notice,delay may be excused if reasonable,which will generally be question of fact for a jury.thus,while the district court identified february,the date wilkicki received a draft appraisal for the city view property,as the absolute,date for a reasonable investigation to have concluded,a factfinder might determine that where,as here,the investigating party is not an individual but a corporate entity,some degree of review is part of a reasonable investigation,and the entity should be permitted to undertake such review before it is charged with discovering or becoming aware of the breach.were the jury to so find in this case,it could extend the investigation conclusion date to march,when centerline president was first asked to authorize the notice of breach and request for cure based on the investigation of his subordinates.in that event,the march,transmittal would have been prompt even under a limitation 
of course,even if a factfinder were to include review within a reasonable period,disputes might persist as to whether other events,commissioning the initial or review appraisals unreasonably prolonged the investigation.while the district court dismissed wilkicki explanations for these appraisals as implausible,when we view the record in the light most favorable to bny,we can not conclude that a reasonable factfinder was precluded as a matter of law from reaching any other conclusion.thus,the dispute can not be resolved on summary judgment.see,dillon morano,cir vacating award of summary judgment where permissibility of defendant conduct turned on explanation for it,which necessarily involved credibility determination that was question for jury.
further,because request for cure is not a condition precedent,even if a factfinder were to conclude that the time for reasonable investigation of breach ended more than three business days before march,it would still have to decide the question of substantial performance.
substantial performance is performance,the deviations permitted being minor,unimportant,inadvertent,and unintentional.cramer esswein,dep t internal quotation marks omitted see bernard las ams.commc ns,cir callanan,smiroldo,dep t.such deviations will sometimes be atoned for by allowance of the resulting damage.jacob youngs,kent,cardozo.
the question of substantial performance is usually one of fact and should be decided as a matter of law only where the inferences are certain.merrill lynch allegheny energy,cir collecting cases,including hadden consol.edison of,assessing substantial performance on basis of several factors such as absolute and relative magnitude of default,its effect on contract purpose,willfulness,and degree to which injured party was benefited under contract.thus,while bny points to a number of factors supporting substantial performance,we do not here decide the question in its favor as a matter of law.we conclude only that the record does not permit substantial performance to be rejected as a matter of law.see jacob youngs,kent,at,explaining that substantial performance is question of degree,which,if there is doubt,must be answered by triers of the facts.
in reaching that conclusion,we reiterate certain undisputed facts.first,bny did transmit a request for cure to morgan stanley thus,the only performance issue is timeliness.second,the delay in transmittal,even on the district court findings,was in the range of two to four weeks.third,the noticed breach of representation was not curable,regardless of the date when bny can be charged with awareness of the breach.
these circumstances strongly support substantial performance insofar as delay in requesting a cure that was never possible would likely be deemed trivial.as this court recently had occasion to note,w hen contracting parties agree to a provision,it is reasonable to assume that they do so with the assumption that the breaches which would be used to terminate the contract would be curable breaches.giuffre hyundai,hyundai motor,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.thus,new york common law will not require strict compliance with a contractual provision if providing an opportunity to cure would be useless.id.at collecting cases.
morgan stanley attempts to distinguish giuffre and the cases cited therein on the ground that they considered the propriety of actions taken by parties who,instead of providing opportunity to cure,terminated contracts or commenced actions for damages.it submits that the futility of cure here is no excuse for the servicer failure timely to request cure because that is the only mechanism for morgan stanley obligation to be triggered.appellee br.the argument fails because,as we have already concluded,notice of breach,not request for cure,is the singular trigger for morgan stanley remedy obligations.further,it is by no means evident that the timeliness of notice is essential to this trigger because the day cure period would not begin to run until notice was received and any harm to morgan stanley from a delay in notice could offset its remedy obligations.see jur d,guaranty suretyship stating that where giving notice within specified time is not condition precedent to liability,consequence of not giving such notice may be to relieve or exonerate the party entitled to notice only to the extent of the damage sustained by reason of the omission see also jacob youngs,kent,at.thus,the impossibility of cure is properly recognized as a factor that here could weigh in favor of substantial performance on remand.
accordingly,because the timeliness of the special servicer request for cure should not have been determined as a matter of law and because a reasonable jury could find that,even if there was some delay in requesting cure,the special servicer substantially performed this mlpa obligation,these questions of timeliness and substantial performance can not be decided in favor of morgan stanley on summary judgment but must be presented to the factfinder at trial.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude as follows 
notice to cure is not a phrase that appears in the mlpa and,thus,can not be identified as a condition precedent to morgan stanley mlpa obligation.
the obligation that the mlpa imposes on the special servicer is properly construed as a promise rather than as a condition precedent because it neither employs the linguistic conventions of condition nor serves as a trigger for the cure period at issue.
even if the mlpa obligation could be construed as a condition precedent because it triggers the day cure period a matter we need not decide as no party advances the argument that rationale would not extend to the timeliness of the notice,which has no triggering effect,much less to a time limitation,which does not cabin the obligation as it does the obligation.
the fact that the obligation arises upon a party discovering breach while the obligation arises upon a servicer becoming aware of the breach does not admit the categorical conclusion,urged by bny,that the time for requesting cure can not run before notice of breach is given,particularly where,as here,the servicer is the party discovering breach.
under new york law,a reasonable time for investigation is afforded before a party can be said to have discovered or become aware of a breach.
questions of fact as to the reasonableness of time taken to investigate the alleged breach of the mlpa environmental conditions representation preclude finding,as a matter of law,that request for cure was untimely,particularly when reviewed for substantial performance.
the judgment of the district court is,therefore,vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in concluding that a request to cure was not a condition precedent to morgan stanley repurchase obligation and that issues of fact preclude summary judgment,the majority opinion both misapplies new york law and misreads the plain language of the contract.the result is,in essence,judicial reformation of the agreement,saving a sophisticated party from the requirements of the bargain it made following negotiation.because i can not agree with these conclusions,i respectfully dissent.
it is indeed the case that new york law requires conditions precedent to be express that is,stated by the parties in unmistakable language.oppenheimer oppenheim,appel,dixon,internal quotation marks omitted.but there is no indication in oppenheimer that the standard of unmistakable language which the court drew from the second restatement of contracts requires specific,talismanic words.see oppenheimer,at,quoting restatement second of contracts cmt.a.in fact,the restatement clearly rejects that view no particular form of language is necessary to make an event a condition,although such words as on condition that,provided that and if are often used for this purpose.an intention to make a duty conditional may be manifested by the general nature of an agreement,as well as by specific language.restatement second of contracts cmt.
a recent case of the court of appeals confirms this analysis the court construed a provision requiring negotiation and execution of additional terms as an express condition precedent to a party obligation to supply capacity but relied on no conditional words,identifying the parties clear intent solely from the nature and structure of the agreement.see idt tyco,similarly,lower new york courts have concluded that an express condition precedent exists despite the lack of explicitly conditional language so long as it was unmistakably required before another obligation came into force.alj capital i,david joseph,dep t emphasis added see also walton analytical labs,dep t finding condition precedent premised on the structure of the provision,notwithstanding the lack of conditional language winfield capital mahopac auto glass,dep t same.in new york courts,therefore,specific words are strong evidence of,but not necessary to,conditions precedent the core inquiry,as in all contracts,is to give effect to the parties clear intent,as expressed through the unmistakable language they use.
so what then does the language and structure of the contract negotiated at arms length by sophisticated commercial entities tell us about breaches of the agreement and the remedies provided for those breaches for ease of reference,here again are the three obligations as identified in the majority opinion,ante,at,
if a material breach exists,the party discovering such material breach shall promptly notify,in writing,the other party 
promptly but in any event within three business days upon becoming aware of any such material breach,the master servicer shall,and the special servicer may,request that the seller,not later than days from the seller receipt of the notice of such material breach,cure such material breach 
the seller hereby covenants and agrees that,if any such material breach can not be corrected or cured in all material aspects within the above cure period,the seller shall,on or before the termination of such cure period,either i repurchase the affected mortgage loan or ii at its option replace,without recourse,any mortgage loan to which such defect relates with a substitute mortgage.
we can all agree the third clause clearly conditions morgan stanley obligation on the existence of a particular circumstance that any material breach can not be corrected or cured in all material aspects within the above cure period.emphasis added see majority,ante,at,identifying this clause as an example of unmistakable language of condition.similarly,we agree that this language makes the repurchase obligation dependent on the obligation to cure within the cure period.but where the majority opinion and i depart is whether that obligation to cure within the cure period arises from the notice of breach or from the request to cure.
the majority opinion concludes that because the period is calculated from the date of the notice of breach,the cure period must be triggered by the notice.see majority,ante,at,a s the mlpa makes clear,that cure period is triggered exclusively by the seller receipt of the notice of material breach,not the servicer request for cure.quoting.i can not agree a clock may count down from the notice of breach,but it is only the request to cure that gives that clock any legal meaning.the cure period is written as a clause in the middle of the request provision,which states that the special servicer may request that the seller,not later than days from the seller receipt of the notice of such material breach,cure such material breach.emphasis added.in other words,the ninety days and their legal significance are a part of the special servicer request.if there were no request,ninety days would pass in time typical fashion but it would not be a legally significant cure period for purposes of the repurchase obligation because no one had requested cure by that date.
the majority opinion seems disturbed by the fact the deadline for cure is not counted down from the request for cure and so concludes that the request itself has no conditional force over the repurchase obligation.but the repurchase obligation depends on the seller not curing the breach within the cure period that circumstance can only exist if the special servicer first makes a request to cure,which includes and creates the obligation to cure and the legal deadline for it.nothing about the fact that the deadline is established ninety days after another event changes the fact that it is the request that brings it into existence.for example,imagine two parties enter into a contract that reads upon becoming aware of a material breach,the special servicer may request that the seller,not later than ten days following the next full moon,cure such material breach.an obligation to cure within the cure period does not come into existence as a result of the lunar cycle it is triggered by the request the not later than clause simply provides a way to determine the deadline by which the seller must comply.put simply,the request identifies an object cure and a deadline ninety days following a particular identified event absent any request,there is no object and no deadline 
this interpretation is confirmed by a simple counterfactual if the special servicer had exercised its option not to request cure,would morgan stanley still have been obliged to cure or repurchase the loan the answer on the plain face of the contract must be no.the contract is conspicuously lacking any language making cure of every material breach obligatory on the seller absent a request to cure to construe the contract in that way would require reading the repurchase obligation as creating,sub silentio,an obligation to cure that arises simply from notification of breach it is simply unfathomable that the parties would silently imply,rather than lay out explicitly,such a significant obligation as one requiring cure of every material breach for which a notice of breach was transmitted.instead,the parties explicitly conditioned the repurchase obligation on the running of the cure period without actual cure,and the cure period only comes into existence through the special servicer request 
compare this framework with the provisions considered by district courts in our circuit that have concluded timely notice did not constitute a condition precedent to repurchase obligations in those cases,the obligation was triggered by either a party discovery of its own breach or its counterparty notification,the obligation could come into existence through a mechanism other than a request to cure.see lasalle bank ass citicorp real estate,civ.hb,wl,at july,tr.for certificate holders of merrill lynch mortg.passthrough certificates series love funding,civ.sas,wl,at,see also bank ass dexia real estate capital,cv,wl,at july,rev on other grounds,cv,wl cir,summary order.here,by contrast,there is no indication anywhere in the contract that morgan stanley discovery of its own breach requires it to do anything other than promptly notify,in writing,the other party.see morgan guar.tr.of bay view franchise mortg.acceptance,civ.sas,wl,at,concluding that a request to cure was necessary to begin cure period,the expiration of which required the seller to repurchase the loan.
in sum,regardless of whether the parties used any particular conditional words,the language of the repurchase obligation is clear and unmistakable that it arises only when cure does not occur within the cure period and cure within the period is an obligation that arises only out of the special servicer request.see alj capital,at,because the language and structure of the provision makes the repurchase obligation unmistakably contingent on the special servicer request to cure,that request must necessarily constitute an express condition precedent.see idt,at.
express conditions precedent are subject to the requirement of strict compliance,in contrast to promises or constructive conditions,with which only substantial compliance is required.oppenheimer,at,internal quotation marks omitted.further,no mitigating standard of materiality or substantiality is applicable to the of an express condition precedent.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,once we determine that a request to cure within three business days upon becoming aware of the material breach,is an express condition precedent to the repurchase obligation,the only remaining question on summary judgment is whether there exists any genuine issue of material fact as to the special servicer strict compliance with that co
