ronalee levy orlick appeals a district court order affirming a bankruptcy court final judgment in favor of john kozyak bankruptcy trustee or trustee for,on three counts of avoidance of payments as fraudulent transfers from financial federated title trust,finfed and american benefits services,abs,collectively,debtor,to orlick under federal and state law a a,a b b uniform fraudulent transfer act,as adopted at.stat.et ufta.based upon the following,we vacate the order of the district court and remand for jury trial with special instructions.
procedural and factual background 
the main case originated in when the bankruptcy trustee filed a complaint against orlick and eight other defendants consisting of orlick father,raphael ray levy,and seven corporations that levy,and one other individual,either owned or controlled.the trustee sought to recover approximately that had been transferred by the debtor to the defendants in an alleged ponzi scheme involving viaticated life insurance policies the trustee claims against orlick were severed from the main case for trial before the bankruptcy court.
the facts involved in orlick case are straightforward.at her father behest,orlick began work in at abs.she claims that it was agreed that she would be compensated at the rate of one percent of the gross revenues generated by abs,similar to commissions paid to brokers.it is not disputed that her responsibilities included organizing the office by computerizing functions,coordinating office networking,performing payroll,commission and banking functions,managing employees and acting as human resource director.later that year orlick held herself out to the public as a of abs.
both parties agree that orlick had a limited educational and professional background.she had graduated from high school and attended one and years of community college.she also had computer and data entry vocational training.orlick had worked as a bank teller for two years,a temporary bank secretary,a graphics art company receptionist and secretary,and a credit union administrative assistant and teller.
orlick commissions were paid directly by debtor abs through a conduit corporation,associates trust,ostensibly for tax purposes.during the approximate eighteen months that she worked at abs,orlick was compensated in the amount of.
as to orlick,the original complaint simply sought to void a transfer made to her for ten thousand dollars.in her initial answer,orlick did not request a jury trial.three months later,an amended complaint was filed.it increased the demand against orlick from ten thousand dollars,to over one million dollars,and added associates trust as the party conduit through which orlick received the money in her answer to the amended complaint,orlick demanded a jury trial.
the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to strike orlick jury demand as untimely under.after hearing argument,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion,finding that the amended complaint contained no additional claims or theories of recovery.it concluded that as no new issues were raised in the amended complaint that differed from those alleged in the original complaint,orlick was not entitled to revoke her original waiver of jury trial.
the case proceeded to a bench trial before the bankruptcy court.it found in favor of the bankruptcy trustee on the fraudulent transfer counts set forth as counts i,ii and iii.it concluded that in transfers from the debtor to orlick were voidable both under the actual fraud and constructive fraud provisions.see sections a a,a b.furthermore,the bankruptcy court held that orlick was not entitled as a matter of law to assert the affirmative defense of for value and in good faith found in section c in defending herself against the three counts.after oral argument,the district court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court in all respects.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
introduction 
orlick raises four issues on appeal.we discuss only two whether the district court improperly denied her right to jury trial in granting the trustee motion to strike jury demand and whether the district court erred in holding,as a matter of law,that orlick was not entitled to assert the affirmative defense of for value and in good faith found in section c in defending against the fraudulent transfer counts of i,ii and iii 
right to jury trial 
orlick demanded a jury trial in her answer to the trustee amended complaint.at hearing on the trustee motion to strike her jury demand,the bankruptcy court found,and the district court agreed,that the amended complaint raised no new issues upon which orlick could demand a jury.we disagree.
b provides in relevant part 
any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue,and filing the demand as required in rule d.such demand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.
in her memorandum in opposition to the trustee motion to strike jury demand,orlick contended that 
the trustee asserts,incorrectly,that the amended complaint did not add any new issues or facts as to the trustee claims against defendant orlick.in fact,defendant orlick has gone from defending a claim against her for original complaint to defending a claim against her for paragraph of the amended complaint.clearly this is a difference that warrants a reassessment as to the considerations of requesting a jury trial.this addition of a claim for over a million dollars more than the original complaint is certainly a new factual issue and alleges a new theory of recovery as to this defendant.
this issue is not one of first impression in this circuit.in lamarca turner,cir,this court held that where new plaintiffs raised new issues and claims,defendant initial waiver of a jury did not preclude him from making an effective jury demand with respect to the new issues and new claims.id.at.see burns lawther,cir borgh gentry,cir a court discretion to deny a jury trial is very narrowly limited and must,wherever possible,be exercised to preserve jury trial.quoting beacon theatres,westover,d guajardo estelle,cir even if a party has waived its right to a trial by jury,that right may be revived,at least as to newly asserted claims,upon the filing of an amended complaint which raises new issues moore united states,cir amended complaint did not revive any waived right to jury trial because it did not raise any new issues which carry a seventh amendment right to jury trial.
here the trustee original complaint simply sought to void a transfer made to orlick for,claiming that she would not be able to demonstrate the provision of services sufficient to earn that amount because the relatively nominal amount claimed in the original complaint did not warrant a jury trial,it is not surprising that a jury demand was not made.
after being lulled into waiving her right to jury trial,the trustee then presents orlick with an entirely new,more sophisticated,case.the amended complaint raises the ante one hundredfold,from to,contending now that these allegedly voidable sums passed through a conduit corporation,added as a new defendant.the case has changed.orlick must now defend herself against her alleged legal incapacity to show any entitlement to in funds,to defending herself against a claim that amounts paid to her were far greater than she would ever be entitled to receive.this is an e
