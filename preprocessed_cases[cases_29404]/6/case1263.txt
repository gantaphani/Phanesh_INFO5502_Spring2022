this original proceeding raises the question of whether the statute of limitations for a liability created by law code civ,section applies to a claim alleging a breach of fiduciary duty by the directors of a corporation.
we conclude that section governs a fiduciary duty claim where the basis of the directors liability was first authorized by a statute or the constitution.if the basis of liability existed at common law,it was not created by law within the meaning of section,even if the common law theory of liability has since been codified.
background 
the first amended complaint complaint alleges as follows.a corporation,did business in los angeles county and had its principal place of business there.was a direct marketing company that promoted a wide variety of products on television,radio,and the internet.each week,it broadcast more than television programs,commonly known as infomercials,throughout the world.customers used credit cards to pay for purchases.
stephen lehman,eric weiss,and daniel yukelson were directors of directors.the directors controlled and dominated for their own personal benefit by issuing misleading press releases announcing that had raised million when the money was in fact required to repay investments and had retained donaldson,luftkin jennerette as financial consultants.the directors also caused or allowed to engage in improper billing procedures.they did not disclose any of these acts.
the directors caused one of subsidiaries to enter into a loan and security agreement under which the subsidiary obtained a million credit facility in exchange for a promise to maintain a minimum net worth of million.the directors caused or permitted the subsidiary net worth to fall below million.as a result,the subsidiary defaulted under the agreement.
acquired a percent interest in buyitnow,a leading internet retailer featuring a large selection of brand name products and specialty items.the directors transferred more than million from buyitnow to with no invoices or management committee consent,commingled the two companies funds,failed to hold proper board meetings,f ail ed to obtain unanimous board consent on several corporate transactions including stock issuances,advertised products for buyitnow as seen on tv when could not fulfill the orders in a timely manner,caused to show a million accounts receivable from buyitnow without providing any accounting or billing information to buyitnow,and improperly billed buyitnow to manipulate ebitda earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation and amortization.these actions diminished investment in buyitnow,exposed to substantial liability,and harmed its reputation and creditworthiness.
the directors caused or permitted and its subsidiaries to inflate earnings and net worth artificially by charging customers credit cards multiple times for a single purchase and by charging customers credit cards for merchandise did not have in stock.in so doing,the directors violated the chargeback limits of the credit card company.
attempted to sell its asian subsidiaries but that effort failed when the directors allowed the subsidiaries to fall significantly off their operating budgets.
eventually,lost its ability to fill and ship orders.the directors caused or permitted to sell and transfer its computers to employees for nominal sums.
on or about march,filed for chapter protection under the bankruptcy code et.the chapter proceeding was subsequently converted to a chapter case et.
the directors concealed their wrongful acts and omissions.did not discover the acts and omissions until november.
on december,the chapter trustee,nancy zamora plaintiff,filed the action below,alleging the foregoing facts and a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors.an amended pleading was later filed.defendants lehman and weiss demurred to the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations,specifically section,which applies a limitations period to an action against corporate directors based on a liability created by law.they argued that their alleged liability was created by law,namely,corporations code section,which sets forth a director standard of care in performing his or her duties.plaintiff filed opposition,arguing for application of section of the code of civil procedure,which states that a n action for relief not hereinbefore provided for must be commenced within four years after the cause of action shall have accrued.
the trial court overruled the demurrer but requested interlocutory review of whether section applied to plaintiff claim,noting that there was a split of authority on the issue.compare smith superior court d.smith with briano rubio th,d briano see code civ,trial court may request interlocutory resolution of controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion.
lehman and weiss filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,arguing that section applied.we issued an order to show cause,established a briefing schedule,and set the matter for oral argument.having considered the written and oral arguments of the parties,we conclude that section is not applicable because petitioners have not shown that their alleged liability was first authorized by a statute or the constitution.we therefore deny the petition.
discussion 
in reviewing the ruling on a demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.blank kirwan cal d,citations omitted accord,code civ.a complaint fails to state a cause of action where the dates alleged therein establish that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations.anderson mcnally d.
interpretation of section 
the petition presents a question of statutory interpretation.we follow t he fundamental rule that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.bodell construction trustees of cal.state university th,d,citations omitted.
section states this title,which governs the time for commencing civil actions,does not affect actions against directors,shareholders,or members of a corporation,to recover a penalty or forfeiture imposed,or to enforce a liability created by law but such actions must be brought within three years after the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which the penalty or forfeiture attached,or the liability was created.italics added.our inquiry focuses on the meaning of a liability created by law and whether corporations code section requires that directors perform their duties in good rise to such liability.
two courts of appeal have previously addressed this issue,reaching different conclusions.in smith,supra,d,the court held that section applies to claims based on corporations code section.in briano,supra,th,d,the court expressly disagreed with smith,concluding that section does not apply where the basis of liability existed at common law and that corporations code section codified the common law.as we explain,smith is inconsistent with the principles announced by our supreme court,the courts of appeal,and the courts of other jurisdictions.we therefore conclude that briano properly interpreted section and follow briano.
smith and briano agreed that the term law,as used in section,refers to a statute or constitutional provision.see smith,supra,d at.briano,supra,th at,d.they disagreed as to whether the law the liability existed at common a difference.under briano,it does.see witkin,cal.procedure supp.actions.
our supreme court discussed these points in coombes getz cal,coombes,an action predicated on a state constitutional provision since repealed that made a director jointly and severally liable for acts of misappropriation committed by another director or officer.see id.at,citing cal,former art.xii.the high court stated the term created by law as used in section of the code of civil procedure has a somewhat restricted meaning.in one sense every liability giving rise to a cause of action may be said to be a creature of the law but in the sense in which the term is used in said code section,it is confined and restricted to a liability which exists by virtue of an express statute,and it does not include nor extend to actions arising under the common law it does include,however,a liability arising under the constitution.coombes,supra,cal.at,citations omitted.
coombes went on to explain t he liability for misappropriations by a was something which did not exist at common law,and was brought into existence by said section of the constitution.prior to the enactment of said section of the constitution no such liability existed.plaintiff cause of action rests entirely for its validity upon the right given creditors of a corporation by this section of the constitution.it is,therefore,an action to recover on a liability created by law.coombes,supra,cal.at,accord,hoffman wair.
under coombes,a liability created by law refers to liability that was first authorized by statute or the constitution,not the common law.see briano,supra,th at,d discussing coombes people clauson d.same de malherbe intern.of elevator constructors,same damiano bunting,section barred personal injury action against deceased stockholder because right to pursue stockholder was based on constitution and did not exist at common law.
enacted in,s ection differs from usual statutes of limitation which commence when the cause of action accrues.the history of this section is well known.it was enacted at a time when the state constitution provided for proportional liability of shareholders art.xii,repealed.it was intended to place reasonable limits upon the time within which the direct primary liability of the shareholders could be enforced suit could be brought by the creditor against the shareholder and a judgment against the corporation was not a condition of suit it was strictly construed and sometimes barred a cause of action before it accrued m ost of the cases related to the proportional liability of shareholders,and distinguished this from any common law liability of shareholders.hoover galbraith cal d,fn.and citation omitted,italics added.
in pourroy gardner,stockholders brought an action against the directors of a defunct corporation,alleging a violation of the civil code,which required that dividends be paid out of surplus profits.id.at.the stockholders contended that the corporation had always operated at a loss.id.at.the court held that the cause of action was barred by section,stating t he right of action against directors of a corporation conferred by the civil code is a statutory right pure and simple,having no foundation in contract,nor any existence at common law.pourroy gardner,supra.at,italics added.
section may have been modeled after a new york statute with virtually identical language.see coombes,supra,cal.at.as explained by that state highest court,the phrase liability created by law is not such as would have been used,and certainly is not such as is commonly if ever used,to describe a liability existing at common law,independently of any statutory provision the phrase created by or under the laws of the state occurs several times in the code,and is always used in the sense of a thing brought into existence by or under statute brinckerhoff bostwick,brinckerhoff,italics added see id.at,at discussing legislative history of new york statute gilbert ackerman,liability created by law,as used in new york statute of limitations governing actions against corporate directors,does not include liability existing at common law.similar statutes in other states have been given the same interpretation.see gores field,liability created by law refers to liability created by statute,not common law southern bell.beach,following brinckerhoff.
thus,as used in section,law means statutory or constitutional law.and created means brought into existence by or made for the first time.see webster third new internat.dict.ed,defining create.
by analogy,section,subdivision a of the code of civil procedure section a establishes a limitations period for a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.italics added.courts have held that liability created by statute means the liability is embodied in a statutory provision and was of a type which did not exist at common law.jackson medical center d.accord,city of los angeles belridge oil cal d,app.dism.churchill pac.improvement.cal,smith cremins cir,fn.applying california law see witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.
the phrase liability created by statute,as used in the statutes of limitations of other states,has been interpreted in the same way,namely,the liability did not exist at common law.see preferred risk mut.ins.vargas,mccormick city of lawrence,royal ins.roadarmel,aetna life and cas.nelson,mcauliffe states import,ohio,fn,lincoln bank and trust neustadt,shelton paris or.
a liability is created by statute if it would not exist but for the statute.shewry begil th,d,italics added accord,city of los angeles belridge oil,supra,cal d at,winick general ins.d.a liability created by statute is a liability that comes into being solely by statute and one which had no existence prior to the enactment creating it.where liability would exist in some form irrespective of the statute,it is not a liability created by statute.rondelli county of pima.any statutory modification,alteration or conditioning of a cause of action which falls short of creating a previously unavailable cause of action does not transform that cause of action into an action upon a liability created by statute.mcauliffe states import,supra,ohio at,at.and where a statute merely limits or expands the remedies available for a breach of duty existing at common law,the liability is not created by statute.see state cortelle,state farm,regional transit serv.
in this action,the directors contend that their liability exists,if at all,by virtue of corporations code section,which provides 
a a director shall perform the duties of a director,including duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the director may serve,in good faith,in a manner such director believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
b in performing the duties of a director,a director shall be entitled to rely on information,opinions,reports or statements,including financial statements and other financial data,in each case prepared or presented by any of the following 
one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.
counsel,independent accountants or other persons as to matters which the director believes to be within such person professional or expert competence.
a committee of the board upon which the director does not serve,as to matters within its designated authority,which committee the director believes to merit confidence,so long as,in any such case,the director acts in good faith,after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is indicated by the circumstances and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
