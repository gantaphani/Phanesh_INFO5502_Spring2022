victims of a massive,south ponzi scheme characterized by fraudulent loans secured by the borrowers publicly traded stock obtained a judgment of over million against derivium capital usa,its principals,and numerous other participants in the scheme.alan grayson,amg trust,and grayson consulting,three of the plaintiffs,are now pursuing others whom they claim also participated in the scheme.
with respect to the three plaintiffs claims against vision international people group,a cypriot company,the district court granted vision international motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.and with respect to grayson and amg trust claims against randolph anderson,patrick kelley,and total eclipse international for aiding and abetting common law fraud,the district court granted those defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law at trial,concluding that the cause of action was not recognized by south carolina courts.
the plaintiffs filed separate appeals on the two rulings.in the first,the three plaintiffs contend that,because the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing in which it took live testimony,it should have assessed the rule b motion under the more relaxed standard of whether the plaintiffs had made a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over vision international rather than under the more demanding standard that the district court applied,which required them to prove facts demonstrating personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.and in the second,grayson and amg trust contend that the district court erred in dismissing their claims for aiding and abetting fraud,maintaining that south carolina recognized the cause of action in connelly state.
we consolidated the two appeals by order dated august,and now affirm on both.we conclude that,because the parties engaged in full discovery on the jurisdictional issue and fully presented the relevant evidence to the district court,the court properly addressed vision international rule b motion by weighing the evidence,finding facts by a preponderance of the evidence,and determining as a matter of law whether the plaintiffs carried their burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction over vision international.we also agree with the district court conclusion that south carolina has not recognized a cause of action for aiding and abetting common law fraud and that it is not our role as a federal court to so expand state law.
under the fraud scheme referred to as the stock loan program,which began in,borrowers delivered their publicly traded stock to derivium as collateral for loans in amounts up to of the stock market value.because the loans were loans,the borrowers could,at the loan maturity date of usually three years,surrender the stock with no further obligation to pay the loan an attractive option if,at that time,the stock value had depreciated.alternatively,they could pay the loan and demand return of the stock an attractive option if,at that time,the stock value had appreciated.it was,for the borrowers,thought to be a proposition.
but the full,undisclosed details of the program,which was designed and implemented largely by charles cathcart and yuri debevc,two of derivium principals,involved derivium misuse of the stock.indeed,the principals sold the stock to fund their personal investments in venture capital opportunities,and,in the process,they realized substantial personal income from commissions on the stock sales.although they hoped for yet larger returns on their investments,all but one of the personal investments failed,and derivium was unable to return the borrowers stock at the loan maturity dates because it had maintained no capital reserves and had entered into no derivative transactions to hedge against losses.consequently,to cover the losses,the principals continued to solicit stock from new borrowers and enter into new loans for years after the principals knew that the entire scheme would eventually collapse.
derivium went into bankruptcy in,and victims of the fraud began commencing actions in against derivium,its principals,and other employees and related companies implicated in the scheme.there were more than defendants in these actions.with respect to some of the defendants,the district court consolidated the actions for discovery and trial,and,following trial,a jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of.the judgment entered on that verdict was affirmed on appeal.
the plaintiffs in the present appeals then began pursuing claims that had been stayed by the district court pending the outcome of the principal trial.one of the defendants in these resumed cases,vision international,a company engaged in distributing health and beauty products outside of the united states,filed a motion to dismiss under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction over it.to support its motion,vision international included deposition excerpts,affidavits,and other documents developed during full discovery,as well as a memorandum of law,to demonstrate that the court lacked jurisdiction.to support their response,the plaintiffs included more than exhibits,likewise consisting of deposition transcripts,affidavits,interrogatory answers,and documentary evidence,as well as a memorandum of law,to demonstrate that vision international had sufficient contacts with south carolina and the united states generally.see ann.south carolina statute.k a federal statute.the plaintiffs argued in their memorandum of law that both vision international ceo and its legal advisor had participated in the ponzi scheme in south carolina and california.the district court conducted a hearing on the motion on july,and neither side asked to present any further evidence,including any live testimony.following the hearing,the district court granted vision international motion to dismiss,concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,facts demonstrating personal jurisdiction over vision international.
during the subsequent trial against anderson,kelley,and total eclipse,the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to grayson and amg trust claims for aiding and abetting fraud,reasoning that no such cause of action existed under south carolina law.after the district court dismissed the aiding and abetting claims,the jury found in favor of those defendants on the remaining claims.
on appeal,the plaintiffs challenge the district court procedure for dismissing their claims against vision international for lack of personal jurisdiction,and the district court ruling dismissing the claims against anderson,kelley,and total eclipse for aiding and abetting common law fraud.
on the personal jurisdiction issue,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting vision international motion to dismiss because the court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve the conflicting evidence.as a consequence,they argue,the district court erred in failing to recognize that,in that circumstance,they only needed to make a prima facie showing to establish jurisdiction and thus that their evidence had to be taken in the light most favorable to them.rather than applying the prima facie standard,they argue,the district court weighed and considered the evidence and applied a more difficult standard,from the plaintiffs point of view,by imposing on them the burden of proving facts demonstrating jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.the plaintiffs maintain that only by applying the more rigorous preponderance of the evidence standard was the district court able to grant vision international rule b motion to dismiss.
vision international contends that the district court correctly held the plaintiffs to the preponderance of the evidence standard and,in applying that standard,correctly found that no evidence existed to show that vision international availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in south carolina no evidence existed to show that vision international had any contacts with south carolina or with the united states generally and,more specifically,no evidence existed to show that actions taken by two of vision international employees in furtherance of the loan scheme fell within the scope of their employment or were otherwise imputable to vision international.
addressing the plaintiffs procedural arguments first,we note that the federal rules of civil procedure do not provide specific procedures for a district court disposition of pretrial motions filed under rule b.nonetheless,the general principles governing an appropriate procedure are.
under rule b,a defendant must affirmatively raise a personal jurisdiction challenge,but the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction at every stage following such a challenge.see combs bakker,cir.and a rule b challenge raises an issue for the court to resolve,generally as a preliminary matter.id.t he jurisdictional question thus raised under rule b is one for the judge.indeed,only when a material jurisdictional fact is disputed and that fact overlaps with a fact that needs to be resolved on the merits by a jury might a court defer its legal ruling on personal jurisdiction to let the jury find the overlapping fact.adams bain,cir noting that,where the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the facts central to the merits of the dispute,deferring resolution of that factual dispute to a proceeding on the merits is the better view.
the plaintiff burden in establishing jurisdiction varies according to the posture of a case and the evidence that has been presented to the court.for example,when the court addresses the personal jurisdiction question by reviewing only the parties motion papers,affidavits attached to the motion,supporting legal memoranda,and the allegations in the complaint,a plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction to survive the jurisdictional challenge.combs,at see also mylan,akzo,cir explaining how courts may consider affidavits from any party when applying the prima facie standard.when determining whether a plaintiff has made the requisite prima facie showing,the court must take the allegations and available evidence relating to personal jurisdiction in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see combs,at mylan,at.ultimately,however,a plaintiff must establish facts supporting jurisdiction over the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence.combs,at noting that the burden is on the plaintiff ultimately to prove the existence of a ground for jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.and because defendants file rule b motions precisely because they believe that they lack any meaningful contacts with the forum state where the plaintiff has filed suit,the better course is for the district court to follow a procedure that allows it to dispose of the motion as a preliminary matter.
to be sure,we have previously stated that,if a court requires the plaintiff to establish facts supporting personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence prior to trial,it must conduct an evidentiary hearing.see,new wellington fin.flagship resort dev,cir p laintiff s must eventually prove the existence of personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence,either at trial or at a pretrial evidentiary hearing quoting prod.grp.int l goldman,d,internal quotation marks omitted.but contrary to the plaintiffs position,an evidentiary hearing does not automatically involve or require live testimony.see,boit gar tec,cir noting how,in the personal jurisdiction context,n ot all evidentiary hearings,involve evidence taken orally in open court quoting.a id.at noting that,to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard before trial,a court may take most of the evidence by affidavits,authenticated documents,answers to interrogatories or requests for admissions,and depositions see also.c providing that courts may hear motions on affidavits or wholly or partly on oral testimony or on depositions.rather,an evidentiary hearing requires only that the district court afford the parties a fair opportunity to present both the relevant jurisdictional evidence and their legal arguments.once the court has provided that opportunity,it must hold the plaintiff to its burden of proving facts,by a preponderance of the evidence,that demonstrate the court personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
as with many pretrial motions,a court has broad discretion to determine the procedure that it will follow in resolving a rule b motion.if the court deems it necessary or appropriate,or if the parties so request,it may conduct a hearing and receive,or not,live testimony.it may also consider jurisdictional evidence in the form of depositions,interrogatory answers,admissions,or other appropriate forms.but we see no reason to impose on a district court the hard and fast rule that it must automatically assemble attorneys and witnesses when doing so would ultimately serve no meaningful purpose.creating such needless inefficiency would undermine a principal purpose of the federal rules of civil procedure to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.
at bottom,a district court properly carries out its role of disposing of a pretrial motion under rule b by applying procedures that provide the parties with a fair opportunity to present to the court the relevant facts and their legal arguments before it rules on the motion.
in this case,vision international filed a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction following the completion of a full discovery process.in support of its motion,it included numerous excerpts from depositions,exhibits,affidavits,and similar evidence for consideration by the court.supporting their opposition to the motion,the plaintiffs filed over exhibits,including deposition transcripts,affidavits,interrogatory answers,and documentary evidence.both sides also filed extensive memoranda of law.after the parties completed their submissions,the district court conducted a hearing on the motion on july,and,after receiving argument,took the motion under advisement.at the hearing,no party proffered,nor did the court request,more evidence,and no party requested to present live testimony.presumably,the parties and the court were satisfied that the court had before it all the relevant evidence from which to make its decision.and,in this case,the evidence was substantial.following this procedure,the district court found facts by a preponderance of the evidence and,based on those facts,concluded as a matter of law that it lacked personal jurisdiction over vision international.
we find no deficiency in the process that was followed by the district court and conclude that the district court correctly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard,rather than the prima facie standard,in finding facts.because full discovery had been conducted and the relevant evidence on jurisdiction had been presented to the court,the court appropriately considered the evidence and found the facts by a preponderance of the evidence.and even though a hearing was not mandatory,the court also conducted one.no party ever claimed that the record was inadequately developed,that relevant evidence was missing,or that it was unable to fairly present its position.accordingly,we find no error in the procedure that the district court followed or the standard that it applied for deciding vision international rule b motion.
on the merits of vision international rule b motion,the district court found that there is no evidence that indicates that vision international ceo paul jarvis and vision international legal advisor ismini papacosta acted on vision behalf or in vision interest when they participated in the stock loan program.moreover,it found that vision international did not direct any of its activities to south carolina,did not maintain any office or agent in south carolina,did not own any property in south carolina,and did not conduct any business with or communicate with anyone in south carolina.at bottom,the court found that there was no evidence demonstrating that vision international purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting busines
