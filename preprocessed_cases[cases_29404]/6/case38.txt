husband and wife timothy wilson and carrie wilson collectively,the wilsons appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint alleging certain improprieties with respect to hsbc mortgage services,hsbc acquisition of the mortgage on their home by way of an assignment from mortgage electronic registration system,mers.the wilsons claim the assignment is void because it was executed not by mers,but by an hsbc employee who falsely purported to sign on mers behalf.according to the wilsons,hsbc never acquired the mortgage to their property and has no right to initiate foreclosure proceedings.
a homeowner in massachusetts who is neither a party to nor a third party beneficiary of a mortgage assignment has standing to challenge the assignment on the grounds that it is void.although the wilsons complaint sets forth some rather troubling accusations about hsbc business practices and foreclosure procedures,the wilsons have not set forth a colorable claim that the mortgage assignment in question is void.because we agree they lack standing to raise certain claims,and because they have failed to state a claim for promissory estoppel with respect to a loan modification,their request for injunctive relief must also fail.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
the facts are straightforward.we recite them as alleged in the wilsons amended verified complaint complaint,supplementing as necessary with information found in the mortgage itself,public records,documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,and other matters susceptible to judicial notice giragosian ryan,cir.
on june,the wilsons granted a mortgage on their property in northborough,massachusetts to ameriquest mortgage company ameriquest in order to secure a promissory note.the mortgage was recorded on july,and on that same day ameriquest assigned its interest in the mortgage to mers the assignment the assignment was recorded on february.
hsbc entered the picture on march,the date on which mers purported to execute a document assigning the wilsons mortgage to hsbc the assignment.the assignment was recorded in the worcester county registry of deeds on april.according to the complaint,the assignment was executed by shelene strauss,as vice president of mers.
the wilsons attached a copy of the assignment to their complaint.the document is entitled corporate assignment of mortgage and identifies mers as the assignor and hsbc as the assignee.it goes on to identify the original mortgage granted by the wilsons for their property in northborough.the assignment text states,in pertinent part,assignor mers hereby assigns unto the assignee hsbc,the said mortgage together with the note or other evidence of indebtedness with respect to the wilsons property.the signature block towards the bottom of the document reads as follows

shelene strauss,vice president 
the face of the assignment further shows it was notarized on march,the same date upon which it was signed.
in spite of the assignment text,and notwithstanding their prior allegation that strauss executed it on behalf of mers,the wilsons allege strauss prepared the assignment on behalf of the assignee,hsbc and not the assignor,mers.the complaint further alleges that strauss has notarized other mortgage assignments from mers to hsbc on at least two occasions,and that she prepared and signed a satisfaction of mortgage on behalf of beneficial financial,the complaint goes on to allege that strauss has documents assigning mortgages,including the wilsons mortgage,to hsbc from various lenders.the wilsons do not define the term in their complaint.
following the assignment,hsbc,relying on the assignment,began foreclosure proceedings by sending certain notices to the wilsons and making various filings in the massachusetts land court.throughout these proceedings,hsbc claimed that it held the mortgage on the wilsons property.the wilsons,however,assert that hsbc did not,in fact,hold their mortgage because the assignment was and therefore fraudulent.
the wilsons go on to introduce allegations of irregularities regarding hsbc foreclosure processes.in november,hsbc reported to the securities and exchange commission that it had halted its foreclosures because of certain deficiencies in the processing,preparation and signing of affidavits and other documents supporting foreclosures including the evaluation and monitoring of law firms retained to effect its foreclosures.in april,hsbc parent company entered into a consent order with the united states department of the treasury comptroller of currency the consent order stating,in part,that it had identified certain deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in residential mortgage servicing and in the bank initiation and handling of foreclosure proceedings.according to the complaint,the consent order required hsbc parent company to hire an independent consultant to review certain residential foreclosure actions and to determine whether loss mitigation activities with respect to foreclosed loans were handled in accordance with the requirements of the hamp,and consistent with the policies and procedures applicable to the bank proprietary loan modifications or other loss mitigation programs.
then,on november,mers again purportedly assigned the wilsons mortgage to hsbc the assignment.this assignment was recorded on november.the wilsons allege that hsbc was no longer a member of mers at this point in time,having ceased its membership sometime in.the wilsons further allege that,as of the time they filed their complaint,their mortgage was in inactive status with mers.they have not alleged that hsbc or mers has taken any further actions towards foreclosing on their property.
indeed,it appears there was no further action at all with respect to the wilsons mortgage until the wilsons submitted a hardship letter and income information to hsbc on march,in connection with a request for a loan modification.hsbc requested further information from the wilsons the following day.according to the wilsons,hsbc then suggested to the wilsons that they would be required to pay of the arrearage on their mortgage,approximately,as a condition of any loan modification.this offer does not comply with hamp requirements,the wilsons claim,because hamp does not require a down payment for a loan modification and the wilsons never received written notice that their request had been denied.
wasting no time after making their request for a loan modification,the wilsons filed their original complaint in the massachusetts land court on march.hsbc promptly removed the matter to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,and the wilsons filed their amended verified complaint on april.in addition to the facts recounted above,the wilsons complaint contains the following allegations hsbc was not the present holder of their mortgage when it served them with a notice of right to cure in and notice of intent to foreclose in,hsbc fraudulently represented it was acting on behalf of mers when in fact it was acting on behalf of hsbc and assigning the mortgage to itself with respect to the assignment,hsbc breached its contract with the wilsons by attempting to foreclose on their property when it did not hold the mortgage,hsbc violated its obligation of good faith and fair dealing with respect to its foreclosure attempts,hsbc made a promise,upon which the wilsons relied,that all documents to be recorded with respect to their mortgage would be reliable and free from fraud,hsbc wrongfully attempted to foreclose on their property,hsbc should be promissorily estopped from offering the wilsons a loan modification whose terms varied from hamp requirements,and the wilsons are entitled to injunctive relief.the complaint seeks both an award of damages and a permanent and preliminary injunction to issue against hsbc enjoining hsbc from conducting a foreclosure sale.
hsbc fired back with a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case on september.key to the district court decision was its conclusion that the wilsons did not have standing to challenge the assignment because they were not a party to that assignment and were not beneficiaries thereof the next day the wilsons filed a motion for relief from judgment,which the district court denied on february.this timely appeal followed.

standing counts i vi 
the district court dismissed the first six counts of the wilsons complaint for want of standing.specifically,the court found that under massachusetts law parties can not challenge mortgage assignments to which they were neither a party nor a beneficiary.our first task,therefore,is to determine if the wilsons have standing.mcinnis misenor,at standing is a threshold question in every case.we,as did the district court,consider these first six counts together because each one relies on the wilsons contention that hsbc never acquired the mortgage on their home from mers because the question of whether certain facts establish standing is a question of law,we review the district court resolution of the issue de novo.culhane aurora loan servs.of,cir 
standing a litigant right to be in the courtroom must be established in every case,as the constitution permits the federal courts to address only actual cases and controversies.id.citing const.art.iii,cl.a party does not establish standing simply because the other side agrees to submit a controversy to a federal court.see sosna iowa.instead,a plaintiff must show that he or she has a personal stake in the litigation outcome by establish ing each part of a familiar triad injury,causation,and redressability.culhane,at see also mcinnis misenor,f d at observing a litigant bears the burden of establishing standing.the third aspect of the test,redressability,is the most important one for our purposes today.to satisfy this prong,a plaintiff must adequately allege that a favorable result in the litigation is likely to redress the asserted injury.pagn caldern,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife.further,separate and apart from these constitutional concerns,a plaintiff must also generally show that his claim is premised on his own legal rights as opposed to those of a third party,that his claim is not merely a generalized grievance,and that it falls within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.id.citing ramrez ramos,cir.
here,we must determine whether the wilsons have standing to assert their particular claims with respect to the assignment.far from being done in a vacuum,our analysis is guided by culhane.in that case,we analyzed massachusetts mortgage law and concluded that a mortgagor has standing to challenge the assignment of a mortgage on her home to the extent that such a challenge is necessary to contest a foreclosing entity status qua mortgagee.culhane,at.although this language may appear to grant standing to a broad group of individuals,we immediately dispelled any such notion by explaining how this holding,narrow to begin with,is further circumscribed.id.pursuant to culhane,under massachusetts law a mortgagor has standing only to challenge a mortgage assignment as invalid,ineffective or void if,say,the assignor had nothing to assign or had no authority to make an assignment to a particular assignee.see also woods,at s tanding exists for challenges that contend that the assigning party never possessed legal title and,as a result,no valid transferable interest ever exchanged hands.by contrast,a massachusetts mortgagor does not have standing to challenge shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective to pass legal title.culhane,at.
the underlying reasoning behind this distinction is straightforward.a homeowner in massachusetts even when not a party to or third party beneficiary of a mortgage assignment has standing to challenge that assignment as void because success on the merits would prove the purported assignee is not,in fact,the mortgagee and therefore lacks any right to foreclose on the mortgage.see also bank ass ibanez,any effort to foreclose by a party lacking jurisdiction and authority to carry out a foreclosure under these massachusetts statutes is void.quoting chace morse.that same homeowner,though,lacks standing to claim the assignment is voidable because the assignee still would have received legal title the homeowner.thus,even successfully proving that the assignment was voidable would not affect the rights as between those two parties or provide the homeowner with a defense to the foreclosure action.
here,the district court which did not have the benefit of culhane or woods erroneously concluded that,as a matter of law,parties can not challenge mortgage assignments to which they were neither a party nor a beneficiary.in the wake of culhane and woods,however,a trial court confronted with the standing issue in this type of case must conduct an inquiry to determine whether a plaintiff allegations are that a mortgage assignment was void,or merely voidable.we now turn to this task.
void voidable assignments 
before delving into the meat of the wilsons allegations,a word on the distinction between void and voidable.void contracts or agreements are those that are of no effect whatsoever such as are a mere nullity,and incapable of confirmation or ratification.allis billings.by contrast,voidable refers to a contract or agreement that is injurious to the rights of one party,which he may avoid at his election.ball gilbert.thus,while the party injured by a voidable contract has the option of avoiding its obligations,it may choose instead to ratify the agreement and hold the other party to it.see cabot avx.
the massachusetts courts have provided examples of voidable assignments in other contexts.cabot teaches that a contract entered into under duress,whether economic in nature or otherwise,is voidable by the victim.id.discussing elements of economic duress with respect to a commercial supply contract.agreements induced by fraudulent misrepresentations are voidable as well.see shaw supermarkets,delgiacco,noting employer would have been entitled to rescind employment contract that had been induced by the applicant false representations.where the parties have made a mutual mistake with regard to an essential element of an agreement,that agreement is voidable by the adversely affected party.see lafleur pierce,addressing an attempt to set aside a workers compensation agreement.further,when a corporate officer acts beyond the scope of his authority,h is acts in excess of his authority,although voidable by the corporation,legally could be ratified and adopted by it.commissioner of banks tremont trust,finding an ultra vires purchase of stock by the corporation president was voidable,but that the corporation ratified the action by accepting the dividends see also glovin.eagle clothing,holding a corporation may ratify and become bound by obligations incurred on its behalf by its president where the president acted outside the scope of his authority.
a void contract,on the other hand,is one that is of no effect whatsoever and whose terms a court will not enforce.see,ball,at refusing to enforce a contract where the parties placed a wager on the outcome of an election.specific to the mortgage context,a void mortgage assignment is one in which the putative assignor never properly held the mortgage and,thus,had no interest to assign.culhane,at.we have also found that a party who challenges a mortgage assignment on the grounds that the assignor was but a nominee for the mortgage holder and never possessed a legally transferable interest in the mortgage alleges a void,as opposed to merely voidable,assignment.woods,at applying massachusetts law.
the common thread running through culhane and woods is the allegation that the foreclosing entity had no right to foreclose,as it had never become the mortgage holder in the first place.in other words,the homeowners sought to establish that the mortgage transfer from the assignor to the assignee who in turn attempted to foreclose was void at the outset.through this allegation,the plaintiffs in those cases established standing because they challenged the foreclosing entity status as mortgagee of their property.similarly,we must determine whether the wilsons have set forth a claim that the assignment was void and,therefore,that hsbc is not their mortgagee.
have the wilsons alleged a void or voidable mortgage assignment 
as we are concerned with standing in this case,we do not take the wilsons conclusory characterization of their allegations as being about a void assignment as gospel.instead,we review the materials before us,including the text of the assignment,in light of massachusetts law to determine whether the wilsons complaint sets forth allegations that the assignment is void,or merely voidable.
the parties,having taken standing for granted with respect to the assignment,have not presented any extensive argument with respect to that issue.they have,however,provided their views on the assignment validity under massachusetts law as part of their treatment of the district court resolution of the motion to dismiss.while presented for a different purpose,these arguments nevertheless highlight issues important to the standing analysis.
the wilsons insist their complaint alleges that the assignment is void.the basis for this assertion is their claim that hsbc assigned their mortgage to itself because strauss executed it on behalf of hsbc,not mers.they urge us to find this is so from the face of the assignment itself.hsbc disagrees entirely,arguing that the assignment not only effectively transferred the mortgage interest from mers to hsbc but,moreover,is unassailable under massachusetts law.having considered the arguments of counsel and in light of the materials before us,we conclude that the wilsons complaint does not allege that the assignment is void.we explain.
the reasoning behind the wilsons argument that the assignment is void runs as follows strauss is an employee of hsbc strauss executed the assignment when strauss executed the assignment,she did so as an employee of hsbc therefore,mers never assigned the mortgage to hsbc.the wilsons own complaint,however,flatly contradicts this position,as it explicitly alleges that t he march,assignment from mers to hsbc was executed by shelene strauss,as vice president of mers.thus,the complaint actually alleges that strauss wore multiple hats,serving both as an employee of hsbc and an officer of mers.significantly,the complaint does not allege that such dual agency violates the common law or any statute or applicable regulation accordingly,the facts set forth in the complaint actually describe a valid assignment from mers to hsbc.
while this defective pleading is likely enough on its own to doom the wilsons first six counts,it is not the only thing we have to go on.we also have available for consideration the text of the assignment.according to the wilsons,there is no indication that straus s executed the assignment with purported authority from mers.this statement is simply incorrect the assignment clearly identifies mers as the assignor and hsbc as the assignee.
the assignment signature block,reproduced supra,brooks no argument as to the identity and roles of the parties thereto.mers is listed as the assignor and hsbc the assignee.to make matters even more clear,shelene strauss signature and position of vice president appear in the signature block.notably,her signature is found underneath printed text stating the assignment was being made by mers.in sum,the four corners of the document show in no uncertain terms that strauss executed it in her capacity as a vice president of mers.the wilsons claim that this instrument was executed on behalf of hsbc is wholly without merit.
nevertheless,the wilsons press on,arguing that an affidavit from hsbc vice president jeffrey davis establishes strauss executed the assignment on behalf of hsbc,not mers the affidavit does no such thing.davis affidavit,which hsbc originally filed in the massachusetts land court,states only that strauss has been an hsbc employee since january,and that she served as a vice president of hsbc on march.the affidavit is silent as to the circumstances surrounding the assignment execution.contrary to what the wilsons set forth in their brief,the affidavit is entirely consistent with and does nothing to disprove the complaint allegations that strauss was a dual agent of both hsbc and mers.
indeed,the most that can be gleaned from the affidavit and complaint is that strauss was an employee or agent of both hsbc and mers on march.the wilsons themselves admit this sort of arrangement is utilized many times in assigning mortgages.the wilsons do not argue there is anything illegal or untoward about strauss acting in such a dual capacity.
this is just as well.in culhane we determined the applicable massachusetts statute.laws ch,neither places restrictions on who may be elected as an officer of the assignor nor imposes special requirements say,regular employment on who may serve as a vice president of an assignor corporation.at.significantly,we concluded that a remarkably similar mortgage assignment was valid under massachusetts law,even though the individual executing the assignment was appointed a vice president of mers purely as a matter of administrative convenience.id.
there is no evidence in the record here as to the nature or length of strauss association with mers.yet,even had she been appointed as a vice president solely for purposes of this assignment,this would make no difference.we said in culhane that while this type of practice can be disparaged on policy grounds,such policy judgments are for the legislature,not the courts.id.thus,the wilsons allegation that strauss was also a vice president of hsbc at the time of this assignment does nothing to call into question the legality or validity of her executing it on mers behalf.
moreover,massachusetts statutory law has something to say about this mortgage assignment.laws ch,section pushes the wilsons position,already moribund in light of our holdings in culhane and woods,over the brink.section provides,in relevant part,that 
an assignment of a mortgage if executed before a notary public by a person purporting to hold the position of vice president of the entity holding such mortgage shall be binding upon such entity.
recognizing the danger section poses to their position,the wilsons attempt to get out from under its shadow by urging us to find it inapplicable to the assignment.the wilsons begin their struggle by reiterating their contention that the assignment was void at the outset because it was no more than hsbc attempt to assign the mortgage to itself.they then argue simply that section does not make an otherwise invalid assignment valid and,therefore,has no effect on the assignment.in rebuttal,hsbc turns the wilsons argument on its head and takes the position that se
