espresso roma corporation,pacific espresso corporation,and david boyd dba hillside residence hall appellants appeal from a judgment dismissing their complaint alleging several causes of action against bank of america,bank,based upon its payment of forged checks drawn on appellants accounts by one of their former employees.the court entered judgment in favor of the bank after it granted the bank motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellants were precluded by california uniform commercial code section,subdivisions d and e from asserting any claims against the bank for unauthorized payment of checks drawn on their accounts.we shall affirm the judgment.
david boyd is the president of espresso roma and pacific espresso corporations and also runs hillside residence hall.all three businesses had checking accounts with the bank.
from late through april,appellants employed joseph montanez,who eventually assumed certain bookkeeping responsibilities,learned how to generate company checks on the computer,and had access to blank checks.starting in october,montanez downloaded company computer programs,stole blank checks,and printed company checks on his home computer which he used to pay his personal bills,and for personal purchases.he concealed his actions by removing the forged checks from the bank statements when he sorted the mail.
boyd did not discover the forgeries,or report them to the bank until may.after montanez left the company,a check was returned by a stereo company,bearing a signature that boyd did not recognize.boyd then reviewed the records and discovered that,from october through april,montanez had forged company checks in an amount totaling more than.
the bank motion for summary judgment was based upon section,which limits a payor bank liability to its customer for making payment upon checks with alterations or unauthorized signatures.
pursuant to subdivision f of section,the bank asserted that appellants were absolutely precluded from asserting forgeries processed more than one year before the forgery was reported.by its terms subdivision f applies,w ithout regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank,italics added and precludes a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer discover and report the customer unauthorized signature from asserting it against the bank.the bank also relied upon the conditional preclusion established by subdivisions d and e of section.subdivision c of section imposes a duty upon the customer promptly to review monthly statements or checks made available to the customer by the bank,to exercise reasonable care in discovering any unauthorized signature or alteration,and promptly to notify the bank of the discovery of such items.pursuant to subdivision d,if the customer fails to comply with these duties,when the same person has forged checks on the account,the customer is precluded from making a claim against the bank for the unauthorized payment unless the customer notified the bank no more than days after the first forged item was included in the monthly statement or canceled checks,and should have been discovered,subd.d.this preclusion is conditional because the customer may avoid its application by establishing that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure contributed to the loss,subd.e roy supply,wells fargo bank th,d.
in its order granting summary judgment,the court held that appellants were precluded by sections d and e from asserting claims against the b ank for unauthorized payments of checks drawn on appellants checking accounts.the court specifically ruled that appellants failed to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the b ank system of processing checks for appellants accounts violated the b ank procedures or varied unreasonably from general banking usage in the area.the court also ruled that the declaration of appellant expert failed to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the b ank failed to exercise ordinary care,and that the bank had no duty to sight review the checks 
appellants argue that the burden never shifted to them to create a triable issue of fact because the bank failed to meet its burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of fact,that despite the availability of monthly statements and canceled checks,appellants failed to discover and notify the bank of the forgery within days,and it exercised ordinary care in paying the item.see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,code civ,subd.o.appellants further contend that,even if the burden did shift to them,the declaration of their own expert created a triable issue of fact on the issue whether the bank exercised ordinary care,precluding summary judgment in the bank favor.
appellants failure to discover and report the forgeries 
pursuant to section,subdivision d,the customer is precluded from making a claim against the bank for unauthorized payment unless the customer notified the bank no more than days after the first forged item was included in the monthly statement or canceled checks and should have been discovered,subd.d see also official comments on com.code,west ann.cal,ed.com.
according to the complaint,the forged checks were presented for payment between october and may,but appellants did not discover or report them until on or about may.to establish its prima facie case that the conditional issue preclusion created by section,subdivision d applied,the bank presented the deposition testimony of boyd,that it made monthly account statements and canceled checks available to appellants shortly after the closing period of each statement.boyd testified that he received statements on a monthly basis,and they included canceled checks.when boyd began to suspect unauthorized checks were being written and reviewed the statements and checks in may,he was able to identify,and reported,the forgery.this evidence supports the inference that the first monthly statement that would have reflected the forgery by montanez would have been in november see mac bank of america th,d where forged checks cleared account between march and may,it was inferable that statements from april through june reflected those checks.yet,despite having the means to discover the forgeries,more than a year and a half elapsed before appellants discovered and reported any of them,far beyond the days specified in section,subdivision d.
appellants argue,as they did below,that boyd testimony did not support the bank assertion that it made monthly checks or statements available because boyd also testified that there were some instances in which the statements or checks did not arrive through the mail in a timely fashion.boyd,however,acknowledged that when this occurred he was able to pick up the statement or a duplicate at the branch.nothing in boyd testimony contradicts the bank assertion that it made monthly statements available to appellants in accordance with section,subdivision a.nor is there any merit to appellants assertion that the bank was required to submit the statements and canceled checks themselves,or a declaration of a bank officer that it made them available,instead of relying upon boyd admission,which was competent and admissible evidence code civ,subd.c.
appellants also suggest that the bank was required to establish,with respect to each forged check,exactly when it made the monthly statement including the forged check available,thereby providing the means by which appellants should have discovered the forgery,and triggering the notification period.to the contrary,where as here,the forgeries are all committed by the same person,it is the failure to report the first forged item within days that precludes the customer from asserting the subsequent forgeries,subd.d.regardless of the exact date the first monthly statement after october was made available to appellant,the evidence the bank submitted established that it made statements and checks available on a monthly basis,yet the first forgery was not reported until,long after the period expired.
