background 
equifax is one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the united states.it assembles and disperses credit reports to third parties in exchange for compensation.equifax also is one of the largest national repositories of financial data.
in,leroy and gladys nunnally each requested a credit report from equifax.the credit reports that the nunnallys received incorrectly listed each as having a first usa bank account and a jc account.the nunnallys informed equifax of these errors and requested a reinvestigation,but equifax did not report the results of the reinvestigation to the nunnallys.
the nunnallys again requested credit reports in,and the nunnallys discovered that those reports contained the same errors as the reports.the nunnallys again requested that equifax perform a reinvestigation.equifax sent leroy nunnally a letter that stated that the jc account had been removed from his file and that the first usa bank account was not currently reporting.a week later,equifax sent gladys nunnally a letter that stated that both the jc and the first usa bank accounts had been removed from her file.the nunnallys then paid for copies of their complete files to ensure that the corrections had been made.neither copy of their consumer files contained inaccurate information.
rhodes also discovered inaccuracies in her equifax credit report in.rhodes report incorrectly stated that she owed balances to cbs collection division and homecomings financial network and had accounts with merchants farmers and discover financial services.she reported these errors to equifax and informed equifax that her surname had changed from cook to rhodes,following her divorce.
equifax sent rhodes a letter that stated that the cbs collection division account had been deleted,her name had been updated,the home financial network account was reported as closed,and the merchants farmers account was paid.equifax did not provide a report about the alleged account with discover financial services.rhodes then paid for a copy of her complete file to check for inaccuracies.the file still listed the discover financial services account and misspelled rhodes name as phodes.
on october,the nunnallys and rhodes filed this action and complained that equifax had failed to comply with the fair credit reporting act when it did not send them each a complete copy of their consumer reports following the reinvestigations.a.the nunnallys and rhodes sought certification of a plaintiff class of all those who had requested a reinvestigation but had not received a free and complete copy of their consumer report from equifax following the reinvestigation.equifax moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.equifax argued that the letters it sent to the nunnallys and rhodes satisfied the requirements of section a b ii,which required equifax to provide the nunnallys and rhodes with a consumer report.
the district court denied the motion of equifax.the district court determined that the letters equifax sent to the nunnallys and rhodes were excluded from the definition of consumer report because those letters were communications relating solely to transactions between the nunnallys and rhodes and equifax.nunnally,d at.the district court examined the purpose and structure of section a and concluded that,because the act requires that a consumer report must be provided to the consumer as part of or in addition to the notice of the results of a reinvestigation,the consumer report is something over and above the mere results of the reinvestigation.id.at.the district court concluded that the something over and above the mere results is the consumer complete file.id.the district court also stated that it lacked certitude in its conclusion and certified this issue for interlocutory appeal.id.

iii.discussion 
the fair credit reporting act requires a consumer reporting agency to provide a free reinvestigation of a consumer file if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer file is disputed by the consumer.a a.after a reinvestigation,the consumer reporting agency shall provide written notice to a consumer of the results of a reinvestigation.id.a a.as part of,or in addition to,the notice,a consumer reporting agency shall provide a consumer report that is based upon the consumer file as that file is revised as a result of the reinvestigation id.a b.
we must decide whether the consumer report that a credit reporting agency provides to a consumer following a reinvestigation is the consumer complete file or a description of revisions to that file,and we must decide whether equifax satisfied its obligation to the nunnallys and rhodes.equifax argues that neither section nor any other section of the act requires disclosure of the consumer complete file.the nunnallys and rhodes respond that both the text and the purpose of the act support disclosure of the consumer complete file.equifax argues that it satisfied its obligations to the nunnallys and rhodes,but they respond that equifax was obligated to provide them more information.
we divide our discussion of this appeal into two parts.first,we address whether the act requires disclosure of a consumer complete file following a reinvestigation.second,we discuss whether equifax satisfied its obligation to the nunnallys and rhodes based on a correct understanding of the act.
a.the act does not require disclosure of the consumer complete file after reinvestigation.
equifax argues that the district court erred in its interpretation of the term consumer report on two grounds.first,equifax argues that the language of section and the definitions in section establish that a credit reporting agency need not provide a consumer his complete file following a reinvestigation.second,equifax argues that other provisions of the act require a credit reporting agency to provide a consumer his complete file in different circumstances,and the contrast of those provisions supports an interpretation that section does not require disclosure of the consumer complete file.the nunnallys and rhodes respond that the purpose of the act requires that credit reporting agencies provide more information to consumers following a reinvestigation than equifa
