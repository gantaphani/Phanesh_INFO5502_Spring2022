introduction 
this case presents a novel issue under california uniform commercial code section,subdivisions b i and d plaintiffs lost more than million in an investment fraud scheme.the perpetrator led plaintiffs to believe that brokerage accounts in their names would be opened with carlin equities corporation,an existing,and induced plaintiffs to make checks payable to carlin,carlin,and carlin corporation.the culprit opened his own bank account at defendant and respondent wells fargo bank,wells fargo under the fictitious business name carlin he deposited plaintiffs checks into that account and then appropriated the monies.
section,subdivisions b i and d provide,in effect,that the drawer of a check may recover from a depositary bank on a comparative negligence basis if,inter alia,the depositary bank failed to use ordinary care in permitting a customer to deposit a check when the person who signed the check as,or on behalf of,the drawer the signer did not intend the person identified as payee on the check to have an interest in the check,subds.b i,d.plaintiffs asserted a claim pursuant to these provisions against wells fargo,alleging that wells fargo failed to exercise ordinary care when it allowed the perpetrator of the fraud to deposit plaintiffs checks in his wells fargo account.a jury returned a verdict against plaintiffs and in favor of wells fargo.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the trial court erred by giving the jury instructions that,in effect,conflated the concepts of an intended payee,as determined under section,with the person identified as payee or the named payee referred to in section,subdivision b i.we agree that the jury instructions were erroneous,but conclude that plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the error.by its terms,section,subdivision b i applies only when the signer does not intend the named payee to have an interest in the check.but the signer can have no such intent when the signer believes that the named payee and the intended payee are the same person or entity.the evidence at trial was undisputed that plaintiffs issued checks payable to carlin,carlin and carlin corporation plaintiffs intended those designations to refer to carlin equities corporation and carlin equities corporation was the intended payee of the checks.because subdivision b i does not apply,plaintiffs claim under section,subdivision d fails as a matter of law.we therefore affirm the judgment.

discussion 
relevant legal principles 
articles and of the code govern,respectively,negotiable instruments and bank deposits and collections.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.negotiable instruments.as relevant here,a check is a draft that is payable on demand and drawn on a bank,subd.f.the drawer of a check is the person who is ordering payment here,plaintiffs,subd.a.the drawee or payor bank is the bank on which the check is is,the bank ordered by the check to make payment,subd.a,subd.
usually,a check will be payable to the order of an identified person.that person is generally referred to as the payee,subd.b see schweitzer bank of america d,see generally witkin,supra,negotiable instruments.the identity of the payee is not determined by the name written on the check.rather,the payee is determined by the intent of the person who signs the check as,or on behalf of,the is,the signer,subd.a.this rule is of particular importance when it is unclear from the face of the check to whom the check is payable.for example,if a check is made payable to john smith and two or more people share that name,the intent of the signer will determine which john smith is the payee.com,pt.west ann.foll.similarly,if the signer intended that john smith would be the payee but misidentified john smith as john jones on the check,the payee is nevertheless john smith,not some other person named john jones.ibid.the intent of the signer controls even if the check is forged.for example,if an unauthorized employee forges the signature of his or her employer on a check drawn on the employer account,the intent of the determines the identity of the payee.see generally witkin,supra,negotiable instruments,hawkland and lawrence,uniform commercial code series rev,to.for purposes of clarity,we use the term intended payee to denote the person to whom the signer intended the check to be payable.we use the term named payee to denote the person identified on the check as the payee.
the intended payee may negotiate a check by indorsing it and depositing it in his or her bank account.see mills bank th,d,fn.mills.the bank to which the intended payee negotiates the is,the first bank to take the the depositary bank,subd.c,subd.depositary bank means the first bank to take an item even though it is also the payor bank,unless the item is presented for immediate payment over the counter see generally hagedorn and bailey,brady on bank checks the law of bank checks.brady.some provisions of the code use the term collecting bank.that term includes a depositary bank,if the depositary bank is not also the payor bank,subd.collecting bank means a bank handling an item for collection except the payor bank.in this case,wells fargo was both the depositary bank and a collecting bank.usually,the depositary bank will submit the check for collection through the check clearing system,ultimately receiving payment from the payor bank.see mills,supra,th at,fn,d brady,supra.
some provisions of articles and serve to allocate losses due to the payment of unauthorized or fraudulent checks.in general,those provisions place the burden of loss on the party best able to prevent or to insure against the loss.see hawkland and lawrence,supra,rev,white and summers,uniform commercial code ed.one such provision is section.that section allocates to the drawer losses in certain circumstances in which it is presumed the drawer failed to exercise due care to avoid the loss.see,com,supra,foll,hawkland and lawrence,supra,rev.
relevant here is section,subdivision b i this subdivision,enacted in its present form as part of the revisions to article of the code stats,ch,essentially restates former section,subdivision b,which in turn was derived from section of the negotiable instruments law,codified in california as former civil code section,subdivision see,com,supra,foll.in effect,subdivision b i shields a bank from liability for negotiating an unauthorized or fraudulent check by deeming an indorsement to be effective if the signer of the check did not intend that the named payee would have an interest in the is,the named payee was not the intended payee and the check was either indorsed in a name substantially similar to that of the named payee,or deposited to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the named payee,subds.b i,c.in applying section b,the key issue is whether the person signing as or on behalf of the drawer intended that the named payee have no interest in the check t he section applies where the drawer issues an instrument intending that the named payee have no interest in the instrument.because the drawer knows that there will not be a proper indorsement,it is unfair to shift the loss to a subsequent purchaser or payer whose fault is minimal.hawkland and lawrence,supra,rev,to,fns.omitted.
by way of example,in a typical case in which section,subdivision b i would apply,an employee of a company makes out a check on the employer account to a supplier of the employer.the employee intends when he signs the check that it will never be paid to the supplier.instead,the employee intends to forge an indorsement in the supplier name and deposit the check to his or her own account,or to another account controlled by the employee or a confederate.in such a case,the person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable,subd.b i never intended the supplier to have an interest in the check.see,com,supra,foll.
as this example illustrates,the typical case under section,subdivision b i involves a situation in which the signer issues the check with fraudulent or other wrongful intent.however,fraudulent intent of the signer is not necessarily required.courts in at least two other jurisdictions have applied their corresponding uniform commercial code provisions in circumstances not involving signer fraud.see getty petroleum american express travel related servs,former section,subd.b allocated to drawer loss in forged indorsement case when oil company issued checks to gas stations never intending for checks to be negotiated american nat.bank in louis seidel,seidel under former section,subd.b,when lending bank made check payable jointly to borrower and borrower wife,lending bank did not intend wife to have an interest see generally,anderson,uniform commercial code ed,culpable mental state not required under former section hawkland and lawrence,supra,rev,fn.describing as questionabl e the missouri court holding in seidel.
in the usual case,section is asserted by a bank as a defense against a drawer claim of improper payment,rather in this the drawer as an affirmative basis for relief against the bank.see,title ins.comerica th,d.this is because a drawer typically will seek compensation for payment of an unauthorized or fraudulent check from his or her own is,the payor the theory that the check was not properly payable,subd.a bank may charge only items that are properly payable see,com,supra,foll,normally,the loss in forged check cases is on the drawee bank that paid the check,com,supra,foll,drawer has an adequate remedy against the payor bank for recredit of the drawer account white and summers,supra.the payor bank may then seek compensation from the depositary bank or other collecting bank on the theory that the depositary bank breached its warranties as the transferor or presentor of the check,see witkin,supra,negotiable instruments,white and summers,supra.the payor and collecting banks may defend against such recredit and warranty claims by asserting that the unauthorized or fraudulent indorsement should be deemed effective pursuant to section.
although the general rule is that the drawer bears the loss in cases governed by section,subdivision b,that rule is modified by section,subdivision d that subdivision applies principles of comparative negligence to permit the drawer to recover from,inter alia,a depositary bank that failed to exercise ordinary care in taking for collection a check subject to subdivision b i.as the uniform commercial code comments explain,in some cases the person taking the check might have detected the fraud and thus have prevented the loss by the exercise of ordinary care.in those cases,if that person failed to exercise ordinary care,it is reasonable that the person bear loss to the extent the failure contributed to the loss t he most likely defendant is the depositary bank that took the check and failed to exercise ordinary care,com,supra,foll.accordingly,if plaintiffs could demonstrate that section,subdivision b i applied to the checks at issue in this case,section,subdivision d would provide the basis for a statutory negligence claim by plaintiffs against wells fargo.
b.the trial court erred in instructing the jury 
we review de novo whether the jury instructions correctly stated the law.cristler express messenger systems,th,d.statutory interpretation also is a question of law that we review de novo.van horn watson cal th,fn,d,the fifth day,llc bolotin th,d.
plaintiffs argue,in essence,that the jury instructions erroneously confused the concepts of the intended payee as determined under section,subdivision a,and a named is,the person identified as payee in section,subdivision b i.we agree.
as relevant here,the trial court instructed the jury,plaintiffs have asserted a claim for statutory negligence against wells fargo.in order to prevail on their claims for statutory negligence,the plaintiffs have the burden of proving b.the plaintiffs intended that the payee of the checks have no interest in the funds represented by the checks.italics added.the trial court further instructed,in determining whether the plaintiffs intended that the payees of the checks have no interest in the checks,you must determine the payee of the checks.the payee of the checks is determined by examining all of the facts and circumstances present to determine the intention of the plaintiffs at the time they signed the checks.the payee is the person or entity to whom the signer intended the checks to be paid,even if that person or entity name is different from the payee listed on the checks.it is who the maker intends the payee to be that is controlling in determining the intended payee,not the name written on the check.italics added.
the instructions thus presented the jury with the inherently contradictory proposition that plaintiffs were required to prove that they did not intend the checks to be paid to the person to whom they intended the checks to be paid.the jury confusion and frustration is understandable 
section,subdivision b i requires no such proof.that provision does not state that it applies if the signer did not intend the payee to have an interest in the check.rather,it applies if the signer did not intend the person identified as payee to have an interest in the check,subd.b i,italics added.we read the phrase person identified as payee to refer to the named payee,not the intended payee.to read it otherwise would achieve,as the jury instructions here illustrate,an absurd result.see commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,d,statutes should be interpreted to avoid unreasonable,impractical or arbitrary results.in the circumstances of this case,a correct instruction would have charged the jury that plaintiffs were required to prove that the persons identified as payees on the checks the named payees were not the intended payees as determined under section,subdivision a,and that the signer so intended.the case examples in the official comments are consistent with this conclusion,com,supra,foll.the trial court thus erred in instructing the jury.
plaintiffs were not prejudiced 
our conclusion that the trial court erred does not dispose of plaintiffs appeal.we may reverse only if the error was prejudicial.t here is no rule of automatic reversal or inherent prejudice applicable to any category of civil instructional error,whether of commission or omission.a judgment may not be reversed for instructional error in a civil case unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.citation.soule general motors cal th,d,cal,art.vi.thus,we must not only determine whether the trial court committed error,but whether the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.zagami,james crone,th,d see county of monterey leasing unlimited d.where the judgment is the only proper one in the state of the record,even substantial error is not reversible failure to give the requested instruction which arguably should have been given was not prejudicial error.
the undisputed evidence at trial was that plaintiffs issued the checks at park direction and that park was,in effect,the signer
