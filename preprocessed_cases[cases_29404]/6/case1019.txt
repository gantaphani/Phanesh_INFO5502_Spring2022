charlene jenkins entered into several lending transactions with first american cash advance of georgia,llc first american and first national bank in brookings fnb.each time jenkins obtained a loan,she signed an arbitration agreement,in which she agreed to either arbitrate or assert in a small claims tribunal,any claim she had against defendants.the arbitration agreements also required jenkins to waive her right to participate in a class action against defendants.nonetheless,jenkins filed a class action lawsuit against first american and fnb in state court,asserting the loan agreements violated georgia usury laws.after removing the case to federal court,defendants moved to stay the court proceedings and compel arbitration.the district court denied defendants motion,finding the arbitration agreements were unconscionable.pursuant to a,defendants appealed the denial of their motion to this court.we reverse and remand.
background 
fnb is a national bank chartered under the national bank act,d,with its principal offices in south dakota.from september through january,first american,which is located in georgia,managed and serviced loans for fnb however,fnb set the credit scoring criteria for the loans and funded the loans.customers,like jenkins,seeking to obtain a loan from fnb would fill out a loan application at first american offices.first american would electronically transmit the application to fnb for review.fnb would analyze the loan application and make the final decision on whether or not to extend credit.if fnb approved the application,it would send a consumer loan agreement,which included a promissory note and an arbitration agreement,to first american.to obtain the loan,the customer would have to sign and date both the promissory note and the arbitration agreement.
the type of lending transactions at issue in this case are commonly referred to as payday loans.in general,payday loans are,loans with high interest rates.in such transactions,a borrower receives a modest cash advance that becomes due for repayment within a short period of time,usually about days.as security for the loan,the borrower gives a check to the payday lender in the amount of the cash advance,plus the interest charged by the lender.the interest rates in payday lending transactions typically range from to for a advance,which computes to an annual percentage rate of about to.if the borrower has not repaid the lender by the due date,the lender can negotiate the check alternatively,the borrower may be able to extend the loan due date by paying a fee.this type of extension is referred to as a renewal or a rollover.
between june and september,jenkins entered into at least eight payday lending transactions with first american and fnb.each of these loans was for less than and had a maturity date between seven and days.the annual percentage rates charged by defendants for these loans ranged from a low of to a high of.most of the loans in question charged an interest rate of about annually.
like other fnb customers,jenkins signed and dated a promissory note and an arbitration agreement each time she took out a loan.fnb was explicitly listed as the lender in the loan documents,and first american was listed as the loan.each promissory note included a provision,stating the note was governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of south dakota.the arbitration agreements stipulated that they were governed by the federal arbitration act faa,because the underlying lending transactions involved interstate commerce.each arbitration agreement further stated if a court found the faa did not apply to a particular transaction,then the arbitration agreement would be governed by the arbitration law of south dakota.
the arbitration agreements signed by jenkins provided that all disputes between the parties would be resolved by binding arbitration.they further stated jenkins waived her right to participate in a class action against defendants.under the agreements,jenkins had the right to choose the arbitrator from a list of national arbitration organizations,or jenkins and defendants could agree on a local arbitrator.the agreements required defendants to advance jenkins arbitration costs if she submitted a written request for them to do so.the arbitration agreements also permitted the arbitrator to award reasonable attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing party i f allowed by statute or applicable law.
the arbitration agreements provided only one exception to resolving disputes in arbitration all parties shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal for disputes within the scope of such tribunal jurisdiction.the agreements did,however,require appeals from the small claims tribunal to be resolved by arbitration.therefore,by signing the arbitration agreements,jenkins agreed to resolve any claim she had against defendants by either submitting the claim to arbitration or raising it in a small claims tribunal.
the main provisions of the arbitration agreements were conspicuously disclosed in capital letters 
you acknowledge and agree that by entering into this arbitration provision 
a you are waiving your right to have a trial by jury to resolve any dispute alleged against us or related third parties 
b you are waiving your right to have a court,other than a small claims tribunal,resolve any dispute alleged against us or related third parties and 
c you are waiving your right to serve as a representative,as a private attorney general,or in any other representative capacity,to participate as a member of a class of claimants,in any lawsuit filed against us related third parties 
in addition,each promissory note signed by jenkins included a clause stating 
arbitration you acknowledge that you have read,understand and agree to the terms contained in the arbitration agreement you are signing in connection with this note.by entering into the arbitration agreement,you waive certain rights,including the right to go to court,to have the dispute heard by a jury except as specifically provided in the arbitration agreement,and to participate as part of a class of claimants relating to any dispute with lender,first american or their affiliates.
jenkins nevertheless filed a class action lawsuit against first american and fnb in the superior court of richmond county,georgia.in her complaint,jenkins alleged the payday loan agreements violate georgia usury statutes,ann,and the georgia racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act,ann.
first american and fnb removed the case to federal district court.in federal court,first american and fnb sought to enforce the arbitration agreements signed by jenkins.defendants moved pursuant to the faa to stay the court proceedings and to compel arbitration.under the faa,a written arbitration provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa explains when a party to such an agreement fails or refuses to arbitrate,the other party may petition a federal district court for an order to compel arbitration.id.
the district court found the payday lending transactions involved interstate commerce,and,therefore,the faa applied.the district court,however,denied defendants motion to compel arbitration,finding the arbitration agreements were unenforceable because they were unconscionable.defendants filed a motion to reconsider and to stay the proceedings pending this appeal.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and granted the motion to stay the proceedings.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
pursuant to a,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.a authorizing an immediate appeal of any final decision with respect to an arbitration we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration.musnick king motor of fort lauderdale,cir.
iii.discussion 
the parties raise,inter alia,the following three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in applying the faa to the loan agreements in this case whether the district court erred in finding the arbitration agreements are unconscionable and whether the arbitration agreements are unenforceable because the underlying payday loans are illegal and void ab initio under georgia law.we address each of these issues in turn.
applicability of the faa 
the purpose of the faa was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at english common law and had been adopted by american courts,and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the faa provisions manifest a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.id.at.at quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.the supreme court has rejected generalized attacks on arbitration that rest on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to complainants.green tree fin.randolph,d quoting rodriguez de quijas.express,d.
the faa makes enforceable a written arbitration provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.the faa defines commerce as commerce among the several states.id.the supreme court has interpreted the term involving commerce in the faa as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term affecting commerce words of art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of congress commerce clause power.citizens bank alafabco,d citation omitted.the court has further explained the phrase evidencing a transaction means only that the transaction turns out,in fact,to have involved interstate commerce,even if the parties did not contemplate an interstate commerce connection.terminix,dobson,d.
in this case,the district court found the faa applied because the underlying payday lending transactions involved interstate commerce.on appeal,jenkins challenges this part of the district court decision,contending there has been no showing that the loan agreements involved interstate commerce.jenkins contention is without merit.
the faa broad interstate commerce requirement is satisfied in this case.the lending transactions were between jenkins,a georgia resident,and fnb,a national bank located in south dakota loan applications were electronically transmitted to south dakota,where fnb decided whether to approve or refuse the loans.if the loans were approved,fnb sent the borrowers preprinted consumer loan agreements,each including an arbitration agreement.the district court explained first national bank role in analyzing loan applications,sending the approved loan applications,funding the loans,and accepting the loan proceeds constitutes sufficient interstate commerce to satisfy the definition of involving commerce within the meaning of.jenkins first am.cash advance of georgia,d,citation omitted.
we agree with the district court.here,the parties not only contemplated an interstate commerce connection when they entered into the lending agreements but the payday lending transactions did,in fact,turn out to involve interstate commerce.the district court did not err in applying the faa to the loan agreements signed by jenkins 
unconscionability 
under the faa,a written arbitration provision is valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.emphasis added.this language has been interpreted to mean t he faa allows state law to invalidate an arbitration agreement,provided the law at issue governs contracts generally and not arbitration agreements specifically.bess check express,cir citing doctor,casarotto,d.the supreme court has recognized that generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements.doctor,at.at.in this case,appellant argues,and the district court found,the arbitration agreements signed by jenkins are unconscionable.
in deciding claims of unconscionability,georgia courts generally consider a variety of factors,which have been divided into procedural and substantive elements nec,nelson.procedural unconscionability addresses the process of making the contract,while substantive unconscionability looks to the contractual terms themselves.id.at.factors relevant to the procedural unconscionability inquiry include the bargaining power of the parties,the conspicuousness and comprehensibility of the contract language,the oppressiveness of the terms,and the presence or absence of a meaningful choice.id.citations omitted.as for substantive unconscionability,courts consider the commercial reasonableness of the contract terms,the purpose and effect of the terms,the allocation of the risks between the parties,and similar public policy concerns.id.at citations omitted.
on the procedural side of this analysis,the district court found that defendants had superior bargaining power and that the arbitration agreements constituted adhesion contracts.on the substantive side of the analysis,the court provided two reasons for finding the terms of the agreements to be unconscionable precluding class action relief was unfair because a class action is the most effective method for borrowers with small claims to obtain relief and the arbitration agreements lacked mutuality of obligation because the provision providing access to a small claims tribunal would only benefit the lender,fnb.
the district court explained that considered individually,these factors might not be enough to support a finding of unconscionability,but that considered together,they rendered the arbitration agreements unconscionable.we disagree.
bargaining 
the district court found the arbitration agreements were procedurally oppressive because the type of consumer loans that defendants offer unquestionably places the consumer at a severe bargaining disadvantage.jenkins,d at.the court stated c onsumers who are willing to borrow money at such high interest rates would foreseeably sign anything.id.the court further explained consumers were unable to negotiate the terms of the preprinted contracts.after a customer,like jenkins,filled out a loan application at first american offices,the application would be electronically transmitted to fnb.fnb would then send a completed consumer loan agreement,including an arbitration agreement,back to first american for the borrower to sign.the court found the contracts to be adhesive because the borrower was unable to discuss or negotiate the amount and conditions of the preprinted agreement.id.
before considering the merits of the adhesion argument,we must first decide whether this issue is one for an arbitrator or a court to resolve.the faa provides a remedy to a party seeking to compel compliance with an arbitration agreement.prima paint flood conklin,d.such a party can move the district court for an order compelling arbitration.section four of the faa instructs the federal court to grant the motion and order arbitration once it is satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration is not in issue.id.if,however,the making of the arbitration agreement is in question,then the federal court may first adjudicate that issue.id.
in interpreting this section of the faa,the supreme court has distinguished between claims that challenge the contract generally and claims that challenge the arbitration provision itself.see prima paint,at.at.in prima paint,the plaintiff sought to rescind a contract on the grounds that the contract was fraudulently induced.id.at.at.the defendant,on the other hand,sought to invoke the contract arbitration clause and moved to stay the action pending arbitration.id.at.at.the supreme court explained 
i f the claim is fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause issue which goes to the making of the agreement to federal court may proceed to adjudicate it.but the statutory language of the faa does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract generally.
id.at.at.the court concluded that because the fraudulent inducement claim related to the underlying contract generally,and not to the arbitration clause specifically,it was a matter to be resolved by the arbitrator,not the federal court.id.at.at.
this court has applied the prima paint rule to claims of adhesion and unconscionability.we have held that i f the party claims of adhesion,unconscionability,and lack of mutuality of obligation pertain to the contract as a whole,and not to the arbitration provision alone,then these issues should be resolved in arbitration.benoay,cir citations omitted.
here,the adhesion arguments relied on by the district court pertain to the underlying consumer loan agreements as a whole,and not to the arbitration agreements specifically.as explained above,the adhesion arguments were that the consumers lacked bargaining power because these type s of consumer loans would only appeal to extremely desperate consumers,and that the consumers were allegedly unable to negotiate the terms and conditions of the preprinted agreements.jenkins,d at.these claims do not relate to the arbitration agreements themselves rather,they allege the consumer loan agreements,in general,were adhesive.under the supreme court decision in prima paint and our decision in benoay,the faa does not permit a federal court to consider claims alleging the contract as a whole was adhesive.we conclude,therefore,jenkins adhesion claims are for an arbitrator,not a federal court,to decide.
class action waiver 
the district court found the arbitration agreements were substantively unconscionable because they preclude borrower s from either instigating or participating in a class action suit.jenkins,d at.the court explained a class action is the only way that borrowers with claims as small as the individual loan transactions at issue in this case can obtain relief.id.the district court considered the cost of attorney fees to be a significant factor in determining whether the arbitration agreements are unconscionable.id.the court speculated that a borrower who attempts to pursue her claim individually based on one loan transaction would probably be unable to obtain a lawyer on a contingent fee basis.id.the district court found requiring arbitration and prohibiting class action would have the practical effect of providing defendants immunity.id.
as an initial matter,we note this issue may be decided by a federal court.the class action waiver was a provision included in each of the arbitration agreements.unlike the adhesion argument,which applies to the loan contracts generally,this claim alleges the arbitration agreements specifically are unconscionable because they preclude class action relief.under section four of the faa,a federal court may adjudicate this claim because it applies to the arbitration agreements themselves,and thus,it places the making of the arbitration agreements in issue.see.
we have held,however,that arbitration agreements precluding class action relief are valid and enforceable.see randolph green tree fin,cir holding a contractual provision to arbitrate tila claims is enforceable even if it precludes a plaintiff from utilizing class action procedures in vindicating statutory rights under tila.other federal circuit courts have similarly enforced arbitration agreements despite the fact that classwide relief was unavailable.see,snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir rejecting the borrower argument that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable as unconscionable because without the class action vehicle,she will be unable to maintain her legal representation given the small amount of her individual damages johnson west suburban bank,cir holding arbitration clauses are effective even though they may render class actions to pursue statutory claims under the tila or the efta unavailable livingston assocs,cir the arbitration agreement at issue here explicitly precludes the borrowers from bringing class claims or pursuing class action arbitration,so we are therefore obliged to enforce the type of arbitration to which these parties agreed,which does not include arbitration on a class basis.citations omitted.
in addition,the district court contention that consumers would likely be unable to obtain legal representation without the class action vehicle is unfounded.the arbitration agreements expressly permit jenkins and other consumers to recover attorneys fees and expenses i f allowed by statute or applicable law.under the georgia rico statute,a prevailing plaintiff may be awarded attorney fees.ann.c.jenkins,therefore,can presumably recover attorneys fees and costs if she prevails in arbitration on her georgia rico claim see snowden,at in rejecting an unconscionability argument,the court concluded the plaintiff could recover attorney fees in arbitration if she prevailed on her tila and civil rico claims.
georgia courts have explained that by authorizing the recovery of attorneys fees,the georgia rico statute provides plaintiffs with effective access to the judicial process.dee sweet.moreover,federal circuit courts have recognized that arbitration agreements prohibiting class action relief do not necessarily choke off the supply of lawyers willing to pursue claims on behalf of debtors.johnson,at see also snowden,at.these courts explained that when the opportunity to recover attorneys fees is available,lawyers will be willing to represent such debtors in arbitration.see snowden,at johnson,at.
thus,precluding class action relief will not have the practical effect of immunizing first american and fnb.the arbitration agreements permit jenkins and other consumers to vindicate all of their substantive rights in arbitration.we conclude,therefore,the inclusion of a class action waiver in the arbitration agreements did not render those agreements substantively unconscionable.
access to small claims tribunals 
the district court finding of substantive unconscionability was also based on the provision in the arbitration agreements permitting either party to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal.the court found the arbitration agreements lacked mutuality of obligation because this provision only benefits defendants.
on its face,this provision does not favor one party over the other rather,it provides that a ll parties shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal for disputes within the scope of such tribunal jurisdiction.the district court,however,found a borrower ability to pursue an action in a small claims tribunal to be illusory.the court speculated that it is hard to conceive of a claim by the payday lender that can not be sought in a small claims tribunal,but it is easy to envision a plethora of claims a consumer might seek which are inaccessible in such a tribunal due to its limited jurisdiction.jenkins,d at.additionally,the district court explained this provision favored defendants because the judgments of small claims tribunals were appealable to an arbitrator 
under georgia law,if at the time the agreement is to be enforced,the contract contains mutual obligations equally binding on both parties to the contract,then the contract is not unilateral and unenforceable.jones quigley.in this case,both jenkins and defendants had equal access to small claims tribunals.the only restriction,which applied equally to both parties,was that the claims sought in such a tribunal must fall within the tribunal limited jurisdiction.
in stating it could envision a plethora of claims that consumers would not be able to raise in small claims courts,the district court apparently overlooked the many claims that consumers could bring in such tribunals.for example,if fnb charged a consumer an interest rate higher than that agreed upon in the contract,the consumer could,in most instances,pursue an action for the difference in a small claims court.additionally,if fnb mistakenly imposed late charges on a consumer,he could presumably seek recovery in a small claims tribunal.thus,we disagree with the district court unsupported speculation that the consumers ability to pursue an action in a small claims tribunal is illusory.
we note,moreover,that the provision providing access to small claims tribunals was intended to benefit,not injure,consumers.the american arbitration association aaa has developed a set of principles,known as the consumer due process protocol,to protect consumers and en
