rosemary love and nine other female farmers appeal from the denial of their motion for class certification.appellants claim,on behalf of themselves and not less than similarly situated women,that the united states department of agriculture usda or the department discriminatorily administered its lending programs,and that the department failed to process and properly investigate women discrimination complaints over the last.because we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants motion for class certification and did not err in dismissing the claim,we affirm in part.however,because the appellants claim under the administrative procedure act,a apa,remains largely unbriefed,we remand in part.
introduction 
the appellants allege the usda has engaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of discrimination,dating back to specifically,the appellants first the discrimination claim is that the department violated the equal credit opportunity act,ecoa or the act by employing subjective criteria,which enabled decentralized to discriminate amongst loan applicants on the basis of gender.the appellants second the claim is that the department violated both ecoa and the apa by systematically dismantling its systems and failing to investigate discrimination claims filed by women farmers.
the usda administers its farm loan and subsidy programs through the farm service agency fsa the fsa makes several different types of loans,including farm ownership loans,which assist farmers in buying or improving farm property,pt,operating loans,which provide credit and management assistance to help farmers run their farms,id.pt,and emergency loans,which help farmers resume operations after a disaster,id.pt.under the usda regulations,a farmer seeking a farm credit or benefit must first ask the department for a loan application,which the usda is required to disburse.see id.b all persons requesting an application will be provided one.
after receiving an application,a farmer is then required to submit her completed application to a local county committee,the members of which are selected by other farmers from that county.see pigford glickman.the local county committee initially determines whether the applicant is eligible for the program,and usda staff members ultimately grant or deny the application.see,i.the usda has promulgated criteria upon which the local committees are to rely in making eligibility decisions,including citizenship,legal capacity,education and farming experience,farm size,inability to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere,and character which emphasizes credit history and reliability.see id.operating loan criteria,a ownership loan criteria,emergency loan criteria.
any farmer who believes the usda denied her application for a program loan or benefit on the basis of gender or any other prohibited basis may file a civil rights complaint with the secretary of the usda the usda office of civil rights ocr.see id.the department ocr may then conduct an investigation and institute compliance proceedings,if needed.see id.to effectuate compliance,the secretary may refer the matter to the department of justice or institute any other applicable proceedings under state or local law.id.a.
if a farmer is dissatisfied with the usda response to her discrimination complaint,she may sue in federal court under ecoa.the act makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race,color,religion,national origin,sex or marital status,or age.a.ecoa creates a private right of action against creditors,including the united states,who violate its provisions,and it makes such creditors liable to the aggrieved applicant for any actual damages sustained by such applicant acting either in an individual capacity or as a member of a class.id.a.exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required before an ecoa suit may be filed,and prevailing appellants may recover attorney fees.id.d.
the appellants filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia,seeking billion in money damages under ecoa,as well as both compensatory and equitable relief under the apa and the declaratory judgment act,a.to buttress their claims,the appellants filed declarations,which purported to show that the department allowed,indeed supported,unconscionable disparate impact through usda lending programs around the country.the appellants statistics expert,patrick,also filed a report,which purported to provide empirical evidence of the adverse affects sic of a discriminatory system.the department moved to dismiss the complaint under fed.civ.b,and the appellants moved for class certification under fed.civ.
before ruling on the propriety of class certification,the district court dismissed the appellants claim on three grounds.first,the district court concluded that the usda failure to investigate the appellants complaints did not constitute a credit transaction within the meaning of ecoa,a.second,the court held the apa abuse of discretion standard does not cover the usda failure to investigate appellants complaints because ecoa provided an alternative adequate remedy.third,the district court concluded appellants claims for money damages arising from the usda failure to investigate their complaints are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
in light of the court dismissal of the claim,the appellants based their motion for class certification solely upon their discrimination claim.accordingly,the appellants filed an amended complaint,along with a renewed motion for certification of two subclasses.subclass consists of female farmers who asked for loan application forms but did not receive them.subclass consists of female farmers who received,completed,and submitted their loan application forms but did not garner a loan.the amended complaint also dropped the appellants demand for billion in damages and asked only for compensatory damages appropriate for proof at trial.
the district court denied the appellants renewed motion to certify the class on three grounds.first,the court concluded that the appellants failed to satisfy rule a commonality requirement because there had not been a substantial showing that would permit the inference that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination that pervaded all of the challenged decisions.second,the court concluded that the class could not be certified under rule b because the claims for monetary relief predominated over the claims for equitable relief.third,the court concluded the class could not be certified under rule b for the same reason it did not satisfy rule a commonality requirement the appellants adduced no evidence establishing that it is or ever was actually usda policy to refuse to give loan application forms to women,and individual justifications for any loan denials would predominate over questions common to the putative class.
the district court stayed the proceedings so that the appellants could seek interlocutory review of the denial of class certification on their discrimination claim,as well as the dismissal of their claim.in our discretion,we granted the appellants petitions for interlocutory review of the class certification denial.we have jurisdiction over the district court dismissal of their claim under b.see fed.civ.f in re lorazepam clorazepate antitrust.the parties with the help of three amici curiae then fully briefed and argued both issues before a merits panel.compare in re veneman,denying a f petition because the critical questions required to resolve it are entirely unbriefed.
ii.discrimination claim 
appellants first assignment of error is that the district court erroneously declined to certify their putative class as to the discrimination claim.to justify class certification,appellants must first satisfy four threshold requirements,demonstrating that 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
fed.civ.a.if all four prerequisites under rule a are met,then appellants must also show that their claims fit within one of the subsections of rule b.see amchem,windsor,d.rules b and b the two subsections at issue in this different requirements depending primarily on the nature of the relief sought certification under the former is appropriate where a class seeks declaratory or injunctive relief,while certification under the latter is appropriate where,inter alia,the final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.in re veneman,at quoting fed.civ.b advisory committee notes.
the district court declined to certify the class because the appellants failed to show commonality under rule a,and they failed to meet the requirements of rule b or b.because we conclude the district court neither erred as a matter of law nor abused its discretion in finding the putative class members lack commonality under rule a,we affirm without considering whether certification would also be improper under rule b.
appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to find commonality within subclass under rule a.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see hartman duffey,wagner taylor.
each member of subclass allegedly requested an application for a farm loan and had her request denied.although the district court recognized that p laintiffs have assembled an impressive collection of sworn statements asserting that a great many women have been flatly refused loan application forms,it nonetheless declined to certify subclass.the court noted that the appellants declarations might have been sufficient to support certification of subclasses of women who suffered discrimination at the hands of particular county committees,but variations between the declarations precluded a finding of commonality for purposes of a nationwide class action.
the appellants concede that the department offered varying reasons for denying their requests,but appellants argue these variations are irrelevant because there is no basis for refusing to distribute loan applications to requestors,pursuant to usda own regulations.see b all persons requesting an application will be provided one.appellants further concede that they have no statistical proof that women requests for loan applications were treated differently from men.nevertheless,appellants assert that a mountain of anecdotes proves that their claims are not mere coincidence.in the absence of any data to the contrary,the appellants claim,the district court should have presumed that aggrieved women declarations warranted the certification of the class.
we disagree.as we have previously noted 
t here is more to a showing of commonality than a demonstration that class plaintiffs suffered discrimination on the basis of membership in a particular group while in a case alleging intentional discrimination,such as this one,a plaintiff need not isolate the particular practice and prove that such practice caused the discrimination,plaintiffs must make a significant showing to permit the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination that pervaded all of the employer challenged employment decisions.
hartman,at emphasis in original.thus,commonality under rule a requires a named plaintiff to show i discrimination ii against a particular group iii of which the plaintiff is a member,plus iv some additional factor that permit s the court to infer that members of the class suffered from a common policy of discrimination.id.hartman common policy requirement is consistent with the supreme court teaching in general telephone of the southwest falcon,d.there the court noted 
conceptually,there is a wide gap between a an individual claim that he has been discriminated against,and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination,and b the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual,such that the individual claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact for respondent to bridge that gap,he must prove much more than the validity of his own claim.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellants failed to bridge th e gap between their individual claims and hartman common policy requirement.some members of subclass namely,the declarants offered anecdotal evidence that they were personally denied loan applications,and some of those same women reported discriminatory treatment by usda officials.for example,the declarants allege that usda officials told them they were too early to apply for a loan,too late to apply for a loan,that they need not bother filling out an application because they were not eligible to receive a loan,or that their husbands should apply.appellants br.at.certainly these allegations may give the declarants standing to bring individual suits.however,the declarants allegations did not require the district court to infer the existence of a common policy of discrimination that affected the,as well.the bald allegation that the declarants and alike are unified by a common policy of gender discrimination is insufficient to show the district court abused its discretion under hartman and falcon.
as the appellants candidly admit,there is no evidence that women were more likely than men to be refused loan applications.see appellants br.at.moreover,the declarants anecdotal accounts differ widely,and their complaints of discrimination are interspersed with nondiscriminatory evidence and innocuous explanations.compare joint appendix i was told there were no f u nds available,and i was told that there were no funds or applications available,with a usda official told me that farming business was too risky for women.thus,even taking as true all of the declarants factual allegations,the district court was nevertheless left to wonder whether some of the declarants to say nothing of the silent,were victimized by gender discrimination.because the appellants failed to bridge th e gap between their individual and claims,we can not fault the district court for refusing to take a leap of faith.
a recent case from the sixth circuit illustrates our point.in reeb ohio dep t of rehab,cir,four female prison guards filed a putative class action against their employer,alleging it violated title vii by treating them differently from the male guards.seeking to represent all past and present female employees at the prison,the named plaintiffs claimed to have been the victim of the defendant general policy of discrimination on the basis of sex.the district court certified the class and found rule a commonality requirement met b ecause the issue of whether the defendant violated title vii will be common to the class.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the appeals court reversed for an abuse of discretion because i f this were the test,every plaintiff seeking to certify a class in a title vii action would be entitled to that certification.see also bacon honda of am,cir conclusory allegations and general assertions of discrimination are not sufficient to establish commonality.citing falcon,at.sprague motors,cir it is not every common question that will suffice to show commonality,however at a sufficiently abstract level of generalization,almost any set of claims can be said to display commonality.what we are looking for is a common issue the resolution of which will advance the litigation.
after conducting a rigorous analysis of the appellants claims under rule a,hartman,at,the district court in this case exercised its considered judgment and concluded that class certification would not advance the litigation.pigford glickman,chronicling the arduous process of handling a similar case as a class action.even if subclass were certified,the district court concluded,the outcome of this case would nevertheless turn on a series of individualized inquiries into practices in more than fsa offices across the country over the last.unlike the reeb court,we need no
