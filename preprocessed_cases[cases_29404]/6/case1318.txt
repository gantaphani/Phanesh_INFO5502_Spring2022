the money store investment corporation the money store appeals the judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of southern california bank the bank,contending there was a triable issue of fact concerning the bank disbursal of loan proceeds contrary to the money store instructions in an escrow transaction.we reverse with directions.
robert mckinley contracted with teddy springfield to buy springfield chiropractic practice.to facilitate the purchase,springfield and mckinley entered into an escrow with the bank.the escrow instructions the parties submitted on may,reflected a purchase price of.mckinley was to secure a small business administration sba guaranteed loan in the amount of.of that amount,represented the purchase price,was designated as working capital,and was for the sba loan guaranty fee.
under the escrow instructions,the bank was authorized to comply with the lender instructions and to provide copies of the escrow instructions,amendments,and other exhibits the lender might request.the escrow was to close on or after june,and all net proceeds due to springfield were to be paid to attorney robert johnson,who was to hold them in his trust account pending receipt of disbursement instructions from mckinley and springfield.
on june,the money store transmitted closing instructions to the bank.these instructions indicated the sale price plus working capital funds would be wire transferred to the bank upon demand and compliance of sic the money store instructions.
the instructions directed disbursal of to springfield and for working capital and indicated the money store would pay the loan guaranty fee directly to the sba.the instructions directed the bank to provide the money store p rior to close of escrow with an estimated closing statement for money store review and approval.they indicated any deviation from the instructions without the money store express authorization would be at the bank risk.
the bank acknowledged receipt and acceptance of the instructions on june.the same day,springfield and mckinley submitted to the bank an addendum to their original instructions.in it,they agreed that from the springfield proceeds held by johnson,would be paid to dottie billing service and would be paid to mckinley.springfield was to retain interest in the medical lien existing with the attorney for the tran family accident case.
the money store wired loan funds to the bank on june the same day,the bank closed the escrow.it mailed the money store a copy of the addendum to the escrow instructions.by the end of the next day,june,the bank had distributed of the loan proceeds.it transmitted to attorney johnson on july.the money store claimed it would not have closed the loan had it known of the change in terms.
mckinley defaulted on the loan and declared bankruptcy.the money store sued the bank,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,negligence,and equitable estoppel.the bank filed a motion for summary judgment,or summary adjudication in the alternative,and the trial court granted summary judgment.
summary judgment is a drastic procedure and should be used with caution so that it does not become a substitute for trial.citation.however,summary judgment is proper where the affidavits show,as a matter of law,the plaintiff can not prevail against the moving party.citation.sutake orange county federal credit union d.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo campbell industries d,resolving doubts as to whether the motion should be granted against the moving party.schlitz brewing downey distributor d.the motion must be granted when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c barkley city of blue lake th,d.
the facts are gleaned from the parties papers in support of and opposition to the motion,construing them as we must in a light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered.malmstrom kaiser aluminum chemical d.however,a reviewing court may uphold the grant of summary judgment if it can be sustained on any grounds,even those on which the trial court did not rely.id.at.
the bank argues summary judgment was proper on the breach of contract cause of action because the money store and the bank were not parties to a contract the money store reserved the right to withdraw or amend its instructions at any time there was no consideration for a contract and the bank did not breach any contract the bank is wrong on all counts.
the bank claims,without citing authority or the record,that no contract existed between it and the money store because the closing instructions were provided to facilitate the bank performance of its obligations under the e scrow i nstructions,not to create a separate contractual agreement not so.
an essential element of any contract is consent.citations.the consent must be mutual.citations.consent is not mutual,unless the parties all agree upon the same thing in the same sense.citations.the existence of mutual consent is determined by objective rather than subjective criteria,the test being what the outward manifestations of consent would lead a reasonable person to believe.citation.weddington productions,flick th,d.
the bank and the money store objectively exhibited mutual consent.the money store agreed to provide the loan funds to the bank to facilitate the sale,which was the subject of the escrow,on condition the money would be distributed in a certain manner and the money store would be notified before any changes were made to the escrow instructions.the bank acknowledged acceptance of the conditions when its employee signed the acknowledgement and acceptance.
the bank asserts the agreement was illusory because the money store instructions reserved the right to withdraw or amend these instructions at any time prior to the close of escrow.the bank is correct on its general point of law where a contract imposes no definite obligation on one party to perform,it lacks mutuality of obligation.it is elementary that where performance is optional with one of the parties no enforceable obligation exists.citations.kowal day d.
a corollary to that rule exists,however.an agreement that is otherwise illusory may be enforced where the promisor has rendered at least part performance.burgermeister brewing bowman d.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.the money store performed.it provided the loan money necessary to complete the sale.performance cured any illusory aspect of the agreement.
the bank urges no consideration existed for the agreement because the closing instructions said the money store was to be at no expense in this transaction.nevertheless,the money store provided consideration.in return for the bank promises to disburse the funds as the money store designated,not to deviate from the money store instructions except at its own risk,and to provide an estimated closing statement for the money store review and approval,the money store deposited the loan funds with the bank.this was adequate consideration.see pmc,porthole yachts,th,d.
the bank contends it did not breach the contract if one existed.it asserts its duty was to disburse the funds to attorney johnson and it complied with that duty it sent a preclosing estimated closing statement to the money store as the money store closing instructions required and it was not faced with conflicting instructions.we disagree with the first two assertions,so we need not address the third.
as to the first assertion,the bank may confuse its duties under mckinley and springfield instructions and its duties under the money store instructions.under the former,including the addendum,the bank was to pay the proceeds to johnson.under the latter,it was to pay of the proceeds to springfield and to mckinley.
if johnson was the bank agent,the bank had a duty to ensure he disbursed the monies in accord with the money store instructions,and arguably breached its agreement with the money store when he did not if johnson was not the bank agent,the bank arguably breached its agreement with the money store when it paid the funds to johnson rather than to springfield and m
