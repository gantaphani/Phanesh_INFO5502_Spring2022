this appeal raises the question under what circumstances will a creditor be barred from later bringing an action against a based upon state law claims if,during the pendency of a bankruptcy,it failed to raise such claims.
eastman kodak company kodak appeals the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,which affirmed an august,order of the bankruptcy court.that order enjoined kodak from continuing to seek relief against wachovia bank first union national bank wachovia in the united states district court for the western district of new york for violations of state law new york action.the bankruptcy court held,and the district court affirmed,that kodak was precluded from bringing the new york action by the doctrine of res judicata as a result of orders issued by the bankruptcy court in a bankruptcy filed by atlanta retail,wolf camera,et wolf and wolf bankruptcy.
we hold that res judicata does not bar the new york action because kodak could not have received a full remedy in the contested wolf bankruptcy proceedings and because the same nucleus of operative fact was not presented in the two actions.moreover,res judicata does not require a creditor to raise an independent state law claim against a in an adversary bankruptcy proceeding unless the resolution of that claim explicitly becomes an essential part of the bankruptcy plan.here,kodak claim against wachovia in no way impacted on the confirmation of the wolf bankruptcy plan.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed and the injunction is vacated.
background 
kodak had a business relationship with wolf,supplying film and other goods.in the kodak provided financing as secured lender to enable wolf to expand,thereby increasing kodak sales.
in september,kodak and wachovia,which acted as another secured lender to wolf,entered into an agreement the subordination agreement under which kodak loans were subordinated to wolf other secured creditors including wachovia lenders.at the same time,wachovia and kodak made a separate agreement the intercreditor agreement to use their best efforts to promptly notify each other of occurrences which may significantly affect the other secured creditor with regard to the ability of wolf to meet its obligations 
in late kodak began discussions with wolf about an additional million loan for a further expansion of the business.like kodak other loans,it was contemplated that this new loan was also to be subordinated to the loans of the other lenders.in its pleadings in the new york action,kodak alleges that wachovia was aware of these negotiations and their stated purpose and,indeed,that it encouraged the loan.however,wachovia did so without disclosing its plan that wolf would use the money to meet its financial obligations to wachovia.
kodak also claims that it was not aware at the time that wolf was nearing a breach of its financial obligations with wachovia and the other lenders.kodak alleges that on march,wachovia and wolf other lenders entered into an agreement with wolf under which wolf covenant defaults would be forestalled until the kodak loan was completed,unless wolf failed to receive the loan by april,at which point the defaults would accrue.kodak further alleges that it was never informed of this agreement as required by the intercreditor only became aware of the alleged breach of the intercreditor agreement during the pendency of the bankruptcy.wachovia did not share this information,kodak alleges,because wachovia knew that kodak would never have loaned the money to wolf for the purpose of paying wachovia loan,rather than for expansion purposes.
in march,kodak did make the loan to wolf with the express condition that the loan fund the development of wolf business.included in the loan agreement was the following clause 
wolf covenants to kodak that it will use the proceeds of the new term loan to fund new photo retail store development,new photo retail store acquisitions and upgrading the capability of existing and acquired photo retail stores.
second am.and restated loan and purchase agreement,dated,between kodak and wolf.
on march,the money was transferred from kodak to wolf.on the same day,in accordance with the alleged secret agreement between wolf and the lenders,the money was transferred again,this time to wachovia and the other lenders in order to pay some of wolf debts.it appears to be undisputed that none of the money was used to finance an expansion of the business as contemplated in the loan agreement.
on june,wolf voluntarily filed for chapter bankruptcy.on the same date,wolf also filed an emergency debtor in possession motion dip motion,requesting permission to receive financing from wachovia and the other lenders in the amount of,permission to continue to use the cash collateral from the loans from the lenders,and for the court to provide protection to the lenders.kodak did not file an objection to this motion,but the official committee of unsecured creditors unsecured creditors did object.thereafter,wachovia filed proofs of claim and included both the subordination agreement and the intercreditor agreement as evidence that kodak claims were subordinate to those of the lenders.
the bankruptcy court granted the dip motion final order.wolf borrowed approximately from wachovia and the other lenders.the court granted this loan first priority,and also granted a superior security interest to the lenders compared to the remainder of wolf creditors,which included kodak.wolf owed these secured creditors approximately in addition to the amount it owed kodak.
on august,wolf filed a motion seeking approval for ritz camera centers,ritz to purchase nearly all of wolf assets sale motion.approximately a month later on september,wolf and wachovia filed an amended joint motion to approve stipulation with respect to distribution of proceeds from sale of assets of debtors stipulation motion.the unsecured creditors objected to both the sale and stipulation motions.kodak only opposed the sale motion.
kodak did not object to the fact that its claims were subordinate to the lenders.instead kodak argued that wolf could not sell its assets to ritz free and clear of its liens.see f.kodak argued that because the proposed sale price of could not cover the combined claims of wachovia and kodak that the sale could not be considered free and clear if the statute was read to require the repayment of the face value of all liens rather than their market value.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument,holding that kodak waived its right to object to the sale in the intercreditor agreement.the bankruptcy court also rejected kodak legal argument holding that the market determined the value of the liens.as kodak claims were subordinate and there were insufficient funds to pay the priority claims,the bankruptcy court found that kodak claims were in fact valueless.
in addition,the bankruptcy court also found against the unsecured creditors and granted the stipulation motion stipulation order.it also gave permission for the sale sale order.under the sale order,the proceeds of the sale were distributed first to the lenders,then for debts,and then for administrative expenses,with any balance to the remainder of the debts.
after the sale,which was approved by the bankruptcy court on september,the unsecured creditors filed an adversary action challenging wachovia and the other lenders claims,arguing that certain of their liens in wolf assets were not perfected.kodak did not take part in this action.rather,kodak filed one of its own in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of new york.kodak filed this proceeding against wachovia alone,arguing that wachovia and the other lenders claims should be equitably subordinated to kodak claims.it also filed claims for breach of contract,fraud and tortious interference with a contract.all of these claims were based on kodak claim that it was fraudulently induced by the lenders to provide the loan to wolf even though they knew,and so contracted with wolf,that the loan would be used to pay their loans rather than for the contemplated expansion.wachovia and the lenders filed a motion to dismiss.
in the meantime,the unsecured lenders,wolf and the lenders had agreed on the terms of a settlement of the unsecured lenders adversary proceeding.a motion was filed under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure for approval of this settlement.kodak made a limited objection to this motion,but did not object to the settlement itself.kodak only objected to the extent the language of the stipulation could be construed as barring any and all claims against the lenders,including claims held by third parties independent of the debtors or their estates.
at the july,hearing on the rule motion the debtor argued that all questions of subordination,including kodak adversary proceeding,had to be resolved in the bankruptcy court in order for the settlement to stand.kodak did not use this forum to raise the allegations it made in the new york action.it did argue that the fraud claims in the new york action were based on newly discovered evidence that had not been available at the time of the earlier orders.the bankruptcy court granted the rule motion,approving the settlement settlement order.
after this hearing,on august,rather than responding to wachovia motion to dismiss the case in the bankruptcy court for the western district of new york,kodak voluntarily dismissed the action.on the same day,kodak filed a new case new york action in the new york supreme court,alleging the same state law claims as in its prior suit,but excluding the equitable subordination claim.on wachovia motion,the case was removed to the district court for the western district of new york on diversity grounds.
wolf filed its disclosure statement and plan of liquidation on august.the bankruptcy court endorsed the plan on january.the plan did confirm that kodak loans were subordinate to the lenders.however,the plan did not prohibit any suits against third against the debtor.
although the record provided does not show the specific amounts that each party received,it is undisputed that kodak did not receive any portion of its million loan from the distribution.while wachovia and the other creditors did receive some amount at oral argument an estimate of million was suggested,there is no question that wachovia recovery was less than the total amount owed to kodak.therefore,even if kodak had taken wachovia place through equitable subordination,it would not have received the full amount sought in the new york action.
on october,wolf and wachovia filed suit against kodak in the georgia bankruptcy court seeking an injunction against kodak new york action on the basis of res judicata now abandoned collateral estoppel.the bankruptcy court entered an order barring the suit on the basis of res judicata on august.the bankruptcy court rejected kodak argument that the new york action was only an intercreditor dispute and instead focused on the contractual relationships between kodak,wachovia and wolf.it framed the new york action as an attack on its previous orders and an attempt to make the subordination agreement unenforceable.the bankruptcy court stated that the subordination agreement was found enforceable in the process of determining the validity,extent and priority of the claims against the debtors.in re atlanta retail.the bankruptcy court identified the orders approving the sale of wolf to ritz,the order approving the rule motion,and the order approving the final plan of liquidation as the prior orders,as having a preclusive effect.id.the order was affirmed by the district court for the northern district of georgia.eastman kodak atlanta retail,et.march.
in appealing this order,kodak makes five arguments,only three of which need be addressed first,kodak argues that this is not the same cause of action because the bankruptcy court did not consider the evidence relevant to its state law claim in particular,wachovia withholding of information about the revision of its debt agreement with kodak.kodak relies on this court decision in kaiser aerospace teledyne,in re piper aircraft,cir for this point,arguing that the bankruptcy and district courts did not properly apply the case.kodak argues that the bankruptcy court did not,and was not required,to consider whether a breach of contract between the two lenders had occurred when it made its rulings and,therefore,kaiser is controlling.
second,kodak argues that it could not have brought its state claims against wachovia in the bankruptcy court because its breach of contract was not related to the underlying bankruptcy resolution of wolf estate.therefore,the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
third,again relying on kaiser,kodak argued that it lacked an adequate procedural vehicle to bring the state breach of contract claim before the bankruptcy court.at.kodak further claims that all of the bankruptcy court orders were issued on contested matters rather than as adversary proceedings.kodak argues that because the procedural framework for each type of proceeding is different,the orders issued as contested matters could not preclude kodak claims,which would have had to have been raised as adversary proceedings.kaiser,at.
in response,wachovia agrees with kodak that kaiser is controlling,but focus on its differences from the case at hand.in particular,it cites the contractual relationships between kodak,wachovia and wolf in comparison to the absence of any relationship between kaiser and the debtor in the piper bankruptcy.wachovia argues that this court in kaiser relied on this lack of any relationship between the debtor and the plaintiff in finding that kaiser did not have standing to raise the contested claims in the bankruptcy proceeding.wachovia argues that,here,the district court was correct in finding that kodak was sufficiently involved and the contractual relationships were sufficiently discussed in the bankruptcy that kodak was required to bring its state law claims during the bankruptcy.it also argues that the fact that kodak originally filed its case as an adversary action in the western district of new york was essentially an admission that the case could be tried before a bankruptcy court.
wachovia further argues that the bankruptcy court orders were final orders deserving of the application of res judicata.it argues that kodak could have raised its objections during the course of the litigation of these orders and its tactical refusal to raise its fraud claim does not protect it from the effects of res judicata.wachovia further argues that the bankruptcy court properly exercised its discretion in granting the injunction.
lastly,wachovia asks the court to rely on equitable and judicial estoppel to enjoin the action if the lower court is not upheld.
discussion 
res judicata 
res judicata,or more properly claim preclusion,is a judicially made doctrine with the purpose of both giving finality to parties who have already litigated a claim and promoting judicial economy it bars claims that could have been litigated as well.parklane hosiery shore,d.questions of law raised by the application of res judicata are reviewed de novo.kaiser aerospace teledyne,in re piper aircraft,cir applying de novo review to a bankruptcy court decision based on res judicata in re justice oaks ii,cir.in order to establish that a case is barred under the doctrine of res judicata,this court has held that all four of the following elements must be present 
first,the prior judgment must be valid in that it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction and in accordance with the requirements of due process.second the judgment must be final and on the merits.third,there must be identity of both parties or their privies.fourth,the later proceeding must involve the same cause of action as involved in the earlier proceeding.
in re justice oaks ii,at internal citations omitted.when all of the requirements of claim preclusion are satisfied,the judgment or decree upon the merits in the first case is an absolute bar to the subsequent action or suit between the same parties not only in respect of every matter which was actually offered and received to sustain the demand,but also as to every claim which might have been presented.justice oaks ii,at quoting baltimore phillips.
as in kaiser,there is no real question that the bankruptcy court was a court of competent and that,at the very least,its confirmation order was final and on the merits.see justice oaks ii,at finding order endorsing confirmation plan final,but order confirming settlement not to be final and on the merits.however,it is clear that res judicata does not apply because at least two of the elements are lacking here kodak could not have received full relief in the first action,and the contested bankruptcy proceeding and the state court claim do not involve the same nucleus of operative fact or transaction or occurrence.see ragsdale rubbermaid,cir applying a transactional approach to determining the nucleus of operative fact in each action,citing restatement second of judgments.
res judicata and the availability of relief in contested proceedings 
under the most basic principles of res judicata,kodak did not have to sue wachovia in a forum where it could not receive full relief.kaiser,at see also restatement second of judgments c.wachovia has argued that kodak could have raised its claims regarding wachovia alleged fraud in the context of one of the five contested proceedings before the bankruptcy court by challenging the enforcement of the subordination agreement.it urges that the bankruptcy court could have decided to grant equitable subordination of kodak claim at any point while considering these motions.this argument fails here because kodak could not have received its full requested relief under any of these orders.
as in kaiser,it is not clear that kodak challenge to any of the orders would have resulted in any additional benefit to kodak.thus,in kaiser,it was found that the plaintiff did not have to raise objections to the bankruptcy plan confirmation because,even if successful,the objections would only have resulted in defeating the confirmation,not providing the relief kaiser sought under state law.at.likewise,here,if kodak had challenged any of the five motions,it would have done kodak little good.the result would only be their denial,not the equitable subordination of wachovia claims to kodak.
in each of the five orders,either the relief was not available within the context of the claims,or the contested proceeding was not the appropriate procedural device to achieve any kind of relief.the settlement order,which approved the final resolution of the unsecured creditor claims,did not touch upon kodak claims and specifically stated that it did not resolve the claims in the new york action.the four remaining orders,the final order confirming the dip plan,the sale and stipulation orders endorsing the sale to ritz and the division of profits and the final confirmation order,did endorse the subordination agreement by setting the priority of the lenders.as kodak does not challenge the validity or enforcement of the subordination agreement itself,but instead alleges a violation of it,the only conceivable means for kodak to receive relief under these orders would be to seek equitable subordination of the parties however,in order to receive such relief,a party must file an adversary proceeding unless the plan itself provides for subordination.fed.the plan here did not allow for subordination.therefore,filing objections at the contested proceedings would not have provided kodak with the requested relief.
more significantly,even if equitable subordination were available,the amount wachovia received from the bankruptcy would not be sufficient to meet kodak losses.when kodak filed suit,all of the lenders had only received million.wachovia was only entitled to a fraction of this amount.although the full record of the current distribution amount is not before this court,both sides conceded in oral argument that the total amount that wachovia itself received from the bankruptcy as one of the many lenders was not sufficient to satisfy kodak claim.in other words,even if kodak had taken wachovia place in the bankruptcy through equitable subordination,its claim against wachovia would not have been satisfied.
in addition,not only would kodak not be made whole by equitable subordination of wachovia claims,kodak also could not have been granted state law damages in the context of the contested proceedings.any suit kodak filed to recover money or property against a person other than the debtor would have to be filed as an adversary proceeding,rather than be raised within the context of a contested proceeding.fed.here,as in kaiser,the defeat of the plan would not necessarily have resolved claims for potential consequential and punitive damages.at.we reach the same conclusion as the court in kaiser that objections to the various motions in the contested proceeding context did not provide an adequate vehicle to assert fully the claims it raises in the state court action.id.the most basic principles of res judicata require that full relief must have been available in the first action in order for the second action to be barred.see restatement second of judgments c.therefore,res judicata can not apply to the contested matters.
res judicata and the adversary proceedings.
wachovia argues that,nevertheless,res judicata should apply despite the fact that full relief was not available in the contested proceedings because kodak could have filed an adversary action within the context of the bankruptcy.kodak disputes that the bankruptcy court would have had jurisdiction over such an action,claiming that the state law action was not related to the bankruptcy.see c.kodak also claims that preclusion of such claims on the basis of the bankruptcy court judgment resulting from only a contested proceeding would raise seventh amendment concerns 
bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction,by reference from the district courts,over all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title.a,b c.neither party has cited a case in this circuit that indicates that the bankruptcy court would have had jurisdiction over a claim between two creditors when the outcome would not affect the amount of money available in the bankruptcy estate.however,the bankruptcy court would have had jurisdiction over a claim for equitable subordination as a core proceeding determining the priority of the liens.b k.if kodak had brought an equitable subordination claim,it would appear that the bankruptcy court would then have had jurisdiction over the state law claims as claims related to the equitable subordination claim,at least where they would directly affect the bankruptcy plan.this issue need not be addressed because the case turns not on whether kodak could,but whether it was required to bring an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy to resolve its state law claims.
again,assuming the bankruptcy court would have had jurisdiction over the state claims in an adversary proceeding,it does not follow that the new york action would have been precluded.the sweeping limits of jurisdiction do not set the boundaries of res judicata.wachovia is correct in asserting that res judicata applies not only to claims which were actually brought before the previous court,but also to those claims which could have been raised in that action.kaiser,at.however,res judicata only requires a litigant to raise the claims in the first proceeding if the later litigation arises from the same cause of action.in re justice oaks ii,at internal citations omitted.
both parties have suggested that we look to the third circuit to determine which claims to compare to the second litigation.we do not think that the third circuit decisions help wachovia because as we read the cases the inquiry is narrowed in the context of two creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding to comparing only the claims which were actually brought against a to the claims in the later litigation.see eastern minerals chemicals mahan,cir corestates bank,huls america,cir.in any case,in this circuit,we have not narrowed the analysis,instead looking at all the previous bankruptcy orders,regardless of whether there were claims between the creditors during the proceedings leading to those orders
