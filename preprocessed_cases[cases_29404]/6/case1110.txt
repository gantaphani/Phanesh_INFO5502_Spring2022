background 
in response to the large number of failing savings and loan institutions in the economic conditions of the,the united states,acting through the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic and related regulatory bodies,encouraged solvent banks to infuse capital and management resources into failing thrift institutions.the government offered various incentives for that purpose,including tax and accounting benefits,regulatory relief and forbearances,and cash payments,as discussed in winstar,at.
in accordance with a plan called the southwest plan,the fslic sought a buyer for five failing savings and loan institutions first texas savings association,gibraltar savings association,killeen savings and loan association,montfort savings association,and home savings association.these five institutions had total liabilities of over twelve billion dollars.on december,first nationwide bank and associated investors collectively nationwide agreed to acquire the assets and liabilities of the five failing institutions,and also to provide million in cash the terms and conditions were set forth in an assistance agreement between nationwide and the fslic.
the assistance agreement provided,inter alia,that in addition to the tax deductions available for losses,fslic would provide reimbursement of of each covered asset that was liquidated at a loss.the court of federal claims explained that nationwide and the government negotiated to convert of the anticipated tax savings into a reduction in reimbursements,nationwide iii.at,in that the reduction in loss reimbursement was of the tax rate set in the assistance agreement.id.at.
the transfer to nationwide of the five southwest plan thrift institutions was completed in december.in august enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act firrea eliminated many of the incentives that had been employed by the fslic to salvage failing thrifts,and required the newly formed resolution trust corporation rtc to evaluate all existing agreements with respect to loss reimbursement,tax consequences,and other concessions and considerations.b b.upon such evaluation the rtc and other cognizant agencies proposed no change in the arrangement with nationwide,and the assistance agreement continued in effect in accordance with its terms.
in,in response to concerns that the various assistance agreements granting tax benefits for covered asset losses had created an incentive to maximize losses,congress enacted a remedial provision as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra.section of the obra,known as the guarini legislation,disallowed tax deductions for savings and loan losses that were reimbursed with fslic assistance this disallowance was made retroactive to years ending on or after march.pub,stat,note.the effect was to eliminate a substantial benefit provided by the assistance agreement.nationwide and others filed suit against the fdic,as successor to the fslic.
in august nationwide and the fdic entered into a settlement and termination agreement the termination agreement,terminating both the assistance agreement and the suit against fdic.fdic made certain payments to nationwide,and the termination agreement released the fdic from further liability

discussion 
in nationwide i the court of federal claims held that the release provision in the termination agreement does not bar nationwide from pressing this claim against the united states.the government argues that section of the termination agreement released the fdic from all liability under the assistance agreement,and that since the fdic was the government party to the termination agreement in its capacity as successor to fslic,the release of the fdic also released the united states from all liability for breach.thus the government argues that the excepted claim provision,section,did not preserve a breach claim against the united states.the government also argues that any judgment against the united states would be satisfied from the fslic resolution fund frf which is managed by fdic and,because of the release of fdic in section,the frf can not be called upon to satisfy any judgment against the united states under section.thus the government argues that since nationwide agreed not to sue the fdic,it can not sue the united states despite the express reservation of this right.
this question arose in centex and was decided by the court of federal claims in the same way as in nationwide i,and affirmed by the federal circuit.in centex the plaintiff bank had entered into a termination agreement with the fdic as successor to the fslic,terminating an assistance agreement that contained tax benefits expunged by the guarini legislation.the centex termination agreement released the fdic from claims related to the assistance agreement,but reserved to the bank the right to bring a claim against the united states based on legislation that resulted in the reduction or elimination of contractual benefits of the acquisition of failing thrifts.the bank then sued the united states,alleging that the guarini legislation constituted a breach of contract and incurred liability for damages.on the government argument that the reservation of the right to sue the united states was ineffective,this court on appeal held 
the agreement barred an action directly against the fdic,but to the extent that an action against the united states is considered to implicate the fdic,such as by requiring that any judgment be paid from the frf,the reservation of the right to sue the united states in the termination agreement must be interpreted to permit such an action.
centex,at.the government now asks this court to decline to follow centex and to disregard or hold ineffective section in the termination agreement.
in nationwide i,which was decided before the federal circuit reached centex on appeal,the court of federal claims held that this contract claim against the united states was preserved by section.the court also held that it is not controlling whether the fdic manages the fund from which damages may be paid,for the claim for breach by reason of the guarini legislation was expressly excepted by section.we agree that the court of federal claims correctly construed the termination agreement.the principle that a contract is construed to give effect to all of its provisions does not exempt contracts with the united states.see tecon united states,a construction of a contract provision which gives meaning to all its language is to be favored.united states,also,an interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all parts of an instrument will be preferred to one which leaves a portion of it useless,inexplicable,inoperative,void,insignificant,meaningless or superfluous.the government proposed interpretation would materially change the bargain by eliminating a remedy that had been expressly reserved.the court of federal claims correctly held that the termination agreement can not be interpreted as eliminating section while preserving section,for such an interpretation would deprive a material contract provision of effect.
the centex court also heard the argument that since damages for breach of contract would be paid from a fund of which fdic is the manager,the release of the fdic means that the united states could not pay any damages if such were awarded,and thus the united states can not be liable for damages.in centex the court explained that the asserted source of funds neither insulated the united states from liability,nor freed it from the obligation to pay damages if such were incurred.we agree that the termination agreement,which preserved nationwide claims against the united states,did not in section place the fdic in the position of preventing payment of a judgment against the united states.the holdings of nationwide i are affirmed.
the government also argues that the guarini legislation could not incur governmental liability for breach of contract with respect to elimination of tax incentives that were included in the assistance agreement with nationwide,because the tax code did not authorize these tax incentives.the government argues that nationwide was never entitled to the tax benefits that it received in the assistance agreement,and thus suffered no deprivation by the guarini legislation.the argument appears to be that this aspect of the assistance agreement was contrary to law and that the guarini legislation simply eliminated the illegality.this argument had been made in centex,and the federal circuit affirmed the comparable holding of the court of federal claims.at.
various statutes were enacted to facilitate government intervention when the savings and loan institutions began to fail in large numbers.the economic recovery tax act of,pub,stat,codified at,was the foundation of several tax incentives,including authorization to the fslic to grant tax benefits in consideration for investment in and acquisition of weak or insolvent thrift institutions.see centex,at.for example,the internal revenue code at a provided that assistance payments to acquiring institutions in transactions would not be taxed as income to the acquiring institutions,and b provided that such assistance payments would not reduce the basis of the acquired assets for tax purposes.although the government argues that these provisions did not override other provisions of the tax code,specifically,and,which the government states are in conflict with,that is not a tenable argument.
the favorable tax treatment was enacted as an incentive to facilitate the acquisition of failing thrifts,by providing benefits to the acquiring and merged financial institutions.indeed,of the internal revenue code was directed explicitly to the tax treatment of such acquisitions.as a principle of statutory interpretation,a specific provision prevails against broader or more general provisions,absent clear contrary intent.see radzanower touche ross,d specific statute not vitiated by general statute absent manifest intent morton mancari,d where there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,regardless of the priority of enactment.this court ruled in centex,at,that was enacted as a tax incentive to attract solvent financial institutions to invest in and manage failing thrifts,and in this application superseded the general provisions of and.
similarly,the general principle of a was overtaken by.section a concerns deduction of losses from disposition of property,measuring such loss as the excess of the adjusted basis provided in such section for determining loss over the amount realized.the government argues that fslic reimbursement of losses on thrift property should always have been included in the amount realized,and should not have been treated in the way that was authorized in the assistance agreement.however,code explicitly authorized these tax incentives to thrift acquisitions,until abrogated by the guarini legislation.this court explained in centex 
after a close examination of the series of statutory provisions enacted in the and early that specifically addressed acquisitions,we agree with the trial court that,prior to the enactment of the guarini amendment in,congress allowed losses to be deducted even though they were offset by fslic assistance payments.
nationwide entered into the assistance agreement on the premise and promise of the tax benefits that were included in the agreement.section of the internal revenue code permitted the tax incentives that were implemented by the fslic,and were recognized until abrogated by the guarini legi
