this appeal is an appendage of two lawsuits filed by the securities and exchange commission sec to shut down two fraudulent prime bank trading programs.in march,the sec initiated a lawsuit sec cook alleging that cook and several other defendants were engaged in a complex ponzi scheme the dennel program.in the backdrop to this particular lawsuit,the district court issued a receivership order designed to protect any remaining assets to reimburse the investors defrauded by the dennel program.the court appointed lawrence warfield warfield as receiver.the court also issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited cook or any person or entity cooperating with him from 
directly or indirectly,making any payment or expenditure of funds,incurring any additional liability including,specifically,any advances on any line of credit,or effecting any sale,gift,hypothecation or other disposition of any asset,pending defendants providing sufficient proof to the court that they have sufficient funds or assets to satisfy all claims arising from the violations of the federal securities laws alleged in the sec complaint.
the court subsequently entered a preliminary injunction with the same terms.
martella is the sole shareholder and sole director of.martella is also a friend and business associate of cook.had invested more than with the dennel program directly,and about with the dennel program through its pension plan.after his assets and those under his control were frozen,cook was unable to pay his attorneys.cook asked martella to pay his attorneys in exchange for immediate reimbursement.on march,and april,martella personally delivered two checks,in the amounts of and,to cook attorneys.these checks were drawn on chase bank checking account.on april,ierc wired from its bank of nevada account to.at the time the check was issued to cook attorneys,checking account would not have contained sufficient funds to pay it,but for the wire transfer from ierc.
in march,the sec filed a second lawsuit sec rdi against another set of defendants led by james and david edwards.the defendants in this lawsuit included ierc,resource development institute,llc,rdi,and other entities.the complaint alleged that the rdi prime bank trading program rdi program had its genesis in the dennel program,and that james and david edwards,and their,had developed the rdi program to replace the dennel program after the sec shut it down.the district court also entered a receivership order with respect to these defendants and again appointed warfield as receiver.
after discovering the wire transfer from ierc to,warfield filed suit on december,claiming that the transfer of funds from ierc to was fraudulent under the uniform fraudulent transfer act.warfield also contended that martella and failure to return the funds to him constituted wrongful conversion.finally,warfield alleged that martella and conspired with cook and the edwards defendants to defraud the ierc,the receivership entities,and their investors.warfield requested equitable disgorgement to prevent martella and from being unjustly enriched by their fraudulent joint and several liability as between the two defendants on the theory that martella used to perpetrate fraud and that the court should hold him personally accountable.
the case was tried before the district court beginning on january.on january,the district court entered its findings of facts and conclusions of law.the court found that martella,knowing that cook accounts were frozen,agreed to make payments to cook counsel in exchange for immediate reimbursement.after martella delivered two checks to cook lawyers,this transaction was completed when he was reimbursed by a wire transfer from ierc.martella and were aware or reasonably should have been aware of the court order freezing cook assets and restricting the disposition of assets within his control.
in the same order,the court determined that ierc was an entity created to perpetuate an illegal ponzi scheme all of its assets resulted from fraudulent activities on april,when ierc transferred to defendant,ierc was insolvent gave no reasonably equivalent value to ierc for the transfer ierc made the transfer and received the monies to hinder enforcement of the court orders freezing cook accounts and restricting the disposition of his assets,and to further perpetuate the fraud on dennel investors and in using for this money laundering transaction,martella utilized his control over the corporation for an illegal purpose violation of the court orders and to continue the fraudulent dennel program 
on the basis of these findings,the district court concluded that ierc april,wire transfer of to defendant was a fraudulent transfer under a of the texas business and commerce code the payment constituted an unjust enrichment that the defendants should be required to disgorge and was the alter ego of martella,with respect to the payment.finally,the court rejected the defendants asserted affirmative defenses of offset,good faith,waiver,and laches.
