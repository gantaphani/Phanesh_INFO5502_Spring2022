this is a winstar damages case.see united states winstar,d.the united states appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims,which awarded to old stone corporation osc million in damages for the government breach of contract.old stone united states.old stone ii.the breach was the elimination of regulatory capital by the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea,stat.we affirm the award of million of mitigation payments,but reverse the award of million of initial contributions.we conclude that the million amount is not recoverable under a restitution theory because the appellant elected to continue performance under the contract to the benefit of the appellant and to the detriment of the government,and is not recoverable under a reliance theory because the damages were not foreseeable as a matter of law.
background 
before the transactions that are the focus of this lawsuit,old stone corporation osc was a bank holding company headquartered in rhode island.its primary subsidiary was a commercial bank,old stone bank old osb or oosb,which was insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.this dispute had its genesis in the acquisition of two thrifts by osc.
the first transaction was an acquisition of a small thrift,rhode island federal rif.in june,osc submitted a proposal to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic to acquire rif with cash assistance from fslic.as a result of the acquisition,osc would become a thrift holding company owning all of the stock of rif.osc would also obtain a federal savings bank charter which would permit it to engage in commercial lending while allowing it to expand into other geographical areas.
fslic accepted osc offer and approved the transaction in august.the transaction involved the following steps rif converted from a mutual savings institution to a federal stock savings bank or thrift,new old stone bank osb osb formed a subsidiary,newco,to which osc transferred all of its stock in oosb,valued at million newco caused oosb to distribute its assets and liabilities to osb osc acquired all of osb stock for a nominal amount.
under an assistance agreement executed by osc,fslic and osb,fslic contributed million cash to osb,and osc contributed million cash.rif deficit net worth on the date of the acquisition,after the cash contributions,was million,which was recorded as supervisory goodwill.the assistance agreement incorporated a forbearance letter,which obligated the government to permit osb to count fslic million cash contribution known as a capital credit,and the million of goodwill as regulatory capital.thus the rif transaction generated approximately million in regulatory capital million in goodwill,and million in the form of a capital credit.the forbearance letter permitted osb to amortize this regulatory capital over a thirty year period.because the forbearance letter was incorporated into the assistance agreement signed by osc,fslic and osb,the government promise of regulatory forbearance ran to both osc and osb.
osc and fslic also executed a net worth maintenance stipulation nwms under which osc agreed to downstream contribute additional funds needed to maintain osb in compliance with regulatory requirements.
the second transaction the citizens transaction occurred on december.osc acquired citizens federal,a,mutual association located in seattle,washington.as part of the transaction,citizens federal converted to a federal stock savings bank and was renamed old stone bank of washington osbw.under an assistance agreement between fslic,osc and osbw,fslic contributed million of cash assistance to osbw,and osc contributed million.taking into account the cash contributions,the bank had a net worth deficit of million.this amount was recorded as supervisory goodwill.the assistance agreement incorporated a forbearance letter,which permitted osbw to count fslic million contribution,and the million of supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital.thus the citizens transaction generated a total of million in regulatory capital million in goodwill,and million in capital credits.the forbearance letter permitted osbw to amortize that regulatory capital over twenty five years.as in the rif agreement,the government promise of regulatory forbearance ran to both the thrift and to osc.
on december,osbw formerly citizens federal merged with and into osb.thereafter the combined entity made regulatory filings on a consolidated basis and was regulated on the basis of its combined regulatory capital.
the government contends that on december,the parties agreed to terminate the citizens assistance agreement,pursuant to a termination provision of the assistance agreement that provided that this agreement shall terminate five years following the effective date or on such other date to which the parties or their successors agree in writing at emphasis added.the parties dispute the effect of this termination on the government regulatory capital promise,but agree that it terminated the government obligation to make assistance payments under the agreement.
in august of,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of,stat.firrea,which limited the ability of thrift institutions to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits towards their regulatory capital requirements.winstar,at.
at the time of the enactment of firrea,approximately million of regulatory capital from the citizens and rif transactions had not yet been amortized pursuant to the and amortization provisions of the assistance agreements.approximately million of this capital was attributable to the rif transaction,and the remainder to the citizens transaction.firrea prevented osb from recognizing these amounts as regulatory capital.as a result,osb failed one of the government regulatory capital capital million osb was thus undercapitalized and subject to seizure.however,neither osc nor osb repudiated the assistance agreements or at the time filed suit against the government for breach of the contracts.rather,osc and osb sought to achieve compliance with firrea,and to otherwise continue performance under the contract.
a thrift could address the problem of regulatory compliance created by firrea in one of two by shrinking the thrift selling assets and using the proceeds to pay off liabilities or by infusing additional capital into the thrift.initially the thrift chose the former route it sold assets in december of residential lending unit oscal and a tuition budget company academic management services or ams.
thereafter osb submitted a capital plan,which required osb to maintain compliance with the tangible and core capital requirements and to meet the capital requirement of firrea by december.at.under the plan,the government granted an exemption from any penalties or sanctions that may be imposed on the thrift for failing to meet its capital requirements.at.the capital plan called for further shrinkage of the thrift through the sale by osb of the assets that were owned by citizens before the merger of citizens into osb.on january,osb entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the branches of osbw formerly citizens.it sold the assets in may,for a gain of million.
the plan also required osc to contribute additional capital under the nwms,pursuant to a revised schedule.the government approved the plan in march.pursuant to the plan,osc downstreamed million of capital to osb in three allotments million in,million in and million in.in order to fund these downstream payments,osc sold assets including two of its subsidiaries,old stone credit corp and old stone bank of north carolina.osc refers to these subsidiaries as its crown jewels.the record does not reflect the exact relationships between the,and payments and the amount of unamortized regulatory capital at the time of each payment,but the parties agree that these payments were even greater than the amount of unamortized regulatory capital million when the thrift was later seized in.
it is undisputed that after the breach caused by the enactment of firrea,osc was suffering from significant problems unrelated to the lost regulatory capital.as the court of federal claims found,old stone acknowledges that factors other than the breach affected the bank operations during the period after the breach.at.the court also found that t hese problems resulted in part because of general economic conditions at the time.id.however,osc contended,as its expert stated,that w hat the breach did was take away our ability to weather the storm,to solve the other problems.id.at emphasis added.
three years after the enactment of firrea,osc and osb filed a complaint in the court of federal claims against the united states on september,alleging that the passage of firrea resulted in the breach by the government of contracts embodied in the rif and citizens assistance agreements,under which the government was obligated to permit the thrift to count capital credits and goodwill as regulatory capital.the complaint requested,inter alia,recovery of damages osb had allegedly suffered in attempting to maintain regulatory compliance,and million osc had invested when it acquired citizens.
on january,the government seized osb and placed it in receivership.osb was at that time critically undercapitalized under the statute because it had less than two percent tangible equity.as noted above,absent the enactment of firrea,on the date of seizure the unamortized balance of regulatory capital would have been approximately million.
the court of federal claims action was stayed pending the supreme court decision in winstar,d,and pursuant to a pretrial agreement concerning many of the winstar actions.
eventually,after discovery,on april,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of osc on the issue of liability,finding that the enactment of firrea had breached the assistance agreements.old stone united states,old stone i.in that connection the court rejected the government argument that the regulatory capital promises had been terminated by the parties pursuant to section of the citizens assistance agreement before the enactment of firrea,slip op.at.the court appeared not to address the government contention that the promise of regulatory forbearance under the citizens assistance agreement should not be considered because that promise would have ceased upon the sale of the osbw assets in may without regard to the enactment of firrea.
a trial on damages was held beginning in may.old stone ii.at.following the trial,the court of federal claims awarded osc the following amounts in damages a million for the contributions osc made to osb after the enactment of fireea,under mitigation and reliance theories b million for the value of stock osc transferred to the thrift in the rif acquisition,under restitution and reliance theories and c million for the cash contribution osc made to citizens in the citizens acquisition,under restitution and reliance theories.these damages totaled million in awarding these amounts,the court reasoned that the government breach caused all of osc losses,because absent firrea,osb would have had an additional million in regulatory capital and would not have been seized.the court held that the requirements of restitution had been met because the contributions conferred a benefit on the government,and because the enactment of firrea constituted a total breach.the court rejected the government argument that continued performance by osc constituted an election that barred voiding the contract and seeking restitution.in finding that the million should be awarded as reliance damages,the court found that the losses were foreseeable.the court also rejected the government argument that returning the initial investments would result in a windfall to osc.
the government timely appealed.following oral argument,we ordered supplemental briefing on a variety of questions.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims decisions on summary judgment and conclusions of law without deference.comtrol,united states,alger united states.we review the court findings of fact following trial under the clearly erroneous standard.anderson city of bessemer city,d home savings of am.united states.
we first address the court of federal claims holding that under a mitigation theory osc is entitled to recover the million in downstream payments that it made to osb in order to replace the regulatory capital eliminated by firrea.when firrea was enacted in august of it eliminated million of regulatory capital that was available to osb under the assistance agreements.by the time of seizure of the thrift in january the unamortized regulatory capital deficiency would only have been million.between the enactment of firrea and the seizure,osc downstreamed million to osb to replace the regulatory capital lost by firrea.that amount is claimed and was allowed by the court of federal claims on a theory of mitigation.neither party disputes that the downstreamed amounts exceeded the unamortized regulatory capital which remained at the time of the seizure.
a party may generally recover its mitigation costs incurred in a reasonable effort to avoid loss caused by a breach,even if its efforts prove unsuccessful.restatement second of contracts cmt.h id.at cmt.c t he injured party is generally entitled to recover for all loss actually suffered.consistent with this rule,we have upheld awards of the actual costs of generating replacement capital resulting from the elimination of regulatory capital by firrea.see,home savings,at cal.fed.bank,fsb united states,affirming award of transaction costs as measure of cost of replacing capital cal fed see also hughes commc ns galaxy,united states.
in home savings,for example,we affirmed an award of the cost incurred by shareholders in replacing supervisory goodwill eliminated by firrea.at.likewise,in lasalle talman bank united states,we affirmed an award of the cost of raising replacement capital because it provides a measure of compensation based on the cost of substituting real capital for the intangible capital held by plaintiff in the form of supervisory goodwill.id.at.in our prior cost of replacement cases,the thrift was not seized and the replacement capital was not lost,so the cost of replacing the capital was limited to the cost of raising additional capital and did not include the replacement capital itself.here,the court of federal claims held that osc cost of replacing osb supervisory goodwill with tangible capital was not just the transaction costs incurred in raising the million,but rather the million itself.
we understand the government to contend that the court of federal claims made several errors in allowing the million as mitigation costs.
first,the government contends that the regulatory capital promise with respect to the citizen acquisition was eliminated by agreement in december,before the enactment of firrea,and that firrea thus did not cause a breach of the government promise.since there was no breach of the citizens agreement,there can be no recovery of mitigation payments that replaced the citizens capital.because only million of rif capital remained on the date of firrea,any mitigation payments in excess of million are attributable to citizens and are not recoverable.
there is no dispute that the citizens agreement was terminated.the question is whether the termination applied to both executory,financial assistance and,regulatory forbearance provisions.the government asserts that the termination applied to both obligations and eliminated its obligation of regulatory forbearance before the enactment of firrea.the government agrees that the termination is described in a december,letter fhlbb sent to osb stating that t his letter serves as notification that the assistance agreement has terminated as of december,pursuant to section of the agreement.at.relying on our decision in winstar,the court of federal claims interpreted the parties agreement to apply only to the executory provisions.old stone i,slip op.at.we agree with the court of federal claims.
in winstar united states,en banc,affirmed,d,we held that a termination clause applied only to executory provisions.at.that termination clause stated in part,t his agreement shall terminate and the obligations of the fslic to make any payments hereunder shall cease upon the expiration of years glendale federal supervisory action agreement,available in old stone ii supplemental appendix filed may.the government claimed that after the passage of years the regulatory forbearance expired.we rejected that construction and held that the expiration provision relat ed only to executory provisions set out in the saa,which obligated the fslic to make certain payments to the merged thrift for a limited period of time.winstar,at.
section of the citizens assistance agreement is similar to the termination clause in the winstar case.it provides that this agreement shall terminate five years following the effective date or on such other date to which the parties or their successors agree in writing at emphasis added.the emphasized language does not appear in the agreement involved in winstar.however,this language merely allows the parties to accelerate the natural termination that would otherwise take place upon the passage of five years.that is exactly what the termination agreement did.it refers specifically to section.at this letter serves as notification that the assistance agreement has terminated as of december,pursuant to section of the agreement.emphasis added.thus the termination agreement did no more than accelerate a termination provision that was not designed to eliminate the promises of regulatory forbearance.the termination only applied to executory provisions,and the regulatory forbearance remained in force on the date of the enactment of firrea.
second,the government argues that,even if the citizens contract were not voluntarily terminated in,any contractual right to count the citizens capital credits and goodwill as regulatory capital would have ceased with the sale of in may.again the government argues the amount of mitigation recovery should be reduced by eliminating payments that replaced the regulatory capital under the citizens agreement and thus should be confined to million the amount under the rif agreement.
after the execution of the two assistance agreements in and,the two thrifts merged into osb on december.the government admits that the merged entity could claim the benefit of both assistance agreements.however,the government contends that the merged entity lost the right to enforce the citizens assistance agreement when the citizens assets were sold in may.the government contends that section of the citizens assistance agreement provides that generally accepted accounting principles gaap govern accounting computations made under the agreement.it asserts that gaap rules required that the goodwill attributable to the citizens transaction be written off upon the sale of the citizens assets.at that point,says the government,the citizens agreement would no longer be enforceable.
again we do not agree.the sale of the osbw assets occurred after the enactment of firrea,and the court of federal claims found that firrea caused the sale of the citizens assets.old stone ii.at old stone capital plan also represented that management would mitigate the capital reduction by sell ing certain subsidiaries including the seattle,thrift that was a division of old stone bank,citizens.on this point,the court of federal claims finding is supported by the record.
finally,the government contends that the amount of mitigation recovery should be limited to million rather than the million awarded by the court of federal claims because osb needed only million to bring it into capital compliance immediately after the enactment of firrea.
in home savings,we recognized that w hen mitigating damages from a breach,a party must only make those efforts that are fair and reasonable under the circumstances.at quoting robinson united states,see also corbin on contracts,at ed.the doctrine of avoidable consequences merely requires reasonable efforts to mitigate damages.dobbs law of remedies,at ed.t he damage recovery is reduced to the extent that the plaintiff could reasonably have avoided damages he claims and is otherwise entitled to.the government has not shown that it was unreasonable for osc to replace the entire amount of regulatory capital that was eliminated by firrea.
in home savings,we allowed a mitigation award that exceeded the minimum amount required to achieve regulatory compliance.at.the home savings court held that the full cost was recoverable because the holding company was entitled to raise funds to replace the supervisory goodwill the thrift lost as a result of the government breach,including the excess capital beyond that needed to achieve regulatory compliance.id.likewise,osc was entitled to replace the entire amount of regulatory capital eliminated by firrea so that the thrift had a cushion against future losses.we agree with the court of federal claims conclusion here that osc mitigation efforts were reasonable under the circumstances.
for the forgoing reasons,we conclude that the court of federal claims correctly held that osc is entitled to recover its mitigation payments of million.
we next address the court of federal claims holding,and osc argument,that osc is entitled to recover its million stock contribution to the rif transaction,and its million cash contribution to the citizens transaction.osc claims these amounts under restitution and reliance theories.we first consider its restitution theory.
when one party to a contract commits a total breach,the other party is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the breaching party by way of part performance or reliance.mobil oil exploration,prod.southeast,united states,d citing restatement second of contracts see also landmark land.a party may recover damages as restitution to the extent that party has conferred a benefit on the breaching party.hansen bancorp,united states,citing restatement second of contracts see also cal,at the idea behind restitution is to restore the party to the position it would have been in had there never been a contract to breach.citing glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,glendale 
we have suggested that restitution of initial contributions of both stock and cash in winstar transactions may be allowable because both forms of contribution confer a benefit on the government.see,landmark,at hansen,at.in landmark,we held that restitution of an initial cash contribution to a supervisory merger was appropriate when the contribution was expressly required by the assistance contract.at.in hansen,we indicated that it might be possible to consider a stock transfer as a benefit conferred in a winstar case that would be subject to restitution.at.
nonetheless,restitution is subject to an important limitation.restitution is available only if the breach gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach and not merely to a claim for damages for partial breach.id.at quoting restatement second of contracts cmt.a.when a party elects to continue performance,that party is said to elect to treat the breach as partial rather than total.williston on contracts ed.the consequence is that restitution is not available,and the party must pursue a claim for damages instead.see corbin on contracts,at damages and restitution will not be given as concurrent remedies for the same injury.our winstar precedent has not yet considered the effect of the election doctrine on damages arising from the enactment of firrea 
in describing the election doctrine,williston states 
when one party commits a material breach of contract,the other party has a choice between two inconsistent or she can either elect to allege a total breach,terminate the contract and bring an action for restitution,or,instead,elect to keep the contract in force,declare the default only a partial breach,and recover those damages caused by that partial breach 
williston ed in mobil oil united states,the supreme court recognized that the election doctrine applies when the breach is the enactment of a statute,d.
the authorities differ on what conduct is required to establish an election.the williston view appears to be that mere continued performance can result in an election.williston a party actions are sometimes characterized as an election where that party continues to perform or to accept performance under a contract even though he or she knows that a contract provision has been breached.other authorities take a stricter the mere failure to elect restitution at the time of the breach and the continuation of performance is not sufficient to result in an election.rather,there must be either detrimental reliance by the breaching party here an injury to the government as the result of the delay,see corbin ed.restatement second of contracts or a benefit to the party as a result of the delay here a benefit to osc,see mobil oil,at.
the supreme court decision in mobil,in which the court allowed a restitution remedy under a government contract,is ambiguous as to which standard applies.in that case the court concluded that t he government has not convinced us that the companies continued actions under the contracts amount to anything more than the urging of performance consequently the government waiver claim must come down to a claim that the companies received at least partial performance.id.at.internal citations omitted emphasis in original.the court concluded the plaintiff companies had not received partial performance from the government under the contracts after the breach.id.at.while the decision is clear that the receipt of partial performance by the plaintiff will bar restitution and the authorities cited make equally clear that detrimental reliance by the government would also be a bar it is unclear as to whether a plaintiff continued performance without the receipt of benefits or detrimental reliance would be sufficient to bar restitution.
here we need not decide which standard governs,because even the stricter election rule is satisfied.osc plainly continued to treat the assistance agreements as in place by deciding not to terminate the contracts or to file suit for restitution after the enactment of firrea.indeed,osc claim for restitution was not asserted until three years later.instead of electing to terminate the agreement after the enactment of firrea,osc on march,some seven months after firrea,agreed to a new capital plan with the office of thrift supervision ots,under which it once again agreed to comply with the net worth maintenance stipulations of the original contracts and to make payments to the thrift to bring it into compliance with the requirements of firrea see old stone ii.at ots approved the bank capital plan conditioned on osc agreement that it would maintain the bank capital position pursuant to the net worth maintenance stipulation.
the government detrimentally relied on osc conduct.if osc had elected to terminate the contract and seek restitution at the time of the enactment of firrea,the government could not have,and would not have,demanded that osc make subsequent contributions to the thrift pursuant to the new capital plan and net worth maintenance stipulations of the terminated contracts which resulted in the government liability for million in mitigation payments.and it is certain that the government would have seized the bank earlier,with the likely result that additional losses to the insurance fund would have been avoided there were also continued benefits to osc received under the earlier agreements with the ability to continue to operate the thrift the government willingness to defer enforcement of the obligation of osc to contribute additional capital pursuant to the nwms under the earlier agreements the of the thrift before despite its with firrea standards and continued federal deposit insurance 
the election doctrine is designed to avoid the very kind of moral hazard that would result here if the thrift could postpone repudiation of the contract for several years,bet that it could make the thrift profitable,but secure restitution if the thrift failed.our predecessor court,the court of claims,has recognized in the waiver context,that a s a general proposition,one side can not continue after a material beach by the other act as if the contract remains fully in force,run up damages,and then go suddenly to court.northern helex united states,
despite the clear applicability of the election doctrine,osc argues that a provision in the assistance agreements here bars the argument that osc election prevents it from claiming restitution.section of the rif assistance agreement,and section of the citizens assistance agreement,entitled rights and forbearances,provide 
the rights,powers,and remedies given to the parties by this agreement shall be in addition to all rights,powers,and remedies,given by any applicable statute or rule of law.any forbearance,failure,or delay by any party in exercising or partially exercising any such right,power,or remedy shall not preclude its further exercise.
at.in light of this provision,osc failure to promptly assert a breach of contract did not,of course,result in a waiver of its right to assert a breach at a later time and recover damages.see westfed,at holding plaintiff did not waive its right to assert breach by continuing to receive assistance payments from the government.but here the restitution remedy is not precluded by inaction forbearance,failure or delay in exercising the right to rather by osc taking an among inconsistent remedies by continuing to perform.the quoted provision does not restore a remedy forfeited by continued performance.in other words,the rights and forbearances clause of the rif and citizens agreements does not preclude the application of the common law election of remedies doctrine.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that osc initial contributions are not recoverable under a restitution theory.
nor are the initial contract payments of million recoverable under a reliance theory.
the purpose of reliance damages is to compensate the plaintiff for loss caused by reliance on the contract.restatement second of contracts b.we have previously upheld awards of reliance damages in winstar cases.see,westfed,at.we have also held that reliance damages can be recovered for losses of investments pursuant to the contract.see glendale,at.
the court of federal claims found that the breach caused the seizure of osb and the loss of osc investment.old stone ii.at defendant breach was the cause of plaintiff damages.id.at we think it highly unlikely that the regulators would have seized the bank in,absent the breach.id.osb problems would have been eased by the bank having had a capital cushion.
however,the court of federal claims did not explain how the refusal to recognize the regulatory capital as promised in the assistance the seizure when that regulatory capital had been replaced by the mitigation payments before the seizure occurred.on this critical question the court of federal claims opinion is unfortunately entirely silent.despite the absence of findings by the court of federal claims,osc urges that the causation finding is supportable on two the breach caused the shrinkage of the thrift and on the alternative and primary theory that the breach caused the depletion of the assets of the holding company,and that these events caused the seizure of the thrift and the loss of the osc investment.
but even assuming that firrea caused the seizure by putting in motion this chain of events,reliance damages are subject to two pertinent damages must have been both proximately caused by the breach,and foreseeable.hughes,at.
as we have repeatedly held,i n order to be recoverable as reliance damages,plaintiff loss must have been foreseeable to the party in breach at the time of contract formation.westfed,at quoting landmark,at see hadley baxendale eng.contract damages only recoverable if in contemplation of both parties at the time of contract formation see also restatement second of contracts damages are not recoverable for loss that the party in breach did not have reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach when the contract was made.emphasis added.
losses must also satisfy a closely related must be proximately caused by the breach.hughes,at see also controls semiconductor,cir noting that lost profits,to be reco
