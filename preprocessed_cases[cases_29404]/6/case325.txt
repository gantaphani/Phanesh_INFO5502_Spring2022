this appeal arises from the denial of class certification in a securities fraud class action.john malack purchased notes issued by american business financial services,american business,a subprime mortgage originator,and those notes were later rendered worthless during the subprime mortgage meltdown.he now seeks compensation from bdo seidman llp bdo,an accounting firm that assisted american business in allegedly defrauding him and other investors by providing american business clean audit opinions that were used to register the notes with the securities and exchange commission sec.malack filed a putative securities fraud class action against bdo based on b of the securities exchange act of and rule the district court denied class certification,holding that malack did not satisfy the predominance requirement of rule b because he did not establish a presumption of reliance under the theory malack now appeals the denial of class certification.
this case turns on the application vel non of the theory of reliance.without the presumption of reliance afforded by that theory,malack can not receive class certification.the theory validity is an issue of first impression for this court,and other courts of appeals are split over whether it should be recognized.we join the seventh circuit in rejecting the theory and will affirm the district court denial of class certification.
the district court had jurisdiction under and.this appeal reaches us under e and rule f.a district court decision on class certification is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.id.internal quotation marks omitted.w hether an incorrect legal standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
malack and other investors directly purchased notes from american business between october,and january.the notes promised to pay interest well above the prime rate without the involvement of underwriters or brokers,were,could only be cashed in after they matured,and had no market for resale.the notes were issued pursuant to american business and registration statements and prospectuses filed with the sec.bdo provided the audit opinions necessary to complete the filings with the sec.
on january,american business filed a chapter petition for reorganization.on may,that proceeding was converted to a chapter liquidation.malack and the other investors suffered substantial losses as a result.on february,malack filed a putative securities fraud class action against bdo,alleging that its audits of american business were deficient.according to malack,had bdo done its job properly,it would not have issued american business clean audit opinions.malack further alleges that without clean audit opinions,american business would not have been able to register the notes with the sec,the notes would not have been marketable,and malack and the other investors would not have purchased the notes.based on these allegations,malack asserted that bdo violated b of the act and rule.
malack sought class certification.the district court,after a thorough analysis of the possible approaches through which malack might have obtained a presumption of reasonable reliance based on the theory,denied his request,concluding that the proposed class did not satisfy the predominance requirement of rule malack timely petitioned for permission to appeal under rule f.we granted that petition and now must consider whether the district court erred in denying malack class certification.
malack challenges the district court predominance determination.
predominance tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation issues common to the class must predominate over individual issues because the nature of the evidence that will suffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or individual,a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.if proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment,then class certification is unsuitable.
in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,at internal citations omitted.accordingly,we examine the elements of malack claim through the prism of rule to determine whether the district court properly denied certifi cation of the class.id.at.
a b private damages action has six elements 
a material misrepresentation or omission 
scienter,a wrongful state of mind 
a connection with the purchase or sale of a security 
reliance,often referred to in cases involving public securities markets cases as transaction causation 
economic loss and 
loss causation,a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.
mccabe ernst young,llp,cir quoting dura,broudo,emphasis omitted.the district court denied class certification because malack was unable to show that the proposed class was entitled to a presumption of reasonable reliance,aes dow chem,cir explaining reasonable reliance.the reliance element requires a showing of a causal nexus between the misrepresentation and the plaintiff injury,as well as a demonstration that the plaintiff exercised the diligence that a reasonable person under all of the circumstances would have exercised to protect his own interests.id.proving reliance for individual class members can quickly become a cumbersome endeavor that overwhelms the questions of law or fact common to the proposed class.b,and could preclude class certification,see id.it is likely that for this reason,malack sought to invoke a presumption of reliance.
the supreme court has held that a presumption of reliance exists in two circumstances.the first means for establishing a presumption of reliance was set forth in affiliated ute citizens of utah united states.in that decision,the supreme court explained that positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery in cases involving primarily a failure to disclose material facts by defendants obligated to disclose such facts.id.at.all that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in making th e investment decision.id.at.
second,in basic levinson,the supreme court recognized the theory as a means for establishing a presumption of reasonable reliance in an efficient market 
the fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements the causal connection between the defendants fraud and the plaintiffs purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations.
id.at quoting peil speiser,cir.i n an efficient market,misinformation directly affects the stock prices at which the investor trades and thus,through the inflated or deflated price,causes injury even in the absence of direct reliance.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,r eliance may be presumed when a fraudulent misrepresentation or omission impairs the value of a security traded in an efficient market.id.
some courts of appeals have held that a presumption of reliance may be established through a third theory.compare,shores sklar,cir en banc setting forth the theory,with eckstein balcor film investors,cir rejecting the theory.malack seeks to rely on this theory to establish a presumption of reliance for the proposed class.
the theory posits that t he securities laws allow an investor to rely on the integrity of the market to the extent that the securities it offers to him for purchase are entitled to be in the market place.shores,at.a presumption of reliance is established where a plaintiff prove s that the defendants conspired to bring to market securities that were not entitled to be marketed.abell.potomac ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted,vacated on other grounds sub nom.fryar abell,thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation c ed explaining that a claim involves a fraudulent scheme depicting the existence of a market which in fact would not exist upon full and accurate disclosure.
if the plaintiff proves no more than that the securities would have been offered at a lower price or a higher rate,rather than that they would never have been issued or marketed,he can not recover th e theory is not that the plaintiff bought inferior securities,but that the securities he bought were fraudulently marketed.
shores,at.to be unmarketable,the securities must be so lacking in basic requirements that they would never have been approved by the issuing entity nor presented by the underwriters had any one of the participants in the scheme not acted with intent to defraud or in reckless disregard of whether the other defendants were perpetrating a fraud.id.at.to invoke the theory,a plaintiff must allege that the existence of the security in the marketplace resulted from the successful perpetration of a fraud on the investment community and that she purchased in reliance on the market.id.at.critical to the theory coherency is the assumption that it is reasonable for an investor to rely on a security availability on the market as an indication of its apparent genuineness.id.at.
un marketability,as envisioned by the shores court,is an elusive concept.ross bank south,cir en banc tjoflat,concurring.three rough categories of unmarketability have emerged legal,economic,and factual.the lines distinguishing one from the other are hazy.legal unmarketability asks if,absent fraud,a regulatory agency or the issuing municipality would have been required by law to prevent or forbid the issuance of the security.ockerman may zima,cir.economic unmarketability asks if no investor would buy the security because,assuming full disclosure,it is patently worthless.id.this approach focuses on hypothetical securities that could be issued at any combination of price and interest rate.ross,at tjoflat,concurring.c ould the securities,because of the enormous risk of nonpayment,have been brought onto the market at any combination of price and interest rate if the true risk of nonpayment had been known id.at.finally,factual unmarketability looks to the actual securities issued,and asks whether,in the absence of fraud,the securities would have been issued given the actual price and interest rate at which they were issued.id.at emphasis omitted.under this approach,a security is unmarketable if,but for the fraudulent scheme,some regulatory entity whether official or unofficial would not have allowed the security to come onto the market at its actual price and interest rate.id.at emphasis omitted 
malack asks us to embrace the legal unmarketability approach to the theory.no matter what approach is taken,however,the theory lacks a basis in any of the accepted grounds for creating a presumption.
presumptions typically serve to assist courts in managing circumstances in which direct proof,for one reason or another,is rendered difficult.basic,at citing louisell mueller,federal evidence.c onsiderations of fairness,public policy,and probability,as well as judicial economy,often underlie the creation of presumptions.basic,at united states dep t of justice landano.advisory committee note.another relevant concern in the creation of a presumption is whether it is consistent with congressional policy.basic,at.common sense also plays a role.id.at.courts may also create presumptions to correct an imbalance resulting from one party superior access to the proof,kenneth broun,george dix,edward imwinkelreid,kaye,robert mosteller roberts,mccormick on evidence john strong,ed,where social and economic policy incline the courts to favor one contention,or to avoid a factual impasse,id.generally,however,the most important consideration in the creation of presumptions is probability.most presumptions have come into existence primarily because judges have believed that proof of fact b renders the inference of the existence of fact a so probable that it is sensible and timesaving to assume the truth of fact a until the adversary disproves it.id.
the theory rests on the conjecture that a security availability on the market i s an indication of its apparent genuineness.shores,at.malack points to common sense and probability as support for this conjecture,but neither of these considerations bolsters the idea that securities on the market,by the mere virtue of their availability for purchase,are free from fraud.other considerations relevant to the creation of a presumption also counsel for rejection of the theory.
common sense,to the extent malack invokes it as support,calls for rejecting the proposition that a security availability on the market is an indication of its genuineness and is worthy of an investor reliance.for a security availability on the market to be an indication of its genuineness there must be some entity involved in the process of taking the security to market that acts as a bulwark against fraud.yet the entities most commonly involved in bringing a security to market do not imbue the security with any guarantee against fraud.
the security promoter and other entities involved in the issuance,such as the underwriter,the auditor,and legal very entities often charged with be reasonably relied upon to prevent fraud.ross,at tjoflat,concurring.
all of the parties involved in an issuance have a significant in marketing the securities at a price greater than their true value.the and the issuer if a separate entity have an obvious interest in marketing the securities regardless of their true fair market value.likewise,the legal counsel and underwriter,who are often retained under a contingency fee contract,are interested in marketing the securities at an inflated price.the underwriter in particular,who,like an insurer,can spread the risk of loss among many stock or bond subscriptions,has a reduced incentive to investigate thoroughly the true value of the securities it underwrites.
id.at.if we were to credit the theory based on the entities involved in the issuance we would have to believe that an initial investor may reasonably rely on clearly perhaps dishonest parties to make decisions that are at least burdensome and at most economically irrational.id such a belief runs counter to common sense.
the sec likewise can not be reasonably relied upon to prevent fraud because it does not conduct merit regulation.rather,it seeks to confirm that the issuer adequately disclosed information pertaining to the security 
the sec does not review the merits of the registration statement and the offering.i n reviewing act registration statements,as is the case with sec review of filings generally,the focus is on the adequacy and clarity of the disclosure.specifically,the sec will consider whether the applicable disclosure items are explained in sufficient detail and with sufficient clarity.in addition to the review of the adequacy of the disclosures,the sec will examine clarity and also will conduct a plain english review of those portions of the registration statement that are subject to the sec plain english disclosure requirements.
thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation.the sec does not read all of the publicly available information about an offering and then determine the legitimate price for the security n or does it endorse any of the documents involved in the issuance of securities.joseph wiles,cir internal citation omitted 
disclosure of adverse information may lower the price of a security,but it will not prevent that security from going to market 
the existence of a security does not depend on,or warrant,the adequacy of disclosure.many a security is on the market even though the issuer or some third party made incomplete disclosures.federal securities law does not include merit regulation.full disclosure of adverse information may lower the price,but it does not exclude the security from the market.securities of bankrupt corporations trade freely some markets specialize in penny stocks.thus the linchpin of disclosing bad information keeps securities off the market,entitling investors to rely on the presence of the securities just as they would rely on statements in a simply false.
eckstein,at internal citations omitted note,the theory,harv,a ny argument about an expectation fostered by sec regulation is severely undermined by the fact that the sec does not vouch for either the substantive value of any issue or the veracity of the representations by any issuer.in short,the fil ing of a misleading document with the sec does not lend any more credibility or veracity to the document than if it had simply been given to investors.joseph,at.
malack all but outright concedes that there is no common sense justification for the proposition that a security presence on the market is an indication of its genuineness upon which an investor may reasonably rely.in his brief,he conceded that the sec does not conduct merit regulation.at oral argument,he agreed that even if bdo had not committed the alleged fraud,the notes still would have passed sec review and would have made it to market 
the court what if bdo had said in all candor,well,the company here,american business,is using a discount rate that may be lower than what the market among similar strips that are being sold across this country would indicate.and in fact,they may be understating their default rate in comparison to similarly situated issues.but having said that,these are the facts which a buyer should be aware of.and this is,indeed,a risky investment which pays a high interest rate.
the court the sec would said accepted,go ahead and sell.
malack counsel certainly,if that disclosure had been provided in the prospectus in the registration statement.
oral argument tr,june.if the american business notes would have gone to market with or without bdo allegedly fraudulent audit,then there is no common sense connection between bdo audit and malack ability to purchase the notes.thus,there is no reason to view the notes presence on the market as being indicative of their genuineness.
malack vague invocation of probability also fails to lend any support to the assertion that a security availability on the market is an indication of its genuineness.unlike the theory,which was supported by empirical studies and economic theory,see basic,at,the theory has the support of neither moreover,malack does not articulate any reason why probability supports his view.if his reliance on probability is based on the idea that almost all marketed securities are,in fact,legally marketable,and therefore we should presume that anything offered on the market has not been stained by fraud,then malack is advocating for a kind of investor insurance that eliminates the need for proving reliance in any securities fraud case.any investor who purchases any security could point to the security availability on the market to satisfy the reasonable reliance element of a b claim.such insurance expand s the sec role beyond its intended or realistic scope.joseph,at.
the establishment of investor insurance is contrary to the goals of securities laws.see basic,at white,concurring in part and dissenting in part fener operating eng rs const.indus.miscellaneous pension fund local,cir robbins koger,cir ockerman,at grigsby cmi,cir list fashion park,cir.t he securities laws enacted by congress in the were not intended to create a scheme of investors insurance or to regulate directly the underlying merits of various investments.compared to the legislation of the late and,the federal securities laws leave a great many potential harms in the sense of economic losses by individual investors unremedied.shores,at randall,dissenting.
because malack has not articulated any justification for his argument that probability supports the theory,and because the most obvious possible justification is flawed,we are comfortable stating that the theory is not supported by probability and decline to further speculate on the issue.
other considerations relevant to whether a presumption should be created similarly point toward rejecting the theory.first,the theory does not serve the securities laws goal of informing investors via disclosures.in affiliated ute,the supreme court described the act and its companion legislative enactments including the securities act of as embracing a fundamental purpose to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus to achieve a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.id.quoting affiliated ute,at santa fe,green,noting that the supreme court has repeatedly described the fundamental purpose of the securities exchange act as implementing a philosophy of full disclosure sec zandford,gustafson alloyd,inc,the primary innovation of the act was the creation of federal the most part,registration and disclosure connection with public offerings.
t he federal securities laws are intended to put investors into a position from which they can help themselves by relying upon disclosures that others are obligated to make.shores,at randall,dissenting.the theory,contrary to this goal,allows monetary recovery for those who refuse to look out for themselves.id.investors need not examine a disclosure because,no matter what,the security presence on the market would be enough to satisfy the reasonable reliance element of a b claim.see id.indeed,an investor stands to lose nothing by blindly purchasing securities without examining any disclosure because the damages award for a claim would be the same as the measure of damages for a rule claim based on actual reliance 
t he only workable measure of damages in a shores action would be the full price paid by the plaintiff for the new issue.that being so,a shores award would simply be the plaintiff expenses caused by the same measure of damages for a standard rule recovery based upon actual reliance,see loss,fundamentals of securities regulation ed normally means difference between price paid and value of securities.thus,under shores,any incentive to read disclosures essentially disappears since plaintiffs would receive the full purchase price for their securities without having to read disclosure information.
ross,at tjoflat,concurring.moreover,an investor might rationally seek to avoid reading disclosures in order to preserve a possible claim under shores.id.at.the less an investor knows about the security,aside from the fact that it is on the market,the less likely it is that she will learn of information that would sever the link between the alleged fraud and her decision to purchase the security.basic,at explaining how presumption may be rebutted.discouraging investors from examining disclosures accompanying securities runs contrary to congress goal of empowering investors with the information they need to make educated,prudent investment decisions.
malack argues that the theory would serve congress goals of promoting honesty and fair dealings in the securities markets.shores,at see alba conte herbert newberg,newberg on class actions ed t he federal securities laws were designed to deter future wrongdoing in the securities field and promote the integrity of the securities market,and the class action has been recognized as an effective means to realize these goals.promoting honesty and fair dealings is certainly an important concern,but it is also an exceedingly abstract concern.if we were guided mainly by the promotion of free and honest securities markets,then we would seek to expand b liability whenever possible to prevent fraud.but that has not been the approach taken by the federal courts.the securities laws are not a catchall for any fraudulent activity committed in connection with a securities offering.for example,the supreme court in central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,held that a private plaintiff may not maintain an aiding and abetting suit under b.id.at.it did so over a dissent that cited the exchange act goal of
