california has a pair of holiday statutes that essentially state that whenever a legal or contractual act is required to be performed on a holiday,the act may be performed on the next business day without any adverse consequence.the question in this appeal is whether these state holiday statutes apply to a national bank credit card payment due dates.they do not.this is because these state laws are preempted by a federal law stating that a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning the terms of credit these terms include the schedule for repayment of principal and interest and the payments due.d iv see et,national bank act.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment rejecting plaintiffs lawsuit because it is preempted.

discussion 
a demurrer is an appropriate vehicle to secure a dismissal of a state law action based on federal law preemption.ball,supra,th at,d.
principles of preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,federal law can preempt state law in one of three ways expressly by actually conflicting with state law or by exclusively occupying a legislative field.smith wells fargo bank,th,d smith hood santa barbara bank trust th,d hood.
federal regulations may preempt state law just as fully as federal statutes.hood,supra,th at,d,quoting smith,supra,th at,fn,d.
there is a general presumption against federal preemption of a state traditional police powers,unless the state regulates in an area where there has been a significant federal presence.united states locke,d hood,supra,th at,d smith,supra,th at,d.the area of banking regulation has posed some issues in this regard.this is because the states traditional police powers include the regulation of banking smith,supra,th at,d hood,supra,th at,d banking has been found to be an area traditionally subject to dual federal and state control national state bank,elizabeth,long cir,and banking has been deemed an area where there has been a significant federal presence bank of america city county of san francisco cir,city county.
a sorting out of these issues of preemption involving the area of banking regulation has occurred in three respects.the first is whether the bank at issue is a national bank.city county,supra,at state regulation is permissible when it does not prevent or significantly interfere with a national bank exercise of its powers see,barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d federal statute authorizing national banks to sell insurance in small towns preempted a conflicting state law that prohibited such sales.
the second is whether the claims at issue involve state laws that target banks or seek to regulate banking,or whether the state laws are of general application.hood,supra,th at,d see watters wachovia bank,d,watters federally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or the general purposes of the national bank act.
and the third,drawing from these two,is the critical one,encapsulating the preemption principle we apply here regardless of the nature of the state law claim alleged rose chase bank usa,cir,rose,the central inquiry regarding federal preemption in the banking realm is whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the state law claim constitute s a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law preempts.hood,supra,th at,d smith,supra,th at,d rose,supra at see cipollone liggett group,d.
federal law and preemption 
the business activities of national banks are controlled by the national bank act nba,et,and regulations promulgated thereunder by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ.watters,supra,at.at,d at.as the agency charged by congress with supervision of the nba,occ oversees the operations of national banks and their interactions with customers.ibid.
in,the occ amended part of its regulations to add provisions clarifying the applicability of state law to national banks operations.the provisions concerning preemption identify the types of state laws that are preempted,as well as the types of state laws that generally are not preempted,with respect to national banks lending,and other operations.hood,supra,th at,d,see part,subpart,et 
one of these provisions,section,authorizing estate lending by national banks,is the applicable occ regulation here.section d specifies the a pplicability of state law in this context and provides as pertinent

a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning 
iv the terms of credit,including the schedule for repayment of principal and interest,amortization of loans,balance,payments due,minimum payments italics added.
the holiday statutes of civil code sections and provide that when a legal or contractual act falls due on a statutorily defined holiday,the act may be performed on the next business day without any adverse consequence.as the trial court correctly found,b y changing when a payment is due in such circumstances,these state statutes affect the schedule for repayment of principal and interest and we add,affect the payments due set by a national bank.such interference is directly contrary to section,subdivision d which provides that a national bank may set the schedule for repayment on estate loans and set the payments due without regard to state law limitations.
as noted,the central inquiry regarding federal preemption here is whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the state law claim constitute s a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law preempts.hood,supra,th at,d smith,supra,th at,d rose,supra,at.the legal duty underlying the state law claim of the holiday statutes specifies that if the due date for an act falls on a weekend or other statutorily defined holiday,the act is due on the next business day.this duty constitutes a requirement of the sort that federal law expressly preempts in the context here of national banks engaging in estate lending state law limitations concerning the terms of credit,including the schedule of repayment or the payments due.d iv.
plaintiffs themselves lend support to this view of the central inquiry,albeit in the context of making other arguments.in their briefs on appeal,plaintiffs state that the duty to be performed that is the subject of this lawsuit is a contractual duty to make payment at
