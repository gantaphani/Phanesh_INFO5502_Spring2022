in these coordinated class actions challenging a lender collection practices,the trial court denied all relief to,and eventually entered dismissals with prejudice against,all class members against whom the lender had previously secured judgments in separate collection actions.the chief ground on which this ruling is challenged is that the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code sections et sequitur,empowered the trial court to disregard the judgments,or even grant affirmative relief from them,on a basis.we hold that the act can not be so understood.since no other ground of relief is urged,we will affirm the orders and judgment from which the appeal is taken.we will deny the related writ petition as moot.
background 
this matter was previously before this court in fireside bank superior court,review granted and reversed in part by fireside bank superior court cal th.the background of the case is suitably summarized in the supreme court decision.fireside bank superior court,supra,cal th at.it is enough here to observe that sandra gonzalez purchased a van under a conditional sales contract that was assigned by the dealer to fireside bank fireside.when she fell into arrears,fireside repossessed the van and sent her a notice purporting to state the conditions on which she could cure the default and reinstate the contract.the notice,however,overstated the amount due by some,representing a credit to which she was entitled for unearned finance charges.when gonzalez failed to cure,fireside sold the van and sued her for the deficiency.she answered and,asserting that by serving the defective redemption notice,fireside had violated the motor vehicle sales and finance act act,that this precluded any recovery of deficiencies and that by proceeding to collect deficiencies despite this violation fireside had engaged in an unlawful business practice.ibid.
the trial court granted gonzalez motion for judgment on the pleadings as against fireside complaint.it did so,however,at the same time that it granted her motion to certify her as a class action,and thus before any notice had been given to the class.the supreme court directed us to reverse the pleadings order as a violation of the rule against intervention.id.at.however it found no error in the order certifying the class.id.at.
meanwhile fireside had brought a collection action in santa cruz county against patricia lind,who in october filed a class action against fireside in that county on claims similar to those of gonzalez.the two matters were coordinated in santa clara county.
as pleaded in gonzalez second amended,the class claims included several allusions to fireside having already obtained judgments against some members of the class.a list of q uestions of law and fact of common and general interest to the class included w hether fireside or its agents obtained deficiency judgments from proposed class members based on defective notices and whether fireside collected or attempted to collect on such judgments,when it had no legal right to obtain such judgments or attempt to collect on them.a list of unlawful collection practices included collection lawsuits and invalid judgments.it was alleged that in the course of filing deficiency lawsuits,fireside filed affidavits averring compliance with,which affidavits were false due to fireside defective notices.fireside was alleged to have accumulated ill gotten gains by,among other things,collecting on deficiency judgments invalidly obtained.and the relief prayed for included r estitution or damages paid to class members based on all money they paid on invalid deficiency judgments obtained by fireside,together with interest profits thereon,d isgorgement of all profits collected on invalid deficiency judgments,and a n injunction requiring fireside to vacate all judgments entered against class members and dismiss all pending lawsuits.
the in lind included allegations resembling those above.it further asserted that fireside unlawful business conduct included trick ing courts into entering judgments against consumers on claims which have no merit.and it prayed for,among other things,an order requiring fireside to seek an order from each court in which it has obtained a judgment setting aside that judgment.
on december,fireside brought motions to strike all of these allegations from the two insofar as they seek to overturn or bar fireside from enforcing deficiency judgments it has previously obtained.the grounds for the motion were stated as follows these deficiency judgments operate as res judicata and collateral estoppel,barring gonzalez claims on behalf of the judgment debtors in this action.gonzalez,a stranger to those transactions and prior lawsuits,can not now collaterally attack those judgments and obtain relief for the persons bound by them.
in response to these arguments,contended that res judicata was inapplicable because these matters did not involve the same cause of action as any previously adjudicated matter,and that collateral estoppel could not justify the requested order because that doctrine required fireside to demonstrate that the issues it sought to preclude had been actually litigated in a prior matter.implicitly conceded that the court lacked the power to declare the judgments void,but argued that the ucl empowered it to order fireside to restore sums it had collected from judgment debtors,and ask the rendering courts to set the judgments aside.
the trial court granted the motions,directing in its pretrial order that the challenged language be stricken from the two.filed amended reflecting the stricken text in strikeout typeface.
two members of the gonzalez class,cathy moore and cristian lopez,moved for leave to intervene in the action and for entry of a judgment against them.the stated rationale for the motion was that the order striking references to the judgments had effectively disposed of their claims and that the orders sought were necessary to facilitate appellate review.fireside attacked these requests as an attempt to manufacture an appeal where none can exist,arguing that the order was not appealable because the claims of other class members remained unresolved,and that the relief sought would offend various other rules.in their reply memorandum the moving urged the court to designate a subclass of affected class members.
in an order styled order,the court denied the request for intervention on the grounds that the movants had failed to submit a proposed pleading,as is generally required for permissive intervention,and had made no attempt to establish the kind of stake required for mandatory intervention.the court also concluded that the movants lacked standing to intervene on behalf of a subclass that had not been formally designated,and that the request to designate a subclass should have been made in the original moving papers,not raised for the first time in a reply memorandum.the court rejected the request for entry of a judgment on the ground that the movants had not addressed concerns about notice,including notice to the class,and no authority appeared for such an order under the circumstances shown.
at the hearing leading to this order,class counsel observed that the court tentative denial had been expressly made without prejudice and confirmed the court willingness to entertain a further motion seeking to cure the perceived procedural defects.moore and lopez then brought a second motion to intervene,including a motion to designate a subclass and appoint them its representatives.it was accompanied by a proposed in intervention.fireside opposed the motion on the ground,among others,that intervention was an inappropriate means to acquire appellate standing or jurisdiction and that the designation of a subclass would unduly complicate the case.the court denied the motion,stating that the movants interests were adequately represented by sandra gonzalez and that the designation of a subclass could lead to more problems and that it is premature under the rules pertaining to class actions.
filed timely notices or amended notices of appeal as to the original order granting the motion to strike and succeeding orders.thereafter the court approved a settlement of the class action excluding judgment debtors from any relief,and ultimately entered a judgment dismissing their claims with prejudice.filed a timely amended notice of appeal referring to these orders.
appellate jurisdiction 
fireside contended in its original brief that the orders from which the appeal was taken were not appealable.this contention may have been colorable prior to the entry of a judgment dismissing all claims by judgment debtors,but it can hardly be maintained now.we have no doubt that the orders just described amount to an appealable adjudication of the rights of judgment debtor members of the claimant class in gonzalez.the situation is different in lind.there,no class had yet been certified when the original order was made striking the allegations seeking relief from judgments.the court eventually certified a class explicitly excluding persons against whom fireside obtained a judgment prior to the date of this order.since this ruling has not been challenged,and the judgment ultimately entered does not purport to dispose of any of the judgment debtors in lind,we discern no basis for appellate jurisdiction as to them.insofar as their protective writ petitions might give us jurisdiction to consider their arguments on appeal,we will conclude,for reasons that will become apparent,that they are not entitled to relief.
as far as we can tell,concerns about appellate jurisdiction were the only reason for the motions seeking to designate a subclass of judgment debtors and to permit the intervention of individual class members.since those concerns seem to have been obviated by the entry of a final judgment,the disposition of those motions would appear to be moot.we will therefore dismiss the appeal insofar as it is taken from those orders.
order striking references to judgments 
the chief remaining question is whether the trial court properly granted fireside motion to strike all allegations specifically seeking relief on behalf of persons against whom fireside had obtained judgments.it must be acknowledged that the class setting of the order greatly complicates the required legal analysis.ordinarily a defense of res judicata or collateral estoppel claim or issue preclusion must be affirmatively raised,and the conditions for its operation demonstrated,by the party asserting,fireside.nor are these conditions necessarily easy to establish.in the case of claim preclusion,it must appear that the judgment adjudicated the same cause of action as is asserted in the second matter.ferraro camarlinghi th.in the case of issue preclusion,it must appear that the first matter presented some issue that is necessary to the later claim or defense,and that the issue was actually litigated and necessarily decided.id.at.ordinarily these matters will not appear on the face of the pleading,but they may be ascertainable from materials subject to judicial notice.thus if fireside had obtained a judgment against gonzalez,it might have been able to raise that judgment as a defense at the pleading stage by seeking judicial notice of relevant judicial records.but fireside made no attempt to do this here it simply asserted that all of the judgment debtor class members claims were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel,without troubling to establish or even acknowledge the conditions for operation of those doctrines.
alluded to this weakness in fireside motion when they observed that fireside had not shown that the present matter involved the same cause of action as any of the collection matters or that any dispositive issue was actually litigated in those matters.but the themselves strongly suggested that at least the latter condition was present with respect to the issue whether fireside had complied with.that is,it was alleged in the gonzalez that in the course of filing deficiency lawsuits,fireside had filed affidavits averring compliance with,which affidavits were false due to fireside defective notices.this strongly implies,if it does not affirmatively show,that in at least some cases the question of compliance with was actually tendered in the collection matter,and was determined adversely to the class member in question.it might of course be open to individual members to show otherwise,but in this form the pleading raised a strong suggestion,at least,that critical issues were vulnerable to an assertion of issue preclusion.
the question then becomes whether had pled,or could plead,some basis on which to avoid the usual effect of the earlier judgments.as we have already acknowledged,individual members might be able to show that the conditions for preclusion were lacking.moreover,it would be open to individual members to attack the prior judgments on various grounds.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.attack on judgment in the trial court,et sequitur.but no attempt was made to do this below.nor did fireside attempt to show,on a basis,that no such attempts could succeed.instead the issue was joined over one question whether the class members were entitled to relief en masse on the theory that the ucl rendered the judgments essentially irrelevant.their is also their central argument on as follows the ucl empowers trial courts to make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.bus.fireside secured the judgments in question by means of unfair competition,violations of the act.any sums collected on the judgments were therefore also the products of unfair competition.therefore the court has the power to restore such sums to plaintiffs despite the judgments in fireside favor,and to make any orders needed to accomplish that result.
thus challenge the premise,which they attribute to fireside,that res judicata and collateral estoppel trump the broad remedial power authorized by the legislature in the ucl.they cite general principles of statutory construction and specific statements in stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,that w hen the legislature has desired to limit ucl remedies,it has expressly provide citation for such limitation,and that courts are not authorized to insert qualifying provisions not included,and may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language.the legislature,note,has not expressly declared that res judicata or collateral estoppel limit the trial court power to order relief pursuant to.accordingly,they say,no such limitation can be imposed.to conclude otherwise would create a safe harbor from ucl liability,which only the legislature can do.
this argument appears to rest on the idea that the law of judgments can only impede a claim under the ucl to the extent the legislature has affirmatively manifested an intent that it do so.the broader premise would seem to be that when the legislature grants broad remedial powers to a court,it intends that they be exercised free of the constraints of basic rules of procedure except as those rules have been expressly incorporated in the enabling statute.there is no obvious reason that such a principle should stop at the law of judgments.other procedural bars to relief,such as the statute of limitations,would seem susceptible to the same logic.indeed,if argument is carried to its logical conclusion,once an unfair business practice is shown,no defense would be recognized except as expressly incorporated in the ucl.
one of the fundamental rules of statutory construction is that a law should not be applied in a manner producing absurd results,because the legislature is presumed not to intend such results.the wholesale abrogation of our laws of procedure is not a result to be lightly imputed to the legislature.nor does argument follow,as they suggest it does,from the rule favoring the literal application of statutory language.that rule does not require that a statute be viewed as a legal island,entire of itself.every statute mus
