jamie edelkind was convicted of four counts of bank fraud directed against federally insured banks,and he now appeals.the story can be briefly told,reserving details for our discussion of specific issues raised on appeal.so far as those issues concern sufficiency of the evidence,we set forth the facts assuming that the jury resolved credibility disputes and drew inferences in the government favor.united states,cir.
facing bankruptcy in the summer of,edelkind concocted a false resume for his wife linda,forging documents to make her appear to be a executive in a sham technology company he called apostille,using the forged documents,edelkind convinced a lender,america moneyline moneyline,to extend a mortgage of in linda name in order to purchase the former honey fitz mansion in hull,massachusetts.
edelkind then repeatedly refinanced the hull property for larger and larger amounts,each time paying down outstanding previous loans and retaining the surplus or cash out amount.he persuaded lenders to extend the loans on the basis of false representations and fabricated documents,including tax forms,showing linda to be earning from to over million per year.specifically 
in september,edelkind refinanced the hull property by securing a million mortgage in linda name from south shore savings bank south shore,a federally insured lender.he retained after paying down the moneyline loan.
in spring,edelkind used the property as collateral to obtain several home equity loans in linda name,including a line of credit from wells fargo,a federally insured bank.
in march,edelkind refinanced the hull property again,this time with a million mortgage in linda name from washington mutual bank washington mutual,another federally insured bank.he retained after paying off south shore,wells fargo,and other lenders.
in august,representing that linda income was million a year,edelkind obtained a million loan through fairmont funding fairmont,a insured mortgage broker,which funded the loan with the approval of aurora loan services aurora,itself a subsidiary of lehman brothers,a federally insured bank.lehman brothers later purchased the loan.edelkind used the proceeds to pay off the washington mutual loan and an additional that had been run up on the wells fargo credit line,leaving him with in cash surplus.
remarkably,the last of these loans was secured after the government in march had filed a information charging edelkind with bank fraud in connection with the loans from south shore,wells fargo,and washington mutual.in early november,linda and her children fled to norway.approximately was wired to norway and withdrawn from atms in massachusetts and norway between august and december.
in february,the government filed a superseding information adding a fourth count directed to the fairmont transaction and including criminal forfeiture allegations under a c and c west supp subsequently amended.after a jury trial later that month,the district court entered a judgment of conviction on each of the four counts.in june,the court forfeited the hull property and two bank checks deemed to be funds derived from the offenses.in july,edelkind was sentenced to months in prison and ordered to pay restitution.
edelkind first claim on appeal is that no proper verdict of conviction was ever returned by the jury.instead of having the jury return a written verdict of guilty or not guilty on each count,the district judge submitted to the jury a form whose first question asked the jury to say yes or no whether they unanimously find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that jamie edelkind knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme to defraud south shore.the form then asked the same question as to wells fargo,washington mutual,and fairmont,respectively.
the jury returned a written verdict of yes on all four counts.the judge then asked the foreperson,as i read your verdict,your answer,whether you find the defendant guilty as to count,is yes on count is yes on count is yes and count is yes.am i correct the foreperson responded,yes.defense counsel declined the judge offer to poll the jury and also did not inquire whether the jury intended its verdict to be one of guilty on each count.
although we have not adopted a flat rule against special interrogatories in criminal cases,they pose special dangers.see,united states spock,cir progression of special questions can exert judicial pressure on jury.they also sometimes offer benefits,notably in very complex criminal cases,where they can reduce risk of juror confusion.see,united states palmeri,cir.the present appeal better illustrates the dangers than the benefits.
edelkind broadest claim is that no guilty verdict was delivered by the jury on any of the counts.the form did not in terms ask whether edelkind was guilty,and his appellate counsel suggests that the foreperson response when questioned by the trial judge was ambiguous.counsel posits that the foreperson might have meant only that the yes lines had been that the jury had intended to find edelkind guilty of the offenses specified in the indictment.
nothing in the rules requires a written verdict at all.see.here,there was a written verdict which,if ambiguous,was clarified when the judge asked whether the defendant has been found guilty on each count.the lack of any objection when the foreperson answered and the judge proceeded to enter a judgment of conviction shows that trial counsel had no doubt that the jury had equated its verdict with guilt.there was no error,plain or otherwise,in treating the verdict as one of guilty on each count.
a narrower version of the argument,also made on appeal,has more bite.edelkind points out that the phrasing of the verdict form itself omitted,for each count,an element of the statutory,that the defrauded institution be one that was federally insured.this is itself an example of the problems with using detailed verdict forms rather than simply asking whether the defendant was guilty of the offense charged.
nevertheless,we conclude that there was no prejudicial error in the omission of the federally insured requirement from the verdict form.special verdicts are not required in criminal cases,and,when they are used,there is no automatic requirement that a special verdict form include every element of the offense so long as the jury is instructed as to all elements.see,united states stonefish,cir.here the jury was specifically instructed that they must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of each of the four elements of the offense,including as one of the four elements that the financial institution in question was federally insured.
the defendant next argument is that the verdict form and the jury instructions charged him with defrauding fairmont and not with defrauding lehman brothers,and that he could not properly be convicted of defrauding fairmont,which was not a federally insured institution.the district court initial jury instruction which was given orally but later provided to the jury in written form described count as charging edelkind with executing a scheme to defraud upon fairmont funding,ltd,which is a financial institution.the special verdict form submitted to the jury asked,as to count,whether the government had proved 
a scheme to defraud fairmont funding,ltd in connection with a loan originated by fairmont funding,ltd,and subsequently assigned to lehman brothers bank,fsb.
just before the court read the jury instructions and provided the jury with the special verdict form,edelkind filed a motion for judgment of acquittal arguing that count four is entirely dependant on fairmont funding and the government has failed to prove federal jurisdiction because fairmont is not a financial institution under.the basis for defense counsel motion was that edelkind had to know that a financial institution would be the ultimate victim of his fraud.the district judge rightly found this position to be at odds with brandon,at,and rejected the motion for acquittal.
after the instructions were read to the jury,defense counsel orally objected to them and to the verdict form on the ground that fairmont was not a financial institution,and reiterated his position that edelkind needed to know that a financial institution would be injured.the court then provided a curative instruction stating that fairmont is not a financial institution but lehman brothers,to which it sold the note,is.since the court had already told the jury that a financial institution had to be defrauded or deprived of money by fraud the jury was informed that it could not convict on the theory that the defendant had defrauded fairmont alone.
it is quite true that the curative instruction came late in the day and apparently edelkind counsel did not ask for a transcript page reflecting it to accompany the original written instructions sent into the jury room but the curative instruction was virtually the last instruction that the jury heard before retiring.nor was defense counsel entitled to have the jury ignore the fraud upon fairmont on the government theory of the case,false representations to it were the instrument by which money was secured from lehman brothers.
the question then becomes whether the jury was adequately advised that it needed to find fraud on lehman brothers.in this respect both the verdict form and the instructions were deficient.the verdict form made only passing mention of lehman brothers as having acquired the loan.while the cured instructions generally required a finding that a financial institution had been defrauded and that lehman brothers was a financial institution,the instructions failed to specifically identify lehman brothers as allegedly defrauded.
edelkind did not request revision of the verdict form or an instruction that,in order to convict on count,the jury had to find that lehman brothers was defrauded.indeed,edelkind counsel objected unsuccessfully to any mention of lehman brothers in the supplemental instruction.counsel had good reason to direct attention away from lehman brothers but edelkind was surely on notice that the government own theory of the case was that lehman brothers had been the victim of the fraud albeit indirectly because the fraud on fairmont had operated to deprive lehman brothers of its money 
under these circumstances,we conclude that edelkind failure to object to the instruction and verdict form as omitting lehman brothers makes those errors reviewable only for plain error.b united states newton,cir.edelkind says that trial counsel had a duty to object only to mistakes inimical to his client interest,not to ones that would undermine any verdict against his client.the potential of such errors to undermine the verdict is why an objection is required at the an excuse for failing to make a timely objection.
edelkind also says that the errors were structural,requiring reversal without regard to prejudice.structural errors comprise a small category of mistakes so identified by the supreme court,but generally exclude erroneous jury instructions despite the fact that they preclud e the jury from making a finding on the actual element of the offense.see neder united states,d collecting examples.the error in neder omission of an element of the offense from the not deemed structural mere lack of clarity is clearly a lesser error and not structural.
to establish plain error,edelkind must show error,plainness,prejudice,and an outcome that is a miscarriage of justice or akin to it.united states olano,d.the flaws in the initial instructions and verdict form were error and only partly corrected as to the former we will assume that any remaining error was plain.the problems for edelkind are to show prejudice and miscarriage of justice.
the banking institutions defrauded in the first three counts were federally insured.as to count,the evidence discussed below amply permitted a reasonable jury to find that lehman brothers was defrauded.therefore edelkind can not show that the mistakes probably altered the outcome or undermine our confidence in the verdict,united states dominguez benitez,d olano,at,let alone constitute a miscarriage of justice.
turning to the sufficiency of the evidence,edelkind attack on this ground is directed only to count.the government questions whether his motion for a judgment of acquittal in the district court preserved all of the claims he now makes under this head.because we find that the evidence was sufficient in each of the aspects raised,we bypass the waiver issue which poses difficulties of its own.
section,as already noted,makes criminal the knowing execution of a scheme to defraud a federally insured bank.see note,above.neither fairmont nor aurora was federally insured.edelkind says that there is no proof that lehman brothers,although federally insured,was the intended or direct victim of his scheme to defraud,and therefore the scheme can not have been one to defraud a financial institution as defined by congress.
the statute says that the scheme to defraud a protected financial institution must be knowingly executed.in brandon,at,this court held that the government does not have to show that the defendant knew which particular bank might be injured or that it was federally insured.id.at.the statute gives fair warning that bank fraud is unlawful one who defrauds a bank simply assumes the risk that the victim is federally insured.id.
the greater difficulty,and the main focus of edelkind objection,concerns whether lehman brothers was in fact defrauded.edelkind secured the count loan from fairmont,which was not federally insured.but the government offered evidence that fairmont did no more than table fund the loan,that is,it agreed to make the loan only if another lender first agreed to purchase the loan thereafter.the other lender,on the government theory,was lehman brothers.
edelkind argues on appeal that lehman brothers was not the victim of his scheme to defraud because his fraudulent statements about his wife credentials and earnings never reached lehman brothers he says the misrepresentations only reached aurora,lehman brothers insured subsidiary.so,edelkind says,he never defrauded lehman brothers as section requires.
neither the statute nor the case law fully instructs just how tight a factual nexus is required to allow a jury to decide that a scheme,formally aimed at one uninsured company,operates in substance to defraud another insured entity with whom the defendant has not dealt directly.in our view the statute does apply where the federally insured institution takes part in an integrated transaction and is thereby injured by the defendant,who intended to defraud another party to the transaction.scienter exists,the causal connection is sufficient,and under brandon the defendant can not escape liability by virtue of his ignorance of the overall arrangement.
here,the government offered evidence that lehman brothers forms and guidelines were used by fairmont and aurora in table funding the loan,that a lehman brothers official not just its subsidiary aurora signed off on the loan before fairmont made it,and that fairmont transferred the loan to lehman to a month after the closing between edelkind and fairmont.thus the formally made by from the outset part of an integrated transaction,the first step of which was dependent on approval by lehman brothers,and the second step of which was a transfer of the mortgage to lehman brothers itself.
given these intent to defraud,the integrated transaction,and the financial injury to which lehman brothers was jury was entitled to find that edelkind defrauded lehman brothers,a federally insured bank the situation would be quite different,and liability might well be doubtful,if the involvement of the federally insured entity was not contemplated at the outset and came about later from a separate transaction,for example,by the happenstance of an insured bank purchasing an earlier loan because of an earlier,independent fraud.we leave such for a case that poses the issue.
we turn now to an ancillary order of forfeiture following the jury verdict.in this criminal proceeding,the government sought forfeiture,pursuant to a c and c,of the hull property used in the scheme and of in proceeds traceable to the final loan.edelkind argues that the two forfeiture statutes invoked by the government do not allo
