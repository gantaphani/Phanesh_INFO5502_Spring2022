our code of civil procedure provides a number of ways to serve process on a corporation doing business in the state.the most common method is by service on the corporation designated agent for service of process.code civ,subd.a.otherwise,a corporation may be served by personally delivering a summons and complaint to those corporate officers,managers and employees identified in section,subdivision b,or by delivering process to someone in charge of the office of one of the individuals identified in section,subdivision b and then mailing the individual a copy of the summons and complaint.
here,the plaintiff used none of the methods prescribed in the code of civil procedure for service of process on a corporation.rather,the plaintiff simply left a summons and complaint with someone who was in charge of a branch office of the defendant corporation and then mailed the corporation,rather than any individual officer or manager,a copy of the summons and complaint.although service was defective,the plaintiff nonetheless obtained a default against the corporation and a default judgment.
because service on the corporation was defective,the trial court properly granted the corporation motion to set aside the default and default judgment.accordingly,we affirm its order doing so.
