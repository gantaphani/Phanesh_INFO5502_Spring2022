relying upon our decision in kruger wells fargo bank cal d,kruger,account holders who deposited social security or other public benefit funds into checking or savings accounts and then overdrew those accounts contend that bank of america may not recoup the overdrawn amounts and charge insufficient funds fees for each transaction that results in an overdraft.in kruger,we held that a bank may not satisfy a credit card debt by deducting the amount owed from a separate checking account containing deposits that derived from unemployment and disability benefits and,thus,were protected from the claims of creditors.ibid.one year later,the legislature enacted financial code section,which comprehensively governs the manner in which banks may exercise the right to set off debts.financial code section,subdivision a expressly excludes overdrafts and bank charges from the statute definition of debt.we conclude that bank of america practice does not run afoul of our holding in kruger because the setoff of independent debt at issue in kruger is not implicated here.we further conclude that bank of america practice of recouping overdrafts and charging insufficient funds fees is permissible in light of the legislature unequivocal statement in financial code section that overdrafts and bank charges are not debts and are therefore not subject to the limitations placed on a bank right of setoff set forth in that statute.because we conclude that bank of america practices do not violate state law,we do not reach the issue of federal preemption.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
representative plaintiff paul miller miller receives supplemental security income benefits via direct deposit into his checking account with defendant bank of america the bank.miller has maintained an account with the bank since,and he began receiving ssi in.miller testified that he began having his ssi payments directly deposited into his checking account in after bank employees assured him that his deposits would be safe from debits or charges absent his authorization.
in january,the bank erroneously credited to miller account.in april,the bank realized its error and reversed the credit to miller account without obtaining miller authorization or providing him with notice.the reversal caused a negative balance in miller account that depleted his may ssi payment as soon as it was directly deposited.miller complained to the bank that the reversal of the erroneous credit caused a negative balance in his account,completely depleting his ssi deposit,and he would be unable to pay rent and other living expenses that month the bank advised miller that he would be responsible for repaying the portion of the erroneous credit that he had spent,but he could open a separate checking account for his ssi deposits that would not be used for repayment.the bank opened a new checking account and deposited miller previously deducted may ssi benefit funds into it.in june and july,the bank again used the ssi funds directly deposited into miller new checking account to repay the negative credit in his original account.miller complained each time,and each time the funds were later restored.
from time to time,miller overdrew his account,and the bank recouped those overdrafts and associated insufficient funds nsf fees from his directly deposited public benefit funds.bank employees testified that the bank automatically deducted overdrafts and nsf fees from directly deposited funds,regardless of the source of those funds.social security funds received no special treatment or protection as of,the bank nsf fees ranged from per transaction to per transaction,and up to five nsf fees could be levied in a single day,for a total daily nsf fee of.
the bank executive in charge of the bank checking products testified that,in order to prohibit certain account holders from overdrawing their accounts which would eliminate the bank need to recoup overdrafts or charge nsf fees,the bank would have to bounce more checks,withhold check deposits for the maximum allowable period of four days instead of one or two days before the bank would make the funds available for withdrawal,eliminate purchases but not personal identification number pin or transactions,and restrict automated teller machine atm withdrawals from atm.the bank posts checks,or processes transactions,each day in order of largest to smallest based on its belief that larger transactions are more important,and therefore should be cleared first.when an account contains insufficient funds to cover the checks or transactions,the bank practice of processing larger transactions before smaller ones results in the same total amount being overdrawn from a particular account,but increases the number and amount of nsf fees imposed.
miller initiated the instant representative action,and in his first amended complaint filed on august,alleged fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,as well as violations of code of civil procedure section the consumers legal remedies act clra,civil code section et the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et,and the false advertising act,business and professions code section et.
on october,the trial court denied in part and granted in part the bank motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication.the trial court granted the bank motion for summary adjudication with respect to plaintiff claims for violation of code of civil procedure section,and for intentional infliction of emotional distress,and denied the bank motion for summary judgment with respect to all other claims.the trial court found that triable issues of fact remained regarding the fraud,negligent misrepresentation,clra,ucl,and false advertising claims as to whether the bank made false or misleading statements concerning the availability of directly deposited funds,whether the bank had a practice of debiting benefit funds to collect overdrafts and other charges,and whether the bank practices as applied to plaintiff violated the ucl.
on the same day,the trial court also certified a class consisting of a ll california residents who have,have had or will have,at any time after august,a checking or savings deposit account with bank of america into which payments of social security benefits or other public benefits are or have been directly deposited by the government or its agent.as the court of appeal noted,i n,the bank had such accounts.each month more than million in government benefits is electronically deposited into class members accounts.between january and may,the bank debited at least in nsf and other overdraft fees from accounts containing social security direct deposits.although ssi benefits constituted miller primary source of income,the class consisted of all bank customers who received directly deposited public benefit funds without regard to whether those class members had available alternate sources of income to cover their basic living expenses.
on february,following a bifurcated trial in which the jury considered clra issues and the trial court also considered clra issues,as well as ucl and false advertising issues,the jury returned its verdict,finding that the bank violated the clra by falsely represent ing that it ha d the right to use social security funds from direct deposit accounts that receive government benefits including social security funds to pay overdrafts,insufficient fund s fees,and money claims it has against class members.the jury awarded in compensatory damages to the class,and awarded in statutory damages to each class member who suffered substantial economic or emotional damage.the jury also found that miller suffered emotional distress as a result of the bank conduct,and awarded him individual damages in the amount of.
on december,the trial court issued its statement of decision following a bench trial regarding plaintiffs clra,ucl,and false advertising claims.relying on kruger,supra,cal d,the trial court found that the bank violated the clra,the ucl,and the false advertising act,and awarded in compensatory and restitutionary damages to class members,concluded that each class member suffered substantial economic or emotional damage meriting the in statutory damages awarded by the jury to eligible class members,enjoined the bank from continuing to violate the clra,and awarded attorney fees and costs to plaintiffs.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment,holding that kruger did not apply to the bank practice of debiting overdrafts and charging nsf fees to account holders who deposited public benefit funds.we granted review to consider whether the bank practice violated our holding in kruger,and,if so,whether federal law preempted application of a state law prohibiting the setoff of overdrafts and nsf fees.
ii.discussion 
setoff of exempt funds 
miller argues that the bank practice of recouping overdrafts from,and charging nsf fees to,class members runs afoul of our holding in kruger,supra,cal d,and is inconsistent with the strong public policy prohibiting the setoff of exempt public benefit funds.the bank argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that the bank practice is nothing more than routine internal account balancing,and is distinct from the setoff of independent debt prohibited in kruger.while the bank practice here implicates to some extent the policy considerations at issue in kruger,we are ultimately persuaded that the practice of recouping overdrafts and charging nsf fees is not prohibited by our decision in kruger.our conclusion is bolstered by financial code section,which limits the manner in which banks may set off debts,but expressly excepts overdrafts and bank fees from those limitations.
in kruger,jean kruger maintained a checking account and a credit card account with wells fargo bank.kruger,supra,cal d at.she deposited into her checking account her unemployment compensation and state disability benefits,which were her only sources of income.ibid.without notifying kruger in advance,wells fargo deducted from her checking account,which was the entire balance of the account,and applied it against a delinquency in her credit card account.ibid.wells fargo refused to honor several checks that kruger had written before the funds were deducted from her account and billed her in service charges for the dishonored checks.ibid.
we held that the bank was prohibited by statute from using the funds in kruger checking account to satisfy the delinquency in her credit card account,because the funds consisted of exempt unemployment and disability benefits.kruger,supra,cal d at.we explained that a bank may not exercise its right of setoff against deposits of state disability insurance and unemployment compensation because f unds derived from such sources are exempt from attachment and execution by statute.id.at.although a banker setoff is not the same as attachment and execution,which are expressly prohibited by the statutes,we held that there is no relevant difference between the two procedures as to the state objective of protection of unemployment compensation and disability benefits from claims of creditors.the assertion of a banker setoff has exactly the same effect as a third party levy of execution on the deprives the depositor of the income which the state provided him to meet subsistence expenses,compelling the state either to give him additional money or leave him without means of physical survival.id.at,fn.omitted.
our decision in kruger recognized that public benefits such as unemployment compensation and state disability insurance benefits exist to provide subsistence income to a person who recently lost a job in the case of unemployment compensation or to a person whose unemployment stems from an illness or injury not covered under workmen compensation.kruger,supra,cal d at.the legislature objective in providing unemployment compensation and disability insurance benefits would be thwarted if those funds were subject to attachment or execution.ibid.permitting a banker setoff against unemployment and disability benefits diverts money intended by the state to pay the current living expenses of the unemployed and the disabled into payment of past debts accumulated by the bank,leaving the intended beneficiaries no alternative but to seek additional relief from the state.id.at,italics added.
here,unlike in kruger,the bank is not setting off independent,past debt.instead,the transaction occurs within a single account and is triggered by a customer overdraft,causing the bank to recoup those funds from a subsequent deposit,and charge an nsf fee.in kruger,we concluded that the setoff of exempt funds to satisfy debts external to the bank customer checking or savings account was unlawful.kruger,supra,cal d at.plaintiffs urge us to view the fact that the bank is balancing and charging fees within a single account as indistinguishable from a bank setoff of debt external to a customer account,and to extend kruger to the present case.we do not agree with plaintiffs that there is no meaningful difference between satisfying a debt external to an account and recouping an overdraft of an account from funds later deposited into that same account.
we are certainly mindful of the strong public policy reasons underlying our decision in kruger,and we recognize that the statutes at issue in kruger are similar to the statutes implicated here,exempting social security and other public benefit funds from attachment.indeed,just as code of civil procedure former section and unemployment insurance code former section the statutes at issue in kruger prohibited the attachment or execution of exempt public benefit funds,code of civil procedure section provides that an account into which social security payments are directly deposited is exempt to the extent that it consists of payments of public benefits or social security benefits authorized by the social security administration.code civ,subd.c.
plaintiffs emphasize the policy concerns addressed in kruger,namely,that the objective in providing public furnish the recipient and his or her family with a stream of income to defray the cost of their obviously fail if creditors could seize that income and apply it to past debts.consequently,the legislature provided that public benefits can not be subjected to attachment or execution.kruger,supra,cal d at,italics added.by concluding that banks may recoup overdrafts and charge nsf fees from public benefit recipients,we do not intend to diminish the significance of preserving public benefit funds for defray ing the cost of subsistence.ibid.however,it is far from clear that this policy is undermined when banks recoup overdrawn balances from subsequently deposited public benefit funds.indeed,an overdraft may be the result of the bank honoring,rather than bouncing,a rent or utility payment made prior to the deposit of benefit funds.requiring banks to dishonor checks can harm the customer credit rating,result in the customer incurring fees,and affect the customer relationship with merchants.in this case,policy concerns about the setoff of independent issue in not present here,where the credits and debits occur in a single account.
the legislature recognized the distinction between the setoff of independent debt and the recoupment of overdrafts and bank charges in financial code section,which comprehensively regulates the manner in which banks may exercise their right of setoff.financial code section limits a bank in exercising any setoff for a debt claimed to be owed to the bank by a customer in that a setoff shall not result in an aggregate balance of less than one thousand dollars,and describes the notice and opportunity to object that a bank must provide a customer prior to setting off debt,subds.b,c.debt is defined in the statute to exclude a charge for bank services or a debit for uncollected funds or for an overdraft of an account imposed by a bank on a deposit account,subd.a.
plaintiffs argue that financial code section serves two ensures that banks provide notice to customers prior to exercising a setoff,and it prohibits the setoff of funds resulting in a balance of less than.plaintiffs argue that the legislature excluded nsf fees and overdrafts from financial code section definition of debt bec
