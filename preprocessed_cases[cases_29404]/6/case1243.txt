introduction 
section,paragraph fifth,of the national bank act nba provides the following powers to a duly organized national banking association to elect or appoint directors,and by its board of directors to appoint a president,vice president,cashier,and other officers,define their duties,require bonds of them and fix the penalty thereof,dismiss such officers or any of them at pleasure,and appoint others to fill their places,par.fifth section fifth.courts have long recognized that the power conferred by section fifth on national banks to dismiss its officers at pleasure is protected by the doctrine of preemption from all state law claims filed by their former officers for breach of an employment agreement.see,mackey pioneer nat.bank cir.courts have also acknowledged the doctrine of preemption protects national banks that dismiss their officers under section fifth from state law discrimination claims filed by their former officers,although in this regard,courts have differed on whether such preemption is total or partial.aalgaard merchants nat.bank,d.claims under state age discrimination statute totally preempted by section fifth with marques bank of america th,d state antidiscrimination claims under feha preempted only to the extent they conflict with federal antidiscrimination laws.
in this case,the trial court decided the state law discrimination claims filed by plaintiff and appellant padmanabhan ramanathan ramanathan against defendant and respondent bank of america the bank were fully preempted by section fifth because ramanathan was an officer of the bank.on that basis,the trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of the bank and dismissed ramanathan complaint.ramanathan appeals.
in our view,the key issue on appeal is whether ramanathan was an officer of the bank under section fifth.if he was not an officer of the bank under section fifth,then his state law discrimination claims are not preempted.if he was an officer of the bank under section fifth,then his state law discrimination claims are preempted,either totally or partially,under the nba.the bank position,adopted by the trial court below,is that because its board of directors duly appointed ramanathan as a and duly ratified his dismissal after the fact,then ramanathan falls automatically within the provisions of section fifth and all his state law discrimination claims are preempted.in essence,the bank asserts it may invoke section fifth and shield itself against state law discrimination claims so long as its board of directors appoints an employee to the status of a and ratifies that employee subsequent dismissal,whatever may be the substantive nature of the duties and responsibilities of the employee under the appointed status of a.
for reasons more fully explained below,we reject the bank interpretation of section fifth.rather,we hold that where an employee asserts his or her position as is not vested with any of the duties or responsibilities normally associated with such a ramanathan did to obtain summary judgment on preemption grounds under section fifth the bank must show the employee is an officer of the bank pursuant to the criteria set forth in wells fargo bank superior court cal d,wells fargo.because the bank failed to prove ramanathan was an officer of the bank under wells fargo,it was not entitled to summary judgment on grounds of preemption under section fifth.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment awarded in favor of the bank and remand for further proceedings.

on december,ramanathan filed his opposition papers to the bank motion for summary judgment.ramanathan argued summary judgment should be denied on two independent grounds his designated status as vice president did not bring him within the scope of the section fifth and,section fifth does not preempt his feha claims.in support of the first contention,ramanathan submitted a separate statement of undisputed facts asserting he was hired by the bank in the position of programming.in this position,ramanathan worked as a web architect in the global corporate systems shared services group,and his responsibilities included assisting with architecture,design and development of software applications using web technologies.

scope of section fifth of the nba 
section fifth grants each national bank the corporate power t o elect or appoint directors,and by its board of directors to appoint a president,vice president,cashier,and other officers,define their duties,require bonds of them and fix the penalty thereof,dismiss such officers or any of them at pleasure,and appoint others to fill their places.our supreme court considered the scope of section fifth in wells fargo,supra,cal d.
in wells fargo,three former wells fargo branch managers sued wells fargo under california law for its alleged wrongful termination of their employment.the branch managers held appointments as assistant and exercised significant authority in transactions between the bank and third parties.wells fargo,supra,cal d at.after the trial court denied wells fargo motion for summary judgment and the court of appeal denied its request for peremptory writs,the supreme court granted review in order to consider,inter alia,the issue of whether plaintiffs were officers of a national bank under section fifth.id.at.the court noted plaintiffs sought a restrictive definition of section fifth by contending it applied only to a bank senior officers and not to branch managers,whereas wells fargo sought an expansive construction by contending plaintiffs were other officers within the meaning of section fifth,having been so designated by the bank.id.at.
the court began its analysis of the issue of whether plaintiffs were officers of a national bank under section fifth by examining the history and purpose of the nba.the court noted the power to dismiss a bank officer at will reflects the congressional mandate to establish an independent national system in order to maintain the stability of,and promote the welfare of,national banks.citation.wells fargo,supra,cal d at.the court quoted with approval from westervelt mohrenstecher cir fed,one of the earliest cases to consider the dismissal provision in the act observation and experience alike teach that it is essential to the safety and prosperity of banking institutions that the active officers,to whose integrity and discretion the moneys and property of the bank and its customers are entrusted,should be subject to immediate removal whenever the suspicion of faithlessness or negligence attaches to them.citation.id.at.indeed,in peatros bank of america cal th,d,peatros,the court acknowledged that t oday,more than years later,the statement of the westervelt court on the purpose of what is now section,fifth,remains current.citations.the provision object is to give national banks the greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their officers citation,indeed,to allow them to remove and replace them at will citation,in order to maintain their stability citation,protect their integrity citation,and promote their welfare citation,all with an eye toward securing and preserving the public trust citation.citation.peatros,supra,cal th at,d.
the wells fargo court reasoned that a broad construction of the term officer was necessary to give maximum effect to section fifth purpose of maintaining the stability and integrity of,and preserving the public trust in,the banking system,especially since larger banks are more likely to have such additional officers as comptroller,auditor,trust officer,and functional vice presidents in charge of particular divisions,with assistant officers in these categories citation who may all be held out to the public as having the authority to act on behalf of the bank and bind the bank,in favor of third persons possessing no other knowledge.wells fargo,supra,cal d at.indeed,the court noted a general banking practice favoring large numbers of officers with the title of who perform important banking functions under authority ultimately conferred by the bank board of directors.id.at.the court also noted the position taken by the california bankers association appearing as amicus curiae that bank officers are those in positions of special trust with the ability to sign documents which legally bind the bank.id.at.accordingly,the court set forth a broad definition of the officers covered by section fifth as follows in view of the language and purpose of section and the history and practice of the banking industry,a bank officer within the meaning of section possesses the following attributes first,he or she holds an office created by the board of directors and listed in the bank bylaws.citation.second,he or she is appointed by the board of directors,either directly or pursuant to a delegation of board authority set forth in the bylaws.citations.third,he or she has the express legal authority to bind the bank in its transactions with borrowers,depositors,customers,or other third parties by executing contracts or other legal instruments on the bank behalf.citation.fourth,his or her authority,however it might be limited by bank rule or policy,relates to fundamental banking operations in such a manner as
