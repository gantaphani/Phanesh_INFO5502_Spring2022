plaintiffs james laliberte and jann and dennis appeal the trial court orders sustaining demurrers to class allegations without leave to amend.plaintiffs contend they should have been allowed to further amend their class definition or to conduct further discovery to identify an adequate class representative.plaintiffs also contend the trial court erred in ruling that rescission is unavailable as a class remedy for violations of the truth in lending act tila et and regulation z,implementing tila.
we agree the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs leave to amend the class definition in their third amended complaint,but conclude it correctly denied plaintiffs leave to amend the class action rescission claim in their second amended complaint.
factual and procedural background 
in april,plaintiffs applied to defendant pacific mercantile bank pmb for refinance loans secured by their principal residences.in connection with the loan,pmb provided plaintiffs with a disclosure statement purporting to include the disclosures required by tila.the statement,however,failed to disclose closing fees of charged in each of the loans.plaintiffs allege this omission violated tila.
plaintiffs filed suit against pmb on may.the initial complaint included only individual claims.on november,plaintiffs amended their complaint to include class allegations,listing two subclasses of persons who obtained certain pmb loans,and either failed to receive,or received inaccurate,tila disclosures.one subclass included persons who obtained loans during the period from may,to the present.the other subclass included persons who obtained loans during the period from may,to the present.the trial court sustained demurrers to the first amended complaint,concluding the class allegations failed to allege sufficient common facts to constitute a single class.
plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged four subclasses,two including persons who obtained loans after may,and two including persons who obtained loans after may.pmb again demurred,and filed a motion to strike contending,inter alia,the statute of limitations ceased running on class claims not when the complaint was filed on may,but when plaintiffs first included a class claim in their first amended complaint on november.in opposition to the motion to strike,plaintiffs agreed to amend the class definitions to include only persons who obtained loans after november,for subclasses seeking damages,and after november,for subclasses seeking rescission.
the trial court sustained demurrers to the second amended complaint with leave to amend on class claims seeking statutory damages,but denied leave on class claims seeking rescission,concluding rescission was an individual remedy and therefore unavailable in a class action.the court explained that the class allegations in the second amended complaint were too generic,and that plaintiff needs to identify the specific provisions of defendant instruction manuals or policies which led to the violations of the tila plaintiff has alleged.
plaintiffs third amended complaint eliminated subclasses,and defined the single class as follows all persons who obtained a loan from pacific mercantile bank primarily for personal,family or household purposes secured by either real property or the borrower principal dwelling during the period from november,to the present.the complaint alleges that pmb had provided neither the named plaintiffs nor the class members a disclosure statement reflecting the closing fee charged in connection with their loans.by amending the class definition to include only those persons who obtained loans after november,plaintiffs eliminated pmb argument that some of the class claimants were.but pmb lodged a new objection to the amendment,arguing that the class obtained their loans in april no longer members of the class.
the trial court granted pmb demurrer to the class allegations of the third amended complaint without leave to amend on the sole ground that plaintiffs were not members of the class they purported to represent.the court ruling did not affect plaintiffs individual claims against pmb.plaintiffs now appeal the trial court order denying leave to amend the class claims in the third amended complaint,and its order sustaining demurrers to plaintiffs class claims seeking rescission.
standard of review 
an order sustaining demurrers to class action allegations is appealable to the extent that it prevents further proceedings as a class action.wilner sunset life ins.th,fn,d.in reviewing a trial court order sustaining a demurrer,we exercise our independent judgment on whether a cause of action has been stated as a matter of law.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.a trial court denial of leave to amend,however,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the trial court abused its discretion and must demonstrate the proposed amendment states a cause of action.goodman kennedy cal d.
discussiona.the trial court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend 
in sustaining demurrers to the third amended complaint without leave to amend,the trial court held because the named plaintiffs were never a member of the class they purport to represent,they have no standing to sue on its behalf.where the complaint states a cause of action in someone,but not in the plaintiff,a general demurrer for failure to state a cause of action will be sustained.payne united california bank d.payne.on the face of the complaint it is undisputed that plaintiffs were never members of the interested class.thus,plaintiffs do not belong to the class whom they purportedly represent and can not give themselves standing to sue by purporting to represent a class of which they were never a member.
plaintiffs contend the trial court reliance on payne was misplaced,and that la sala american sav.loan cal d,la sala compels reversal.we agree.
in la sala,the plaintiff borrowers brought a class action against a lender,alleging that the lender trust deed form included a provision permitting acceleration if the borrower executed a junior encumbrance on the secured property.after the lender offered to waive the provision as to the named plaintiffs,the trial court dismissed the action,determining that the plaintiffs no longer represented the class because they had received full relief.the supreme court reversed,concluding that the plaintiffs should have been given the opportunity to add new class representatives by amendment,even though the lender waiver removed plaintiffs from the class they purported to represent.la sala,supra,cal d at.
la sala then addressed the lender arguments regarding alternative grounds for affirming the trial court order.one of these identical to pmb that the plaintiffs were never members of the class defined in their complaint.the la sala plaintiffs defined the class as those borrowing money from the lender during the four years immediately preceding the filing of this action.la sala,supra,cal d at.because the plaintiffs borrowed money six and years before they filed the action,the supreme court acknowledged the plaintiffs never qualified as class members.ibid.the court nonetheless recognized that the named plaintiffs shared a community of interest in the questions of law and fact involved,because they were all persons against whom the lender had threatened to enforce its clause.id.at.the court viewed the time restriction in the complaint as arbitrary,and that the community of interest in the litigation subject matter extended beyond any period and encompasses all borrowers,including plaintiffs,who have been threatened with acceleration under the clause within the period of the statute of limitation.ibid.the court concluded in sum,plaintiffs nonmembership in the class defined by the complaint stems not from the lack of a community of interest between plaintiffs and the class,but from arbitrary and inadvertent limitation of the class.fn.omitted.ibid.because the plaintiffs could easily cure the pleading defect by amendment,the court held it would be an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend.id.at.
