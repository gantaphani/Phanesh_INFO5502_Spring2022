this appeal concerns the interpretation and application of the california accounts law campal,et.
in,plaintiff,dennis stevens,and his wife,jackie,opened a joint bank account with defendant,tri counties bank at some point,jackie sister,nancy wrinkle,was added to the account and withdrew all the money.
dennis,who sued the bank for breach of contract,appeals from the judgment entered in tri counties favor.he contends the trial court erred in concluding that tri counties did not violate probate code section when it added wrinkle to the joint bank account without dennis and jackie written approval,and further concluding that,in any event,the provisions of probate code section do not apply to this controversy because of probate code.further section references are to the probate code unless otherwise specified.
we shall reverse the judgment.as we will explain,the joint bank account contract with tri counties incorporated california law relating to such agreements,except to the extent that the contract explicitly varies from california law.such a law is probate code section,which contains specific limitations on how the terms of a account can be changed,for example by adding another person to the account.the contract in this case does not provide a method that varies from the provisions of section.the trial court incorrectly held that the contract is not governed by section due to section,which states the provisions of the statutory scheme commencing with section,concerning beneficial ownership as between parties of accounts,are relevant only to controversies between these persons and their creditors and other successors,and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of these persons as determined by the terms of account contracts.the provisions of chapter commencing with section govern the liability of financial institutions who make payments pursuant to that chapter.however,section simply absolves financial institutions of any liability for paying to a party of a account a sum from the account that is more than that person beneficial ownership in the account funds,the proportion of that person contribution to the account,provided that the person to whom the institution pays the money is a proper party to the account.whether a person is a proper party to the account is governed by section,unless the terms of the account vary from the provisions of section.section does not deprive account holders of recourse against financial institutions that permit a party to withdraw funds from a account when the person is not a proper party to the account pursuant to section and the account contract.because the way in which tri counties added wrinkle to the account in this case did not conform to the requirements of section incorporated in the account contract,tri counties can be liable for breaching the contract when it allowed wrinkle to withdraw all of the money in the account.
the parties agreed statement of facts discloses the following 
on july,dennis and jackie both signed a signature card for a joint account at tri counties,which covered two deposit accounts.the account title is stevens,dennis c or jackie another signature card,containing only wrinkle signature,bears the same date,lists just one of the deposit accounts noted on the other signature card,and titles the account,stevens,dennis c or jackie a or wrinkle,nancy 
other evidence disclosed that wrinkle was not added to the account in,as indicated by the signature card she signed,but at some later date.wrinkle testified she was certain that she,jackie,and dennis went to tri counties directly from jackie doctor office when jackie was diagnosed with cancer in july.according to wrinkle,she was added to the joint account at that time because she helped care for jackie developmentally disabled adult daughter,and because wrinkle became almost a maid and caregiver for jackie while jackie was undergoing chemotherapy.
dennis disputed the extent of wrinkle involvement as a caregiver,and he testified that he never authorized her addition to any deposit account and never discussed doing so with jackie.dennis denied that the three of them went to the bank together to add wrinkle to the account.
monica canchola,tri counties bank,testified that in september,the bank stopped using the signature card format used by dennis,jackie,and wrinkle.if dennis and jackie had added wrinkle to the account after september,the bank would have required all three of them to sign one signature card.
dennis and jackie separated in may,but agreed that jackie would continue to use their joint account for her expenses and that dennis would continue to deposit funds into the account.all of the bank statements were sent to jackie address.
in early,dennis and jackie sold a rental property they owned jointly and deposited approximately in sales proceeds into their joint account.according to wrinkle,while jackie was in the hospital in oregon,she asked wrinkle to withdraw all the money from the bank account and pay to jackie significant other,richard,for money she owed him for their joint purchase of a fifth wheel trailer and other living expenses.wrinkle also asserted that jackie instructed her to pay some other miscellaneous expenses and to keep the remaining funds.wrinkle returned to california and followed jackie instructions.the withdrawals occurred on or after august.
on september,jackie died from cancer.dennis was the executor and sole beneficiary of her will.within days of her death,he went to the bank to check on the available balance in the account to pay jackie debts.there,he discovered that wrinkle had closed the account after withdrawing over.dennis complained to tri counties that he had not given permission to add wrinkle to his account with jackie.
ray block,the branch manager,conducted an internal inquiry and learned that nancy ferguson,a bank employee,recalled speaking to dennis about adding wrinkle to the account after jackie was admitted to a hospital in seattle in.dennis denied having done so.contrary to tri counties answers to interrogatories,ferguson stated that she did not personally add,or supervise adding,wrinkle to the account.
tri counties service and disclosure pamphlet,which was incorporated in the account agreement,did not contain any language about adding a signer to the account.however,the bank internal operations manual stated that one of the original signers must be present to add an additional signer,and that a new signature card must be completed with all authorized signers.bank manager block testified that only a manager would have the authority to depart from these procedures and that bank employee ferguson lacked the necessary authority.bank canchola testified that the manual was only a set of guidelines and that employees have the discretion to depart from these procedures.as a community bank with a focus on customer service,tri counties accommodated its customers thus,if either dennis or jackie called and spoke with a bank employee acquainted with either one of them,the employee could have,as a courtesy to them,added wrinkle to the account based on the oral request.however,it was more likely that either dennis or jackie came into the bank with wrinkle to have her sign the signature card.
dennis sued tri counties for breach of contract,alleging the bank violated section of campal,and the bank agreement with him,by adding wrinkle to the account without written consent.according to dennis,section,subdivision b provides that the terms of a account,such as the one owned by dennis and jackie,can be changed only by closing it and reopening it under different terms,presenting to the bank a modification agreement signed by all parties with a present right of withdrawal,or complying with a method of modification provided for in the term of the account agreement.
tri counties denied that section applied.this is so,it argued,because section states that said portion of the probate code is relevant only to controversies between the parties and creditors,not between the parties and the bank.
the trial court ruled in favor of tri counties.its statement of decision found both dennis and jackie had full authority as joint tenants to affect any disposition of the joint tenancy account,including withdrawing all of the funds at any time or adding a third joint tenant.nothing in the deposit agreement required the bank to obtain the written consent of the account owners to add a third account owner.although dennis knew that jackie,from whom he was separated,could withdraw the funds completely,he deposited the funds in question into the joint account.
the trial court further found that wrinkle did not sign the signature card on july,as the card indicated,but did so at some later date.nevertheless,there were reasons for either dennis or jackie to add wrinkle as an account owner,and a bank employee recalled discussing the issue with dennis.as plaintiff,dennis had the burden to prove that neither he nor jackie consented to adding wrinkle.the court intimated that dennis had not met his burden of proof.
the court ruled that tri counties did not violate section by permitting the addition of wrinkle because she was added as a joint tenant in accordance with the deposit agreement,and section rendered section inapplicable to the controversy between dennis and tri counties.
discussion 
dennis argues the trial court erred in ruling that wrinkle was added to the joint bank account in compliance with section,which states a the provisions of section as to rights of survivorship are determined by the form of the account at the death of a party.b once established,the terms of a account can be changed only by any of the following methods closing the account and reopening it under different terms.presenting to the financial institution a modification agreement that is signed by all parties with a present right of withdrawal.if the financial institution has a form for this purpose,it may require use of the form.if the provisions of the terms of the account or deposit agreement provide a method of modification of the terms of the account,complying with those provisions.as provided in subdivision c of section concerning written notification limiting withdrawals following a court order.c during the lifetime of a party,the terms of the account may be changed as provided in subdivision b to eliminate or to add rights of survivorship.withdrawal of funds from the account by a party with a present right of withdrawal during the lifetime of a party also eliminates rights of survivorship upon the death of that party with respect to the funds withdrawn.
he contends the account contract with tri counties expressly incorporated california law as follows this agreement is subject to applicable federal laws and the laws of the s tate of california except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws.the agreement did not provide a method for adding a joint tenant to the account that varied from section in fact,it provided no method at all.therefore,section applied and subdivision b delimits the manner in which a person may be added to a account.he and jackie did not close the account and reopen one with wrinkle.they did not give tri counties a signed written modification adding wrinkle to their account.and the provisions of their account did not provide any other method for modifying it or adding another party without written authorization.thus,the trial court erred in ruling that wrinkle was added in accordance with section and the terms of the account agreement.
dennis also contests the trial court conclusion that tri counties liability was not governed by section in light of section,which states a the provisions of chapter commencing with section concerning beneficial ownership as between parties,or as between parties and payees or beneficiaries of accounts,are relevant only to controversies between these persons and their creditors and other successors,and have no bearing on the power of withdrawal of these persons as determined by the terms of account contracts.b the provisions of chapter commencing with section govern the liability of financial institutions who make payments pursuant to that chapter.
dennis claims that,contrary to the trial court ruling,section does not render all of chapter inapplicable to a determination of the bank those portions dealing with the parties beneficial ownership of the account and their right of withdrawal.as long as the bank pays a proper party to a account in accordance with the terms of the account,it is absolved of any liability for paying more than the party beneficial ownership.but,in dennis view,that does not mean the bank has no liability if it pays someone who has no right of withdrawal at all because the person was not added to the account in accordance with the express specifications of section.
we agree with dennis interpretation of section in light of other provisions of campal.
the words of a statute must be construed in context,and the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.kray cabling county of contra costa th,d.
