plaintiff sylvia cohen sued defendants jp morgan chase and jp morgan chase bank hereinafter referred to collectively as chase in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york charles sifton,judge,alleging that chase collection of an unearned fee in connection with its refinancing of her home mortgage violated section b of the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,b,and new york general business law.in a judgment entered on march,cohen morgan chase,no.cps,the district court dismissed cohen complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim under respa b because the fee at issue was analogous to an overcharge,which kruse wells fargo home mortgage,cir,held was not prohibited by b and plaintiff had,in any event,failed to plead that the challenged fee represented part of a charge split between chase and one or more third parties.the district court similarly concluded that cohen failed to state a deceptive practices claim under state law because the pleaded facts demonstrated that the challenged fee was disclosed.
for the reasons stated herein,we conclude that kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at,does not control this case.we further conclude that respa b is ambiguous as to whether its protections can apply to undivided,as well as divided,unearned fees.because the department of housing and urban development hud,the agency charged with administering respa,reasonably resolves this ambiguity by construing the statute to apply to undivided fees,we accord that construction deference pursuant to chevron natural resources defense council,d,and we vacate the dismissal of cohen federal claim.we similarly vacate the dismissal of cohen state claim because,if she can show that the challenged fee violated respa,that fact might allow her to establish a deceptive business practice under new york law.accordingly,we remand this case to the district court for reinstatement of the complaint and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background 
in september,when sylvia cohen refinanced her home mortgage,chase presented her with a closing statement listing various fees incurred in connection with that transaction.among these was a fee,which cohen paid.cohen alleges that chase provided no services for this fee.although chase disputes this contention,on review of a judgment of dismissal,we must assume its truth.see,mccarthy dun bradstreet,cir.
on september,cohen instituted this action,suing on behalf of herself and a putative class of persons who had also refinanced home mortgages with chase and paid similar unearned fees.see.following the district court grant of chase motion to dismiss and its denial of cohen motion for reconsideration,see cohen morgan chase,no.cps,wl,cohen filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
cohen respa.respa b and the standard of review 
cohen federal claim against chase is premised on respa b,which states 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
b.in a formal policy statement,hud has construed this statutory section to proscribe unearned fees in three contexts 
where t wo or more persons split a fee for settlement services,any portion of which is unearned or one settlement service provider the cost of services performed or goods provided by another settlement service provider without providing additional actual,necessary,and distinct services,goods,or facilities to justify the additional charge or one service provider charges the consumer a fee where no,nominal,or duplicative work is done,or the fee is in excess of the reasonable value of goods or facilities provided or the services actually performed.
statement of policy,codified at c policy statement emphasis added.the third numbered provision in fact references two circumstances.cohen relies on the first,highlighted circumstance in pursuing her claim that one service provider,such as chase,can not charge a consumer a fee for which no work is done,what we refer to hereinafter as an undivided unearned fee.the second,unhighlighted circumstance prohibits charges over and above reasonable value.we invalidated this part of the third provision in kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at,discussed infra at.
we review the district court decision to dismiss cohen b claim de novo,both because it is a ruling of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,see mccarthy dun bradstreet,at,and because it depends on statutory construction,see kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at.further,the question of the appropriate level of deference to accord agency regulations is one purely of law,subject to de novo review.coke long island care at home,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.
kruse does not control this case 
because the district court ruled that cohen claim was precluded as a matter of law by our construction of respa b in kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at,we consider at the outset whether that decision does,in fact,control this case.we conclude that it does not.
in kruse,we considered two parts of the quoted policy statement numbered provision,referencing and the second part of numbered provision,referencing fees in excess of reasonable value.the kruse plaintiffs alleged that wells fargo had violated b by marking up the price of services provided by a third party.we concluded that respa b was not clear and unambiguous with respect to its coverage of markups.id.at because the second prong of hud policy statement reasonably resolved that ambiguity to prohibit,we accorded chevron deference to that agency interpretation.see id.at.the kruse plaintiffs further alleged that defendants violated b by charging fees in excess of the reasonable value of services that they did provide.we held that this agency interpretation,which effectively imposed price controls on settlement fees,was contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.see id.at.we explained that respa b does not authorize courts to break down a single charge into reasonable and unreasonable components.id.whatever its size,such a fee is for the services rendered by the institution and received by the borrower.thus,we invalidated that part of the policy statement third prong prohibiting fees exceeding the reasonable value of the services rendered.id.
on this appeal,cohen relies on neither of the policy statement provisions at issue in kruse to support her b claim.instead,she invokes only that part of the third numbered provision wherein hud interprets b to prohibit undivided unearned fees charged by a single service provider.each party to this action nevertheless contends that kruse compels resolution of this appeal in its favor.cohen with the support of hud argues that the twin rulings in kruse effectively establish that,while b does not authorize price controls for services actually performed,it does proscribe fees for no services,whether structured as a divided or undivided charge.chase counters that kruse approved the application of b to only because a,by allowing one person to an unearned fee onto the charge of a service provider,effectively constitutes a divided charge.for its part,the district court concluded that cohen claim failed because the challenged fee was sufficiently analogous to the overcharges that kruse held were beyond the reach of the statute.
in fact,kruse had no occasion to consider and,therefore,did not address the critical issue on this appeal whether respa b reference to any portion,split,or percentage of any charge clearly and unambiguously indicates congress intent to prohibit unearned fees only when incorporated in charges divided among two or more persons,thereby precluding hud construction of the statute to prohibit one service provider from charg ing the consumer a fee where no,nominal,or duplicative work is done,policy statement.at.in this quoted language,hud focus is not on lenders who overcharge for services actually provided it is on lenders who charge fees for no services at all.accordingly,kruse holding that respa b is clearly not a price control statute does not resolve this appeal.similarly,the quoted policy statement language here is distinct from the provision concerned with.thus,kruse holding that respa b is ambiguous with regard to,and that the second prong of the policy statement reasonably resolves this ambiguity by establishing their illegality,tells us nothing about whether b also prohibits undivided unearned fees.to resolve that issue,we must again interpret b according to the process outlined in chevron natural resources defense council,at,this time focusing on respa reference to any portion,split,or percentage of any charge.
chevron analysis supports hud construction of respa b to prohibit lenders from accepting undivided unearned fees 
chevron analysis 
at chevron step one,we consider whether congress has clearly spoken in respa b to the issue of undivided unearned fees.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.accord chauffeur training,spellings,cir.to ascertain congress intent,we begin with the statutory text because if its language is unambiguous,no further inquiry is necessary.see zuni pub.sch.dist.dep t of,d robinson shell oil,d daniel am.bd.of emergency,cir.if the statutory language is ambiguous,however,we will resort first to canons of statutory construction,and,if the statutory meaning remains ambiguous,to legislative history,daniel am.bd.of emergency,at internal citations omitted,to see if these interpretive clues permit us to identify congress clear intent,general dynamics land,cline,d.if we still can not conclude that congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue,we will proceed to chevron step two,which instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute,so long as it is reasonable.chevron natural res.def.council,at.accord kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at.
b.the statutory phrase any portion,split,or percentage of any charge is ambiguous with respect to congress intent to prohibit undivided unearned fees 
accepting as true the allegations in cohen complaint,we assume that the challenged fee could constitute a charge for which no services were actually performed under respa b,an unearned fee.b.accordingly,at the first step of chevron analysis,we must decide whether b reference to any portion,split,or percentage of an unearned charge demonstrates congress clear intent to prohibit unearned fees only when reflected in charges divided among two or more persons.chase submits that such intent is apparent from the plain meaning of the words portion,split,and percentage.to support cohen claim,hud counters that b reference to any portion,split,or percentage of any charge signals congress broader intent.because the text is,in fact,subject to divergent,but plausible,constructions,on the issue of undivided unearned fees,kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at,we conclude that it is ambiguous in revealing congress intent on this subject.
to explain,we begin by considering the ordinary meaning of the nouns at the center of the contested phrase.gonzales carhart,d accord tafari hues,cir.the word portion is commonly understood to mean an individual part or share of something or a part of a whole.webster third new international dictionary.split means a product of division by or as if by splitting,or a share as of booty,winnings,profits.id.at.percentage is commonly understood to mean a part of a whole expressed in hundredths.id.at.to the extent the words share and part recur in these definitions,we note that share is commonly defined as a portion belonging to an individual,id.at,while part is defined as one of the equal or unequal portions into which something is or is regarded as divided or something less than a whole,id.at.thus,because the words portion,split,and percentage are commonly understood to reference things that have been divided and that are less than a whole,their use together in respa b could plausibly be understood to signal a legislative intent to prohibit unearned fees only when reflected in divided charges.
our task at chevron step one,however,is not simply to interpret individual words but to construe statutes.in so doing,we follow the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context since a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.general dynamics land,cline,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in respa b,congress placed the words portion,split,or percentage within the phrase any portion,split,or percentage of any charge.b emphasis added.as the supreme court has frequently observed,use of the word any in statutory text generally indicates congress intent to sweep broadly to reach all varieties of the item referenced.see,united states gonzales,d quoting webster third new international dictionary in concluding that,r ead naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind accord hud rucker,d same ruggiero county of orange,cir noting that congress made the phrase at issue even broader when it chose the expansive word any to precede the list internal quotation marks omitted.the court most recently applied this principle in interpreting the phrase any air pollution agent or combination of such agents,including any physical,chemical substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air in the clean air act.massachusetts epa,d quoting g ellipsis and emphases in original.it concluded that o n its face,the quoted language embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe,and underscores that intent through the repeated use of the word any.id.
the court has cautioned that,in some circumstances,the word any may warrant a narrower interpretation.see,small united states,d e ven though the word any demands a broad interpretation,we must look beyond that word itself.internal quotation marks omitted nixon missouri mun.league,d a ny can and does mean different things depending upon the setting.lewis united states,d avoiding literal reading of the words any enactment that would dramatically separate the statute from its intended purpose.this precedent only reinforces the rule that statutory terms are not interpreted in the abstract but in the context of surrounding language.thus,we must consider whether the expansive modifier any,when paired with the nouns portion,split,or percentage,can plausibly be construed to include an undivided charge.we conclude that it can.
in reaching this conclusion,we note that,although congress appears to have used the precise phrase any portion,split,or percentage only in respa b,it has used the formulations any portion of and any percentage of in other federal statutes for example,states whoever,not being an authorized depository of public moneys,knowingly receives any public money or uses,transfers,converts,appropriates or applies any portion of the public money for any purpose not prescribed by law is guilty of embezzlement emphasis added.similarly,and proscribe as embezzlement the unauthorized use,conversion,transfer,or application of any portion of the public money s intrusted to certain persons emphasis added.title makes it unlawful for a federal official to accept or receive any portion of the money which may accrue to any person making a customs detection and seizure emphasis added.in none of these statutes does congress use of the phrase any portion of manifest a clear intent not to criminalize the proscribed conduct when it involves the whole of the moneys at issue.indeed,such a conclusion would appear to border on the absurd so too,the requirement that a financial institution not collect or attempt to collect from a student loan recipient any portion of the interest on the note which is payable by the secretary of education,a e emphasis added,hardly signals clear congressional intent to allow institutions to collect the whole of such interest.
as for the phrase any percentage,in l b,authorizing medical assistance grants,congress used it to allow certain states to substitute for the percentage provided earlier in the section any percentage emphasis added.because the percentages provided by the statute include and,see id.l a ii,it appears clear that,in this context at least,congress plainly intended any percentage to reference amounts equal to and even greater than.see also wisconsin dep t of health family servs.blumer,d referring to percentage in context of,including garelick sullivan,cir discussing percentages of charges in context of g,including.
mindful that congress has thus frequently used the phrases any portion and any percentage without conveying a clear intent to legislate only as to less than the whole,we can not confidently conclude from their inclusion in respa b that,in that context,they unambiguously convey a narrow congressional intent nevertheless,we consider the possibility that the sum may be more than its parts and that the longer phrase here at issue any portion,split,or percentage of any charge might convey congress clear intent to exclude an undivided whole.three of our sister circuits have,after all,embraced such a narrow interpretation of respa b.see haug bank of,cir holding that plain language of section b requires plaintiffs to plead facts showing that the defendant illegally shared fees with a third party krzalic republic title,cir reasoning that defendant did not accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge because no one agreed to divide a fee boulware crossland mortgage,cir by using the language portion,split,or percentage,congress was clearly aiming at a sharing arrangement rather than a unilateral overcharge.but see sosa chase manhattan mortgage,cir holding that a single party can violate subsection b.these circuits holdings with respect to undivided unearned fees can not,however,be divorced from their construction of b phrase n o person shall give and no person shall accept to require at least two culpable parties in any proscribed transaction.this court rejected that construction in our consideration of in kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at.thus,we do not assume that a guilty giver and a guilty acceptor must participate in every unlawful unearned charge,a circumstance more suggestive of a divided charge.
nor does the canon of construction noscitur a sociis permit us to identify a clear congressional intent to limit b to divided charges.see norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed explaining that when two or more words are grouped together,and ordinarily have a similar meaning,but are not equally comprehensive,the general word will be limited and qualified by the specific word.as we have already recognized,the common meaning of all three nouns in the contested phrase references something that has been divided and is less than whole.see supra at.whether or not any one noun is more specific in this respect,the critical interpretive issue in this case is not whether distinctions can be drawn among these three nouns,but whether use of the expansive modifier any in conjunction with all three words gives rise to ambiguity regarding congress intent with respect to b prohibition on undivided unearned fees.
we conclude that it does.congress serial reference to any portion,split,or percentage of any charge in b can plausibly be construed to demonstrate a legislative intent to sweep broadly,prohibiting all unearned fees,however structured.see generally united states dauray,cir concluding that noscitur a sociis does not resolve textual ambiguity where language plausibly supports both narrow and expansive reading.while congress could certainly have used clearer language to convey such intent,see,a barring creditors from collecting all or any part of a consumer debt of debtor protected by chapter bankruptcy emphasis added,it could also have used clearer language if its intent was to exclude undivided unearned fees from the statute reach.faced with competing,plausible interpretations,we conclude that the statutory text is ambiguous in conveying congress intent.see mizrahi gonzales,cir recognizing ambiguity arising from competing,plausible interpretations kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at observing that divergent,but plausible,constructions of language at issue preclude finding of clear and unambiguous congressional intent see also united states gayle,cir concluding that phrase any court is ambiguous as to inclusion of foreign courts cheung united states,cir observing that phrase any foreign government is ambiguous as to inclusion of hong kong where statutory terms neither compel nor exclude competing interpretations.
respa structure,purpose,and history do not clearly resolve the textual ambiguity 
when the text of a statute is ambiguous,we look to structure,purpose,and history to determine whether these construction devices can convincingly resolve the ambiguity at chevron step one.general dynamics land,cline,at.a high level of clarity is necessary to resolve textual ambiguity in this manner.at the first step of chevron analysis,a court task is not to infer what congress might have said about the issue in dispute if it had considered the matter a court decides only whether congress has directly spoken to that precise question.chevron natural res.def.council,at.thus,we employ traditional tools of construction to determine only if they compel a particular conclusion as to congress intent.see pension benefit guar.ltv,d see also general dynamics land,cline,at.observing that interpretive clues spoke almost unanimously,establishing congress intent beyond reasonable doubt fda brown williamson tobacco,d concluding that congress preclusion of agency position was inescapable and unmistakable japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y,d observing that scattered statements in legislative history hinting at congressional intent are insufficient to resolve ambiguity.in this case,they do not.
respa is structured so that section,entitled prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees,is divided into three subparts.section a,entitled business referrals,prohibits payments for referrals within the real estate settlement business.a.section b,entitled splitting charges,is the part at issue in this case.id.b.as already noted,it prohibits any person from giving or accepting not only any split charge for which no services were performed,but also any portion or percentage of an unearned charge.section c,entitled fees,salaries,compensation,or other payments,specifies that certain bona fide service fees and disclosed referral fees are not prohibited by respa.id.c.
chase argues that,together,these subsections support an interpretation of b that protects consumers from unearned fees only when included in charges divided among two or more persons.because the referral fees referenced in subsection a and the safe harbor created by subsection c appear to reference fees involving two or more parties,chase urges us to conclude that congress necessarily intended subsection b to prohibit unearned fees only when charges were divided among multiple persons.however plausible this reading of the statutory structure,it is no more compelling than chase similar reading of the text.it is equally plausible that congress could have intended respa b to prohibit behavior separate and distinct from subsection a.moreover,its decision not to provide a safe harbor for unearned fees in subsection c makes equal sense whether such fees are divided or not.
because the structure of the statute does not speak unambiguously to congress intent with respect to undivided unearned fees,it can not resolve textual ambiguity at chevron step one.fda brown williamson tobacco,at.rejecting agency interpretation at chevron step one as incompatible with and precluded by coherent regulatory scheme.
in respa,congress identified two concerns requiring significant reforms in the real estate settlement process providing consumers with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of that process,and providing consumers with protect ion from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices.a.to address these concerns,congress identified respa purpose as more effective advance disclosure to home buyers and sellers of settlement costs,the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of certain settlement services,a reduction in the amounts home buyers are required to place in escrow accounts established to insure the payment of real estate taxes and insurance,and reform and modernization of local recordkeeping of land title information.id.b.pointing to the absence of any reference to undivided unearned fees in this statement of purpose,the fourth circuit has concluded that respa b is limited to divided fees.see boulware crossland mortgage,at.
we are not convinced,however,that congress silence on the issue of undivided unearned fees demonstrates its direct consideration of the issue,much less its clear intent to exclude such charges from the protections b affords consumers.first,as the supreme court has recognized,statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil identified by congress to cover reasonably comparable evils,and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.oncale sundowner offshore,d.indeed,respa provisions,such as the prohibition on charges for the preparation of statements,see,go beyond the stated statutory goal to eliminate kickbacks and referral fees.second,although respa statement of purpose nowhere references undivided unearned fees,the prohibition of such fees is consistent with respa overall goal to protect consumers from abusive practices that result in unnecessarily high settlement charges.a.in short,this is not a case where one reading of ambiguous text can be ruled out because it would harm the very class that congress intended to protect.see general dynamics land,cline,at.reaching that conclusion with respect to agency construction of age discrimination in employment act.
because respa stated purpose neither requires that b be construed to prohibit undivided unearned fees nor precludes that interpretation,it does not render the statutory text unambiguous at chevron step one.
legislative history 
this court has generally been reluctant to employ legislative history at step one of chevron analysis,see coke long island care at home,at,mindful that the interpretive clues to be found in such history will rarely speak with sufficient clarity to permit us to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,general dynamics land,cline,at.this case is no exception.
the legislative history of respa b is set forth most authoritatively in senate report,as reprinted in the senate report describes section then numbered section as follows 
prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees 
section is intended to prohibit all kickback or referral fee arrangements whereby any payment is made or thing of value furnished for the referral of real estate settlement business.the section also prohibits a person or company that renders a settlement service from giving or rebating any portion of the charge to any other person except in return for services actually performed.reasonable payments in return for services actually performed or goods actually furnished are not intended to be prohibited.
in a number of areas of the country,competitive forces in the conveyancing industry have led to the payment of referral fees,kickbacks,rebates,and unearned commissions as inducements to persons who are in a position to refer settlement business.such payments take various forms.for example,a title insurance company may give or more of the title insurance premium to an attorney who may perform no services for the title insurance company other than placing a telephone call to the company or filling out a simple application.a discount or allowance for the prompt payment of a title insurance premium or other charge for a settlement service may be given to realtors or lenders as a rebate for the placement of business with the individual or company giving the discount.an attorney may give a portion of his fee to another attorney,lender,or realtor who simply refers a prospective client to him.in some instances,a commission may be paid by a title insurance company to a corporation that is by one or more savings and loan associations,even though that corporation performs no substantial services on behalf of the title insurance company.
in all of these instances,the payment or thing of value furnished by the person to whom the settlement business is referred tends to increase the cost of settlement services without providing any benefits to the home buyer.while the making of such payments may heretofore have been necessary from a competitive standpoint in order to obtain or retain business,and in some areas may even be permitted by state law,it is the intention of section to prohibit such payments,kickbacks,rebates,or unearned commissions.
the examples identified in the senate report all appear to reference charges divided among multiple persons.such examples,however,can not by themselves compel a conclusion that congress directly considered and clearly rejected a prohibition of undivided unearned fees.see pension benefit guar.ltv,at,rev g cir.when the pension benefit case was before this court,we noted passages in erisa legislative history indicating that congress had considered a particular circumstance a valid basis for restoration of pension plans but had made no mention of another possible circumstance.we reasoned that,because the second circumstance was not among the bases for restoration by members of congress,that body must have intended that the existence of that second circumstance not be a reason for restoring pension plans.id.emphasis in original summarizing analysis appearing at at.the supreme court reversed,ruling that the legislative history did not compel such a narrow interpretation of the statute.id.the court explained 
t he language of a language expressly granting an agency broad not to be regarded as modified by examples set forth in the legislative history.an example,after all,is just that an illustration of the statute operation in practice.it is not,as the court of appeals apparently thought,a definitive interpretation of a statute scope.we see no suggestion in the legislative history that congress intended its list of examples to be exhaustive.under these circumstances,we conclude that erisa legislative history does not suggest clear congressional intent on the question of pension plans.
in this case congress has similarly granted respa administering agency,hud,broad authority to prescribe such rules and regulations and to make such interpretations as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of the statute.in these circumstances,pension benefit does not permit us to conclude,merely from the absence of an example of undivided charges in respa legislative history,that congress thereby expressed its clear intent that b not protect consumers from any unearned fees except those reflected in divided charges.the legislative history may demonstrate that congress primary concern was divided charges,but that does not convincingly establish that congress intended its list of examples to be exhaustive or suggest clear congressional intent not to protect consumers from undivided unearned fees.pension benefit guar.ltv,at.
because neither the structure,purpose,nor legislative history of respa b clearly resolves the identified textual ambiguity with respect to undivided unearned fees,we proceed to the second step of chevron analysis.
hud reasonably construes respa b to prohibit undivided unearned fees 
at chevron step two,we will defer to a reasonable agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory language when it appears that congress has delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead,d.as previously noted,confers such authority on hud.moreover,in kruse wells fargo home mortgage,at,this court ruled that hud acted pursuant to this authority in promulgating its policy statement respecting b we now hold that hud policy statement reasonably interprets b comprehensively to prohibit unearned fees,whether reflected in a charge divid
