this action is before us for the third time on appeal plaintiffs and appellants john mills,peter and cameron howe ministri thomas and rosemary mills ttee jonathan rauh eric holt chris wong donne goodrich,as the executor of the estate of juliette goodrich evelyn howe and the howe family corporation collectively,plaintiffs challenge three rulings by the trial court with respect to defendant and respondent bank.on their appeal from the judgment,plaintiffs challenge the order granting bank demurrer to the fifth amended complaint eighth and ninth causes of action for a breach of presentment and transfer warranties in violation of california uniform commercial code sections and and b negligence in violation of the california uniform commercial code the trial court ruling on a motion to compel discovery and the order granting summary judgment in favor of bank on the fifth amended complaint fifth and sixth causes of action for common law negligence and gross negligence.
as we will explain,we conclude that plaintiffs arguments are without merit,and accordingly we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs,who were investors in third eye systems,llc,wrote checks payable to third eye systems,llc in march and april to purchase their investment units nine of the checks indicated third eye systems,llc as the payee one of the checks indicated third eye,and one indicated third eye systems.the checks were not negotiated by third eye systems,llc,but by a different entity,third eye systems holdings,which presented the checks for deposit into its account at bank.bank accepted the checks for deposit.the checks were marked with various endorsements,including for deposit only third eye systems holdings,third eye systems llc for deposit only,for deposit only,and for deposit only credited to the account of the within named payee,but they were not properly endorsed to transfer title from third eye systems,llc to third eye systems holdings.
according to plaintiffs,they were injured when the funds from their checks were deposited into the account of third eye systems holdings,because,among other things,third eye systems,llc was worth percent less without the funds from plaintiffs investments.further,plaintiffs claim that because they did not have an ownership interest in third eye systems holdings,they could not access its assets purchased with plaintiffs funds to recoup their eventual investment losses.
a.the nature of this litigation and the operative complaint 
in this action,plaintiffs sued various entities based on the fact that the checks were not deposited into the bank account of third eye systems,llc.they sued both the drawee banks and brokerage firms,the institutions that issued the checks plaintiffs wrote to purchase their investment units,and the depositary,the bank at which third eye systems holdings,deposited plaintiffs checks.in mills i and mills ii,we affirmed the trial court orders disposing of plaintiffs claims against the drawee banks and brokerage firms.the issues in this appeal concern only bank.
the operative fifth amended complaint contains four causes of action against bank.
the fifth and sixth causes of action are for common law negligence and gross negligence,alleging that bank negligently or with gross negligence breached its duty of ordinary commercial banking care in the handling and depositing of plaintiffs checks by failing to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that all of the plaintiffs checks were endorsed by third eye systems,llc and deposited in the bank account of third eye systems,llc.
the eighth and ninth causes of action are based on alleged violations of the california uniform commercial code.the eighth cause of action alleges a statutory cause of action for negligence that plaintiffs title negligence under the uniform commercial code.the ninth cause of action asserts that bank breached the presentment and transfer warranties described in sections and.
in all four causes of action plaintiffs allege that they suffered damages in the face amounts of the checks plus interest and costs.
b.the federal action 
concurrently with the litigation of this action,plaintiffs were litigating against third eye systems,llc,third eye systems holdings,and the principals of those companies,saliha miller and burke hovde,in federal court the federal action the federal action was filed in april this action was filed in march.
in the federal action,the operative complaint alleged separate claims,including breach of contract,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and violation of the securities laws of the states of washington and california.many of the claims were premised on the allegation that plaintiffs checks were improperly deposited in the bank account of third eye systems holdings,and that the funds were thereafter improperly used for purposes other than benefiting third eye systems,llc.
in,judge dana sabraw held a bench trial in the federal action.as described in judge sabraw findings of fact and conclusions of law,the only claim that the federal plaintiffs chose to present at trial was their claim for rescission on the ground that the securities were not registered as required under washington law judge sabraw ruled that the securities were required to be registered under washington law because they did not fall within that state private offering exemption.as a remedy,judge sabraw ruled that the federal plaintiffs,with the exception of john mills,were entitled to rescission plus interest and costs,conditional on their tender of the securities to the defendants.john mills was denied the remedy of rescission pursuant to the doctrine of in pari delicto because he participated in the promotion of the securities and received a commission for his services,and thus was equally responsible for the forbidden transactions.judgment was entered in the federal action in march the federal court judgment.
c.the trial court sustains bank demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action 
in this action,bank demurred to the eighth cause of action for statutory negligence under the california uniform commercial code and the ninth cause of action for breach of certain presentment and transfer warranties under sections and.as to the eighth cause of action,bank argued that the california uniform commercial code did not give rise to a cause of action for negligence in the situation presented by this case,and that in any event,it satisfied its duty of care by using an automated check processing system.as to the ninth cause of action,bank argued that as the drawers of the checks,plaintiffs were not authorized by sections and to sue the depositary bank,and that in any event,any such claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.
the trial court sustained the demurrer.the trial court stated that it found each of bank arguments highly persuasive.
d.the trial court denies plaintiffs motion to compel discovery 
in the course of this litigation,plaintiffs sought to discover the bank records of third eye systems,llc and third eye systems holdings,held by bank and documents concerning bank training of tellers concerning the depositing of checks into the proper account,and whether such training was followed in the case of plaintiffs checks.
bank opposed the motion to compel,arguing among other things that it was obligated to protect customer privacy,and it would be subject to a lawsuit if it turned over the customers private records without compulsion by legal process the discovery concerning teller training was not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and in any event,plaintiffs had failed to comply with the rules for filing a full and complete separate statement in support of their motion to compel as required by california rules of court,former rule 
the trial court denied the motion to compel on both substantive and procedural grounds.it stated,plaintiffs have failed to convince the court that bank objections are unfounded or should be disregarded with respect to the discovery requests at issue.the motion itself is confusing and plaintiffs main legal points are unsupported by any legal authority,the argument that there is no third party right of privacy with respect to third eye systems,llc and third eye systems holdings.further,motions to compel require an accompanying separate statement.while plaintiffs have submitted what they titled a separate statement,it fails to comply with former rule and has been disregarded.
e.the trial court grants bank motion for summary judgment on the remaining fifth and sixth causes of action for common law negligence and gross negligence 
bank brought a motion for summary judgment on the remaining two causes of action,namely,the fifth and sixth causes of action for common law negligence and gross negligence.
bank set forth three separate and independent bases for its summary judgment motion.first,bank argued that the federal court judgment gave rise to collateral estoppel,in the form of issue preclusion,which barred plaintiffs causes of action for negligence and gross negligence.second,according to bank,because miller and hovde simply could have supplied the missing endorsements from third eye systems,llc had bank initially refused to deposit the checks into the account of third eye systems holdings,plaintiffs could not establish that bank alleged negligence in accepting the checks without the proper endorsements caused plaintiffs investment losses.third,bank argued that under the facts presented,plaintiffs could not establish that bank owed them a duty of care.
after the parties completed their briefing of the summary judgment motion,the trial court issued a written tentative ruling,stating that the motion will be ruled upon following further discussion at oral argument on the issues of duty,causation and whether plaintiffs were damaged in light of the outcome in the federal action.after hearing argument and taking the matter under submission,the trial court issued a written ruling.the trial court stated,the court,having taken the matter under submission and having considered the parties arguments confirms its tentative ruling.the court was not persuaded by the points made by plaintiffs at the hearing.accordingly,the motion is granted,effectively doing away with the case as it pertains to bank.the trial court then entered judgment in favor of bank.
in plaintiffs appeal from the judgment,they challenge the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action the ruling denying their motion to compel discovery and the ruling on the motion for summary judgment.
discussiona.plaintiffs challenge to the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action is without.standard of review

the ninth cause of action 
the ninth cause of action alleges that bank breached certain presentment and transfer warranties under sections and the cause of action is titled third party beneficiaries of bank presentment and transfer warranties under the uniform commercial code to the payor banks.according to the fifth amended complaint,plaintiffs as drawers of checks whose accounts were charged are payors within the meaning of section of the uniform commercial code,and may maintain an action against the collecting bank bank based on that section warranties.bank breached those warranties because plaintiffs checks were not endorsed by third eye systems,llc and deposited in the bank account of third eye systems,llc.
a.the demurrer questions the applicability of sections and 
we begin with a review of the statutory provisions cited in the ninth cause of action.
section describes the following transfer warranty 
a a customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that all of the following are applicable 
the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item.
all signatures on the item are authentic and authorized.
the item has not been altered.
the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment subdivision a of section of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor.
the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or,in the case of an unaccepted draft,the drawer.
if the item is a demand draft,creation of the item according to the terms on its face was authorized by the person identified as drawer,subd.a.
the statute plainly describes the transferee as the recipient of the warranty.because plaintiffs were the drawers of the checks,they could not have been the transferees of the checks.
section sets forth presentment warranties,which apply when a check is presented for payment to the bank of the person who wrote the check 
a if an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft,i the person obtaining payment or acceptance,at the time of presentment,and ii a previous transferor of the draft,at the time of transfer,warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith that all of the following apply 
the warrantor is,or was,at the time the warrantor transferred the draft,a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft.
the draft has not been altered.
the warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the purported drawer of the draft is unauthorized.
if the draft is a demand draft,creation of the demand draft according to the terms on its face was authorized by the person identified as drawer,subd.a.
in this case,the drawee banks were plaintiffs banks and bank was the person obtaining payment at the time of presentment,subd.a.thus,section,as applied here,indicates that in presenting the checks for payment to plaintiffs banks,bank was making certain warranties to plaintiffs banks,but not to plaintiffs themselves.
in its demurrer,bank argued that on their face,neither section nor section describe warranties inuring to the benefit of the drawers of the checks,who in this case would be plaintiffs.it explained that the warranty in section,subdivision a runs to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank ibid,and the warranty in section,subdivision a runs to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith ibid.bank also pointed to a statement in the official comment to uniform commercial code ucc section,which expressly rejects the lead opinion in sun n sand,united california bank cal d,sun n sand,which held that a presentment warranty inured to the drawer of the check.there is no warranty made to the drawer under subsection a when presentment is made to the drawee in sun n sand the court held that under the former statute a warranty was made to the drawer of a check when the check was presented to the drawee for payment.the result in that case is rejected.west laws ann,com.to.
plaintiffs implicitly concede that sections and are not applicable,and rely instead on section as the basis for their breach of warranty cause of action 
apparently crediting the authority cited by bank,plaintiffs implicitly concede that as drawers of the checks they can not state a claim for breach of warranty under sections and.instead,on appeal as in the trial court plaintiffs focus on a different statutory provision that is not expressly pled in the fifth amended complaint,namely section.plaintiffs argue that r egardless of the title or label of the ninth cause of action,if the factual allegations in the fifth amended complaint state a valid cause of action on any available legal theory,bank d emurrer should be overruled.
section states in relevant part if a customer delivers an item to a depositary bank for collection b the depositary bank warrants to collecting banks,the payor bank or other payor,and the drawer that the amount of the item was paid to the customer or deposited to the customer account.plaintiffs argue that under section,bank gave a warranty to them as other payor s that the checks were paid to the customer or deposited to the customer account,subd.b.they further argue that bank breached that warranty by depositing the funds into the bank account of third eye systems holdings,when that entity was not the payee on the checks.
however,because the warranty in section,subdivision b is merely that the depositary bank paid the customer or made a deposit into the customer account,and it is undisputed that third eye systems holdings,was a customer of bank,bank would not have breached section,subdivision b if that provision merely set forth a warranty that bank paid its customer the funds that it collected.thus,plaintiffs advocate that we look beyond the plain language of the statute and read section,subdivision b as creating a warranty that the depositary bank paid,or made a deposit in favor of,the payee of the check,not just a bank customer.under plaintiffs interpretation of the statute,bank would have breached its warranty under section,subdivision b because it did not pay or make a deposit in favor of the payee of the checks,which was third eye systems,llc.as we will explain,we reject plaintiffs interpretation of the statute for several reasons.
first,we rely on the fact that the term customer is expressly defined in the statute as a person having an account with a bank or for whom a bank has agreed to collect items,including a bank that maintains an account at another bank,subd.a.thus,as defined in the statute,the term customer is not synonymous with the payee of a check.employing the term customer as defined in section,subdivision a,the meaning of section,subdivision b is that a depositary bank necessarily warrants that it has made payment to or a deposit into the account of the person who has an account at the bank or who has asked the depositary bank to collect items on its behalf.
second,we find it significant that checks are often endorsed by the payee and then transferred to a third party,who becomes the holder of the check,and that third party then may present the check to the depositary bank for deposit or payment in such an instance,when it presents the check to the payor bank,the depositary bank would not be able to warrant that it had made payment to,or a deposit in favor of,the payee of the check.however,the depositary bank is easily able to warrant that has made payment to,or a deposit in favor of,its customer,the third party.thus,the most reasonable reading of the statute comports with its plain language,namely that the depositary bank warrants that it is making payment to its customer,as defined in section,subdivision a,not to the payee of the check.
third,the official comment to ucc section is consistent with our reading of the statute.the official comment states that the statute satisfies the need for a receipt of funds by the depositary bank by imposing on that bank a warranty that it paid the customer or deposited the item to the customer account.this warranty runs not only to collecting banks and to the payor bank or nonbank drawee but also to the drawer,affording protection to these parties that the depositary bank received the item and applied it to the benefit of the holder.pt.west laws,supra,com.to,italics added.significantly,the official comment to ucc section states that the depositary bank warrants that the item has been applied to the benefit of the holder of the item,not that the item has been applied to the benefit of the payee identified on that item 
in support of their interpretation of the statute,plaintiffs rely on case law developed under the former version of section,which existed prior to the revision of the california uniform commercial code in former section stated,in part,that a depositary bank which has taken an item for collection may supply any indorsement of the customer which is necessary to title a statement placed on the item by the depositary bank to the effect that the item was deposited by a customer or credited to his account is effective as the customer indorsement.former,subd,added by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch.plaintiffs point out that in applying former section,lewis telephone employees credit union cir stated that f or a supplied indorsement to be effective under former,subdivision,the payee of the check and the customer in whose account the check is deposited must be one and the same.id.at,citing tennis courts,citizens bank and trust of maryland,holding that the bank was permitted under the statute to supply the indorsement only of its customer kelly central bank and trust,bank was not authorized to supply the indorsement of a krump const.first nat.bank of nevada,holding that a gency authority to supply missing endorsements accrues only when a party becomes a customer of the bank.
plaintiffs argue that based on lewis and the case law it cites,the term customer in the current version of section,subdivision b should be read as referring to the payee of the check.we reject plaintiffs argument.lewis and the cases it relies on stand for nothing more than the unremarkable proposition that a bank does not have the authority to supply an endorsement for a party other than its own customer.thus,the authorities cited by plaintiffs do not establish that the term customer in former section means payee.indeed,those authorities make a clear distinction between the term customer and payee because they hold that a bank may only supply the endorsement of a payee if that payee is a customer.further,we note that the interpretation of the term customer in former section,subdivision a has little relevance to the proper interpretation of that term in the current version of section,subdivision b.the two provisions deal with distinct subjects.the current version of section,subdivision b concerns depositary banks warranties concerning payment or deposit of the amount received from the payor.former section,subdivision a,in contrast,concerned the situations in which a depositary bank could supply an endorsement.
having concluded that section does not describe a warranty on the part of a depositary bank that it paid,or made a deposit on behalf of,the payee of the check,we reject plaintiffs attempt to oppose the demurrer to the ninth cause of action by relying on section.even liberally construing the ninth cause of action to allege that bank violated the warranty set forth in section,subdivision b,plaintiffs still would not state a cause of action accordingly,the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the ninth cause of action 
eighth cause of action 
the eighth cause action is titled negligence under the uniform commercial code.plaintiffs allege that bank breached their sic duty of care to plaintiffs pursuant to the uniform commercial code,subds.a,e in the handling and depositing of plaintiffs checks.more specifically,defendant bank negligently breached that duty by failing to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that all of the plaintiffs checks were endorsed by third eye systems,llc and deposited in the bank account of third eye systems,llc.
as one of their two bases for demurrer to the eighth cause of action,bank argued that under the facts pled in the complaint,the california uniform commercial code does not give plaintiffs a statutory cause of action for negligence against bank.plaintiffs argued that a lthough sun n sand carved out a narrow exception for common law negligence,that exception is limited to common law negligence.as we will explain,under the facts of this case no provision in the california uniform commercial code allows plaintiffs to bring a statutory cause of action for negligence against bank,and thus the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action.
as an initial matter,it is important to understand that the eighth cause of action concerns a statutory cause of action for negligence rather than a common law claim.thus,we are not concerned with whether a common law cause of action is viable under the facts of this case we thus look to the california uniform commercial code to determine whether it sets forth a cause of action for negligence by a drawer against a depositary bank in the specific situation presented here,namely,the depositary bank deposit of checks with missing endorsements.union fire ins.allfirst bank d,concluding that although certain portions of the ucc as adopted by maryland created the potential for a statutory claim for negligence against a depositary bank,the plaintiff claim for statutory negligence failed because it did not identify a portion of the ucc that applied to the specific situation presented.
in their eighth cause of action,plaintiffs specifically identify section,subdivisions a and e as the basis for their statutory negligence claim.however,those provisions do not establish that a depositary bank has a duty of care to a drawer that could form the basis for a negligence claim.instead,the statute establishes that the statutory provisions of the division of the california uniform commercial code dealing with bank deposits and collections may be varied by agreement,but the parties to the agreement can not disclaim a bank responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure,subd.a and describes t he measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item,subd.e.because they neither create a duty on the part of depositary banks to drawers nor authorize a cause of action for negligence in any specific situation,section,subdivisions a and e can not serve as the basis for a statutory negligence cause of action in this case.
in their briefing,plaintiffs argue that they have a negligence cause of action against bank pursuant sections,and,subdivision a.however,as we will explain,none of those statutory provisions establishes that a drawer has a statutory cause of action for negligence against a depositary bank which deposits checks with missing endorsements.
we begin our discussion with section.that provision governs the rights and liabilities of persons paying or taking an instrument bearing a fraudulent indorsement made by an employee who has been given responsibility by his or her employer for such instruments and covers both forged indorsements made in the name of the employer to instruments payable to the employer and indorsements made in the name of payees of instruments issued by the employer.lee newman,wells fargo bank th,d,citation omitted.through its provisions,s ection adopts the fundamental principle that the risk of loss for fraudulent indorsements by employees entrusted with responsibility for checks should fall on the employer rather than the bank that takes the check or pays it.id.at,d.this loss allocation principle,however,is tempered by the doctrine of comparative negligence section,subdivision b provides that,if the party paying the instrument or taking it for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure contributes to loss resulting from the fraud,the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.ibid.thus,for cases falling within the scope of section,that provision authorizes a statutory cause of action for negligence against a depositary bank.lee newman,at,d.the instant case,however,does not fall within the scope of section,as it does not concern fraudulent endorsements made by an employee.thus,plaintiffs may not rely on section as a statutory basis for their claim that bank is liable for negligently accepting checks with missing endorsements.see clark clark,the law of bank deposits,collections and credit cards ed.check fraud forged instruments,c,observing that neither ucc nor cover the situation of missing endorsements,as opposed to forged endorsements.
plaintiffs next rely on section.that provision applies in two situations,namely,when an imposter induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the imposter by impersonating the payee,subd.a and when a person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable does not intend the person identified as payee to have an interest in the instrument,or the payee is a fictitious person,subd.b.section also creates a statutory cause of action against a depositary bank by a drawer.it states that w ith respect to an instrument to which subdivision a or b applies,if a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument,the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss,subd.d see also gina chin first union bank,ruling that the virginia equivalent of gave rise to a statutory negligence action by a drawer against a depositary bank in the situation where an employee forged checks.the instant case does not fall within the scope of section,subdivisions a or b because it does not concern imposters or a check made out to a fictitious person or to a person whom the drawer did not intend to pay.thus,plaintiffs may not rely on section to support their cause of action for statutory negligence against bank.
we next consider plaintiffs reliance on section.that provision states in relevant part 
a a person whose failure to exercise ordinary care contributes to an alteration of an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery against a person who,in good faith,pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.
b under subdivision a,if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure contributes to loss,the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
section does not apply here.the statute expressly concerns situations in which an instrument has been altered or a signature has been forged.the instant case does not concern either of those situations.further,although we express no view on the matter,it is debatable whether in situations covered by the subject matter of section,the statute gives rise to a cause of action for negligence by a drawer against a depositary bank.see,halifax wachovia bank,concluding that the virginia equivalent of did not give rise to a cause of action for negligence by a drawer against a depositary bank,but citing authorities reaching a contrary conclusion white sands forest first national bank,concluding that the new mexico equivalent of did not give rise to a cause of action for negligence by a drawer against a depositary bank,but citing commentary to the contrary.
finally,plaintiffs rely on section,subdivision a.that provision states that a collecting bank shall exercise ordinary care in presenting an item or sending it for presentment.presentment is defined as a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument to pay the instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged to pay the instrument or,in the case of a note or accepted draft payable at a bank,to the bank,or to accept a draft made to the drawee,subd.a see also,subd.c adopting definition of p resentment appearing in.in the instant case,plaintiffs do not contend that bank was negligent in how it handled the presentment of their checks to the payor banks.instead,plaintiffs complain about bank conduct in accepting their checks for deposit into the account of third eye systems holdings,when the checks were missing the proper endorsements.thus,plaintiffs may not rely on section,subdivision a as a basis for their statutory negligence cause of action.
in sum,plaintiffs have identified no provision in the california uniform commercial code that supports their statutory negligence claim against bank.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court properly sustained bank demurrer to the eighth cause of action.
b.the motion to compel discovery 
we next consider plaintiffs challenge to the trial court order denying their motion to compel discovery.we apply an abuse of discretion standard of review to the trial court ruling denying a motion to compel discovery.saeta superior court th,d.
the trial court denied the discovery motion on both substantive and procedural grounds.as we will explain,we conclude that the procedural basis cited by the trial court was a sufficient basis for the exercise of its discretion to deny the motion to compel 
as the procedural basis for it ruling,the trial court stated that plaintiffs separate statement had failed to comply with former rule which is now numbered rule.former rule required that a ny motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement,including,as at issue here,a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and the production of documents.former rule a.former rule sets forth in detail the requirements for the separate statement 
c a separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that sets forth all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.the separate statement shall be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full response.material shall not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference.the separate statement shall each discovery request,each interrogatory,request for admission,deposition question,or inspection demand to which a further response,answer,or production is following 
the text of the request,interrogatory,question,or inspection demand 
the text of each response,answer,or objection,and any further responses or answers 
a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,answers,or production as to each matter in dispute 
if necessary,the text of all definitions,instructions,and other matters required to understand each discovery request and the responses to it 
if the response to a particular discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery request,or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request,the other request and the response to it must be set forth and 
if the pleadings,other documents in the file,or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion,the party relying on them shall summarize each relevant document.former rule c,now rule c 
plaintiffs filed a separate statement in support of their motion to compel,but it did not comply with the requirements of former rule now rule.plaintiffs separate statement did not set forth bank full response to each of the interrogatories and requests for production at issue.instead,the separate statement repeatedly grouped together several discovery requests,and then stated in relevant part bank response to the group as a whole,and it significantly truncated some of the lengthier responses.further,although the separate statement contained a separate section in which plaintiffs purported to set forth,as required,a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,answers,or production as to each matter in dispute former rule c,that section was extremely confusing because it did not indicate which of the specific discovery requests the various factual and legal reasons related to,and thus did not fulfill the requirement that the statement address the factual and legal reasons for compelling each matter in dispute.ibid.
in their appellate briefing,plaintiffs acknowledge that they did not set forth the full response to each of the discovery requests.plaintiffs argue,however,that they nevertheless fulfilled the requirement of former rule because they attached to their separate statement bank actual responses to the discovery requests,and bank full responses could be found in those documents.however,former rule forbids this practice,stating that t he separate statement shall be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full response.material shall not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference.former rule c,now rule c.in sum,plaintiffs plainly did not comply with former rule.
we conclude that because plaintiffs did not comply with the requirements of former rule,the trial court was well within its discretion to deny the motion to compel discovery on that basis.neary regents of university of california d.describing trial court denial of motions to compel discovery because of a nonconforming separate statement.
plaintiffs challenge to the ruling granting summary judgment in favor of bank on the remaining causes of action for common law negligence and gross negligence 
we next consider plaintiffs challenge to the trial court ruling granting bank motion for summary judgment on the remaining causes of action in the fifth amended complaint,namely,the causes of action for common law negligence and gross negligence.
legal standard applicable to a motion for summary judgment 
we begin our analysis with a review of the legal standards applicable to a motion for summary judgment.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision c provides that summary judgment or summary adjudication is to be granted when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a defendant moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.a defendant may meet this burden either by showing that one or more elements of a cause of action can not be established or by showing that there is a complete defense.ibid.a ll that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action the defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element.id.at,d,fn.omitted.a defendant moving for summary judgment may establish that an essential element of the plaintiff cause of action is absent by reliance on the pleadings,competent declarations,binding judicial admissions contained in the allegations of the plaintiff complaint,responses or failures to respond to discovery,and the testimony of witnesses at noticed depositions.eisenberg alameda newspapers,th,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar,at,d.

collateral estoppel 
bank first argument in favor of summary judgment is grounded in the concept of collateral estoppel.relying on the federal court judgment,bank argues that plaintiffs are collaterally estopped under the doctrine of issue preclusion from litigating certain issues against bank in this action 
one aspect of the res judicata doctrine is c ollateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,which precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.mycogen monsanto cal th,d,mycogen.collateral estoppel may be applied if the following threshold requirements are met first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.lucido superior court cal d,lucido.the party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.ibid.
an issue is necessarily decided in a prior proceeding if the issue was not entirely unnecessary to the judgment in the prior proceeding.lucido,supra,cal d at.an issue is actually litigated w hen it is properly raised,by the pleadings or otherwise,and is submitted for determination,and is determined a determination may be based on a failure of proof people sims cal d.as witkin explains,clearly,a former judgment is not a collateral estoppel on issues which might have been raised but were not just as clearly,it is a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised,even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented were not.witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment,see also interinsurance exchange of the auto.club superior court d.interinsurance exchange quoting witkin.
bank identifies two issues that it contends plaintiffs are precluded from relitigating in this action.first,bank argues that the issue of who is liable for plaintiffs investment loss in third eye systems,llc was established in the federal action.second,bank contends that the federal action encompassed the issue of whether bank caused the loss to plaintiffs by depositing checks payable to third eye systems,llc into the account of third eye systems holdings,with respect to this second issue,bank contends that the federal court necessarily determined that p laintiffs did receive ownership of their investment units in third eye systems,llc,and thus p laintiffs can not now argue that they incurred damages as a result of bank alleged negligence or gross negligence in depositing their checks.
in this case,some of the requirements for collateral estoppel are undisputed.specifically,the parties do not dispute that the decision in the federal action is now final and that there was a decision on the merits.the parties also do not dispute that plaintiffs,who are the parties against whom issue preclusion is sought,were plaintiffs in the federal action.however,the parties do dispute the other three requirements for collateral estoppel,namely,whether the issues that bank seeks to preclude are identical to issues decided in the federal action,and whether the issues were both actually litigated and necessarily decided in the federal action.
a.the issue of who is liable for plaintiffs investment losses 
we first examine bank contention that the federal action determined the issue of who is liable for plaintiffs investment loss in third eye systems,llc.as we will explain,we conclude that the issue of bank liability to plaintiffs for their investment losses was not decided in the federal action,and thus plaintiffs are not precluded by collateral estoppel from litigating that issue in this action.
we focus our analysis on the question of whether the identical issues were presented in both cases.the identical issue requirement addresses whether identical factual allegations are at stake in the two proceedings,not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the same.lucido,supra,cal d at.bank describes the issue to be precluded as who is liable for plaintiffs investment loss in third eye.however,that statement of the issue is not analytically precise.described more precisely,the ultimate issue presented in the federal action was whether third eye systems,llc,third eye systems holdings,miller and hovde were liable to plaintiffs.the factual issues actually litigated,as shown by judge sabraw findings of fact and conclusions of law,were whether the securities that the federal plaintiffs paid for were exempt from the registration requirements of the washington securities laws because they fell under the private offering exemption and whether john mills was sufficiently involved as a promoter of the securities that he was barred from obtaining rescission under the doctrine of in pari delicto.judge sabraw findings on those factual issues are not dispositive of the negligence claims in this case.
in sum,the federal action simply did not encompass the issue of whether bank was liable to plaintiffs for their investment losses.the issues in the two actions are accordingly not identical as required to create collateral estoppel 
b.the issue of whether plaintiffs were injured as a result of bank alleged negligence or gross negligence 
we next examine bank contention that by virtue of the facts established in the federal action,plaintiffs are unable to show that they sustained any injury due to bank alleged negligence and gross negligence.
as we have explained,bank contends that in ordering rescission,judge sabraw necessarily determined that p laintiffs did receive ownership of their investment units in third eye systems,llc,and thus p laintiffs can not now argue that they incurred damages as a result of bank alleged negligence or gross negligence in depositing their checks.put simply,bank takes the position that due to judge sabraw purported determination of the ownership issue,plaintiffs are not able to argue in this action that they were injured when,due to bank alleged negligence,they were prevented from taking ownership of investment units in third eye systems,llc.
without even determining whether there is merit to bank contention that judge sabraw decision gave rise to collateral estoppel on the issue of whether plaintiffs became owners of the investment units,we reject bank argument because it contains a flawed assumption concerning plaintiffs position as to how their injuries arose.contrary to bank assumption,plaintiffs theory as to how their injuries arose does not depend on an allegation that they failed to receive ownership of the investment units due to bank crediting the checks to third eye systems holdings.
instead,plaintiffs contend that they sustained injury because,among other things,the value of third eye systems,llc was less than it would have been had third eye systems,llc been capitalized with plaintiffs funds,rather than losing that capital when plaintiffs checks were deposited into the account of third eye systems holdings.indeed,plaintiffs claim that their investment units were worth at least less because third eye systems,llc never received the funds from plaintiffs.further,plaintiffs explain that because their funds were placed into the account of third eye systems holdings,that entity instead of third eye systems,llc purchased a public company using plaintiffs funds.because third eye systems,llc did not purchase the public company,it lost one of its major anticipated assets,and plaintiffs,as investors in third eye systems,llc,lost a significant asset to sell to recoup some of their losses.
accordingly,even if bank was able to establish,through the decision in the federal action,that plaintiffs had become owners of third eye systems,llc investment units,plaintiff ability to show that they were injured would not be undermined.bank thus has not established that the federal judgment provides a basis for entry of judgment in this action on collateral estoppel grounds.
as a further ground for summary judgment,bank argued that plaintiffs can not establish that bank alleged negligence was the cause of plaintiffs investment loss.we agree.
bank argued it is undisputed that miller and hovde,as managing partners and general managers of third eye systems,llc,had the authority to supply endorsements enabling checks payable to third eye systems,llc to be deposited into third eye systems holdings,and thus plaintiffs checks would have ended up in the account of third eye systems holdings,in any event,regardless of bank actions.bank argued that if hovde and miller had the absolute power and right to move around the money of the two third eye entities however they chose,bank alleged action of depositing p laintiffs checks into accounts of third eye systems holdings,was not the cause of p laintiffs investment loss.thus,according to bank,although plaintiffs state that their damages were caused by bank negligent acceptance of plaintiffs checks for deposit into third eye systems holdings,account,bank would not be the legal cause of those damages.
we begin our analysis with the applicable legal principles.to prevail on their causes of action for negligence and gross negligence,plaintiffs would have to establish that bank negligence was a substantial factor in causing their injury.rutherford,cal th,d.except in situations involving concurrent independent causes which no one contends is the case here,the actor negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.viner,supra,cal th at,d,quoting rest d torts.applying this principle,bank contends that the harm to plaintiffs would have occurred even if bank had not been negligent in accepting the checks into the account of third eye systems holdings,without the necessary endorsement by third eye systems,llc,because miller and hovde would have supplied the necessary endorsement if bank had refused to deposit the checks.
in support of its motion for summary judgment,bank submitted declarations from miller and hovde.both miller and hovde stated that they held the positions of founder,principal,managing partner and general manager of third eye systems holdings,and third eye systems,llc miller stated that she treated the two companies as the same entity,and hovde stated that he treated the bank accounts of the two companies as interchangeable.both miller and hovde stated that they had complete authority to take title to checks made payable to third eye systems,llc and to deposit those checks in whatever account they elected.specifically,with regard to plaintiffs checks,hovde and miller stated that they directed each of the checks into the account of third eye systems holdings,at bank,and bank followed their directions.further,they both stated that they would have corrected any irregularities in the endorsements if bank had refused to deposit the checks.
based on these facts,bank argued in its motion for summary judgment that bank was not a substantial cause of any injury stemming from the fact that plaintiffs checks were deposited into the bank account of third eye systems holdings,because if bank had refused to deposit the checks into the account of third eye systems holdings,miller and hovde would have simply endorsed the checks on behalf of third eye systems,llc and thereby transferred title of the checks to third eye systems,llc.in short,bank argued that even without any improper conduct by bank,plaintiffs checks still would have ended up in the account of third eye systems holdings,and thus the harm would have been sustained even if bank had not been negligent.viner,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
bank relies on in re mcmullen,supra,which employed a similar causation analysis.the facts in in re mcmullen are analogous to this case.the depositary bank accepted checks for deposit to the account of mcmullen oil.pension plan,even though the payee of the checks was mcmullen oil,a different entity.id.at.the checks were not endorsed by mcmullen oil,and instead were stamped with the endorsement of the mcmullen oil.pension plan.ibid.after mcmullen oil went into bankruptcy,its creditors trust alleged that the depositary bank was negligent in accepting the checks for deposit into the account of mcmullen oil.pension plan.id.at.on summary judgment,the undisputed evidence was that the president of mcmullen oil was authorized prior to bankruptcy to receive,endorse and deposit checks made payable to mcmullen oil,and that he was the person who caused the checks to be deposited into the account of mcmullen oil.pension plan.id.at.the court concluded that the element of causation could not be established for the checks deposited before the bankruptcy because if the bank had refused the deposits on the grounds of the missing indorsements,the court infers from the evidence presented that the president of mcmullen oil would have provided the missing indorsements.id.at.
we find mcmullen analysis to be persuasive and to be applicable here.the fact that miller and hovde had the authority to endorse the checks on behalf of third eye systems,llc,and maintain that they would have done so,means that plaintiffs checks would have been deposited in the account of third eye systems holdings,even in the absence of any negligence by bank.thus,the element of causation can not be established.
in an attempt to dispute that miller and hovde had the authority to endorse checks on behalf of third eye systems,llc,and thereby transfer them to third eye systems holdings,plaintiffs submitted their own declarations,each stating that their checks were not made payable to either miller or hovde,and that t herefore,they understood that miller and hovde did not have any authority to take title to checks payable to third eye systems,llc.the plaintiffs declarations further stated that they never authorized miller,hovde,or anyone else to deposit their checks into a bank account of third eye systems holdings,
however,as we have explained,the dispositive facts are that miller and hovde had the authority to endorse checks on behalf of third eye systems,llc,and that they would have supplied an endorsement from that entity if bank had required them to do so.the evidence submitted by plaintiffs does not serve to create a triable issue of fact on that subject.plaintiffs evidence addresses only whether the checks were payable to miller and hovde and whether plaintiffs authorized their checks to be deposited into the bank account of third eye systems holdings.plaintiffs evidence simply does not call into question the dispositive facts that miller and hovde had the ability to endorse checks on behalf of third eye systems,llc,in their capacity as managing partners and general managers of that entity,and that they would have corrected the endorsement if bank had insisted that they do so 
we accordingly conclude that because bank established that plaintiffs could not prevail on the necessary element of causation,summary judgment was properly granted on the causes of action for negligence and gross negligence
