national banks are required to file a suspicious activity report sar with the federal government whenever they detect a known or suspected violation of federal law or a suspicious transaction related to money laundering.a.sar are confidential.k.under federal law,national banks that are subpoenaed or otherwise requested to produce a sar are prohibited from producing the sar or providing information that would disclose whether a sar has been prepared or filed.ibid.
in this writ proceeding,petitioner union bank of california,union bank challenges a trial court order compelling production of union bank internal suspicious activity reports,which union bank claims are generated as part of its procedure for preparing sar and complying with federal reporting requirements.the trial court reasoned the internal forms comprise supporting documentation generated in the ordinary course of business and are therefore not subject to the unqualified privilege preventing disclosure of sar or their contents.we disagree and grant a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the action below arises from a ponzi scheme disguised as a successful national mortgage lending business that purportedly bilked million from more than individual investors during its brief lifespan.the plaintiffs allege that two individuals set up pinnfund usa,pinnfund,as a mortgage company to originate,purchase,and sell mortgage loans.one of the individuals behind the ponzi scheme also formed and operated three business entities,grafton partners,grafton,allied capital partners,allied,and six sigma llc six sigma,to generate and collect investment dollars to fuel the operation.contracts between each of these entities and pinnfund required all investor funds to be placed in a trust account to be used for the sole and exclusive purpose of funding loans.according to the complaint,the trust account was not used to fund loans but was instead used to pay fictional returns to earlier investors as well as to pay phony commissions and fees that enriched the two principals.
the lawsuit centers on the conduct of union bank,which opened and operated the pinnfund trust account that was allegedly looted.real parties in interest grafton,allied,and six sigma,through their trustee in bankruptcy,along with several individuals acting on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of defrauded investors collectively referred to as grafton partners filed suit against union bank,alleging fraud,conspiracy,aiding and abetting,and negligent misrepresentation.grafton partners contends,among other things,that union bank was complicit in the operation of the ponzi scheme by allowing pinnfund to set up a sham trust account that was used to transfer millions of dollars to offshore accounts.grafton partners alleges the investors losses would not have been as great and the ponzi scheme would have been uncovered earlier if union bank had taken steps to halt the illegal operation of the trust account and fulfilled its obligation to report suspicious activity to the federal government.
in an apparent attempt to learn whether union bank had filed sar reporting suspicious activity associated with the pinnfund trust account,grafton partners initially sought permission from the federal government to allow union bank to produce certain sar it had filed during the relevant time frame the office of the comptroller of the currency occ,the agency responsible for regulating national banks such as union bank,denied the request based upon a determination that sar and their contents are confidential under federal law.
during discovery grafton partners learned that union bank has in place internal procedures and forms to identify,register,and describe what might constitute suspicious activity.in particular,union bank has an internal form referred to as a form suspicious activity report form,which is filled out by bank personnel to report suspicious activities.according to union bank,the sole purpose of the form is to aid the bank in complying with its obligation under federal law to report suspicious activity and file sar.
upon learning of union bank internal suspicious activity report,grafton partners requested that union bank produce any form relating to pinnfund.grafton partners also served interrogatories requesting that union bank identify any suspicious activity it noticed with respect to the pinnfund trust account and identify all documents,including form,concerning the suspicious activity.grafton partners specifically excluded sar from the scope of its discovery requests.union bank objected to the discovery requests and refused to produce or identify its form,asserting the request was an improper attempt to circumvent the occ ruling precluding disclosure of sar,the form were privileged communications related to the sar,disclosure of the form would tend to disclose whether a sar had been filed,and grafton partners request was barred by the privilege relating to sar afforded under federal law.grafton partners moved to compel further responses to a number of discovery requests,including those that sought the form or information relating to the forms.
the trial court initially granted the motion to compel in part,ordering union bank to produce documents and further responses relating to the form the court noted,however,that if union bank failed to notify the appropriate federal authorities of this motion,then the federal authorities may intervene and request reconsideration of this order.
union bank filed a motion for reconsideration in anticipation of the filing of a brief by the occ office of the comptroller of the currency.the occ subsequently filed an amicus curiae brief in the trial court in support of union bank request for reconsideration.the occ urged the trial court to protect from discovery not just the sar but also the process of preparing a the form utilized by union bank as well as documents generated by a financial institution as part of its internal process for filing sar as required by federal law.according to the occ,to permit disclosure of the form would conflict with federal law and would undermine public policy aimed at uncovering and reporting potential criminal activity 
upon reconsideration,the trial court affirmed its decision and ordered production of the form as well as further responses to all requests concerning the form.the trial court held the sar privilege covers draft sars,the sars themselves,and any communications concerning a sar,but it found no support for the proposition that all reports of suspected or possible violations or discussion that might lead to the preparation or filing of a sar are protected by the sar privilege.
the trial court found the form sic were not part of union bank process of drafting and filing sars and instead described them as routine bank forms used by union bank for internal bank purposes as well as for initiating investigations that might lead to a sar.the court also concluded that disclosure of the form would not inform anyone whether a sar had been prepared or filed,because although percent of form result in a filed sar,some sar were prepared without a corresponding form,and one can not tell whether a sar has been filed just by looking at a.
acknowledging that occ opposition to the motion to compel suggests there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion regarding the limits of the sar privilege,the trial court found the issue appropriate for interlocutory appellate review union bank thereafter filed this petition seeking a writ of mandate pending resolution of the petition,we stayed the trial court orders to the extent they compel the production of form or otherwise direct union bank to respond to discovery requests concerning forms.we issued an order to show cause and granted occ request to file an amicus curiae brief.
discussion 
propriety and scope of review 
although writ review of discovery rulings is generally disfavored,interlocutory review by writ is the only adequate remedy when,as here,a court compels the disclosure of documents or information that may be subject to a privilege,because once privileged matter has been disclosed there is no way to undo the harm which consists in the very disclosure.raytheon superior court d.the scope of the sar privilege is an issue of first impression in the california courts,and,as the trial court recognized,there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion on the issue.under these circumstances,interlocutory writ review is appropriate.see oxy resources california llc superior court th,d.
appellate review of discovery rulings is governed by the abuse of discretion standard.where there is a basis for the trial court ruling and the evidence supports it,a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial court.citation.johnson superior court th,d.the trial court determination will be set aside only when it has been demonstrated that there was no legal justification for the order granting or denying the discovery in question.lipton superior court th,d,citing carlson superior court cal d.we defer to the trial court factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.scripps health superior court th,d.
the source and scope of the sar privilege 
evidentiary privileges are created by statute,and the courts of this state are not free to create new privileges as a matter of judicial policy but must apply only those privileges created by statute or that otherwise arise out of state or federal constitutional law,oxy resources california llc superior court,supra,th at,d.the evidence code defines statute broadly to include treaties and constitutional provisions the term is not limited to statutes codified in the evidence code or to state statutes in general,see also,evidence code enumeration of privileges does not repeal by implication privileges not listed.thus,federal statutes and treaties may supply the basis for a privilege recognized by california courts people corona d.privilege is statutory privilege under evidence code.
the sar privilege is a product of federal law.suspicious activity reports,or sar,derive from requirements imposed on financial institutions in the laundering act.see cotton privatebank and trust d,cotton.the relevant statute gives the department of the treasury the power to require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions.g.that statute also prohibits disclosing to any person involved in a reported transaction the fact the transaction has been reported,and it provides a safe harbor for reporting financial institutions,which are not liable to any person as a consequence of reporting suspicious activities.g a g a.aside from the limitation on disclosing the filing of a report to any person involved in a reported transaction,the statute does not refer to a sar privilege or the confidentiality of the reports.in addition there is no official legislative history of the laundering act.coronado bankatlantic bancorp,cir,fn.therefore,the plain language of the statute and its legislative history provide little guidance for assessing the scope of sar confidentiality afforded by federal law.
specific sar filing and confidentiality requirements are the product of federal regulations.after the enactment of the laundering act,the department of the treasury and federal banking agencies issued virtually identical implementing regulations.see,occ,federal reserve board,federal deposit insurance corporation office of thrift supervision.under occ regulations,a national bank is obligated to file a sar whenever it detects any known or suspected violation of criminal law involving insider abuse,violations aggregating or more when a suspect can be identified,violations aggregating or more regardless of whether a suspect is identified,and transactions aggregating or more that involve potential money laundering or that violate the bank secrecy act.c.completed sar are submitted to the financial crimes enforcement network of the department of the treasury fincen.b c.
the regulations also provide that sars are confidential,specifying that any national bank or person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a sar or the information contained in a sar shall decline to produce the sar or to provide any information that would disclose that a sar has been prepared or filed k,italics added.thus,the prohibition against disclosing a sar protects from discovery not just the sar and its contents,but also information that would disclose preparation of a sar.see whitney national bank karam d,whitney.the federal statute,g,as implemented by regulation,k,creates an unqualified discovery and evidentiary privilege that courts have held can not be waived.citations.whitney,supra,d at.although the regulation is broader in its prohibition against disclosure of the existence or content of a sar than is the statute,it has been held consistent and in harmony with the enabling statute.united states holihan d,holihan weil long island savings bank d,weil.
while the regulation prohibits disclosure of sar and their contents,courts have uniformly held that supporting documentation underlying a sar that is generated or received in the ordinary course of a bank business is discoverable.see whitney,supra,d at gregory bank one,indiana,d,gregory holihan,supra,d at cotton,supra,d at weil,supra,d at.the trial court relied heavily on the distinction between sar and supporting documentation in arriving at its holding,noting the regulations recognize a distinction between sar and supporting documentation but afford confidential status only to sar and their contents.see,g supporting documentation deemed filed with sar l distinguishing between sar and supporting documentation for purposes of safe harbor.the trial court also gave great weight to commentary offered by the occ when it promulgated the confidentiality regulation.responding to public comment on the proposed regulation,the occ wrote one commenter correctly noted that the proposed regulation is unclear as to whether the confidential treatment applies only to the information contained on the sar itself or also extends to the supporting documentation.the occ takes the position that only the sar and the information on the sar are confidential.
these authorities confirm that documentation supporting a sar is subject to discovery,but they beg the question of what comprises supporting documentation.the court in cotton described two types of supporting documents the first category represents the factual documents which give rise to suspicious conduct.these are to be produced in the ordinary course of discovery because they are business records made in the ordinary course of business.the second category is documents representing drafts of sar or other work product or privileged communications that relate to the sar itself.these are not to be produced because they would disclose whether a sar has been prepared or filed.cotton,supra,d at.thus,transactional and account documents such as wire transfers,statements,checks,and deposit slips are the types of documents generated in the ordinary course of business that are subject to discovery.id.at.such documents would be prepared regardless of whether a financial institution has an obligation to report suspicious activity to the federal government.
by contrast,a draft sar or internal memorandum prepared as part of a financial institution process for complying with federal reporting requirements is generated for the specific purpose of fulfilling the institution reporting obligation.these types of documents fall within the scope of the sar privilege because they may reveal the contents of a sar and disclose whether a sar has been prepared or filed.k.unlike transactional documents,which are evidence of suspicious conduct,draft sar and other internal memoranda or forms that are part of the process of filing sar are created to report suspicious conduct.
grafton partners contends that reports of suspicious activity other than sar are subject to discovery,citing gregory,supra,d regulation requires confidentiality only of sars and their contents,not of other reports of suspicious activity.id.at.likewise,the trial court held that not all reports of suspicious activity are covered by the sar privilege,and it concluded a bank may not expand the sar privilege to cover its internal reports just by merging its internal investigations with federal reporting obligations.the trial court reasoned the sar privilege is primarily intended to protect the confidentiality of communications between financial institutions and federal authorities.
we do not suggest that all reports of suspicious activity are protected by the sar privilege.we are mindful that evidentiary privileges should be narrowly construed because they prevent otherwise admissible and relevant evidence from coming to light.mckesson hboc superior court th,d.financial institutions may have risk management procedures in place for detecting suspicious activity wholly apart from their procedures for complying with federal reporting obligations.a bank may not cloak its internal reports and memoranda with a veil of confidentiality simply by claiming they concern suspicious activity or concern a transaction that resulted in the filing of a sar.
some internal reports or memoranda citing suspicious activity,however,may legitimately be part of the process for complying with federal reporting requirements.to ensure that financial institutions carry out their obligation to file sar,congress has mandated that each institution establish laundering programs,including internal policies,procedures,and controls.h.the occ had adopted regulations requiring each national bank to develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements b.a bank internal procedures may include the development and use of preliminary reports subject to various quality control checks before the bank prepares the final sar that will be filed.revealing these preliminary reports,the equivalent of draft sar,would disclose whether a sar had been prepared.
it is immaterial that these preliminary documents are not communicated to federal authorities.although the sar privilege encompasses communications between financial institutions and federal authorities,its rationale extends further.permitting the release of any sar through civil discovery could harm the law enforcement interests the laundering act was intended to promote.release of a sar could compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation,tip off a criminal wishing to evade detection,or reveal the methods by which banks are able to detect suspicious activity.furthermore,a bank may be reluctant to prepare a sar if it believes that its cooperation may cause its customers to retaliate.moreover,the disclosure of a sar may harm the privacy interests of innocent people whose names may be contained therein.cotton,supra,d at.these concerns are implicated not just by the release of a sar,but also by the disclosure of preliminary reports used to prepare a sar.compelling the production of such preliminary reports,the occ maintains,would discourage financial institutions from filing sar and could undermine the cooperative effort between federal authorities and financial institutions to combat money laundering,identity theft,embezzlement,and fraud.
the occ interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference.see olszewski scripps health cal th,d.the trial court rejected the occ interpretation,however,apparently giving greater weight to the occ comments at the time it promulgated the regulation that confidential treatment does not extend to supporting documentation.see.we find no inconsistency between the occ position in this lawsuit and its earlier statement that supporting documentation is discoverable.draft sar and similar documents prepared in the process of complying with federal reporting requirements are not supporting documents generated in the ordinary course of business that provide the factual support for suspicious activity.nothing in the occ earlier commentary on the proposed regulation suggests otherwise.see.et.indeed,to the extent the occ defined supporting documentation,it limited the scope of the term to information that would be relevant in proving the crime and the individuals who committed the crime.unlike transactional or account documents that might be evidence of a crime,internal reports or investigations of suspicious activity are not proof of the crime or the identity of the perpetrators.moreover,the occ has consistently taken the position that information on the sar is confidential,a position suggesting that draft sar and similar internal documents prepared in anticipation of the filing of a sar are confidential to the extent they contain the same information as a sar.
the trial court also relied on the facts of holihan,supra,in support of its conclusion that reports of suspicious activity other than a sar,such as the form,are subject to discovery.holihan is distinguishable.in holihan,a former bank teller charged with embezzlement sought the personnel files of other bank employees to show they had similar motives and were under suspicion in connection with the missing funds.holihan,supra,d at.the court held that sar were protected from discovery but that supporting documentation in the personnel files must be produced,provided such documentation does not disclose either the existence or contents of a sar.id.at.accordingly,the court modified the scope of the subpoena to any information contained in the specified personnel files demonstrating that any such employees were initially considered suspects with regard to the alleged embezzlement,had personal financial problems thereby establishing a potential motive to embezzle funds,or had unexplained shortages or losses attributed to them.ibid.however,the bank was not required to disclose any information establishing the existence or contents of any sar filed as to any such employee.ibid.
while holihan may stand for the proposition that all reports and investigations of suspicious activity are not necessarily covered by the sar privilege,a point with which we agree,it does not establish that all such reports other than the sar themselves are discoverable.a bank may investigate suspicious activity for reasons other than to comply with federal suspicious activity reporting requirements.documents reporting such suspicious transactions fall outside scope of the sar privilege.in holihan,there is no indication that any of the documents contained in personnel files were prepared for the purpose of investigating and filing a sar.to the extent the documents were prepared for that purpose,they would presumably fall within the category of documents the holihan court excluded from the scope of the subpoena.
we agree with the trial court that the sar privilege covers draft sar,the sar themselves,and any communication concerning a sar.however,we also hold that the sar privilege extends to documents prepared by a bank for the purpose of investigating or drafting a possible sar.see cotton,supra,d at.
union bank form is covered by the sar privilege 
the trial court found the form are not part of union bank process of drafting and filing sar,comprise routine bank forms used for internal bank purposes,and will not inform anyone whether a sar has been prepared or filed if they are disclosed.we conclude substantial evidence does not support the trial court findings.
substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence,but is evidence that is of ponderable legal significance.toyota motor sales,superior court d.where conflicting inferences may reasonably be drawn,the determination of the trial court will be accepted on appeal even though a contrary determination would likewise be upheld.citations.however,where the facts are undisputed,the issue is one of law and the appellate court is free to reach its own legal conclusion from such facts.citations.id.at.here,the relevant facts,which are drawn from the declaration and deposition of the manager of union bank risk management department,are largely undisputed.the dispute is over the legal significance of the facts.
the form is a document entitled suspicious activity report and contains much the same information as the sar form developed by the financial crimes enforcement network of the department of the treasury finc
