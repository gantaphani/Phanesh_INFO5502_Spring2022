this appeal involves a turnover action in bankruptcy pursuant to filed by the debtor,builders transport,bti.bti seeks to recover certain standby letter of credit proceeds that were drawn down and retained by the cit credit,cit,which was the assignee of bti lessor,two trees,whose two general partners are david walentas and jane walentas.the standby letter of credit was created to secure bti obligations to two trees under a lease agreement that was part of a transaction.the complicated facts surrounding the transaction in this case belie a simple conclusion.the letter of credit proceeds,minus certain lessor damages,belong to bti estate and should be turned over.we affirm the judgments of the bankruptcy and district courts as to both liability and damages.
background 
factual background 
most of the facts in this case are undisputed.quoting liberally and making changes as necessary,we largely adopt the bankruptcy court statement of the facts in its september order bti was in the trucking business.its headquarters facility located in camden,kershaw county,south carolina had been constructed with the proceeds of industrial revenue bonds,and bti leased the facility from kershaw county until.in that year,the bonds were paid,and bti was entitled to purchase the property for.
bti primary lender was cit.bti and cit entered into an amended and restated financing agreement in,which was thereafter amended from time to time,pursuant to which cit provided to bti a revolving line of credit,term loan,and letter of credit facilities,secured by virtually all of bti assets.in bti had written off worthless stock of a satellite messaging company,producing a capital loss carryforward for tax purposes that would expire on december.for several months prior to october,bti had explored selling and leasing the camden property.
in the fall of,of the capital loss carryforward remained unused and could not be used unless bti had sufficient income in that fiscal year to offset the loss.stanford dinstein was an officer and director of bti parent company,builders transport incorporated bti parent,a public company and sole shareholder of bti,and was apparently the architect of the sale and leaseback plan involving two trees that is,two trees would purchase the camden property and lease it back to bti.
in considering dinstein proposal,officers of bti and bti parent consulted their outside accountants,ernst young,who advised them concerning the structure of the deal and what facts would support the legitimacy of the sale and leaseback and hence the ability to successfully use the loss carryforward.for tax reasons,ernst young advised against having bti guarantee the obligations of two trees to cit.
on october,the board of directors of bti parent met to consider the sale and leaseback deal with two trees.at that time,david walentas was a general partner in two trees and chairman of the board of bti parent,as well as chairman of the board of bti.walentas did not attend the october board meeting,however.nor did he act on behalf of two trees,as one of its general partners,in connection with these transactions.instead,dinstein chaired that board meeting.he also represented two trees as its attorney in fact in the sale and leaseback transactions.the board,with dinstein abstaining,unanimously approved resolutions authorizing the sale and leaseback transactions between bti and two trees.
the following day,bti parent,as the sole shareholder of bti,by robert garner,its corporate secretary,executed a written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting adopting resolutions on behalf of bti approving the transactions and authorizing officers to execute and deliver the appropriate documents.that consent,attached as an exhibit to garner affidavit filed on june,states in part further resolved,that it is in the best interest of bti to obtain a letter of credit in the amount of up to million in favor of two trees securing bti lease obligations to two trees.
the deal closed on or about october.two trees purchased the camden property from bti for million and leased the property back to bti.the lease agreement provided for a term,commencing on october,with bti having the option to renew the lease for four successive periods of five years each at then fair market rent.the lease agreement provided that bti would obtain a letter of credit to secure its obligations under the lease.on or about october,kangyo bank dk bank issued a letter of credit in favor of two trees in its capacity as lessor,on behalf of bti,in the amount of million to support bti obligation to pay rent and other amounts under the lease.
two trees borrowed from cit the million it paid to bti for the camden property.in agreements executed by dinstein,two trees secured its obligation to cit with a mortgage on the camden property and with an assignment of its interest in the lease agreement with bti and in the letter of credit issued by dk bank.the rent paid by bti went directly to cit pursuant to a lockbox agreement between cit and two trees.the amount of bti monthly lease payment was,which was the amount of the note payment due from two trees to cit.had the note of two trees to cit been amortized according to its terms,two trees would still have owed cit in excess of at the end of the lease term.
cit and dk bank executed a reimbursement agreement,wherein cit was obligated to reimburse dk bank for any payments made by dk bank on standby letters of credit that dk bank issued at the request of cit,in its role as assignee of two trees.in the event that cit was obligated to reimburse dk bank for money paid under a letter of credit issued for bti benefit,the financing agreement between bti and cit obligated bti to reimburse cit for the same amount.during the course of these transactions,the financial institutions collected their fees associated with the issuance of the letter of credit and related agreements.
on may,bti parent,bti,and related companies filed for chapter of the bankruptcy code.et.subsequent to the petition date,bti continued for a few weeks to operate the business as.virtually all of bti assets secured prepetition debt to cit and to the cit financing.with court approval,bti and cit companies stipulated to the use of cash collateral by bti and to the grant of a postpetition security interest in bti assets to secure the claims of the cit companies.
it quickly became obvious to everyone involved in the case that bti efforts at reorganization as a going concern could not be successful.bti conducted a public auction of certain parts of its business on june,and the bankruptcy court approved the sale of those assets to schneider national,in an order entered on july.the asset purchase agreement between bti and schneider permitted schneider to occupy the camden property on a shared use basis with bti for four months with schneider to pay of the rent to two trees.
on july,cit,as bti lender,sent a notice to dk bank that bti obligations under the lease agreement had been accelerated.on july,dk bank notified cit,as the lender to and assignee of two trees,that because cit had accelerated the debt of bti,the letter of credit would expire in days.on july,cit,as lender to and assignee of two trees,submitted to dk bank a completed default draft for million.
on or about july,dk bank paid million to cit,as lender to two trees,and cit,as bti lender,reimbursed dk bank in the amount of million.on or about july,cit,as bti lender,charged the amount of million to bti line of credit,which was secured by property of the estate.also on july,cit,as lender to two trees,used the million received from dk bank,to pay down the debt two trees owed cit.
the sale of assets to schneider closed on august.at the closing,schneider,bti,and cit executed a termination agreement and a closing statement,which set forth the amount of cit secured claim,which included the million charge to bti line of credit for the reimbursement of dk bank.cit received payment of its claim from the purchase price paid by schneider.cit released its lien on bti assets,with the exception of certain accounts created pursuant to the termination agreement,and the financing agreement between cit and bti was terminated.
in october or november,schneider vacated the camden property bti had previously moved out.on september,two trees sold the camden property to a third party.
procedural history 
on october,bti filed a turnover complaint in the bankruptcy court against cit,two trees,david walentas,and jane walentas appellants.count i of the complaint,which is the only one at issue in this appeal,argued that the million in proceeds from the standby letter of credit constituted estate property,subject to turnover pursuant to to the extent the proceeds exceeded two trees allowed lease rejection claim under b.appellants argued,inter alia,that the letter of credit was instead part of a disguised financing transaction and was not part of the estate and therefore should not be made subject to b.the disguise may have deceived the irs,but not the bankruptcy court.
on september,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting partial summary judgment to bti as to the issue of liability,leaving the issue of damages open.two trees,david walentas,and jane walentas filed an interlocutory appeal of that order,and,on june,the united states district court for the northen district of georgia entered an order affirming the district court.on july,the bankruptcy court entered a separate order and judgment in the amount of in favor of bti against appellants.the district court affirmed the damages order on september.appellants then appealed both the liability order and the damages order to our court.
ii.discussion 
this appeal involves two issues liability and calculation of damages.after examining our jurisdiction and the appropriate standard of review,we address these issues in turn.
jurisdiction 
bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction,by reference from the district courts,over all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title.in re atlanta retail,cir citing a,b c.this matter relates to the substantive rights provided by and related provisions of the bankruptcy code and is therefore a core proceeding arising under title.the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court orders pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to d.
standard of review 
the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.in re fretz,cir.c onclusions of law,whether from the bankruptcy court or the district court,are reviewed de novo.id.the grant of summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,our review of the bankruptcy and district courts grants of summary judgment as to both liability and damages is de novo.
this is a turnover action pursuant to.there are two discernible arguments on appeal with regard to liability under this statute the standby letter of credit proceeds do not constitute property of the estate under the doctrine of independence and the standby letter of credit proceeds do not constitute property of the estate under south carolina contract law.we consider the law regarding generally before addressing these arguments.
under that statute and related sections of the code,a bankruptcy court may generally order a third party to turn property in its possession over to the debtor estate if three primary requirements are met.in re lewis,cir citing d,b,e,a.first,such property must be property of the estate.second,at the moment the debtor filed a petition,the debtor must have had the right to use,sell,or lease the property.finally,upon request,the court must ensure that the third party interest in the property is adequately protected.id.citations omitted.
property of the estate is defined broadly to include all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.id.at citing a united states whiting pools,d observing that congress intended a broad range of property to be included in the estate because reorganization would have small chance of success if property essential to running the business were excluded from the estate.while the question of whether a debtor interest constitutes property of the estate is a federal question the nature and existence of the debtor right to property is determined by looking at state law.id.quoting in re thomas,cir see also butner united states,d property interests are created and defined by state law.unless some federal interest requires a different result,there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.when that state law determination is made,federal bankruptcy law then dictates to what extent that interest is property of the estate.in re thomas,at.
the doctrine of independence 
appellants argue that the common law doctrine of independence removes the proceeds of the dk bank standby letter of credit from the property of the estate.even assuming that south carolina law recognizes this common law doctrine under its adoption of the uniform commercial code,the doctrine of independence would not remove the letter of credit proceeds from the reach of.
before addressing the application of the doctrine of independence to the facts in this case,we examine the nature of the standby letter of credit.
a standby letter of credit transaction is a agreement involving two contracts and the standby letter of credit the first party is the account party or customer the second party is the issuing institution,usually a bank the contract between the issuing party and the account party is one of the contracts involved in the letter of credit the third party to a letter of credit transaction is the beneficiary of the letter of credit.the contract between the account party and the beneficiary is one of the contracts involved in a letter of credit agreement.the letter of credit itself,an obligation between the issuer and the beneficiary,is the final prong of a letter of credit transaction.
resolution trust united trust fund,cir 
while the facts in the case are more complicated than most letter of credit transactions,based on the separate agreements and the many roles played by cit,the basic relationship among the parties under the resolution trust framework can be structured as follows.the first party customer is bti.the second party issuing institution is dk bank.the contract between bti and dk bank to establish the standby letter of credit,secured by the assets of bti estate,is the first contract.the third party beneficiary is two trees.the lease agreement between two trees and bti is the second contract and governs the rights and obligations between those two parties and the conditions pursuant to which two trees can draw down on the letter of credit to satisfy bti obligations under the lease.finally,the standby letter of credit is an obligation between dk bank and two trees,which later assigned its interests in both the letter of credit and the lease agreement to cit.
because the standby letter of credit at issue was constructed as an independent obligation between dk bank and two trees,appellants argue that bti claim for the return of the letter of credit proceeds is excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate.we do not agree.t he doctrine of independence protects only the distribution of the proceeds of the letter of credit.in re graham square,cir.as we explained in resolution trust,o nce the proceeds of a letter of credit have been drawn down,the underlying contracts become pertinent in determining which parties have a right to those proceeds.in other words,an irrevocable standby letter of credit does not nullify the obligations set forth in the underlying contracts.at emphasis added rather the letter of credit serves,among other things,to shift the burden of litigation the beneficiary of the letter of credit holds the stake during the litigation.id.here,bti has not challenged the distribution of the letter of credit proceeds by dk bank to two trees assignee,cit.rather,it challenges the right of cit to retain the letter of credit proceeds pursuant to the underlying contract between bti and two trees,which in this case is the lease agreement.the doctrine of independence is therefore inapplicable.in the next section,we examine the rights and obligations pursuant to that agreement.
whether bti has property under south carolina contract law 
south carolina law governs the lease agreement and we must therefore look first to south carolina law to determine the nature and existence of bti right to the proceeds of the dk bank standby letter of credit.see in re thomas,at.under south carolina law,t here exists in every contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.adams creel sons.as such,in the absence of any provision to the contrary,there is a duty to return the excess proceeds drawn down from the standby letter of credit that were not used to secure bti obligations under the lease.burbach investors mgmt.int l,recognizing the common law claim of conversion for a landlord improper retention of security deposit.
in justifying the retention of the entire million drawn down from the dk bank standby letter of credit,appellants contend that the letter of credit was designed to make up the difference between the actual value of bti property and the mortgage between two trees and cit.thus,according to appellants,the letter of credit secured not only bti obligation to two trees under the lease,but also two trees obligations to cit under the mortgage.
before we continue,however,we can not help but note that appellants devote voluminous attention in their appellate briefs to the issue of whether the lease is a true lease or a secured financing arrangement under b.they repeatedly urge us to recharacterize the lease as a secured financing arrangement under federal common law economic realities test so as to avoid the limitation on lessor damages under b.somewhat overlooked,in our judgment,is the legal analysis of liability under.the economic realities test pursuant to the b recharacterization analysis does not answer the more straightforward question of what rights bti has to the letter of credit proceeds under south carolina law in a analysis,which is an antecedent inquiry to any consideration of a limitation on damages under federal law.moreover,the recharacterization of the lease as a secured financing arrangement,even under south carolina law,does not necessarily insulate appellants from liability because property or at least claims to such property relating to both a true lease and a secured financing arrangement can be subject to turnover pursuant to.see in re lewis,at property of the estate is defined broadly to include all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.see also.thus,our primary inquiry under,and without regard to characterization,is what are bti rights and obligations under the lease agreement between it and two trees.
in determining what these rights and obligations are,we begin with the terms of the leasing agreement itself.under south carolina law t he intent of the parties is to be determined solely from the language of a contract,if that language is clear and unambiguous.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith havird,emphasis added.further,a court should give the terms of an unambiguous contract their plain,ordinary,and popular meaning.id.
the lease agreement provides in section that the letter of credit secured the rent and other amounts under the lease 
support for payment obligations.lessee covenants and agrees that it shall obtain and maintain in effect at all times during the term,as further assurance of the payment by lessee of all amount of rent and other obligations payable by lessee hereunder,a standby letter of credit,issued for the account of lessee or a wholly owned subsidiary of lessee,for the benefit of lessor,in an amount available to de drawn at least equal to or such lessor amount as lessor or the facility mortgagee as hereinafter defined may specify,which letter of credit shall,among other things,be assignable for security to the facility mortgagee and otherwise be substantially in the form of the standby letter of credit issued by kangyo bank,on or about the closing date,in satisfaction of lessee obligations pursuant to this section.
emphasis added.
the lease refers in section to the terms of the letter of credit.the letter of credit states the following 
this letter of credit is being issued to you in your capacity as lessor under the lease agreement dated as of october,as amended and in effect from time to time,the lease between you and builders as lessee.the credit amount is intended to support builders obligation to pay rent and other amounts under the lease.
emphasis added.
section lists an array of remedies available to two trees should a default occur.section a states that if bti abandons or vacates the property,two trees may enter upon and take possession of such leased property in order to protect it from deterioration and continue to demand the monthly rentals and other charges provided.under section b,two trees can terminate the lease and seek and take possession.section c provides 
c lessor may make demand for payment under and apply or retain,as the case may be,the amount then available to be drawn under the standby letter of credit,as its remedy for any damages sustained by lessor,arising out of termination of the lease.
section provides 
additional expenses.in addition to payments required pursuant to subsections a and b of section above,lessee shall compensate lessor for all reasonable expenses incurred by lessor in repossessing the leased property including any increase in insurance premiums caused by the vacancy of the leased property,all reasonable expenses incurred by lessor in reletting including repairs,remodeling,replacements,advertisements and brokerage fees,all reasonable concessions granted to a new tenant upon reletting including renewal options,all losses incurred by lessor as a direct or indirect result of lessee default including any appropriate action by a facility mortgagee,and a reasonable allowance for lessor administrative efforts,salaries and overhead attributable directly or indirectly to lessee default and lessor pursuing the rights and remedies provided herein and under applicable law.
emphasis added.
appellants argue that these lease provisions,especially the underlined language in section,demonstrate that the letter of credit was intended to secure the mortgage of two trees to cit,the facility mortgagee.we disagree.
as the bankruptcy court cogently observed in its september order,this argument fails based on the unambiguous opening text of section,which provides that the losses referred to in that subsection are in addition to payments required in subsections a and b,which requires the payment of rent.hence,even assuming that having to pay the note to cit was a loss,that loss and the loss of not receiving rent are the same loss,so that the loss of having to pay the note is not in addition to the loss incurred for of rent.moreover,two trees suffered no loss by having to pay back a loan because it received the proceeds of the loan.bankruptcy order at.
reviewing the agreements,we can find no provision in the lease or the standby letter of credit that would indicate that the standby letter of credit was intended to secure the mortgage of two trees to cit.thus,under south carolina contract law,bti has a claim to the standby letter of credit proceeds retained by cit based on the unambiguous language in the leasing agreement and the letter of credit.see merrill lynch,at.
even if we were to conclude that these lease provisions were ambiguous,the evidence in the record does not dictate a different result.under south carolina law,i f the vital terms of a contract are ambiguous,then,in an effort to determine the intent of the parties,the court may consider probative,extrinsic evidence.dixon dixon.in this case,it is undisputed that bti did not execute and was not liable under the two trees mortgage that bti did not execute any guaranty agreement under which bti agreed to serve as guarantor
