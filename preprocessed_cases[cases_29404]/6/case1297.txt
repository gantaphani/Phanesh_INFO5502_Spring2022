introduction 
this matter is before the court on two separate appeals.plaintiffs karl and pamela fischer appeal from a summary judgment order and final judgment in favor of defendant first international bank fib or the bank.defendant investors title company itc or escrow company appeals from a subsequent order granting the fischers motion for new trial as to itc.
the fishers appeal presents the following question when a bank enters into a written loan agreement that specifies the collateral for two different loans,and does not state that the loans will be against each other,may the bank subsequently enforce a broadly worded dragnet clause contained in the fine print of a standard form deed of trust securing one of the loans on the particular facts of this case,we conclude that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment in defendants favor on this issue.
with regard to itc appeal,we find that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant a new trial as to itc because the court failed to act within the jurisdictional time period after filing and service of the notice of motion and motion for new trial.code civ.however,we direct the trial court on remand to exercise its inherent authority to reconsider its order granting summary judgment for itc in light of this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
because the fischers appeal pertains to an order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
in,karl and pamela fischer purchased two contiguous commercial lots located at main street in ramona,california,for.they took out a construction loan from fib and invested another to construct a large family dining and recreation center on the property.
in,the fischers entered into negotiations with fib for two additional loans a takeout loan in the amount of to pay off the existing construction loan loan and an equipment loan in the amount of loan.on september,fib and the fischers entered into a written agreement regarding the terms and conditions of the loans the september agreement.the agreement was drafted by fib in the form of a letter to the fischers signed by both a loan officer and a senior vice president,to be countersigned by the fischers.according to the loan officer,the september agreement was intended to define the terms of the loans to the fischers.
the september agreement specified the identities of the borrowers,the dollar amounts of the loans,the purpose of each loan,the term of each loan,the interest rates,loan fees and packaging fees,the terms pertaining to prepayment and assumability,and the estimated closing costs.the september agreement also included the following provision specifying the collateral for each of the two loans 
collateral 
loan first deed of trust on commercial property located at main street,ramona,ca 
loan second deed of trust on commercial property located at main street,ramona,ca 
second deed of trust on single family residence located at blue sage road,poway,ca 
the agreement included express conditions pertaining to each of the loans.one of the conditions for loan was a second deed of trust on the residential property located at blue sage road,poway,ca.there was no such condition for loan.
the september agreement directed the fischers to sign and return the agreement with a check for to cover the small business administration sba packaging fees and the appraisal fees.at the end of the letter,the bank included signature lines marked acknowledged and agreed for the fischers to sign.the fischers signed the agreement and paid the requested fee to fib.
one of the stated conditions of each loan was receipt of a loan guarantee and authorization from the sba.the applications submitted to the sba,as well as the sba written approvals setting forth the conditions of the loans,indicated that the blue sage residence would be used as collateral for loan,but not for loan.the sba documentation did not include any reference to of the loans.by signing the sba approval papers,fib and the fischers accepted the sba stated conditions of the loans.
the signed september agreement contained no reference to of the loans.according to the fischers,they specifically negotiated the loan agreement so that their blue sage residence would not be collateral for loan.this was one of their main objectives in negotiating the agreement.
on september,the fischers went to the bank to sign final loan documents,including a deed of trust for their residence.they met with fib vice president steve pollett.the fischers brought a copy of the september agreement with them to this meeting.according to the fischers,pollett assured them that their home was collateral only for loan,as stated in the september agreement.the fischers pointed out that the proposed deed of trust incorrectly stated that their home would be collateral for both loans.pollett agreed that this was a mistake,and told the fischers they did not have to sign the incorrect deed of trust because their home was not needed as collateral for loan,but rather,only for loan.the bank subsequently changed the deed of trust so that the definition of the word note referred only to the loan for loan.
according to fischer,pollett said that if the fischers were to sell their blue sage residence,any equity from the sale would be used only to pay off the balance of loan.pollett stated that the simple and straightword terms in the september agreement defined the terms of the loan and were more important than all the technical language in the other documents.according to fischer,pollett told us that if we sold our home,that any funds left over after paying off the loan for would be ours to use as we pleased.we believed him and relied upon his statements and assurances to us that comported with the september,contract.
the deed of trust signed by the fischers for their blue sage residence stated in bold and capital letters that the deed was given to secure payment of the indebtedness and performance of any and all obligations of trustor under the note,the related documents,and this deed of trust.on a separate page of definitions,the word note was defined to mean the note dated september,in the principal amount of.the phrase in the principal amount of was inserted in larger print than the other definitions contained on the standard form.however,the word indebtedness was broadly defined in the fine print as follows 
the word indebtedness means all principal and interest payable under the note and any amounts expended or advanced by lender to discharge obligations of trustor or expenses incurred by trustee or lender to enforce obligations of trustor under this deed of trust,together with interest on such amounts as provided in this deed of trust.in addition to the note,the word indebtedness includes all obligations,debts and liabilities,plus interest thereon,of borrower to lender,or any one or more of them,as well as all claims by lender against borrower,or any one or more of them,whether now existing or hereafter arising,whether related or unrelated to the purpose of the note,whether voluntary or otherwise,whether due or not due,absolute or contingent,liquidated or unliquidated and whether borrower may be liable individually or jointly with others,whether obligated as guarantor or otherwise,and whether recovery upon such indebtedness may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations,and whether such indebtedness may be or hereafter may become otherwise unenforceable.
the deed of trust also included a due on sale provision giving fib the right to declare immediately due and payable all sums secured by this deed of trust upon the sale or transfer,without the lender prior written consent,of all or any part of the blue sage residence.
finally,the deed of trust contained a provision stating this deed of trust,together with any related documents,constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in this deed of trust.italics added.the phrase related documents was defined to mean and include without limitation all promissory notes,credit agreements,loan agreements,environmental agreements,guaranties,security agreements,mortgages,deeds of trust,and all other instruments,agreements and documents,whether now or hereafter existing,executed in connection with the indebtedness.
in,the fischers decided to sell their blue sage residence.before listing the property,fischer spoke to pollett.according to fischer,pollett told her that if the house were sold,loan would have to be paid off,but that the fischers could retain any excess proceeds from the sale.in reliance upon pollett representation and their own understanding of the loan agreement,the fischers sold their home.after paying off loan through escrow,there was left over from the sale.
the fischers requested that the escrow company,itc,pay the remaining to the fischers construction company,k f construction.however,fib demanded that any funds remaining from the sale of the residence be applied to loan.itc initially complied with the fischers request and issued a check for to k f construction,but itc stopped payment on the check after fib inquired of itc why its payment was short,and informed itc that the fischers were not to receive any cash out from the sale.itc then issued a check to fib for.after the fischers complained that fib had no right to the money,fib returned of the total to the fischers.
according to the fischers,they would not have sold their home if they had known that fib was going to take the money that remained after the balance of loan was paid.the fischers allege that they intended to use the proceeds from the sale of their home as working capital,and that without these funds,they were forced to sell their commercial property and business for below fair market value.
after the sale of the blue sage residence,pollett told his friend stephen fitch,an attorney,that fib did not have the right to take all the proceeds from the sale.pollett said that fib had the right to to pay off loan,but did not have the right to take the remaining.
the fischers filed suit against fib and itc alleging breach of contract,conversion and misappropriation of money,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud in the inducement,negligent misrepresentation,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and false promise.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants.in its ruling,the court assumed that the september agreement was a related document expressly incorporated by the terms set forth in the deed of trust.however,the court found that the definition of indebtedness in the trust deed gave fib the right to receive the net proceeds from the sale of the fischers residence,and to apply those funds to the balance of both loans.the court concluded that there was no conflict between the september agreement and the trust deed,and no ambiguity in the overall meaning of the contract.in light of what the court viewed as the express contractual agreement between the parties,the court found no triable issues of fact as to the bank.with regard to the claims against itc,the court ruled that summary judgment for itc was warranted because the fischers had not sustained any damages as a matter of law,since the court found the bank was entitled to receive the net proceeds from the sale of the residence.
on january,the fischers filed a notice of motion and motion for new trial as to itc.in the motion,the fischers asserted that the order granting summary judgment in itc favor was erroneous because the fischers were entitled to recover attorney fees from itc as an element of damages under the tort of another doctrine,even if the bank had a right to the net proceeds of the sale.according to the fischers,itc breached its fiduciary duties by releasing the money to fib rather than interpleading the funds,thereby causing the fischers to incur the expenses of this litigation.
on march,the court granted the fischers motion for new trial as to itc.applying the tort of another doctrine,the court found that it had improperly granted summary judgment in favor of itc.
the court entered judgment for fib on april.the fischers appeal from this judgment.itc separately appeals from the order granting the motion for new trial.

under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,summary judgment is proper where the papers submitted establish that no triable issues of material fact exist and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.on appeal,the reviewing court exercises its independent judgment,deciding whether the moving party established undisputed facts that negate the opposing party claim or state a complete defense.romano rockwell,cal th,d,see also regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.

there is a triable issue of fact whether the parties mutually agreed to of the loans 
the trial court found that the dragnet clause contained in the deed of trust defeated all of the fischers causes of action as a matter of law.finding no ambiguity as to the parties intent regarding collateralization of the loans,the court applied the literal language of the dragnet clause and concluded that the bank had a right to apply the proceeds from the sale of the fischers residence to both loans.we disagree with the trial court conclusion and find that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether the parties mutually agreed to of the loans.
a dragnet clause also known as an anaconda clause is a clause stating that a mortgage secures all the debts that the mortgagor may at any time owe to the mortgagee.california courts have upheld the general validity of dragnet provisions.union bank wendland d,citing cases.however,they have also recognized the risk that such provisions may be included in a trust deed or mortgage without the debtor knowledge or understanding.clauses such as this are often termed dragnet or anaconda,as by their broad and general terms they enwrap the unsuspecting debtor in the folds of indebtedness embraced and secured in the mortgage which he did not contemplate wong beneficial sav.loan d,citations omitted.b ecause their apparent coverage is so broad,and because the mortgagor is often unaware of their presence or implications,the courts tend to construe dragnet clauses narrowly against the mortgagee.nelson whitman,real estate finance law ed accord rest d property,mortgages.
courts in different jurisdictions have adopted widely varying approaches to broadly worded dragnet clauses that purport to apply to all existing and future debts and obligations.see generally,debts included in provision of mortgage purporting to cover all future and existing debts dragnet clause modern status,wl.in many states,a dragnet clause will not be applied to other existing debts unless such debts are explicitly described in the security agreement.wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at,citing cases.in those states,a generally worded dragnet clause that purports to cover all existing debts,but does not explicitly identify the debts covered,is insufficient as a matter of law to cover such debts see,lundgren national bank of alaska alaska.
at the opposite extreme are courts that view the literal language of a generally worded dragnet clause as conclusive evidence of the intent of the parties that the clause encompass all other debts.see,hamlin timberlake grocery.the courts in these cases reason that the parties could have limited the scope of the dragnet clause if that was their true intent,and conclude that the courts will not do for a party that which he failed to do for himself.citation.clovis nat.bank harmon.
in a number of jurisdictions,courts have adopted an approach somewhere between these two extremes.these courts examine a variety of factors to determine whether the parties intended the dragnet clause to apply to existing debts.however,they do not regard the literal language of a broad dragnet clause as constituting controlling evidence of the parties intent.some of these courts regard a boilerplate dragnet clause that does not specifically list other debts as being ambiguous as to whether the antecedent debt is secured by the agreement.wallace united mississippi bank so d.the factors these courts consider in assessing the intent of the parties include whether the dragnet clause is boilerplate whether the other debts are of the same kind as the primary debt whether the other loans are listed in the dragnet clause and whether the debt which the lender seeks to have included in the dragnet clause is otherwise fully secured.ibid.
california courts have taken an intermediate position with regard to the validity of dragnet clauses.the courts have rejected the view that a broadly worded dragnet clause may never be applied to other existing or contemporaneous debts.however,california courts have consistently adhered to a construction of such clauses that depends more on the actual expectations of the parties than the literal wording of the boilerplate clause.ostayan serrano reconveyance th,d,citing union bank wendland,supra,d at.accord wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at.
because a dragnet clause is one of the provisions least likely to be understood by a layperson reading the fine print of a deed of trust,california limits the enforcement of such a provision to those transactions where objective evidence discloses the intention of the debtor and the creditor to enlarge the lien to include other obligations.miller starr,california real estate ed.the proponent of a dragnet clause bears the burden of establishing that the parties intended all existing or contemporaneous loans to be included within its scope.wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at.bernhardt,california mortgage and deed of trust practice ed.
a trust deed containing a dragnet clause that is printed on a standard bank form is considered a contract of adhesion under california law.lomanto bank of america d.see also kirk source one mortgage services th,d standardized deeds of trust are contracts of adhesion.although contracts of adhesion are generally enforceable according to their terms,a provision contained in such a contract can not be enforced if it does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or adhering party.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,graham,cal d,see also rest d contracts,where the other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting such assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term,the term is not part of the agreement.
california courts have examined a number of factors in determining whether a broadly worded dragnet clause was mutually intended by the parties to cover preexisting or contemporaneous debts.some of the relevant factors articulated in the case law include the language and specificity of the dragnet clause whether the parties were aware of the dragnet clause and appreciated its significance whether the other loans were of the same type or character as the primary loan and whether the bank relied upon the dragnet clause as the security for the other loans wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at.gates nat.bank d.
applying these general principles,we do not find an objectively clear and unambiguous expression of mutual intent to loan and loan.preliminarily,the presence of the dragnet provision would have been discernable to a borrower only by from the highlighted security provision to the fine print of a,definition of the word indebtedness filled with legal jargon that would have been incomprehensible to the average layperson.the first part of the definition of indebtedness expressly referred only to the note for loan.yet,the second part purported to make the deed act as security for all other obligations,debts and liabilities in language so sweeping that it encompassed even debts barred by any statute of limitations or otherwise unenforceable.
we find it significant that the deed of trust for the fischers residence expressly referred to the note for loan,but never even mentioned loan.because it is easy to include specific existing obligations when that is the parties intent,failure to do so permits the court to infer that no such intent existed or that,if it did,it was a secret intent harbored by the creditor and not shared with the debtor.bernhardt,california mortgage and deed of trust practice,supra,at hess ford motor cal th,d,finding that release applicable to all persons,firms,corporations,associations or partnerships may not have been intended to release ford motor company because the release did not specifically name ford.the fact that loan was fully and separately secured by the fischers business further supports an inference that the parties did not mutually intend.wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at.the patently overinclusive language of the dragnet clause also suggests that it was not within the actual expectations of the parties.for example,we sincerely doubt that anyone would knowingly post his residence as collateral for unenforceable obligations,debts,and liabilities.
other than the boilerplate language of the dragnet clause,the only factor supporting a contrary inference is that the loans were related to each other in kind and purpose.wong beneficial sav.loan,supra,d at.however,this factor does not carry great weight in light of the fact that each loan was separately secured as part of a single transaction.if the parties had intended the loans to be,it would have been a simple matter for the bank to draw up the loan documents for each loan so that they referred specifically to the other.
the most critical factor in our decision is the fact that the deed of trust expressly incorporated by reference all other related documents into the overall agreement.the deed broadly defined related documents to include without limitation all loan agreements and all other instruments,agreements and documents,whether now or hereafter existing,executed in connection with the indebtedness.
the september agreement falls squarely within this definition of a related document.this agreement was executed by the fischers and the bank in connection with the loan secured by the trust deed.it constituted an agreement between the parties that encompassed all of the material elements necessary to constitute a binding loan commitment the identity of the lender and borrower,the amount of the loan,and the terms for repayment.peterson development torrey pines bank d.a written loan commitment by a lender that contains these essential terms is a binding and enforceable obligation of the lender,subject to the conditions precedent expressed in the commitment.miller starr,california real estate ed.thus,we conclude that the september agreement was one of the related documents expressly incorporated by reference into the deed of trust.
in contrast to the deed of trust,the september agreement did not include a dragnet provision that would have permitted of the two loans.significantly,the agreement was not silent on the subject of collateral it specifically identified the collateral for each of the two loans and expressly stated that the business would serve as collateral for both loans,but that the blue sage residence would serve as collateral for loan only.was not a condition of either of the loans according to the terms of the september agreement.
as with any contract,the september agreement must be construed according to the ordinary and popular meaning of its language.thus,if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.aiu ins.superior court cal d.because the september agreement specifically addressed the subject of collateral and did not mention,we believe that any lay
