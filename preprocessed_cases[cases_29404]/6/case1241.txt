a real property developer and borrower of money sued its lender,claiming the interest charged on the secured loan was usurious.the trial court awarded summary judgment to the lender,ruling the loan was exempt from the constitutional usury prohibition because it was negotiated and arranged by a licensed real estate broker.the developer argues the secured loan was not exempt because the broker was in effect the lender and was negotiating on its own behalf.we disagree and affirm the judgment because the broker,although an employee of an affiliate of the lender,acted as a third party intermediary and did not negotiate the loan on his own behalf.
plaintiff stoneridge parkway partners,llc stoneridge,acquired real property in two phases.it borrowed from wri investments iii llc wri investments to purchase the first phase.this loan is referred to as stoneridge i.it is not the subject of this action.the stoneridge i loan documents stated the loan was made arranged by wri investments.

the stoneridge ii promissory note called for an effective rate of interest that exceeded percent.stoneridge owed interest at the base annual rate of percent on the unpaid principal balance,plus additional interest based on a percentage of the gross sales price of each custom lot in the phase and for each production lot in the phase.
housing partners,the lender on the stoneridge ii loan,is of complicated lineage.however,as will be seen,that does not obscure the answer to whether the stoneridge ii loan was exempt from the constitutional usury prohibition.housing partners is a california limited partnership whose sole general partner is defendant mw housing management iii,llc housing management.its sole limited partner is the california public employees retirement system calpers,an agency of the state of california.housing partners has no employees of its own,but is simply a funding vehicle with its own investors.it relies on others to investigate,underwrite,and arrange its loans.in this case,calpers provided percent of the stoneridge ii loan funds.

cp investments is a state of washington limited liability company comprised of two members,mig corporation and weyerhaeuser realty investors,weyerhaeuser.weyerhaeuser,mig corporation,and macfarlane housing provided the remaining percent of the stoneridge ii loan funds not provided by calpers.

housing management,cp investments,and wri investments have no employees.weyerhaeuser,however,has employees.jack marsh was a vice president and investment manager of weyerhaeuser.at the time of these events,both marsh and weyerhaeuser were licensed real estate brokers.marsh was the qualifying officer for weyerhaeuser license.

the stoneridge ii loan agreement contains two errors.paragraph of the loan agreement,under the heading,no violation of usury laws,incorrectly states the loan was made arranged by wri investments.wri investments was not the lender on the stoneridge ii loan,was not involved in negotiating or arranging the loan,and is not a licensed real estate broker.
paragraph of the loan agreement,a clause designed to preclude claims for brokers fees,provides in relevant part that no broker other than lender has been involved in the negotiation of the loan however,the lender,housing partners,is not a broker and has no employees.
neither marsh nor weyerhaeuser provided stoneridge with a mortgage loan disclosure statement,a document business and professions code section requires a real estate broker to provide to a borrower on a secured loan negotiated by the broker.stoneridge received no notice that marsh or weyerhaeuser were licensed brokers.
after paying off the stoneridge ii loan,stoneridge filed this action against housing partners and housing management for recovery of usurious interest paid on the loan.defendants moved for summary judgment,claiming the loan was exempt from the state constitution usury prohibition pursuant to the california constitution and civil code section exemption of secured loans negotiated or arranged by a licensed real estate broker the trial court granted the motion for defendants and entered judgment in their favor.
stoneridge appeals,claiming the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law marsh negotiated and arranged the stoneridge ii loan within the meaning of the state constitution and section exemption for brokers ruling paragraph recital that the loan was made by wri investments was not conclusive and could be disregarded as an obvious mistake and admitting evidence of how the mistakes in the loan agreement occurred.we disagree with each of stoneridge contentions and address them in turn.

stoneridge argues the trial court erred by concluding the stoneridge ii loan was exempt from the constitutional usury prohibition pursuant to the terms of the state constitution and section.it claims a question of fact exists on whether marsh was acting as a third party intermediary or simply as the natural person through whom the lender acted.we disagree.marsh was acting as a third party intermediary as a matter of law because he was not acting solely on his own behalf.
