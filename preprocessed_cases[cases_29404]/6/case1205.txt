background 
appellants own real property located on drakes circle in discovery bay the property.gmac is a mortgage lender.prior to november,appellants sought to refinance the property by obtaining a loan from gmac one or more of the doe defendants in the principal amount of the loan.in connection with the loan,gmac provided a note setting forth a fixed interest rate of percent and monthly payments of the note.respondents also provided appellants a disclosure statement showing monthly payments of for a term at a fixed rate of percent.at the time appellants applied for the loan,they provided information regarding their actual gross income to one or more of the doe defendants.one of the documents tendered at closing was a purported application for the loan application,which appellants had neither prepared nor reviewed.the application stated appellants total income was per month,which was substantially greater than the actual income information appellants provided to gmac.this material change in appellants income information was not disclosed to them prior to december,and appellants were never requested to confirm the accuracy of the information contained in the application.at closing,appellants signed the preprinted application and other documents without being given an opportunity to read or review them.
along with the other documents regarding the loan,gmac prepared and tendered to appellants a deed of trust deed.the deed identifies gmac as lender.the deed identifies unnamed defendant mortgage electronic registration systems,mers as a separate corporation that is acting solely as a nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns.mers is the beneficiary under this deed.the deed identifies ets as trustee of the deed.unbeknownst to appellants,the deed included substantial language which constituted an addendum to the note.moreover,the beneficial interest in the deed is separate from the note,and appellants were not advised that such bifurcation is contrary to california law and without legal force or effect.
on or about december,appellants executed documents prepared by gmac for a home equity line of credit credit line,which was also intended to refinance the property.the entire amount of the credit line,was advanced as part of the refinance of the property.however,the credit line application was neither prepared nor reviewed by appellants,and bears a preprinted date of november,on the applicant signature line.on december,a deed of trust and assignment of rents was recorded to secure the credit line credit line deed 
at no time did appellants income permit them to make the payments called for in the loan documents.on june,ets recorded a notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust notice of default.ets signed the notice of default as agent for beneficiary.on september,ets recorded a notice of trustee sale.
on october,appellants filed their original complaint against respondents.on january,appellants filed the fac against respondents and unnamed defendants alleging slander of title first cause of action,fraud misrepresentation second cause of action,fraud concealment third cause of action,conspiracy to commit fraud fourth cause of action,to void contract fifth cause of action,to void and cancel deed of trust sixth cause of action,breach of fiduciary duty seventh cause of action,violation of business and professions code section et eighth cause of action,intentional infliction of emotional distress ninth cause of action,declaratory relief cause of action,injunctive relief cause of action,violation of civil code section cause of action,and restitution unjust enrichment cause of action 
on february,respondents demurred to the first through sixth and eighth through causes of action of the fac on the grounds they failed to state a cause of action and were uncertain and ambiguous.respondents also moved to strike various portions of the fac.respondents requested that the court take judicial notice of the june,notice of default,the notice of trustee sale recorded on september,and a copy of civil code section.appellants opposed the motion to strike and demurrer,asserting the fac stated the alleged causes of action,and,if not,requesting the opportunity to amend.
none of the parties attended the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike.in sustaining the demurrer to the fac without leave to amend,the court ruled that the slander of title cause of action failed because the deed specifically identifies ets as the trustee under the deed,and the remaining causes of action failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.the court granted respondents request for judicial notice and ruled the motion to strike was moot.
discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint after the granting of a demurrer without leave to amend,courts must assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.citation.courts must also consider judicially noticed matters.citation.in addition,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and read it in context.citation.if the trial court has sustained the demurer,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action.if the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,as here,we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment.citation.if we find that an amendment could cure the defect,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse if not,no abuse of discretion has occurred.citation.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.citation.schifando city of los angeles cal th.
ii.appellants have not waived their claims of error 
preliminarily,we reject respondents assertion that by failing to object to the trial court tentative ruling denying leave to amend,appellants waived their right to claim the court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides when any court makes an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend the question as to whether or not such court abused its discretion in making such an order is open to appeal even though no request to amend such pleading was made.therefore,appellants are entitled by statute to argue that leave to amend should have been granted,despite their failure to attempt amendment in the trial court.kolani gluska th.
we also reject respondents assertion that appellants may not,for the first time on appeal,raise new theories of relief to defeat the demurrer.as witkin explains,the rule against raising a new theory for the first time on appeal applies to an appeal after a trial.the rule is grounded on principles of waiver and estoppel,and is a matter of judicial economy and fairness to opposing parties.at the pleading stage,these considerations are not applicable.thus,on an appeal from a judgment on demurrer,the court will examine the pleaded facts to see if they make out a claim for relief under any theory.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed appeal.
iii.numerous causes of action are deemed abandoned 
respondents correctly note that appellants fail to mention or discuss the following causes of action to which the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend the first cause of action for slander of title,the fourth cause of action for conspiracy to commit fraud,the fifth cause of action to void contract,the seventh cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,the eighth cause of action for violation of business and professions code section et,the ninth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,the cause of action for declaratory relief,the cause of action for injunctive relief,and the cause of action for restitution.
an appellant failure to challenge an issue in its opening brief constitutes a waiver or abandonment of the issue on appeal.this rule has been applied even when,as here,the appellant is challenging the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend.gordon law offices of aguirre meyer th,fn.family security ins.services,d.
iv.appellants can not amend to state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment 
appellants contend they can amend the fac to allege facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment against gmac 
fraudulent misrepresentation 
to establish a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation,the plaintiff must prove the defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact was true that representation was false the defendant knew that the representation was false when the defendant made it,or the defendant made the representation recklessly and without regard for its truth the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation the plaintiff was harmed and,the plaintiff reliance on the defendant representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff.citations.manderville pcg s group,th.each element in a cause of action for fraud must be factually and specifically alleged.citation.cadlo,inc.th.in a fraud claim against a corporation,a plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the misrepresentations,their authority to speak for the corporation,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote,and when it was said or written.lazar superior court cal th.
the fraudulent misrepresentation cause of action of the fac alleges that respondents and the unnamed defendants lender defendants knew or should have known,at the time the documents were prepared and tendered by gmac to appellants for the loan and credit line,that it was not possible for appellants to make the payments called for in the loan and credit line based upon the income information actually provided to gmac.by preparing and tendering the documents to appellants,the lender defendants represented to appellants that appellants could,in fact,make the payments called for in the loans and failed to disclose to appellants that they could not possibly afford the payments called for in the loans.
respondents demurrer argued that appellants failed to allege a misrepresentation of fact as to their payment obligations because appellants admit they executed all of the loan documents required to obtain the loans and,thereby,agreed to all the terms stated in those documents.respondents also argued that preparing and tendering documents to appellants for their execution can not be deemed a representation outside the written terms of the agreement that appellants executed and thereby adopted.respondents also argued that,even assuming appellants alleged representations of fact,appellants failed to allege who made the representations,when they were made and to whom they were made how the representations are false that respondents knew they were false that respondents intended for appellants to rely on such representations and appellants did in fact rely on such misrepresentations.
appellants argue they can amend the fac to allege gmac represented to them that they qualified for the loans based upon their true income,which appellants provided to gmac when they applied for the loans the representation was false since appellants qualification for the loans was based upon a fabricated,inflated income gmac knew the representation was false gmac demonstrated its intent that appellants rely on the false representation by requesting true financial data from appellants,inserting false financial data into appellants application,failing to inform appellants that the application contained an inflated gross monthly income for appellants,and failing to provide appellants with an opportunity to read or review the application and other loan documents appellants relied on the misrepresentation and obtained the loans believing that gmac approval of the loan indicated that gmac thought appellants could afford the loans and appellants were damaged by the misrepresentation because they would not have obtained the loans had they known their qualification was based upon a fabricated,inflated statement of their income.
appellants also argue they can specifically allege the following gmac represented to appellants they qualified for the loans based upon their true income.based on information and belief,nick dutra was a loan consultant for gmac.in the fall of,dutra had a telephone interview with appellants during which they told dutra their true gross income was a year.a couple of days later,dutra called appellants and told them they qualified for their loans.appellants were never informed that their qualification for the loans was based upon a fabricated,inflated income of a month.at the time of his misrepresentations,dutra was located at a pleasanton address.on information and belief,appellants can allege that dutra had authority from gmac to interview and gather financial information from prospective borrowers to submit for gmac loan approval,and to fabricate and inflate a prospective borrower income on his or her loan application without the borrower knowledge and consent.
neither the fac nor appellants proposed amendments allege that gmac expressly represented to appellants that they had the ability to make the loan payments specified in the loan documents.appellants appear to conflate loan qualification and loan affordability.in effect,appellants argue that they were entitled to rely upon gmac determination that they qualified for the loans in order to decide if they could afford the loans.appellants cite no authority for this proposition,and it ignores the nature of the relationship.a bsent special circumstances a loan transaction is at arm length and there is no fiduciary relationship between the borrower and lender.citations.oaks management corporation superior court th.a commercial lender pursues its own economic interests in lending money.nymark heart fed.savings loan d.a lender owes no duty of care to the borrowers in approving their loan.wagner benson d.a lender is under no duty to determine the borrower ability to repay the loan the lender efforts to determine the creditworthiness and ability to repay by a borrower are for the lender protection,not the borrower.renteria d,borrowers rely on their own judgment and risk assessment in deciding whether to accept the loan accord,cross downey savings and loan association,cas ssx wl nonpub.opn.thus,appellants fail to demonstrate they can sufficiently amend the fac to state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation.
fraudulent concealment 
t he elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff must have sustained damage.citation.lovejoy v.at t th.
the fraudulent concealment cause of action in the fac alleges that respondents and the unnamed defendants knew or should have known that it was impossible for appellants to afford to make the payments called for in the loans and,at the time the loan documents were tendered and at all times thereafter,they concealed this fact from appellants.like fraudulent misrepresentation,each element in a cause of action for fraudulent concealment must be factually and specifically alleged.cadlo,supra,th at.and,when alleged against a corporation,a plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who committed the fraud,their authority to speak for the corporation,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote and when it was said or written.lazar superior court,supra,cal th at.
respondents demurred to the fraudulent concealment cause of action on the ground that appellants were presented with all of the loan documents,which included the monthly loan payment amounts and the income on which qualification was based.if any of the loan terms were unsatisfactory,appellants could have refused to execute the loan documents.alternatively,respondents argued that even if concealment of a fact was alleged,the complaint failed to state that respondents were under any duty to disclose the concealed fact,that respondent intentionally concealed such fact and that appellants were unaware they could not afford the terms set forth in the loans.respondents also argued that appellants failed to allege who made the concealment,and when,where,to whom and by what means the concealment was made.
appellants argue they can amend the fac to allege at the time of closing,dutra concealed from appellants that the loan application reflected an amount for appellants income that was fabricated and inflated and appellants qualification for the loans was based on the inflated income amount.gmac owed appellants a fiduciary duty.gmac was and is licensed by the department of real estate,license no.therefore,gmac also was a mortgage loan broker to appellants in addition to being their lender.appellants went directly to gmac to obtain their loans.gmac never told appellants an inflated income was inserted in the loan applications,appellants did not have the opportunity to read and review the loan documents at closing,and therefore did not see that the income listed on the loan applications was inflated and fabricated.gmac intentionally concealed the fact of the inflated,fabricated income shown on the loan applications because it knew appellants would not have the opportunity to read the loan documents at the closing of the loans.
in their reply brief,appellants cite financial code section,which provides a a person who provides brokerage services to a borrower in a covered loan transaction by soliciting lenders or otherwise negotiating a consumer loan secured by real property,is the fiduciary of the consumer,and any violation of the person fiduciary duties shall be a violation of this section.a broker who arranges a covered loan owes this fiduciary duty to the consumer regardless of who else the broker may be acting as an agent for in the course of the loan transaction.b except for a broker or a person who provides brokerage services,no licensed person or subsequent assignee shall have administrative,civil,or criminal liability for a violation of this section.appellants allegation that gmac owed them a fiduciary duty because gmac was and is licensed by the department of real estate,license no,and appellants went directly to gmac to obtain their loans is conclusory and insufficient to establish that gmac was a fiduciary of appellants pursuant to financial code section.moreover,appellants have not alleged that gmac acted as a broker at any time in its dealings with appellants.having failed to sufficiently allege a fiduciary duty,appellants cause of action for fraudulent concealment fails.
appellants can not amend to state a cause of action to void and cancel deed 
next,appellants contend they can amend the fac to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action to void and cancel the deeds against respondents and mers.
the cause of action in the fac to void and cancel the deed of trust alleged that the deeds are void and voidable because the specific terms of the deeds were inconsistent with the nature of a deed of trust.respondents demurred on the ground that the claim is vague and ambiguous,appellants failed to allege how the deeds are void or voidable,and appellants failed to show they would be able to provide any restoration of consideration in exchange for a decree of cancellation.
appellants assert that the thrust of the fac cause of action to void and cancel a deed of trust is that the deed,attached as exhibit c to the fac,is not actually a deed of trust,but instead is a contract to permit mers to foreclose upon the property.appellants argue that since the true character and essential terms of the deed were concealed from appellants,appellants signature upon the deed constitutes fraud in the,rendering the deed void.as a result,appellants argue they may state a statutory cause of action for cancellation of instruments.alternatively,appellants argue the deed is voidable under revenue and taxation code section because mers conducts business in california without paying state taxes.they argue that their claim to void and cancel the deed is not based on fraud in the inducement,but is based on fraud in the.
fraud in the execution of the deed 
appellants argue they can allege facts demonstrating that the deed,which secured the loan,did not meet the definition of a deed of trust but instead was a contract which permitted mers to foreclose upon the property.
appellants argue the deed is void for fraud in the execution.when a plaintiff alleges fraud in the inducement,the plaintiff is asserting it understood the contract it was signing,but that its consent to the contract was induced by fraud.in contrast,when a plaintiff alleges fraud in the execution,the plaintiff is asserting that it was deceived as to the very nature of the contract execution,and did not know what it was signing.a contract fraudulently induced is voidable but a contract fraudulently executed is void,because there never was an agreement.citation.brown wells fargo bank,th,brown.
appellants assert they can amend the fac to allege the following language contained in the deed the beneficiary of this security instrument is mers solely as nominee for gmac and gmac successors and assigns and the successors and assigns of mers.t his security instrument secures to gmac i the repayment of the loan,and all renewals,extensions and modifications of the note and ii the performance of appellants covenants and agreements under this security instrument and the note.for this purpose,appellants irrevocably grant and convey to ets,in trust,with power of sale,the property together with all the improvements now or hereafter erected on the property,and all easements,appurtenances,and fixtures now or hereafter a part of the property appellants understand and agree that mers holds only legal title to the interests granted by appellants in this security instrument,but,if necessary to comply with law or custom,mers as nominee for gmac and gmac successors and assigns has the right to exercise any or all of those interests,including,but not limited to,the right to foreclose and sell the property and to take any action required of gmac including,but not limited to,releasing and canceling this security instrument.italics added.appellants argue the italicized language in the deed demonstrates that the deed is not securing the debt for gmac,and the deed does not permit gmac to reach an asset if appellants default.instead,it is a contract pursuant to which appellants agree that mers may foreclose on the property.
appellants impliedly acknowledge that reasonable reliance is a necessary element of fraud in the execution.that is,t he contract is only considered void when the plaintiff failure to discover the true nature of the document executed was without negligence on the plaintiff part.citation.brown,supra,th at.citing brown,at page,appellants note that where parties to a contract are in a fiduciary relationship requiring the defendant to explain the terms of the contract between them,the plaintiff failure to read the contract is reasonable and the defendant failure to exercise its fiduciary duty may constitute constructive fraud.
appellants argue they can amend the fac to allege gmac owed appellants a fiduciary duty as their mortgage broker,not as a lender gmac failed to inform appellants the dee
