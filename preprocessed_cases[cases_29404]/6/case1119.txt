this is a winstar related case,growing out of the failure of a savings and loan association that resulted from the enactment of a federal statute that barred such institution also known as a thrift from using an accounting method that the federal regulatory agency for the thrift had authorized it to use.the court of federal claims dismissed a damage suit by stockholders of the failed thrift based on the government alleged breach of a contract authorizing the thrift to use the accounting method.fed.deposit ins.lee united states.the court held that the shareholders were not parties to,or beneficiaries of,any contract between the united states and the thrift.
the federal deposit insurance company fdic,which was the receiver for the failed thrift,was a substituted plaintiff in the stockholder suit.the court of federal claims dismissed the fdic as a party,because any recovery it might obtain on behalf of the thrift would have to be paid to the government agency that insured the thrift depositors there was accordingly no case or controversy between the fdic and the united states.id.
we affirm both of those rulings.
a.the winstar related cases developed from the savings and loan association crisis.the facts relating to that crisis have been frequently stated.see united states winstar,d see also landmark land,fed.deposit ins,glass united states.we shall not repeat them in detail.
in brief,a large number of thrifts were in serious financial difficulties in the early.at that time,the federal home loan bank board board regulated the industry.the federal savings and loan insurance corporation insurance corporation administered a fund insurance fund that insured deposits held by thrift institutions.fed.deposit ins.lee,fed.cl.at citing.the fdic manages that fund.glass,at.
the federal regulators were concerned that if a large number of thrifts became insolvent,the amount in the insurance fund might be exhausted and might not be sufficient to pay all of those institutions depositors.to deal with the problem,the regulators undertook a program of encouraging financially healthy thrifts and individuals to take over the failing thrifts and infuse new capital into them.to make such action attractive,the regulators developed a program that would permit,for regulatory purposes,the failing thrifts to include on their balance sheets a fictional asset,landmark,at,called supervisory goodwill,that represented the excess of the thrift liabilities over its assets.the regulators further permitted this asset to be depreciated over a substantial number of years.
in,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act financial reform act,which made significant changes in the regulation of the thrift industry.see winstar,at.of particular significance here,the statute prohibited the use of supervisory goodwill as a balance sheet asset for regulatory purposes.t.as a result,a large number of thrifts that theretofore had been in compliance with regulatory capital requirements no longer met those standards,and were forced into receivership.the result was the large number of winstar cases brought by such thrifts and their shareholders against the united states.
b.the appellants steven lee and quincy lee the lees decided to participate in this program by acquiring and investing new capital into the karnes county savings and loan association karnes,a thrift.the lees acquired karnes for million.the acquisition took the form of the creation of a new interim charter for a thrift,followed by its merger into karnes.the board authorized karnes to use supervisory goodwill and stated that changes in applicable regulation would not alter the forbearances granted or that equivalent forbearances would be granted thereunder 
these arrangements were negotiated on behalf of the new association by stephen dufilho,the president and ceo of karnes.the lees did not sign or draft any of the documents that reflected these arrangements.
following the enactment of the financial reform act,which precluded karnes from using supervisory goodwill to meet regulatory requirements,the board determined that karnes was being operated in an unsafe manner,recommended that a receiver be appointed,and closed the institution.fed.cl.at.a state conservator was appointed.id.by statute,the fdic succeeded as receiver.see d a i,b ii.the insurance fund paid the claims of karnes depositors and was subrogated to their claims against karnes.id.d.
the lees filed in the court of federal claims the present suit for damages against the united states.in their first amended complaint,they asserted claims for breach of contract and a fifth amendment taking.the fdic filed a complaint as substituted plaintiff,as successor to the rights of karnes county savings and loan association,seeking damages for the united states breach of its alleged contract with karnes.
the court of federal claims dismissed both complaints.at.the court stated that it was not satisfied that a contract had been formed.id.at.it then held that even if there were a contract,the lees were neither parties to nor beneficiaries of such a contract,and thus lacked standing to assert the claim.id.at.
the court also dismissed the fdic complaint.relying on landmark,and glass,the court ruled that the statute that the fdic invoked,d supp.ii,is a priority statute that requires the fdic before paying depositors,to distribute any recovery it might obtain to the insurance fund until the fund had been fully reimbursed for the amounts it had paid to insured depositors.fed.cl.at.the court held that there was no case or controversy because t he most fdic can be awarded in this case is million the insurance fund has paid depositors million.any award here would be moved from one government agency to another.id.at.
the fdic,as receiver of karnes,seeks to assert against the united states karnes claims for damages resulting from the united states breach of its alleged contract with karnes to permit the thrift to use supervisory goodwill.in rejecting this claim,the court of federal claims held that because the fdic would be required to pay to the insurance fund whatever amount it could recover on that claim,there was no case or controversy between the fdic and the united states.in order for a plaintiff claim to satisfy the requirement,resolution of that claim must affect the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.landmark,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we dealt with a virtually identical situation in landmark.there,landmark had acquired dixie federal savings and loans association dixie and another failing thrift,and the board authorized dixie to use supervisory goodwill.id.at.after dixie became insolvent,landmark sued the united states in the court of federal claims for breach of contract.id.at.fdic intervened as a plaintiff and asserted another breach of contract claim.id.the trial court held for both plaintiffs.id.
we reversed the judgment in favor of the fdic because its claim did not present any case or controversy between it and the united states.we explained 
even if the fdic were to have won a judgment for the entire amount it was seeking,however,none of the money paid by the government in satisfaction of such a judgment would leave the government.that is because the government holds a claim against dixie for an even greater amount paid by the rtc resolution trust corporation to dixie depositors upon dixie liquidation.nor would adjudication of the fdic claims affect dixie other creditors.for these reasons,the fdic claims do not give rise to an actual case or controversy because the fdic and the government are not truly adverse as to the fdic claims.therefore,the fdic lacks standing,and its claims must be dismissed.
we further explained 
u nder the statutory scheme of priority for thrift creditors,the fdic is obligated to completely satisfy the claim of the government,specifically that of the fslic resolution fund frf,against dixie before distributing any proceeds to dixie other creditors.see d.it is undisputed that dixie owes the frf over billion for the advances that the frf made to dixie depositors upon its liquida
