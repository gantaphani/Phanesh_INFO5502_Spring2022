this putative class action alleges violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and new york usury law.the proposed class representative,saliha madden,alleges that the defendants violated the fdcpa by charging and attempting to collect interest at a rate higher than that permitted under the law of her home state,which is new york.the defendants contend that madden claims fail as a matter of law for two reasons usury claims and fdcpa claims predicated on violations against a national bank assignees,such as the defendants here,are preempted by the national bank act nba,and the agreement governing madden debt requires the application of delaware law,under which the interest charged is permissible.
the district court entered judgment for the defendants.because neither defendant is a national bank nor a subsidiary or agent of a national bank,or is otherwise acting on behalf of a national bank,and because application of the state law on which madden claim relies would not significantly interfere with any national bank ability to exercise its powers under the nba,we reverse the district court holding that the nba preempts madden claims and accordingly vacate the judgment of the district court.we leave to the district court to address in the first instance whether the delaware clause precludes madden claims.
the district court also denied madden motion for class certification,holding that potential nba preemption required individualized factual inquires incompatible with proceeding as a class.because this conclusion rested upon the same erroneous preemption analysis,we also vacate the district court denial of class certification.
background 
madden credit card debt,the sale of her account,and the defendants collection efforts 
in,saliha madden,a resident of new york,opened a bank of america boa credit card account.boa is a national bank the account was governed by a document she received from boa titled cardholder agreement.the following year,boa credit card program was consolidated into another national bank,fia card services,fia.contemporaneously with the transfer to fia,the account terms and conditions were amended upon receipt by madden of a document titled change in terms,which contained a delaware clause.
madden owed approximately on her credit card account and in,fia her account,wrote off her debt as uncollectable.fia then sold madden debt to defendant appellee midland funding,llc midland funding,a debt purchaser.midland credit management,midland credit,the other defendant in this case,is an affiliate of midland funding that services midland funding consumer debt accounts.neither defendant is a national bank.upon midland funding acquisition of madden debt,neither fia nor boa possessed any further interest in the account.
in november,midland credit sent madden a letter seeking to collect payment on her debt and stating that an interest rate of per year applied.
procedural history 
a year later,madden filed suit against the defendants on behalf of herself and a putative class alleging that they had engaged in abusive and unfair debt collection practices in violation of the fdcpa,and had charged a usurious rate of interest in violation of new york law,bus.law oblig.law penal law proscribing interest from being charged at a rate exceeding per year.
on september,the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment and madden motion for class certification.in ruling on the motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether madden had received the cardholder agreement and change in terms,and as to whether fia had actually assigned her debt to midland funding.however,the court stated that if,at trial,the defendants were able to prove that madden had received the cardholder agreement and change in terms,and that fia had assigned her debt to midland funding,her claims would fail as a matter of law because the nba would preempt any usury claim against the defendants.the district court also found that if the cardholder agreement and change in terms were binding upon madden,any fdcpa claim of false representation or unfair practice would be defeated because the agreement permitted the interest rate applied by the defendants.
in ruling on madden motion for class certification,the district court held that because assignees are entitled to the protection of the nba if the originating bank was entitled to the protection of the nba the class action device in my view is not appropriate here.app x at.the district court concluded that the proposed class failed to satisfy rule a commonality and typicality requirements because t he claims of each member of the class will turn on whether the class member agreed to delaware interest rates and whether the class member debt was validly assigned to the defendants,id.at,both of which were disputed with respect to madden.similarly,the court held that the requirements of rule b relief sought appropriate to class as a whole and b common questions of law or fact predominate were not satisfied because there is no showing that the circumstances of each proposed class member are like those of plaintiff,and because the resolution will turn on individual determinations as to cardholder agreements and assignments of debt.id.at.on may,the parties entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment for defendants for purpose of appeal.id.at.the parties stipulated that fia had assigned madden account to the defendants and that madden had received the cardholder agreement and change in terms.this stipulation disposed of the two genuine disputes of material fact identified by the district court,and provided that a final,appealable judgment in favor of defendants is appropriate.id.at.the district court so ordered the stipulation for entry of judgment.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
madden argues on appeal that the district court erred in holding that nba preemption bars her usury claims.we agree.because neither defendant is a national bank nor a subsidiary or agent of a national bank,or is otherwise acting on behalf of a national bank,and because application of the state law on which madden claim relies would not significantly interfere with any national bank ability to exercise its powers under the nba,we reverse the district court holding that the nba preempts madden claims and accordingly vacate the judgment of the district court.we also vacate the district court judgment as to madden fdcpa claim and the denial of class certification because those rulings were predicated on the same flawed preemption analysis.
the defendants contend that even if we find that madden claims are not preempted by the nba,we must affirm because delaware law rather than new york law applies and the interest charged by the defendants is permissible under delaware law.because the district court did not reach this issue,we leave it to the district court to address in the first instance on remand.
national bank act preemption 
the federal preemption doctrine derives from the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides that the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.according to the supreme court,t he phrase laws of the united states encompasses both federal statutes themselves and federal regulations that are properly adopted in accordance with statutory authorization.city of new york fcc.
preemption can generally occur in three ways where congress has expressly preempted state law,where congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law,or where federal law conflicts with state law.wachovia bank,burke,f d,cir,cert.denied.the defendants appear to suggest that this case involves conflict preemption,which occurs when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objective of congress.united states locke,internal quotation marks omitted.
the national bank act expressly permits national banks to charge on any loan interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state,territory,or district where the bank is located.it also provide s the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks,beneficial bank anderson,and therefore completely preempt s analogous usury claims,sullivan am.airlines,cir.thus,there is no such thing as a claim of usury against a national bank.beneficial bank,at see also pac.capital bank,connecticut,cir a state in which a national bank makes a loan may not permissibly require the bank to charge an interest rate lower than that allowed by its home state.accordingly,because fia is incorporated in delaware,which permits banks to charge interest rates that would be usurious under new york law,fia collection at those rates in new york does not violate the nba and is not subject to new york stricter usury laws,which the nba preempts.
the defendants argue that,as assignees of a national bank,they too are allowed under the nba to charge interest at the rate permitted by the state where the assignor national bank is located here,delaware.we disagree.in certain circumstances,nba preemption can be extended to bank entities.to apply nba preemption to an action taken by a bank entity,application of state law to that action must significantly interfere with a national bank ability to exercise its power under the nba.see barnett bank of marion,nelson,u,pac.capital bank,at.
the supreme court has suggested that that nba preemption may extend to entities beyond a national bank itself,such as banks acting as the equivalent to national banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law.watters wachovia bank.for example,the supreme court has held that operating subsidiaries of national banks may benefit from nba preemption.see also burke,at deferring to reasonable regulation that operating subsidiaries of national banks receive the same preemptive benefit as the parent bank.this court has also held that agents of national banks can benefit from nba preemption.pac.capital bank,at holding that a tax preparer who facilitated the processing of refund anticipation loans for a national bank was not subject to connecticut law regulating such loans see also spggc,llc ayotte,cir the national bank act explicitly states that a national bank may use duly authorized officers or agents to exercise its incidental powers.internal citation omitted,cert.denied.
the office of the comptroller of the currency occ,a federal agency that charters,regulates,and supervises all national banks,town of babylon fed.hous.fin.agency,cir,has made clear that debt buyers are distinct from agents or subsidiaries of a national bank,see occ bulletin,risk management guidance,available at news bulletin banks may pursue collection of delinquent accounts by handling the collections internally,using third parties as agents in collecting the debt,or selling the debt to debt buyers for a fee.in fact,it is precisely because national banks do not exercise control over debt buyers that the occ issued guidance regarding how national banks should manage the risk associated with selling consumer debt to third parties.see id.
in most cases in which nba preemption has been applied to a bank entity,the entity has exercised the powers of a national bank,has acted on behalf of a national bank in carrying out the national bank business.this is not the case here.the defendants did not act on behalf of boa or fia in attempting to collect on madden debt.the defendants acted solely on their own behalves,as the owners of the debt.
no other mechanism appears on these facts by which applying state usury laws to the debt buyers would significantly interfere with either national bank ability to exercise its powers under the nba.see barnett bank,at.rather,such application would limit only activities of the third party which are otherwise subject to state control,spggc,llc blumenthal,cir,and which are not protected by federal banking law or subject to occ oversight.
we reached a similar conclusion in blumenthal.there,a shopping mall operator,spggc,sold prepaid gift cards at its malls,including its malls in connecticut.id.at.bank of america issued the cards,which looked like credit or debit cards and operated on the visa debit card system.id.at.the gift cards included a monthly service fee and carried a expiration date.id.at.the connecticut attorney general sued spggc alleging violations of connecticut gift card law,which prohibits the sale of gift cards subject to inactivity or dormancy fees or expiration dates.id.at.spggc argued that nba preemption precluded suit.id.at.
we held that spggc failed to state a valid claim for preemption of connecticut law insofar as the law prohibited spggc from imposing inactivity fees on consumers of its gift cards.id.at.we reasoned that enforcement of the state law does not interfere with boa ability to exercise its powers under the nba and occ regulations.id.rather,it affects only the conduct of spggc,which is neither protected under federal law nor subject to the occ exclusive oversight.id.
we did find,in blumenthal,that connecticut prohibition on expiration dates could interfere with national bank powers because visa requires such cards to have expiration dates and an outright prohibition on expiration dates could have prevented a visa member bank such as boa from acting as the issuer of the simon giftcard.id.at.we remanded for further consideration of the issue.here,however,state usury laws would not prevent consumer debt sales by national banks to third parties.although it is possible that usury laws might decrease the amount a national bank could charge for its consumer debt in certain states,those with firm usury limits,like new york,such an effect would not significantly interfere with the exercise of a national bank power.
furthermore,extension of nba preemption to debt collectors such as the defendants would be an overly broad application of the nba.although national banks agents and subsidiaries exercise national banks powers and receive protection under the nba when doing so,extending those protections to third parties would create an around usury laws for bank entities that are not acting on behalf of a national bank.
the defendants and the district court rely principally on two eighth circuit cases in which the court held that nba preemption precluded usury claims against bank entities.in krispin may department stores,cir,may department stores company may stores,a bank entity,issued credit cards to the plaintiffs.id.at.by agreement,those credit card accounts were governed by missouri law,which limits delinquency fees to.id.subsequently,may stores notified the plaintiffs that the accounts had been assigned and transferred to may national bank of arizona may bank,a national bank and subsidiary of may stores,and that may bank would charge delinquency fees of up to,or as allowed by law.id.although may stores had transferred all authority over the terms and operations of the accounts to may bank,it subsequently purchased may bank receivables and maintained a role in account collection.id.at.
the plaintiffs brought suit under missouri law against may stores after being charged delinquency fees.id.at.may stores argued that the plaintiffs claims were preempted by the nba because the assignment and transfer of the accounts to may bank was fully effective to cause the bank,and not the store,to be the originator of the plaintiffs accounts subsequent to that time.id.at.the court agreed 
t he store purchase of the bank receivables does not diminish the fact that it is now the bank,and not the store,that issues credit,processes and services customer accounts,and sets such terms as interest and late fees.thus,although we recognize that the nba governs only national banks,in these circumstances we agree with the district court that it makes sense to look to the originating entity the bank,and not the ongoing assignee the store,in determining whether the nba applies.
