petitioner,washington mutual bank,fa washington mutual is a federally chartered savings and loan association organized and operating under the home owners loan act hola et washington mutual seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate an order overruling washington mutual demurrers to those causes of action contained within real parties complaints alleging violations of civil code section section the consumers legal remedies act,et and california unfair practices act upa.bus,et each of these counts is premised on the theory that washington mutual practice of charging interest on home loans is unlawful.we hold that such state law claims are preempted by the hola and the act implementing regulations.we also hold that section does not prohibit a lender from charging interest on a home loan prior to close of escrow in those instances where the lender deposits the loan proceeds into escrow by wire or electronic transfer.we will therefore issue a writ directing the superior court to set aside its order overruling washington mutual demurrers.
factual and procedural background 
a.the complaints 
real parties steven guilford and robert guilford,trustee of the guilford revocable family trust,filed a class action lawsuit against washington mutual on behalf of themselves and similarly situated borrowers in california and the general public.shortly thereafter,real party stuart talley filed a similar lawsuit 
the guilford complaint alleged that washington mutual and its predecessor in interest,home savings of america,fsb,originated thousands of residential mortgage loans in california and,in connection with those loans,required borrowers to pay,prior to close of escrow,one day interest.it was asserted that this practice violated section and the upa,constituted conversion,and unjustly enriched washington mutual and home savings.
the talley complaint alleged that washington mutual practice of charging interest was in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjustly enriched washington mutual and home savings,and violated the upa and the consumers legal remedies act.
washington mutual demurrer 
washington mutual demurred to those causes of action that alleged violations of the upa,the consumers legal remedies act and section.washington mutual argued that each of these counts should be dismissed based on the doctrine of federal preemption,and that section does not apply because wire and electronic transfers represent cash.
c.the trial court ruling 
the trial court overruled washington mutual demurrers to those causes of action alleging violations of the upa,the consumers legal remedies act and section this petition followed.
this case presents two issues.the first is whether the hola,together with its implementing regulations,preempts state law claims alleging that washington mutual,a federal savings and loan association,violated section,the upa,and the consumers legal remedies act by charging interest on home loans.the second is whether section prohibits a lender from charging interest on loan proceeds made immediately available to the borrower through escrow by wire or electronic transfer.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
a pure legal issue of preemption is properly handled by demurrer,and its denial is properly reviewed by petition for writ of mandate.see american internat.group,superior court d.where,as here,the issues are tendered on undisputed facts and are purely legal in nature,it calls for the court independent appellate review.ibid.
general principles of preemption 
congress has the authority to preempt state law by virtue of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides that laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.such preemption is found in three circumstances.citation.first congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citations.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is when it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.citations.smiley citibank cal th,d.the critical question in any analysis is always whether congress intended that federal regulation supersede state law.louisiana public service comm fcc,d.
preemptive effect of federal regulations 
federal regulations may preempt state law just as fully as federal statutes.glendale federal sav.loan ass fox.an agency may preempt state law through regulations that are within the scope of its statutory authority and that are not arbitrary.see louisiana public service comm fcc,supra,d may result not only from action taken by congress itself a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may state regulation.
d.the presumption of nonpreemption 
in an area of law traditionally occupied by the states,such as the exercise of a state police powers,we begin with the presumption that these laws are not superseded by a federal act unless congress intent to preempt is clear and manifest.california arc america,d.laws concerning consumer protection,such as the upa and the consumers legal remedies act,are included within the states police power and thus subject to this heightened presumption against preemption.see,smiley citibank,supra,cal th,d,spielholz superior court th,d.the party claiming federal preemption bears the burden of establishing it.see wells fargo bank superior court cal d,conc.opn.of kennard.
real parties state law claims 
washington mutual,a federally chartered savings association,transfers funds into escrow by wire or electronic transfer and begins charging interest one business day prior to the close of escrow.real parties claim that this practice violates three state statutes.the first,section,provides that when the purchaser of a one to residential dwelling takes out a mortgage and the lender deposits the loan proceeds into escrow,the lender may not begin charging interest on the loan before the close of escrow unless the lender deposits the funds in cash or by other specified methods.the second,the upa bus,prohibits unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practices.the third,the consumers legal remedies act,et,prohibits deceptive practices in consumer transactions.
f.the hola and regulations thereunder 
the federal law claimed by washington mutual to expressly preempt section,the upa,and the consumers legal remedies act is the hola,together with regulations promulgated by the office of thrift supervision ots,the agency charged with administering the act.
the home owner loan act of was a product of the great depression of the.the act was intended to provide emergency relief with respect to home mortgage indebtedness at a time when as many as half of all home loans in the country were in default.citations.local institutions that had previously supplied funds to finance homes had ceased doing business or had discontinued such loans,so that more than half the counties in the country,containing almost of the total population,were without institutions.citations.in order to ameliorate these conditions,congress enacted the hola,a radical and comprehensive response to the inadequacies of the existing state systems.citation.the act provided for the creation of a system of federal savings and loan associations,which would be regulated by the federal home loan bank board so as to ensure their vitality as permanent associations to promote the thrift of the people in a cooperative manner to finance their homes and the homes of their neighbors.citations.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d fidelity federal.
congress gave the federal home loan bank board fhlbb the following plenary authority to issue regulations governing federal savings and loans in order to provide local mutual thrift institutions in which people may invest their funds and in order to provide for the financing of homes,the fhlbb is authorized,under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe,to provide for the organization,incorporation,examination,operation,and regulation of associations to be known as federal savings and loan associations,or federal mutual savings banks,and to issue charters therefor,giving primary consideration to the best practices of local mutual thrift and institutions in the united states.a,supp.iv emphasis added.fidelity federal,supra,at.pursuant to this congressional delegation,the fhlbb enacted a complex scheme of regulations governing the powers and operations of every federal savings and loan association from its cradle to its corporate grave.id.at.
in,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,which abolished the fhlbb,created the ots,and placed the rights and duties formerly held by the fhlbb with ots.security sav.loan director,ots cir.the firrea made the director of ots responsible for the examination,supervision,and regulation of all federally insured savings associations id.at,fn,and gave the director the authority to prescribe such regulations as the director may determine to be necessary for carrying out the hola.b.ots was given the same plenary power to issue regulations governing federal savings and loans that congress had entrusted in the fhlbb.in order to provide thrift institutions for the deposit of funds and for the extension of credit for homes and other goods and services,the director of the ots is authorized,under such regulations as the director may prescribe to provide for the organization,incorporation,examination,operation,and regulation of associations to be known as federal savings associations including federal savings banks,and to issue charters therefor,giving primary consideration of the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states.the lending and investment powers conferred by this section are intended to encourage such institutions to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.a.
code of federal regulations section 
in,ots,pursuant to the broad authority granted by the hola,promulgated code of federal regulations section which provides as follows 
a occupation of field.to enhance safety and soundness and to enable federal savings associations to conduct their operations in accordance with best practices by efficiently delivering credit to the public free from undue regulatory duplication and burden,ots hereby occupies the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.ots intends to give federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation.accordingly,federal savings associations may extend credit as authorized under federal law,including this part,without regard to state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit activities,except to the extent provide in paragraph c of this section or of this part.for purposes of this section,state law includes any state statute,regulation,ruling,order or judicial decision.

criminal law and 
any other law that ots,upon review,finds 
i furthers a vital state interest and 
ii either has only an incidental effect on lending operations or is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph a of this section.
ots did not exceed its statutory authority in promulgating code of federal regulations section 
we first examine whether ots exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating code of federal regulations section,or acted arbitrarily in so doing.
section was issued by ots in as part of a final rule updating,reorganizing,and substantially streamlining lending and investment regulations and policy statements.these amendments were made pursuant to the regulatory reinvention initiative of the vice president national performance review reinvention initiative and section of the community development and regulatory improvement act of cdria,which require ed ots and the other federal banking agencies to review,streamline,and modify regulations and policies to improve efficiency,reduce unnecessary costs,and remove inconsistent,outmoded,and duplicative requirements.ibid.
at the time section was issued,ots advised that this general lending preemption provision,was simply restating preemption principles applicable to federal savings associations,as reflected in earlier regulations,court cases,and numerous legal opinions issued by ots and the federal home loan bank board fhlbb,ots predecessor agency.the ots noted that i n those opinions,ots has consistently taken the position that,with certain narrow exceptions,any state laws that purport to affect the lending operations of federal savings associations are preempted.ibid.the ots then cautioned,n one of the changes implemented today should be construed as evidencing in any way an intent by ots to change this long held position ots still intends to occupy the field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.ibid.ots expressed the belief that the new lending preemption regulation is clearer and should significantly reduce the instances in which institutions need to request interpretive guidance from ots.ibid.
in creating a system of federal savings and loan associations,congress could have elected to subject the operation of federal associations to state law.glendale federal sav.loan ass fox,supra.at.instead,congress gave the ots plenary authority over the creation and operation of federal associations.ibid.as the hola makes clear,federal savings and loan associations are not to be operated and regulated by what a particular state conceives to be the best practices.ibid.rather,the ots was delegated by congress the authority to select from the prevailing practices in all the states what it deemed the best practices and to prescribe a nationwide system of operation,supervision,and regulation which would apply to all federal associations,fn.omitted.
title united states code section a,as amended,directs the ots to give primary consideration to the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states,and specifies that t he lending and investment powers conferred by this section are intended to encourage such institutions to provide credit for housing safely and soundly.a.this language evidences a clear congressional intent to delegate to the ots complete authority to regulate federal savings and loan associations.while the language of section is sweeping,we conclude the ots in promulgating this preemptive regulation exercised the kind of discretion that congress intended to delegate to it in hola.
our conclusion is consistent with federal banking agency preemption cases such as fidelity federal.that case involved a conflict between state and federal law regarding the validity of clauses in loans made by federal savings and loan associations.clauses require a borrower to pay the outstanding balance of a debt if the property securing the debt is sold or transferred.fidelity federal,supra,at.a regulation promulgated by the fhlbb ots predecessor provided that such clauses could be included in mortgage agreements.in the preamble accompanying final publication of the regulation,the fhlbb emphasized that federal savings and loan associations would not be bound by or subject to any conflicting state law that imposed different requirements.id.at.borrowers in california sued a federal savings and loan association asserting that its exercise of a clause violated california law.id.at.when the california court of appeal held that state law prevented enforcement of provisions between borrowers and federal savings and loan associations,the supreme court granted certiorari.id.at.in upholding the validity of the fhlbb regulation,the fidelity federal court deferred to the fhlbb because of a convincing congressional delegation to the independent agency to regulate certain lending practices of federal savings and loans.the court concluded that the agency had exercised its power in a way that was not arbitrary or capricious,but was,in fact,reasonable.fidelity federal,supra,at.in reaching its conclusion,the court noted that congress had invested the fhlbb with broad authority to regulate federal savings and loans so as to effect the statute purposes,and plainly indicated that the fhlbb need not feel bound by existing state law.id.at.
the fidelity federal court found that by directing the fhlbb to consider the best practices of local mutual thrift and institutions in the united states,congress plainly envisioned that federal savings and loans would be governed by what the any particular to be the best practices.citations.fidelity federal,supra,at.the court then concluded,thus,the statutory language suggests that congress expressly contemplated,and approved,the fhlbb promulgation of regulations superseding state law.id.at.
while the fidelity federal majority opined that there were no limits on the fhlbb authority to regulate the lending practices of federal savings and loans fidelity federal,supra,at,italics added,one justice concurred in the opinion for the sole purpose of emphasizing that the authority of the federal home loan bank board predecessor to ots to state laws is not limitless.although congress delegated broad power to the board to ensure that federally chartered savings and loan institutions would remain financially sound,it is clear that hola does not permit the board to the application of all state and local laws to such institutions.id.at,conc.opn.of,
section,of course,does not preempt the application of all state and local laws pertaining to federal savings and loans.we do not read the express preemption set forth in section to mean that every state law having any conceivable connection to the lending operations of federal savings associations is preempted.indeed,section makes clear in paragraph c that there are some areas where the ots has no right to regulate.c.
while the scope of code of federal regulations section is broad and sweeping,we conclude that congress intended to allow the ots to promulgate such regulations in order to protect the integrity of federal savings and loans and to ensure that these associations conduct their operations in accordance with best practices,so that credit will be extended safely and soundly.
real parties state law claims are preempted by federal law 
we next consider whether the hola,as implemented by code of federal regulations section,preempts state law claims which allege that a federal savings and loan association violates section,the upa,and the consumers legal remedies act in charging interest on home loans.
real parties contend that the complete absence of ots regulations on the issue of preclosing interest confirms that agency implicit view that the issue lies outside the field of federal preemption.we disagree.where,as here,the agency administering the federal act has expressed its intention to occupy the entire field of lending regulations for federal savings associations a there is no need to find a specific regulation on point.see wisconsin league of fin.inst.galecki,in an action involving no conflicting federal regulation and finding preemption pursuant to the hola,u nder the interpretation advanced by the state of wisconsin the ots would be required to affirmatively express by regulation every power held by a federal institution or risk restrictions by the states.such an interpretation is based upon neither reason nor common sense.in addition,the ots has stated that its silence is not an implicit endorsement of state laws regulating lending.see,failure to mention a particular type of state law that affects lending should not be deemed to constitute evidence of an intent to permit state laws of that type to apply to federal thrifts.
here,it is obvious that some measure of federal preemption is expressly indicated by code federal regulations section.the real question is the extent of the preemption.in,ots issued a regulation designed to assist in the preemption analysis.according to the ots,w hen analyzing the status of state laws under section,the first step will be to determine whether the type of law in question is listed in section paragraph b.if so,the analysis will end there the law is preempted.
paragraph b of code of federal regulations section contains a list of examples of state laws preempted by the hola.except as provided in of this part,the types of state laws preempted by paragraph a of this section include,without limitation,state laws purporting to impose regulations regarding the terms of credit,including amortization of loans and the deferral and capitalization of interest and adjustments to the interest rate,balance,payments due,or term to maturity of the loan,including the circumstances under which a loan may be called due and payable upon the passage of time or a specified event external to the loan.
it is clear that what real parties complain of is the amount of interest charged over the life of the loan,and the timing of the disbursal of loan proceeds.charging interest and disbursing loan proceeds,we conclude,fall within the category of terms of credit as that phrase is used in paragraph b of code of federal regulations section.the date interest begins to accrue and who pays it are as much terms of credit as deferral and capitalization of interest and adjustments to the interest rate,balance,payment due,or term to maturity b since all of these items center around the essential reason lenders issue home loans,to wit,charging and collecting interest.
we find that preemption of state law claims,premised on the theory that the charging of interest by a federal savings and loan association is unlawful,is explicit by virtue of the provisions of code of federal regulations section which expressly preempts any state law governing the lending operations of a federal savings institution.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court order overruling washington mutual demurrers to those causes of action contained within the guilford and talley complaints alleging violations of section,the upa,and the consumers legal remedies act must be set aside 
washington mutual contends that by its terms section does not apply to loan proceeds deposited into an escrow account by a wire or electronic transfer.real parties disagree and contend that section does not expressly exempt a wire or electronic transfer.
