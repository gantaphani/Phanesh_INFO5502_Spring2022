this case requires us to reexamine the jurisdictional boundary between the tucker act and the administrative procedure act,as that boundary is understood in the light of the supreme court decision in bowen massachusetts the case began as a dispute between plaintiff suburban mortgage associates,suburban,and defendants,the united states department of housing and urban development hud et.government with regard to a contract for insurance.plaintiff sued the government in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the suit was cast in part as an action for specific performance of the contract and in part as a declaratory judgment action.the relief sought was to require the government to perform its contract obligations so that suburban mortgage could get the money allegedly due it under the insurance agreement.
the action quickly morphed into a dispute over what court had been authorized by congress to hear the case was it the district court the plaintiff choice or was it the united states court of federal claims the government choice the government forced the issue by moving in the district court to have that court either dismiss the entire case or transfer it from the district court to the court of federal claims.the district court denied the government motion.
litigation over where to litigate is the unfortunate consequence of the complex of statutes and courts that comprise the federal system.nothing is more wasteful than litigation about where to litigate,particularly when the options are all courts within the same legal system that will apply the same law.bowen,at.scalia,dissenting.this court plays a role in such litigation.when a district court denies a motion to transfer an action to the court of federal claims as provided by,an interlocutory appeal from such a denial may be taken to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.d a.the government has exercised that right in this case.
for the reasons we shall explain,and despite suburban valiant effort to frame the suit as one for declaratory or injunctive relief,this kind of litigation should be understood for what it is.at bottom it is a suit for money for which the court of federal claims can provide an adequate remedy,and it therefore belongs in that court.the district court determination to the contrary is reversed,and the matter is remanded to that court with instructions to either dismiss the suit in its entirety or transfer it to the court of federal claims.
background 
suburban is a commercial mortgage lender based in maryland.in suburban made a loan,secured by a mortgage on the subject property,to hillside nursing home hillside,a now defunct nursing home and assisted living facility in rhode island to encourage development of such facilities for the elderly,congress has authorized hud to underwrite such loans,that is,to guarantee payment of the mortgage loan.see national housing act nha.in effect,the government insures the loan.at suburban request,hud,in exchange for premiums paid by suburban,undertook that obligation with regard to the hillside loan.
the agreement with hud means that,should the borrower hillside default on the underlying loan and the lender suburban consequently incur loses,hud will reimburse the lender pursuant to the terms of the insurance agreement.in order to collect the insurance proceeds when there has been a default by the borrower,the lender must first transfer its interest in the mortgage and mortgaged property to hud.the lender has the option of foreclosing and taking title to the property,then transferring the property to hud,c or directly assigning the defaulted note and mortgage to hud,b.in either case,hud pays the lender the outstanding debt the borrower owed,less certain charges.
in this case,the nursing home hillside defaulted on its mortgage loan.thereafter,suburban notified hud that it wished to exercise its contractual right under b to assign the defaulted hillside mortgage to hud.hud,however,declined to accept assignment.under hud statutory authority for these insurance agreements,there is an incontestability clause that generally precludes hud from challenging its duty to pay.see nha e,e.however,an exception to that clause exists when the agreement involves fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the lender.id.in this case,hud thought it had sufficient reason to believe that suburban had committed fraud or made material misrepresentations to hud 
an extensive period of negotiation between the parties proved fruitless.suburban then sued hud in the district court for the district of columbia,asserting jurisdiction under as well as the administrative procedure act apa,the declaratory judgment act,and the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.the complaint contained two counts.
the first count,entitled declaratory judgment for hud to comply with its obligations pursuant to of the nha,asked the district court to declare hud actions unlawful and to order hud to perform its duties under the agreement,specifically,to accept assignment of the loan with ultimate reimbursement of the loan balance to suburban.echoing the language of the apa,suburban alleged that the government,by denying its assignment,acted arbitrarily,capriciously,and in violation of suburban due process rights under the fifth amendment.the second count,entitled breach of contract request for specific relief under of the apa,asked the court for specific relief in the form of payment of the insured loan amount and reimbursement of certain taxes and fees as losses plaintiff suffered because the government allegedly did not perform its duties under the insurance contract.
the government moved in the district court to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that the suit was basically a contract action,and therefore can only be heard in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,a.as an alternative to dismissal,the government requested that the district court transfer the case to the court of federal claims pursuant to.
in ruling on the motion,the district court looked for guidance to the precedent of its regional circuit,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.the district court recognized that it could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over claims against the government only if a plaintiff identifies an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.citing transohio savings bank office of thrift supervision,the court noted that the apa provides the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity for challenges to agency action,subject to three exceptions found in and the apa excludes from its waiver of sovereign immunity claims for money damages,claims for which an adequate remedy is available elsewhere,and claims seeking relief expressly or impliedly forbidden by another statute.suburban mortgage,dep t of hous.urban,wl,at.the court then examined suburban claims in light of these exceptions.
with regard to count ii of the complaint,the district court viewed that as a contract claim asking for essentially the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.id.at citing spectrum leasing united states.the court read the relevant precedent as precluding it from hearing contract claims against the government,whether for money damages or specific relief,because the tucker act impliedly forbids as that term is used in the apa any such relief by district courts.id.citing transohio,at sharp weinberger.applying this case law,the district court concluded that the apa did not waive sovereign immunity for count ii,and accordingly that count ii was outside of its jurisdiction.
the district court viewed count i differently.with regard to the first exception limiting the apa waiver of sovereign immunity,the district court cited bowen massachusetts for the proposition that a claim for money is not necessarily a claim for money damages as that term is used in the apa.citing maryland department of human resources department of health and human services,the court drew a distinction based on the purpose behind the payment sought is the plaintiff seeking money damages to substitute for a suffered loss,or is the plaintiff seeking specific relief in the form of money,the very thing to which he was entitled suburban mortgage,wl,at.although suburban characterized its requested relief in injunctive terms,the court recognized that suburban would recover money from hud if it prevailed.nevertheless,the court concluded that any such recovery would be money that hud was obligated to pay under the agreement.suburban therefore was seeking specific relief in the form of money to which it was entitled,rather than money damages.
turning to the second exception,the district court determined that suburban mortgage did not have an adequate remedy in the court of federal claims.while some of plaintiff claimed losses could be reduced to a monetary sum,the district court concluded that concerns about possible bankruptcy,loss of reputation,and lost future profits could only be addressed through injunctive relief.
finally,the district court held that count i did not seek relief expressly or impliedly forbidden by the tucker act.the government had argued that the claim was a disguised contract claim and therefore,like count ii,could not be adjudicated in district court.but the court concluded that plaintiff allegations regarding hud arbitrary refusal to accept assignment because of unproven fraud suspicions found their source in the statutes and constitutional provisions cited by suburban,and not the underlying contract for insurance that it had with hud.the district court therefore granted the government motion to dismiss count ii,and denied the motion to dismiss count i or to transfer the remaining case to the court of federal claims.
in the same order,the district court granted suburban motion to require hud to file with the court a copy of the administrative record on which it relied in making its determination with respect to the election of assignment.since an apa suit basically challenges an agency actions,the agency administrative record of what it has done is the record on which the court bases its decision.the effect of filing the agency administrative record in the matter would be to provide suburban with what amounts to discovery of the government case,whatever information the government may have for suspecting fraud.the government,however,would not have an equal opportunity for discovery of the facts known to suburban,the kind of discovery that could be had in a normal civil suit,including a contract dispute in the court of federal claims.
the government resisted producing the administrative record under the circumstances and promptly took an interlocutory appeal of the count i jurisdictional issue to this court,as it is entitled to do pursuant to d a.
discussion 
sovereign notion cherished by the medieval english kings and queens that they could do no wrong,at least no wrong correctable in their own a privilege still granted by the federal courts to the royals successor,the united states government.one consequence of this doctrine is that,absent a constitutional grant of authority,if one wishes to sue the united states for a wrong committed by one of its agents and agencies,one must find an appropriate act of congress that waives the government immunity from suit for that particular wrong.
if the suit is a civil action,other than in tort,there are two general statutes that waive sovereign immunity.one is the tucker act,the origins of which go back to the late in the tucker act,congress recognized that for a variety of reasons it was in the government interest to waive immunity and to allow people to bring suit against the government for money they believed was owed to them.for one thing,it relieved congress of the hassle of having to enact special bills to resolve disputes.for another,in the absence of such a waiver,the government cost of doing business would be greater since parties contracting with the government would understand that they had to factor in the costs of arbitrary bureaucratic behavior for which,absent the waiver,no judicial remedy would be available.the tucker act both waives sovereign immunity for,and grants the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction over,actions for money damages of more than.a 
the other general statute is the administrative procedure act apa.enacted to provide for judicial review in the federal district courts of certain agency actions,the act was amended in to expressly waive sovereign immunity for actions against the government,amended by,stat.though the apa itself does not provide an independent grant of subject matter jurisdiction,the general federal question jurisdictional statute,confers authority on the district courts to hear apa cases 
congress reconciled these two general statutory waivers by providing in the apa the three specific limitations noted by the trial court a suit under the apa can only seek relief other than money damages,the suit would lie under the apa only if there were no other adequate remedy in a court,and the suit could not be maintained if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.with these limitations,the apa and the tucker act were understood to cover quite different challenges to government action.a plaintiff seeking relief,other than monetary relief,from a disputed government agency action could challenge that action in district court under the apa.in contrast,a suit requesting relief in the form of a money judgment against the government could be brought in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,but not in a district court for jurisdictional purposes between the district courts under the apa and the court of federal claims under the tucker act,the money distinction seemed to provide a relatively watertight barrier.
in the barrier sprang a leak,a leak that has threatened to become a gusher.bowen massachusetts,d,is the source of the leak.in that case,the commonwealth of massachusetts brought suit challenging a decision by the secretary of health and human services refusing to reimburse the state for certain medicaid expenditures.under the medicaid program,the government makes quarterly advance payments to the state in anticipation of future reimbursable costs.when the secretary disallowed costs as not covered by the program,the result was a withholding of funds from future advances to compensate for past overpayments and to preclude future overpayments.
massachusetts filed suit in federal district court requesting declaratory and injunctive relief setting aside the secretary decision.the state invoked federal question jurisdiction pursuant to and alleged that the apa waived the government immunity.the government challenged the district court authority to hear the case,arguing that the claims court had exclusive jurisdiction over the state claim because it was one for money in excess of.
the supreme court agreed with the district court and the first circuit that the apa provided a waiver of sovereign immunity for the state claim and that the case was properly before the district court.in its opinion,the court first analyzed whether the claim was one for money damages,which would take it outside the purview of the apa under.although the ultimate relief sought by the state was monetary,that did not necessarily mean it could be described as money damages.bowen,at.the court understood the term money damages to mean compensation for the damage sustained by the failure of the federal government to pay as mandated.id.at.in contrast,the state was seeking to enforce the statutory mandate itself,which happens to be one for the payment of money.id.because the state sought to recover money it thought it was entitled to under the relevant statutes,the state claim was for specific relief rather than money damages.id.at.the dissent found this distinction unconvincing.id.at.scalia,dissenting.
the court next addressed the government argument that the state apa claim was barred under because there was an adequate remedy in the claims court.the court rejected the government position on the ground that the claims court had no power to grant equitable relief.id.at.the state sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the secretary to modify future medicaid practices.since the medicaid program was ongoing and a judgment in the case would require future cooperation between the parties,the court was not willing to assume,categorically,that a naked money judgment against the united states will always be an adequate substitute for prospective relief fashioned in the light of the rather complex ongoing relationship between the parties.id.the dissent disagreed with the majority on this issue as well,stating that a successful claim for money damages in the claims court would have precedential as well as collateral estoppel effect and therefore would be as effective in establishing the state future rights as would a declaratory judgment in district court.id.at.scalia,dissenting.in the dissent view,s ince the majority reasoning can not possibly be followed where it leads,the jurisdiction of the claims court has been thrown into chaos.id.at.scalia,dissenting.
as the dissent predicted,the bowen case has generated much confusion regarding the jurisdiction of the courts,as well as adverse commentary in,the same year bowen was decided,congress attempted to bring some order to the process.it enacted a statute providing that,when a district court order grants or denies a motion to transfer a suit against the government to the court of federal claims,an interlocutory appeal can be taken by either plaintiff or the government,title v,stat.codified at d.prior to then,parties could not obtain appellate review of the jurisdictional question until the case had been tried on the merits,possibly in the wrong trial court.to ensure uniform adjudication of all tucker act issues in a single forum,when congress established interlocutory review of these jurisdictional disputes it assigned the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction over such appeals,at,as reprinted in.
one consequence of the bowen case has been to create a sort of cottage industry among lawyers attempting to craft suits,ultimately seeking money from the government,as suits for declaratory or injunctive relief without mentioning the money.if successful,a plaintiff could have the case heard under the apa in one or another district court,with appeal to a regional circuit,rather than in the court of federal claims,where money claims against the government are routinely heard and decided,with appeal in the federal circuit.this court has had several opportunities to deal with such attempts,and to interpret and apply bowen.
to thwart such attempted forum shopping,our cases have emphasized that in determining whether a plaintiff suit is to be heard in district court or the court of federal claims,we must look beyond the form of the pleadings to the substance of the claim.we have cautioned litigants that dressing up a claim for money as one for equitable relief will not remove the claim from tucker act jurisdiction and make it an apa case.see,christopher,united states,a party may not circumvent the claims court exclusive jurisdiction by framing a complaint in the district court as one seeking injunctive,declaratory or mandatory relief where the thrust of the suit is to obtain money from the united states.quoting rogers ink,cir consol.edison of,united states,this court and its sister circuits will not tolerate a litigant attempt to artfully recast its complaint to circumvent the jurisdiction of the court of federal claims.brazos power,united states,court of federal claims jurisdiction can not be circumvented by such artful pleading and,accordingly,we customarily look to the substance of the pleadings rather than their form.ctr.for scis.united states,ncms notwithstanding the imprecision of the complaint,we therefore look to the true nature of the action in determining the existence or not of jurisdiction.quoting katz cisneros,kanemoto reno,a party may not avoid the court of federal claims jurisdiction by framing an action against the federal government that appears to seek only equitable relief when the party real effort is to obtain damages in excess of.quoting marshall leasing,united states,cir.
once we discern the true nature of a plaintiff claim as a claim for money,because of bowen we still must determine whether the claim is excluded from apa jurisdiction by the limitations in and.bowen and several cases following bowen begin their analysis by asking first whether the claim is for other than money damages,as that term is used in,and thus whether the suit meets this requirement for district court jurisdiction.the problem with that approach is that it turns on a linguistic distinction between money damages and a claim that happens to be for money,a distinction that is at best murky,and at worst without a difference.
our cases,and congress purpose in giving this court jurisdiction over these interlocutory appeals,dictate that the better course is to ask first whether the cause is one over which the court of federal claims has jurisdiction under the tucker act.the analysis begins,then,with the question raised by there an adequate remedy in a court other than the district court,that is,can the court of federal claims provide an adequate remedy under the tucker act for the alleged wrong 
one reason for beginning the analysis with the adequate remedy issue is that its resolution often will be dispositive.if the suit is at base a claim for money,and the relief available through the court of federal claims under the tucker money provide an adequate remedy,the inquiry is at an end.there is no need to address the money damages limitation because precludes adjudication under the apa.a number of cases have recognized the value in this approach.see christopher,at determining there was an adequate remedy in the court of federal claims without analyzing the money damages limitation consol.edison,at declining to address the money damages issue because the court of federal claims would provide an adequate remedy kanemoto,at treating the adequate remedy issue as a threshold question see also randall united states,cir t o determine whether plaintiff suit is cognizable under the apa,the court must first examine whether he has an available remedy under the tucker act.emphasis added.
another reason it is preferable to start with the adequate remedy limitation rather than the money damages limitation found in is the way the supreme court has read the limitation.as earlier noted,the supreme court in bowen interpreted the term money damages to mean that not all monetary relief is money damages,an interpretation that opened the way to linguistic manipulation and the consequent opportunity for forum shopping.as the court explained,if the plaintiff requests funds to which a statute allegedly entitles it,rather than money in compensation for sustained losses,the relief sought is something other than money damages.bowen,at.see also ncms,at kanemoto,at katz,at.thus if a plaintiff seeks a money judgment but a court concludes that the relief sought is other than money damages,the limitation is not an impediment to apa review by the district court.
however,even if the plaintiff escapes the limitation in this manner,the inquiry can not end there because a claim seeking monetary relief,however defined,may nevertheless be within the jurisdictional scope of the tucker act a court must therefore undertake the second analytical whether there is an adequate remedy available under the tucker act in the court of federal claims for the monetary relief.see ncms,at katz,at.if the jurisdictional requirements of the tucker act are satisfied,the claim is for more than and is based on a statute,regulation,or constitutional provision,or an express or implied contract with the government,see fisher united states,en banc in relevant part,and if the court of federal claims through a money judgment can provide an adequate remedy under the tucker act,bars the district court from hearing the case because it belongs in another court of federal claims.again,the same conclusion could have been reached without first addressing the money damages limitation of.see consol.edison,at acknowledging that plaintiff might satisfy by seeking monetary relief other than money dam
