we granted review to address whether the national bank act of stat.nba preempts civil code section,a california law requiring that certain disclosures accompany preprinted checks that a credit card issuer provides to its cardholders for use as credit.the nba contains no such requirement with respect to the issuance of convenience checks to credit customers.instead,it broadly grants to national banks all such incidental power as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking by among other powers loaning money on personal security,par.seventh.we conclude that the nba preempts civil code section because the state law stands as an obstacle to the broad grant of power given by the nba to national banks to conduct the business of banking.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal judgment and remand the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
as indicated in the court of appeal opinion below,defendant mbna america bank,mbna renamed itself as fia card services,nevertheless,for the sake of simplicity,we shall follow the parties in continuing to refer to defendant as mbna.
in,mbna issued a credit card to plaintiff allan parks.later that year,as part of its service to cardholders,mbna extended credit to plaintiff by sending him preprinted drafts,commonly referred to as convenience checks.see rose chase bank usa,cir,rose.plaintiff used several of these convenience checks to purchase holiday gifts and pay bills,and he incurred finance charges in excess of those he would have incurred had he used his credit card for similar transactions.the convenience checks that mbna sent to parks did not include disclosures required by civil code section.that statute says a credit card issuer that extends credit to a cardholder through the use of a preprinted check or draft shall disclose on the front of an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft,in clear and conspicuous language,all of the following information that use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account.the annual percentage rate and the calculation of finance charges,as required by section of regulation z of the code of federal regulations,associated with the use of the attached check or draft.whether the finance charges are triggered immediately upon the use of the check or draft,subd.a paragraphing omitted hereafter section.
in,plaintiff sued mbna on behalf of himself and similarly situated mbna customers,alleging that the bank engaged in unfair competition in violation of business and professions code section et by failing to make the disclosures mandated by section.plaintiff sought both monetary and injunctive relief.mbna took the position that the nba and a federal regulation,title code of federal regulations part d hereafter former regulation d,preempt the state disclosure law.former regulation d was superseded by a amendment to section promulgated after congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.july,stat.hereafter dodd frank act.after several years of litigation,mbna renewed a previously rejected motion for judgment on the pleadings in light of the decision by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in rose,which involved different parties but the same factual and legal issues presented here.the ninth circuit concluded that the nba and former regulation d preempt section,and it affirmed the district court conclusion that the bank failure to attach the statutorily mandated disclosures to its convenience checks was not unlawful.rose,supra,at.relying on rose,the trial court granted mbna renewed motion.
the court of appeal reversed.applying barnett bank of marion county,nelson barnett bank,the court of appeal concluded that the nba does not preempt section because the state law does not significantly impair the power of national banks.according to the court of appeal,section is a generally applicable disclosure law that does not forbid banks from making loans via convenience checks.it merely requires clear and conspicuous disclosures of three items of information and requires those disclosures to be attached to the convenience checks.the court of appeal acknowledged that section imposes some burden on national banks and that finding preemption would establish clarity in the law.but the court said its task was not to divine the best policy,and it went on to hold that when a state disclosure requirement does not,on its face,forbid or significantly impair national banks from exercising a power granted to it by congress under the nba,national banks claiming preemption must make a factual showing that the disclosure requirement significantly impairs the exercise of the relevant power or powers.the court concluded that s ection does not,on its face,significantly impair federally authorized powers under the nba and that given the procedural posture of this case,mbna has not yet had an opportunity to submit evidence establishing a significant impairment.
the court of appeal further held that section was not preempted by former regulation d.that regulation provided,in pertinent part,that state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise lending powers are not applicable to national banks.a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning disclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in credit application forms,credit solicitations,billing statements,credit contracts,or other documents.d,viii.the court of appeal held that if valid,former regulation d expressly preempts section,and it further noted that the office of the comptroller of the currency occ had properly promulgated the regulation through the notice and comment procedure required for issuing a preemptive regulation under title united states code section a.
the court of appeal concluded,however,that t he language of former regulation d does not suggest a reasonable attempt to describe and interpret the reach of nba preemption.citation.rather,the regulation exempts national banks from all state disclosure requirements,even though the nba did not express an intention to create this bright line exemption.moreover,the court of appeal reasoned,congress failed to delegate the power to the occ to take administrative action whose sole purpose is to preempt state law rather than to implement a statutory command.watters wachovia bank,n,dis.opn.of stevens.though reluctant to create a split of authority sic with the ninth circuit court of appeals on a point of federal law,the court of appeal said it was require d to do so.
we granted mbna petition for review.
a preemption question is basically one of congressional intent.did congress,in enacting the federal statute,intend to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the laws of a state if so,the supremacy clause requires courts to follow federal,not state,law.barnett bank,supra,at,citing const,art.vi,cl.see also viva internat.voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,cal th,viva international.
this court has recognized four species of federal preemption express,conflict,obstacle,and field.viva international,supra,cal th at.first,express preemption arises when congress define s explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.citations.second,conflict preemption will be found when simultaneous compliance with both state and federal directives is impossible.citations.third,obstacle preemption arises when under the circumstances of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.finally,field preemption,congress intent to all state law in a particular area,applies where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.citation.id.at accord,bronco wine jolly cal th,see also barnett bank,supra,at.as explained below,the main dispute in this case implicates the third type of preemption that is,whether section stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the nba purposes.
since mcculloch state of maryland citation,it has not been open to question that the federal government may constitutionally create and govern banks within the states.franklin nat.bank of franklin square new york u,franklin.in franklin,the high court considered whether a new york statute prohibiting banks from using the word saving or savings in their advertising or business id.at was preempted by the federal reserve act,which authorized national banks to receive time and savings deposits franklin,at,quoting,or by the nba,which grants national banks all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking franklin,at,quoting,par.seventh.franklin held that the state law was preempted,explaining that w e can not believe that the incidental powers granted to national banks should be construed so narrowly as to preclude the use of advertising in any branch of their authorized business.franklin,at.because congress had authorized national banks to accept and pay interest on time deposits of people savings,they must be deemed to have the right to advertise that fact by using the commonly understood description which congress has specifically selected.we find no indication that congress intended to make this phase of national banking subject to local restrictions,as it has done by express language in several other instances.id.at,fn.omitted.
in subsequent cases involving national bank legislation,the high court has found preemption where compliance with federal and state law did not pose the kind of physical impossibility that exists where federal law requires banks to do something that state law prohibits.following franklin,the high court has repeatedly found a sufficient basis for preemption where the federal banking statute provides a broad,not a limited,permission.barnett bank,supra,at.in barnett bank,the court observed that the word powers is a legal concept that,in the context of national bank legislation,has a history.that history is one of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.ibid.the court went on to say that where congress has not expressly conditioned the grant of power upon a grant of state permission,the court has ordinarily found that no such condition applies.in franklin nat.bank,the court made this point explicit.it held that congress did not intend to subject national banks power to local restrictions,because the federal statute there in question contained no indication that congress so intended as it has done by express language in several other instances.at,and.barnett bank,supra,at.
barnett bank applied these principles to a florida law providing that banks can not sell insurance in florida except that an unaffiliated small town bank,a bank that is not affiliated with a bank holding company may sell insurance in a small town.barnett bank,supra,at.the federal law at issue said that any national bank operating in a small town may act as the agent for any fire,life,or other insurance company authorized by the authorities of the state to do business there,by soliciting and selling insurance id.at,citing act of,stats,as amended,alterations except final ellipsis in original.the court held the state law preempted,explaining that t he federal statute before us,as in franklin nat.bank,explicitly grants a national bank an authorization,permission,or power.and,as in franklin nat.bank,it contains no indication that congress intended to subject that power to local restriction.barnett bank,supra,at.
in reaching this conclusion,the high court observed that a federal grant of power to national banks does not preempt state law where there is an explicit statement that the exercise of that power is subject to state law barnett bank,supra,at or where the state law does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers id.at.although normally congress would not want states to forbid,or to impair significantly,the exercise of a power that congress explicitly granted,federal banking laws do not preempt state laws that do not significantly impair a national bank exercise of its congressionally authorized powers.ibid.in,the dodd frank act codified the significant impairment test articulated in barnett bank.see b b declaring state consumer financial laws preempted if in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the decision of the supreme court of the united states in barnett bank the state consumer financial law prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its powers.
the high court affirmed and elaborated on these principles in watters wachovia bank,supra,watters.there,the court considered michigan statutes requiring mortgage brokers,lenders,and servicers that are subsidiaries of national banks to register with the state office of financial and insurance services and submit to state supervision.id.at,citing stats.it was undisputed that under the nba michigan licensing,registration,and inspection requirements can not be applied to national banks themselves.watters,supra,at see id.at,quoting a no national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by federal law.the question was whether michigan regulatory regime survived preemption as applied to operating subsidiaries of national banks.the court held that it did not,relying on federal statutes and regulations authorizing operating subsidiaries to engage only in activities national banks may engage in directly,subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks.watters,supra,at,quoting gramm leach bliley act,a,stats,codified at g a see also watters,supra,at,relying on occ regulations.except where federal law provides otherwise,the court explained,we have treated operating subsidiaries as equivalent to national banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law id.at,including the nba grant of power to engage in real estate lending watters,supra,at,citing and all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking watters,supra,at,quoting,par.seventh.because the michigan statutes would interfere with the business of banking conducted by operating subsidiaries just as much as it would interfere with such business conducted by national banks themselves,the nba preempted the state regulatory regime whether applied to national banks or to their operating subsidiaries.watters,supra,at.
summarizing the principles established in franklin and barnett bank,the high court in watters said in the years since the nba enactment,we have repeatedly made clear that federal control shields national banking from unduly burdensome and duplicative state regulation.citations.we have interpret ed grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.citations.states are permitted to regulate the activities of national banks where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank or the national bank regulator exercise of its powers.but when state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority,enumerated or incidental under the nba,the state regulations must give way.watters,supra,at.
moreover,in explaining why the michigan supervisory regime could not apply to national banks and their operating subsidiaries,the high court in watters said that were it otherwise,n ational banks would be subject to registration,inspection,and enforcement regimes imposed not just by michigan,but by all states in which the banks operate.diverse and duplicative superintendence of national banks engagement in the business of banking,we observed over a century ago,is precisely what the nba was designed to prevent th e legislation has in view the erection of a system extending throughout the country,and independent,so far as powers conferred are concerned,of state legislation which,if permitted to be applicable,might impose limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.citation.congress did not intend,we explained,to leave the field open for the states to attempt to promote the welfare and stability of national banks by direct legislation c onfusion would necessarily result from control possessed and exercised by two independent authorities.watters,supra,at,fn.omitted see also id.at j ust as duplicative state examination,supervision,and regulation would significantly burden mortgage lending when engaged in by national banks,so too would those state controls interfere with that same activity when engaged in by an operating subsidiary.
applying the principles above,we conclude that the nba preempts section.as noted,the nba broadly authorizes national banks to exercise all such incidental power as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,par.seventh.this broad power expressly includes loaning money on personal security.ibid.the disclosure requirements in section impose a condition on the federally authorized power of national banks to loan money on personal security.those requirements say that national banks like mbna may offer credit in the form of convenience checks so long as the checks contain specific disclosures.but here,as in barnett bank,the federal statute does not grant national banks a limited permission,that is,permission to loan money on personal security to the extent that state law also grants permission to do so.barnett bank,supra,at.instead,federal law authorizes national banks to loan money on personal security with no indication that congress intended to subject that power to local restriction.id.at,quoting franklin,supra,at.
the specific disclosure obligations imposed by section exceed any requirements in federal law.the requirement in section that disclosures appear on the front of an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft has no counterpart in federal law.the same is true of section requirement that precise language use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account appear on each check,subd.a.in addition,although federal regulations require certain disclosures when the terms of using a convenience check differ from the terms of the customer credit account b,they do not mandate that every convenience check disclose w hether the finance charges are triggered immediately upon use of the check,as section,subdivision a requires.furthermore,although section,subdivision a mandates disclosure of interest rates and finance charges as required by section of regulation z of the code of federal regulations,that federal regulation pertains to advertising see and arguably does not apply to convenience check offers.
in characterizing the disclosure requirements of section,the court of appeal said that the statute does not forbid the exercise of a banking power authorized by the nba.section does not bar national banks from loaning money on personal security through convenience checks.it is true that section,unlike the state law in barnett bank that prohibited national banks from selling insurance in small towns,does not outlaw a category of banking activity.however,to say that mbna may offer convenience checks so long as it complies with section is equivalent to saying that mbna may not offer convenience checks unless it complies with section.whether phrased as a conditional permission or as a contingent prohibition,the effect of section is to forbid national banks from offering credit in the form of convenience checks unless they comply with state law.as demonstrated by the instant lawsuit brought under california unfair competition law bus,et,a national bank may be subject to monetary liability,and its convenience check offers may be enjoined,if it does not comply.
requiring compliance with section as a condition of loaning money on personal security,par.seventh through convenience checks significantly impair s the exercise of authority granted to national banks by the nba watters,supra,at.section prescribes the content of the disclosures by specifying what must be disclosed on each convenience check.section prescribes specific language that a credit card issuer must use use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account,subd.a.in addition,section prescribes the manner and format of the disclosures the disclosures must appear on the front of an attachment,the attachment must be affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check,and the disclosures must appear in clear and conspicuous language.these requirements as to the content,language,manner,and format of disclosures seem no less prescriptive than the new york law in franklin that prohibited banks other than the state own chartered savings institutions from using the word saving or savings in their advertisements or business.see franklin,supra,at fn,citing stat.the new york law did not bar national banks from receiving deposits or soliciting deposits through advertisements.it simply required national banks operating in new york to use other words to entice people to deposit their money for and to describe the business of protecting,growing,and lending those deposits.see franklin,at the state does not object to national banks taking savings deposits or even to their advertising that fact so long as they do not use the word savings.nevertheless,the high court held that the state law impermissibly interfered with the federally authorized business of national banks.see id.at.
moreover,even if california disclosure requirements by themselves do not seem particularly onerous,the high court in watters made clear that our preemption analysis must consider the burden of disclosure regimes imposed not just by california,but by all states in which the banks operate.watters,supra,at.if disclosure requirements such as those in section were allowed to stand,national banks operating in multiple states would face the prospect of limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.citation.id.at.national banks would have to monitor requirements as to the content,language,manner,and format of disclosures for each of the states and possibly municipalities as well,and continually adjust their convenience check offers to comply with the prescriptions of each local jurisdiction.such d iverse and duplicative regulation of national banks engagement in the business of banking is precisely what the nba was designed to prevent.id.at.congress intended national banks to have broad power to engage in the business of banking by loaning money on personal security,par.seventh,and that power would be significantly impaired if national banks had to comply with a diverse or duplicative patchwork of local disclosure requirements.
plaintiff contends that the phrase subject to law in the federal banking statute means that congress intended state laws like section to apply to national banks.see,par.seventh authorizing national banks t o exercise by its board of directors or duly authorized officers or agents,subject to law,all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking italics added.but plaintiff reading of the phrase subject to law can not be squared with the consistent line of high court precedent broadly construing the preemptive force of the nba absent express language that makes a federal banking power subject to state law.see ante,at.plaintiff textual argument contravenes the high court history of interpreting grants of both enumerated and incidental powers to national banks as grants of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.barnett bank,supra,at.
plaintiff further contends that section is a state law of general application,akin to state contract law,from which national banks are not exempt unless federal law expressly provides.see watters,supra,at.but section is quite different from the kind of state contract law we have previously upheld against preemp
