a documentary letter of credit is a method of payment whereby the promise of a stable financial source,usually a bank,is substituted for the promise of a credit applicant,usually a purchaser of goods.paramount export asia trust bank,d.at least three separate,independent transactions underlie the letter of credit the undertaking from the issuer of the letter of credit to the beneficiary the agreement between the issuer and the credit applicant and the underlying contract between the applicant and the beneficiary.san diego gas electric bank leumi th,d paramount export asia trust bank,d.
in this case,the triangular relationships included an agreement for the sale of clothing between appellant,dbjjj,seller,a garment manufacturer,and pennsylvania fashions,buyer an agreement between buyer and respondent,national city bank bank regarding the issuance of two letters of credit and two letters of credit issued by bank,naming seller as the beneficiary.both letters of credit were subject to the revision of the international chamber of commerce,uniform customs and practices for documentary credits ucp,a compilation of accepted commercial practices designed to ease international trade the ucp provides that an issuing bank shall have a reasonable time,not to exceed seven banking days following the day of receipt of the documents,to examine the documents and determine whether to take up or refuse the documents and to inform the party from which it received the documents accordingly.b.
under the terms of the two similar letters of credit,bank promised to pay seller if seller timely presented specified documents.after seller shipped goods to buyer,either seller or its assignee presented documents to bank and requested payment.bank identified discrepancies between the documents and the terms of the credit and sought a waiver from buyer.failing to obtain a waiver,bank refused the documentary presentation.neither seller nor its assignee ever received payment for the goods seller shipped to buyer.
to resolve the issues in this appeal,we must apply the ucp to assess the timeliness of bank notice of its decision to refuse the documents.the meaning of the phrase reasonable time,not to exceed seven banking days is vigorously disputed.
we hold that seven banking days,the maximum time permitted,is not automatically reasonable where a bank seeks a waiver from an applicant.we also hold that the phrase reasonable time,not to exceed seven banking days is reflected in article d i,the rule governing notice to the beneficiary of the decision to refuse the documents.where a bank fails to timely examine documents and provide notice,it is precluded from arguing that the documentary presentation is non conforming.
we shall reverse the summary judgment awarded in favor of bank.because seller failed to establish that it was entitled to summary judgment,we shall remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual background 
seller and buyer entered into an agreement for the sale of clothing.buyer applied for and bank issued two similar letters of credit naming seller as the beneficiary.both letters of credit required a documentary presentation.both identified wilshire state bank wsb as the advising bank and the place of expiry.for purposes of this appeal,the relevant facts concern the chronology of each letter of credit and may be briefly summarized.
letter of credit no.loc 
loc was issued october,in the amount of,and expired november.on november,either seller or hana financial,hfi seller assignee,presented a request for negotiation and documents to wsb.on november,bank acknowledged receipt of the documents that same day,holly stamos,an employee of bank,reviewed the documents and prepared a negotiation worksheet,a form document with blank spaces to be filled in by the document examiner.the negotiation worksheet listed three discrepancies between the documents and the terms of the credit.
on december,stamos sent buyer a letter identifying the discrepancies and seeking a waiver.the letter indicated that the refusal date was december.the letter concluded with the following sentence please contact us immediately with your waiver of discrepancies or other instructions.on december,buyer informed bank that it refused to allow payment.that same day,bank informed wsb that it was rejecting the presentation because of discrepancies in the documents.the notice to wsb listed the same discrepancies as those identified on the negotiation worksheet and described to buyer.
letter of credit no.loc 
bank issued loc on october,and it expired on december.on december,either seller or hfi presented two separate requests for negotiation and documents to wsb.bank acknowledged receipt of the documents on december.stamos reviewed the documents the next day and prepared a negotiation worksheet,which identified four discrepancies between the documents and the terms of the credit.
stamos sent a letter to buyer noting the discrepancies and seeking a waiver.the letter referenced a refusal date of december,and concluded with the following sentence please contact us immediately with your waiver of discrepancies or other instructions.on december,buyer informed stamos that it refused to allow payment.on the same day,bank notified wsb that bank rejected the presentation under loc because of discrepancies in the documents.the notice to wsb listed the same discrepancies as those identified on the negotiation worksheet and described to buyer.
procedural background 
in its first amended complaint,seller alleged two causes of action for breach of contract,a violation of california uniform commercial code section et,and negligence.bank and wsb were named as defendants.wsb later was dismissed from the case and is not a party to this appeal.
seller and bank both moved for summary judgment.seller primarily argued the reasons bank provided for rejection of the documents were invalid,an issue it no longer advances on appeal.in its motion for summary judgment,bank maintained that it timely examined and rejected seller presentations.in opposition,seller disputed the timeliness of bank notice,the primary issue on appeal.
the trial court denied seller motion for summary judgment.applying the ucp and california law,the trial court granted bank motion for summary judgment,finding no triable issue of material fact as to whether bank was obligated to make payments under the subject letters of credit.the court concluded,defendant bank had until the close of business on the seventh banking day following its receipt of plaintiff claim and supporting documents to send its advice of rejection,and because bank complied with this time period its notices of refusal were timely.seller appealed.
contentions 
this appeal does not involve the adequacy of seller documentary presentation,but instead concerns whether bank is estopped from relying on the conceded inadequacy of seller presentation the principal issue is whether bank is precluded from raising discrepancies in the documents because it failed to provide timely notice of its refusal to honor the documents.
seller also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because bank improperly colluded with buyer in seeking a waiver of the discrepancies,that bank was required to notify it of the discrepancies at the same time it notified buyer,and that bank decided to refuse the documents at the time it identified the discrepancies in the documents.
bank disputes all of seller contentions and argues that seller lacks standing,that ohio law governs,and that the ucp supplants the commercial code.
discussion 
we begin with the threshold issues raised by law and standing.in part ii,we consider the crux of this length of time an issuing bank has to examine documents when it seeks a waiver from the applicant.in part iii,we discuss preclusion under the ucp,focusing on whether an issuing bank forfeits its right to argue that the documents are nonconforming if it exceeds the time period allotted for examining the documents and seeking a waiver.in the remaining sections,we discuss seller claims that bank violated article because bank was required to notify it of the discrepancies at the same time it notified buyer,bank colluded with buyer under the guise of seeking a waiver of discrepancies,and bank rejected the documents at the time it identified discrepancies between the documents and the terms of the credit.
choice of law 
citing section,subdivision a of the california uniform commercial code bank argues that as the letters of credit were issued in ohio,to the extent that any state law should be applied,including the commercial code,ohio law is applicable.the only citation to ohio law in bank brief is for the proposition that ohio law is identical to california law in its requirement that documents must strictly comply with the terms and conditions of a letter of credit.this legal principle is irrelevant to this appeal because seller now concedes that its documents were nonconforming.because bank fails to analyze,cite to,or provide ohio law on any of the issues relevant to this appeal,it is appropriate to analyze it under california law.nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,fn,d.
in any event,bank claim that ohio law is applicable is simply a distraction.the california law objected to by bank,section,is exactly the same as ohio law.both states adopted the uniform commercial code language and commentary as their own.see ula com.code,cal,ohio.
applicability of the california uniform commercial code 
the parties agree that both letters of credit are subject to the ucp.bank argues the commercial code is relevant only with respect to issues not addressed by ucp.section,subdivision c provides in part except as otherwise provided in this subdivision,the liability of an issuer,nominated person,or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice,such as the uniform customs and practice for documentary credits,to which the letter of credit,confirmation,or other undertaking is expressly made subject.however,where there is no conflict between article and the relevant provision of the ucp or other practice,both apply.official comments on,deering ann.cal.ed.foll.
bank identifies one potential conflict between the ucp and the california uniform commercial.we shall discuss preclusion based only on the ucp.aside from this single potential conflict,bank identifies no other conflict and we find no other conflict relevant to issues in this appeal.see hawkland,uniform commercial code series.revised to track ucp see also official comments on,deering ann.cal.ed.foll.article is generally consistent with ucp.
bank next argues that seller lacks standing because seller assigned its interest in both letters of credit to hfi.the trial court did not base the award of summary judgment on that ground.in this court,bank acknowledged that it received a letter purporting to establish that hfi transferred its rights under the letters of credit back to appellant.
the general rule favors permitting a party to substitute the real party in interest.garrison bd.of directors th,d california air resources board hart th,d.if seller is not the proper party,it should have the opportunity to substitute hfi.ibid.
seller challenges the trial court conclusion that bank had until the close of business the seventh banking day following its receipt of plaintiff claim and supporting documents to send its advice of rejection,and because bank complied with this seven day time period its notices of refusal were timely.the parties agree only that the relevant provisions are found in articles and of the ucp.
according to article c seeking a waiver from an applicant does not extend the period mentioned in b.the time period in article b is a reasonable time,not to exceed seven banking days following the day of receipt of the documents,to examine the documents and determine whether to take up or refuse the documents and to inform the party from which it received the documents accordingly.
bank argues t he safe harbor does not extend the seven banking day period.rather,it merely recognizes that it is reasonable for an issuing bank to have the full seven banking days if the applicant does not respond sooner to a request for a waiver or responds on the final day.for support bank cites to a document that indicates,in practice,a bank uses seven banking days to provide notice whenever a bank seeks a waiver from the applicant.bank provides only an excerpt of this document,which appears to be in a newsletter from the united states council on international banking.
bank interpretation is inconsistent with the ucp because it entirely disregards the phrase reasonable time.article b provides for a reasonable time,not to exceed seven banking days.it does not,as bank argument suggests,provide for a time period of seven banking days.by giving no meaning to the phrase reasonable time,bank argument is inconsistent with the plain language of article b.
bank argument can not be reconciled with the intent of the ucp.internat.chamber of commerce,com.on banking technique and practice,publication,ucp compared del busto ed.ucp and compared at.the limit,as stipulated in ucp b was agreed upon as a compromise however,just because a bank now has a limit not to exceed seven days following the day of receipt of the documents,to examine the documents and determine whether to take up or refuse the documents does not mean that it is prudent,reasonable,or even proper for a bank to take all of that time to examine the documents and determine whether to accept or refuse such documents.ibid.
bank argument also ignores the comment to the california uniform commercial code section,adopted by both california and ohio,which provides section a balances the need of the issuer for time to examine the documents against the possibility that the examiner at the urging of the applicant or for fear that it will not be reimbursed will take excessive time to search for defects.what is a reasonable time is not extended to accommodate an issuer procuring a waiver from the applicant.see article of the ucp.the same comment continues examiners must note that the period is not a safe harbor.the time within which the issuing bank must give notice is the lesser of a reasonable time or seven business days.where there are few documents the reasonable time would be less than seven days.official comments on com.code,deering ann.cal.com.code,supra,foll.this comment to the california uniform commercial code is consistent with the plain language of article b,which requires a bank to examine the documents within a reasonable time and establishes the maximum time reasonable as seven banking days.
bank cites a excerpt from an article by the united states council on international banking as its sole support for its argument that the full seven banking days is reasonable.assuming the reliability of the excerpt,it is unpersuasive for the same reason bank argument is unpersuasive it is inconsistent with the plain language of the ucp,the intent of the ucp,and the official comments on uniform commercial code.whereas article b indicates that a reasonable time can not exceed seven banking days,the excerpt indicates,without supporting authority,that the bank has up to the full seven day period within which to give notice of refusal.
to the extent bank is arguing that the practice of banks may elucidate the meaning of the ucp,that argument may have merit where the practice is consistent with the ucp and further explains the ucp.see trading usa bank of china cir,reviewing expert testimony on the meaning of terms used in the ucp.the ucp does not rise to the status of a law.ibid alaska textile chase manhattan.therefore,the general restriction on expert testimony on an issue of law is relaxed.see summers gilbert th,d holding that an expert opinion is not admissible on an issue of law alaska textile,supra,at allowing expert testimony on the ucp,subd.e determination of the issuer observance of the standard practice is a matter of interpretation for the court.
however,to the extent bank argument is that the industry norm trumps the ucp,that argument lacks merit.countenancing that argument would result in a fragmented patchwork of local customs and practices,the very problem letters of credit and the ucp were designed to avoid.brenntag international nordd
