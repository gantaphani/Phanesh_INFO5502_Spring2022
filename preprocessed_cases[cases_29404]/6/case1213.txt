plaintiff carolyn holbert appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment of defendant fremont reorganization corporation,formerly known as fremont investment loan fremont.plaintiff contends issues of fact remain on her claims for violation of the federal truth in lending act et tila,as amended by the home ownership and equity protection act of aa hoepa,unfair business practices and financial elder abuse stemming from a home loan issued to plaintiff by fremont.
we conclude fremont was not required to comply with hoepa,which applies when the finance charges imposed on a loan exceed a certain threshold.we conclude two charges imposed on plaintiff,one to pay off a preexisting debt to another lender and another to satisfy a prepayment penalty on a prior home loan,were not finance charges within the meaning of hoepa.
we further conclude plaintiff has not established a claim against fremont for unfair business practices.while unfair business practices may include both unlawful and unfair acts,the complaint in this matter alleges only unlawful acts.furthermore,the alleged unlawful act is a violation of hoepa,which we conclude did not occur here.
finally,while plaintiff may have a viable claim against her loan broker for financial elder abuse based on various misrepresentations made during the loan process,she failed to link that claim to fremont,who is as much a victim of the broker misrepresentations as plaintiff.
we therefore affirm the judgment of dismissal.
