plaintiff is in the business of making loans.the loans are secured by the borrower assets,which are appraised before the loan is made.on numerous occasions,mb valuation had performed appraisals for plaintiff.to secure the loan to american mold,plaintiff called scott creel creel at mb valuation about appraising american mold equipment.the parties disagree as to creel actual involvement after this request.according to plaintiff,creel stated that he could not himself perform the appraisal but that he would find another appraiser and would supervise and review that appraiser work.plaintiff states that creel then put plaintiff in touch with an appraiser from another company,appraisal services,and that creel reviewed the appraisal as he had promised and increased some specific equipment appraisal amounts and reduced others.according to mb valuation,creel referred plaintiff to another appraisal company and had no further involvement in the appraisal.
the final appraisal valued american mold equipment at about million.mb valuation and creel did not receive payment from plaintiff or any other source for their involvement with this appraisal.several months after the closing of the loan,american mold defaulted on the loan and filed for bankruptcy.the equipment,which had been appraised at a value of about million,sold for about.
plaintiff claims damages of about million,resulting from professional negligence on the part of mb valuation.significantly,plaintiff complaint alleged only negligence on the part of mb valuation and did not allege gross negligence.mb valuation moved for summary judgment.the court below granted summary judgment because it found that the factual dispute described above was not material to the outcome of the case.the court found that because plaintiff had never paid mb valuation for the of the dispute over creel act by mb valuation was gratuitous.under massachusetts law,liability for a gratuitous act arises only from gross negligence.thus,since plaintiff alleged only negligence and not gross negligence,plaintiff could not recover as a matter of law.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.tum barber foods,cir.since mb valuation has moved for summary judgment,we construe the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff.id.
a basic principle of negligence law is that ordinarily everyone has a duty to refrain from affirmative acts that unreasonably expose others to a risk of harm.tobin norwood country club.in contrast,a person generally does not have a duty to take affirmative action.commonwealth levesque.for example,a mere passerby who observes a fire has no obligation to alert authorities.id.at.if,however,a person voluntarily assumes a duty,that duty must be performed with due care.mullins pine manor college,
for a duty voluntarily undertaken,the standard of due care depends upon the nature of the action.the supreme judicial court sjc has noted that j ustice requires that the one who undertakes to perform a duty gratuitously should not be under the same measure of obligation as one who enters upon the same undertaking for pay.massaletti fitzroy.a person undertaking a nongratuitous duty,such as one for pay,has a duty to refrain from ordinary negligence.wheatley peirce.in contrast,a person undertaking a gratuitous duty must refrain only from gross negligence.id.therefore,in order to determine whether a duty of care has been breached,we must first determine whether the duty was gratuitous or not.in a number of cases,massachusetts courts have undertaken the task of distinguishing gratuitous and nongratuitous acts.an important factor is whether there was a social nature in the relations of the parties.beaulieu lincoln rides.a gratuitous act is more likely to occur when an act is of a social nature rather than a business nature.see id.
the line between gratuitous and nongratuitous acts is relatively clear in the social context.in a social context,when a person does a favor for another person,whether a friend or a stranger,and receives no consideration other than those intangible advantages arising from mere social intercourse,comeau comeau,the act will be gratuitous.for example,in bagley burkholder,the plaintiff and defendant were both truck drivers for different trucking companies,and plaintiff sued defendant for injuries that occurred while defendant was helping plaintiff move his truck.the court found that defendant act was gratuitous because the evidence showed no business purpose and no immediate advantage to the defendant of his helpful action.id.at.similarly,in a personal context,when a person offers to give another person a ride without any consideration,the act will be gratuitous see ruel langelier,massaletti,at taylor goldstein,finding the giving of a ride to be a nongratuitous act where the objective of the ride was to benefit the driver and not the passenger.finally,when a host receives a guest as a visitor for social purposes,the act will be gratuitous.shea.
in the business context,the line between gratuitous and nongratuitous acts is more difficult to discern.the dispositive question is whether the allegedly gratuitous act had a business purpose.see onofrio of mental health,defendant was furthering its own business interests falden crook,defendant was doing a kind act rather than building up good will for his business.beaulieu lincoln rides,t here is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant,a business corporation,undertook to give the plaintiff a pure gratuity.foley mcdonald,a business purpose could be found in the transportation of the plaintiffs by the defendants in the course of an attempt by the defendants to sell an automobile to the plaintiffs.
for an act to have a business purpose it need only be incidental to the defendant business.foley,at.for example,when a car salesman drove a prospective buyer home,the court found that the act was incidental to the business purpose of selling automobiles and therefore nongratuitous.id.at.in contrast,where an ice cream truck driver gave a customer a ride home,the act was not incidental to the defendant business as the court found that the driver was doing a kind act rather than building up good will for his business.falden,at.
for an act to be nongratuitous,it is only necessary for a jury to find some business advantage to the defendant.beaulieu,at.in beaulieu,the defendant was the operator of an amusement park ride who gave free rides before and charged for rides after id.at.the court found that a jury could find that the purpose of giving free rides was merely to interest customers and increase business.id.at.a conjectural future benefit,however,will not establish an otherwise nonexistent business purpose.bagley,at.in bagley,the plaintiff truck driver argued that the defendant truck driver assistance was not gratuitous because,had he not given assistance,the defendant would receive a bad reputation and other truck drivers would not help the defendant in the future.id.at.the bagley court found this karmic claim meritless.id.at.
an act may have a business purpose even though no pecuniary benefit actually resulted to the defendants.foley,at.it is enough that the object of the act was pecuniary benefit to the defendants and this fact if found would take the act out of the category of gratuitous
