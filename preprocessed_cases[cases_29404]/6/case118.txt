in,palmer stoutt,together with rancal international and rancal,companies of which stoutt is the president,sued banco popular de puerto rico banco popular or the bank for malicious prosecution,unlawful arrest and incarceration,and defamation.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of banco popular based on the safe harbor provision of the laundering act,which gives immunity to reports of suspected illegal activity.this appeal followed.
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment here,stoutt.am.specialty ins.lapalme,cir.stoutt and one or more of his companies had a continuing business relationship with banco popular.in june,stoutt entered into negotiations with the bank for a loan in the amount of million.banco popular approved the loan conditioned on the securing of adequate collateral in the form of united states treasury bills.
in july,stoutt contacted securities,a registered securities based in chicago,and entered into an arrangement whereby he would lease million in treasury bills from for a month.through this lease,stoutt was told that he could both collateralize the loan from banco popular and invest the surplus bills in a margin account which would generate sufficient income for him to cover the lease cost.
as part of the transaction,securities required stoutt to make a good faith deposit with it equal to the first month lease cost.to satisfy this requirement,stoutt sought a line of credit from banco popular.on july,banco popular granted the words of the document commercial line of credit in the amount of for the discretionary use to conduct the company business affairs.stoutt contends that banco popular understood the underlying treasury bill leasing arrangement with.
on august,stoutt attempted to draw on the line of credit to make the good faith deposit with.josé guzmán,the banco popular manager in the hato rey branch with whom stoutt was dealing,refused the request for reasons that are disputed.according to stoutt,guzmán said that if stoutt deposited in his banco popular account a check drawn on his account in another bank,the bank would pay on an uncollected funds basis,that it would allow withdrawal immediately without waiting for the deposited check to clear.see black law dictionary ed.
stoutt told guzmán that he controlled only one other checking account,which had just been established at the citibank branch in miami.guzmán allegedly told stoutt that if the citibank check were returned unpaid to banco popular,banco popular could initially cover the overdraft by allowing an advance on the line of credit.that afternoon,stoutt deposited into the banco popular account of an affiliated rancal company a check drawn on rancal citibank account.
stoutt apparently believed that sufficient profits from the investment of surplus treasury bills leased from would arrive in the citibank account in time to cover the check.yet when banco popular presented stoutt check to citibank,the check was dishonored for insufficient funds and thereafter dishonored a second time.in the meantime,stoutt had already transferred out from his banco popular account credited there based upon his citibank check to make his deposit with securities,so his banco popular account was now overdrawn by.
in late september,stoutt discovered that the securities transaction was apparently a scam directed against him and that he had lost his good faith deposit without securing the promised treasury bills.in october,he contacted the securities and exchange commission,the united states attorney office in chicago,and the national association of securities dealers.he also retained a lawyer to help him recover the.
the size of stoutt overdraft alerted officials at banco popular.meetings were held in october between him and banco popular officials,and internally within banco popular.at one such meeting,some banco popular officials concluded that stoutt was engaged in check kiting.check writing a check against an account with insufficient amount to an offense under federal bank fraud law.united states fontana,cir.
on november,banco popular filed a criminal referral form crf with the fbi.the crf,a predecessor of the suspicious activity report sar under current law,was required to be filed in various situations.the language of the crf,though opaque in parts,clearly applied if banco popular suspected that possible criminal activity had inflicted on it a potential loss of more than.see c,in this case,banco popular crf stated that the suspected violation appeared to be an isolated incident of check kiting.
the fbi,after discussions with banco popular employees,began a criminal investigation of stoutt and he was ultimately arrested.a federal grand jury indicted him for bank fraud on december.in early,the united states voluntarily dismissed the charges without prejudice for reasons that are unclear.conceivably,the prosecutor on reflection thought this a marginal case in which a jury might deem stoutt more negligent and gullible than consciously fraudulent.
on december,stoutt and his two corporate sued banco popular in the federal court in puerto rico for a variety of torts already listed flowing from banco popular report to and subsequent contact with the fbi,as well as a bivens claim under the fourth amendment for false arrest.see bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d.after discovery the district court in july granted the bank motion for summary judgment,holding that the bank was entitled to absolute immunity under the safe harbor provision of g.stoutt banco popular de,d.on appeal,stoutt argues on various grounds that the bank was not entitled to immunity.our review is de novo.united states howard,cir.
at the time of the transactions and the lawsuit,the immunity provision read,in pertinent part,as follows 
any financial institution that makes a disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation or a disclosure pursuant to this subsection or any other authority,and any director,officer,employee,or agent of such institution,shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the united states or any constitution,law,or regulation of any state or political subdivision thereof for such disclosure 
stoutt makes two core with several avoid the immunity statute a further argument,pertaining only to the bivens claim,is discussed below first,that the bank disclosures in discussions with the fbi,after the filing of the crf itself,fall outside the scope of the statute protection and second,that the statute,read in light of the regulations,implicitly requires that any suspicions conveyed to the authorities be held in good requirement that stoutt says can not be met here because the bank knew that stoutt was innocent of criminal conduct.
the statute offers two different categories of coverage one is for disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation the other,for disclosure pursuant to this subsection or any other authority.the latter clause presumably embraces reports required by g which empowers the secretary of the treasury to compel the filing of reports or other comparable authority.perhaps it is arguable that disclosure under the pursuant to clause must be tied back to some legal mandate for disclosure and so encompasses the crf but not the discussions.
but,as just noted,the statute also protects disclosures of any possible violation of law or regulation,even if not tied to any legal mandate.the original crf report was cast as the disclosure of a possible case of bank fraud,assuredly a possible violation of law.conceivably,the answers to inquiries by the fbi directed to the details of the transaction could be distinguished from disclosure of a possible violation,since the details relate to an already disclosed violation.but this is not a very sensible reading given the purpose of the statute if the original core disclosure was text,ordinary answers to investigators would be footnotes and should be similarly protected.
conceivably,stoutt could argue that the report was not one of a possible violation,even though so termed and colorably disclosing a possible crime,if the bank knew that there was in reality no violation.but this is a reading of the statute,which speaks of any possible violation,and we think it more straightforward to confront any requirement of good faith or due care as an implied qualification of immunity rather than an issue of initial scope.here,whatever its internal beliefs,the bank did by any objective test identify a possible violation.
stoutt makes a somewhat different coverage argument in claiming that the regulations require that the bank must actually suspect that a violation of law has occurred.the short answer is that immunity depends on the regulations only where the immunity is sought for disclosures pursuant to the requirements imposed under subsection g or other authority in this case,the disclosure is independently protected by the earlier clause of the statute covering disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation.
in his second core argument,stoutt urges that at the very least the protection should be conditioned upon a finding of good faith on the part of the reporting entity.this is a colorable argument,accepted by the eleventh circuit but rejected by the second.compare lopez first union bank of,cir,with lee bankers trust,cir.we side with the second circuit,a position supported by an amicus brief of the board of governors of the federal reserve system.the statutory issue is one of continuing importance and should be cleanly resolved for this circuit.
although the statute does not in literal terms include a good faith requirement,the omission of such language is not conclusive.compare,dep t of hous.urban dev.rucker,d declining to read knowledge requirement into statutory silence with field mans,d importing justifiable reliance requirement into statutory silence.courts have often added to statutes unexpressed conditions or qualifications consonant with statutory purpose or other public concerns the most familiar example is the host of doctrines tolling limitations statutes for equitable and related reasons.see,david hall,lst cir collecting cases.
still,this merely poses the question whether such a qualification should be read into the statute.as with any question of statutory construction,there is a trinity of dominant,legislative history,and policy.see versyss,coopers lybrand,cir,cert.denied,d.here,two of the three language and history favor the conclusion that no good faith qualification should be read into the statute,while the balance of policy concerns is equivocal.
language,the starting and sometimes the stopping point in statutory construction,has already been mentioned.the absence of an express qualification is not decisive but counts for something.this is especially so here where a good faith requirement is so obvious a possibility for inclusion by the common law tradition discussed where it would have taken only a simple drafting adjustment.see,b a iv state child abuse prevention plan to include immunity for good faith reports.
turning to legislative history,it is certainly easy enough to imagine a purpose for this statute that would yet be consistent with requiring good faith.at common law one who reports suspected criminal conduct already has a privilege,but a privilege often taken to require both a reasonable basis for the report and good faith.see,murphree bank of utah,cir boyd nationwide mut.ins,cir sack,libel,slander related problems,at ed.absent other evidence congress could have meant only to remove the objective reasonableness requirement and to leave an implicit requirement of subjective good faith,even if unreasonably based.
but against this is the statement of the author of the provision there is no pertinent committee report language that it was intended to provide the broadest possible exemption from civil liability for the reporting of suspicious transactions.cong.rec.this language may also give greater weight than usual to the removal before final enactment of a good faith requirement that was at one time in the proposed immunity provision.compare cong.rec,amendment of senator,with cong.rec,bill as passed by the senate,and g.
turning finally to congress policy,the obvious arguments in this case for a good faith limitation are two that a good faith requirement would not wholly or perhaps even greatly discourage the reports intended by congress,united states rodgers,d,and that,without it,individuals like stoutt could be left without any civil redress against malicious or wholly unfounded accusations.the former argument has some force at least as to voluntary reports.the latter argument for a good faith qualification has obvious weight.
on the other hand,any qualification on immunity poses practical problems.a requirement of objective is typically required for qualified immunity in federal civil rights cases,harlow fitzgerald,d obviously creates a risk of second guessing but,so too does a requirement of subjective good faith.indeed,the latter might seem to give the reporting entity a further margin of protection by shielding honest if careless error but,cutting the other way,subjective good faith requirements work against summary judgment,exposing reporters to an increased risk of trial.id.at.
as to the risk of false charges,ordinarily the disclosures will as a practical matter be made to the authorities,who provide their own filter as to what investigations are pursued and made public.a subsequent technical and clarifying amendment in said that protected disclosures are those made to a government agency,pt,at.this leaves open the separate question not here presented of internal disclosures antecedent to reporting to the government.
finally,remedies other than private damage actions are available for wilfully false reports private sanctions such as employment termination,and government penalties such as fines and imprisonment,false statements an offense id.obstruction of examination of banks an offense.the statute says that the disclosing entity shall not be liable to any person an obvious reference to private civil remedies and not to government sanctions for bad faith reporting.see cong.rec.immunity from civil liability.the amendment confirmed that anyone immunized under the safe harbor provision is still subject to enforcement actions by governments.act,a adding g b see also,pt,at.
our construction of the statute makes it unnecessary to consider stoutt claims that the disclosures were unfounded,incomplete,careless and even malicious.nevertheless,despite extensive discovery allowed to stoutt,we see little basis in fact for any of these labels so far as the bank is concerned.about as close as stoutt gets to providing any factual support for his claim is his repeated assertion that he disclosed to guzmán the nature of his transaction with securities and was encouraged to draw on uncollected funds.
we will assume arguendo that all of this was so although guzmán denies being told of the insufficient funds in stoutt citibank account and will also assume debatably that anything said to guzmán should be attributed to the bank.nevertheless,drawing a check on an account where one knows one has no funds could be a criminal violation,regardless of what disclosures were made to individual bank officials,and the statute requires only a report of a possible violation.since objectively there was a possible violation,it is hard to think that the bank could be found to have acted in bad faith.stoutt has admitted that he knew there were insufficient funds and that he knew what he was doing was wrong.
stoutt final argument is that no statutory immunity could apply to his bivens view seemingly adopted by the district that the district court dismissal of the bivens claim on other grounds was itself error.see stoutt,d at.the district court initial concern is colorable the immunity provision protects against liability under any law or regulation of the united states and,by contrast,under any constitution,law,or regulation of any state or political subdivision thereof.nevertheless,there is a substantial basis for applying the immunity provision to bivens claims as well as ordinary torts.
congress surely has power to impose limitations on bivens actions.recently,
