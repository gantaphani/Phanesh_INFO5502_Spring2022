on april,cnb loaned to adams and adams executed and delivered to cnb a promissory note the note agreeing to repay the principal sum plus interest.the purpose of the loan was to enable adams to exercise options to purchase stock in digital communications.the loan was to be secured by the shares purchased with the loan proceeds the stock.
pursuant to his agreement with cnb,adams was required to maintain collateral equal to at least percent of the outstanding balance on his loan.the stock began to decline in value in early and soon became insufficient as collateral.adams advised cnb he could not repay the loan or pledge additional collateral and asked cnb to sell the stock to satisfy his obligation.
cnb told adams it appeared it could not sell the stock because it bore a restrictive legend.at adams suggestion,cnb retained davidson in june to provide a legal opinion that the restrictive legend could be removed and the stock sold.davidson provided the opinion letter on august.in june digital went out of business,and the stock became worthless.

the motion to disqualify davidson as adams counsel.
at the time he filed his answer and,adams was represented by daniel gunning.the trial court granted gunning motion to withdraw as adams counsel on february.cnb moved for summary judgment on march.adams retained davidson as his counsel on march.after its motion for summary judgment was denied,cnb filed a motion to disqualify davidson on the ground he had previously represented cnb in the same matter.
a.the craig declaration.
in support of its motion to disqualify,cnb submitted the declaration of david craig,the cnb vice president responsible for managing cnb relationship with adams.craig testified in his declaration as follows 
in april craig contacted adams and told him that the digital stock was insufficient to maintain the required balance of collateral to the outstanding loan.adams told craig he could not pay the loan or pledge additional collateral,but was going to sell his business and either pay off the loan or provide additional collateral out of the sale proceeds.
during his conversations with craig,adams asked if cnb could sell the digital stock it held as collateral.craig informed adams that cnb could not sell the stock until the restrictive legend was removed and that the legend could not be removed without an opinion letter from legal counsel.adams suggested craig contact davidson to obtain the opinion letter.because cnb did not have any attorneys who could write such an opinion letter,craig and cnb regional vice president bob patterson decided to retain davidson as counsel on behalf of cnb to write the necessary letter.
craig spoke to davidson on june,i advised him that cnb would like to engage his services to write an outside attorney opinion letter.the opinion letter was to address whether city national bank could now liquidate the shares of digital stock under the rule restrictions.previously,debra bernstein of southwest securities,the company that handled stock transactions on behalf of cnb informed me that the usdi stock could not be sold until the restrictive legend had been removed.i discussed with davidson cnb concerns that cnb borrower was asking cnb to liquidate the collateral,but that we could not liquidate the collateral because any sale would violate the rule restrictions.therefore,i was relying on davidson to issue the necessary opinion letter to enable cnb to sell the stock without violating any rules or regulations.davidson quoted me a fee of to prepare the opinion letter.
craig confirmed his conversation in a letter to adams,dated june,per our conversation today,city national bank would like to engage your services with respect to an outside attorney opinion.this opinion relates to city national banks sic ability to liquidate stock currently under rule restrictions.our borrower,glenn adams owns shares of digital communications stock usdi under this restriction used to secure a loan with the bank.the fee,as discussed today,shall be.if you could provide your opinion at your earliest convenience,it would be greatly appreciated.
craig believed he had hired davidson to act as cnb counsel in the matter by agreeing to pay davidson fee,i understood that davidson was now working for cnb to write the necessary opinion letter.i presumed that davidson was now working as cnb attorney and my communications with him were privileged.although i understood that davidson and adams had worked together in the past in connection with other companies,davidson never told me that he was in the past,or was currently adams s personal attorney.davidson never provided me a retainer agreement,conflict of interest waiver,or similar document advising me that davidson was working for adams during the period that i dealt with davidson,i always understood and assumed that i was hiring him to act as attorney for cnb and not adams.i understood that adams knew davidson,but that davidson was not his personal attorney.i always assumed that my communications with davidson were confidential pursuant to the privilege and that davidson would act on behalf of cnb to ensure that cnb did not violate any rules and regulations if it sold adams s collateral.
davidson did not provide the requested opinion letter until august.at that point the stock had already substantially declined in value and was not sufficient to pay off adams debt.by this time,adams was in the middle of selling his business and he hoped to provide other collateral to cnb that would enable him to retain his usdi stock.adams was hoping the usdi stock would recover some of its previous value.
b.the davidson declaration.
in opposition to the motion to disqualify,adams filed a declaration from davidson himself.davidson declaration discussed his background in securities law and described generally the effect of rule,promulgated by the securities and exchange commission,on the sale of securities that have not been registered under the securities act of.
davidson declared he was outside counsel for digital and that by he had represented adams in various matters for a couple of years.he had rendered forty to fifty opinions to stock transfer concerning the transferability of digital shares bearing restrictive legends,and this was a usual and customary engagement for a public company outside counsel.digital declined to pay for any further opinion letters in march,however,and referred its shareholders to me for opinions on its stock.
davidson maintained he drafted the opinion letter for the benefit of adams,not cnb.he stated he did not recall ever having spoken with craig or receiving a letter from him.he also stated during my conversation with the cnb representative concerning the opinion letter,i did not receive any confidential communications.i simply ascertained the same information that i need from any person who decided to sell restricted stock holding period,share certificate number,and representation as to manner of sale.there was no need for me to acquire confidential information,and i did not do so.all of the information i got from cnb is set forth in the opinion letter itself.i have never represented city national bank.
the trial court ruling.
at the hearing on the motion to disqualify,the trial court stated the court finds you davidson have been retained by city national bank before in this case in connection with the same matter that is involved in this litigation and that your representing the defendant in this case constitutes a conflict of interest and your continued representation would constitute a breach of confidentiality.the motion was granted on april.
adams filed a timely notice of appeal.

the rules governing disqualification of an attorney who is improperly proceeding against a former client.
it has long been established in civil cases that the court has the power,on motion of a party,to disqualify an opposing attorney from participating in a trial when,for example,the attorney improperly seeks to proceed against a former client.citations.people superior court greer cal d.the power to disqualify an attorney is simply one aspect of the trial court broad authority t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers code civ,subd.a speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d,comden superior court cal d,fn.
the prohibition against representation of a new client whose interests are adverse to those of a former client is grounded in both the california state bar rules of professional conduct and governing case law rule e provides a member shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.
more broadly,our supreme court has explained an attorney is forbidden to do either of two things after severing his relationship with a former client.he may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in any matter in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use against his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the previous relationship.wutchumna water bailey cal.the prohibition is in the disjunctive.an attorney may not use information or do anything which will injuriously affect his or her former client.people ex rel.deukmejian brown cal d.

the substantial relationship test.
application of the rule against representations adverse to a former client has focused on whether there is a substantial relationship between the former and current representation.the substantial relationship test was first articulated in theatre warner.pictures,t he former client need show no more than that the matters embraced within the pending suit wherein his former attorney appears on behalf of his adversary are substantially related to the matters or cause of action wherein the attorney previously represented him,the former client.the court will assume that during the course of the former representation confidences were disclosed to the attorney bearing on the subject matter of the representation.it will not inquire into their nature and extent.see also trone smith cir,the relevant test for disqualification is whether the former representation is substantially related to the current representation.citations.the interest to be preserved by preventing attorneys from accepting representation adverse to a former client is the protection and enhancement of the professional relationship in all its dimensions.it is necessary to preserve the value attached to the relationship both by the attorney and by the client.these objectives require a rule that prevents attorneys from accepting representation adverse to a former client if the later case bears a substantial connection to the earlier one.citation.substantiality is present if the factual contexts of the two representations are similar or related.
the substantial relationship test was adopted by california courts in a line of cases beginning with global van lines,superior court d.global van lines.in global van lines,the court held that w hen a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation,and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney or to subordinates for whose legal work he was responsible,the attorney knowledge of confidential information is presumed.citation.this is the rule by necessity,for it is not within the power of the former client to prove what is in the mind of the attorney.id.at.
