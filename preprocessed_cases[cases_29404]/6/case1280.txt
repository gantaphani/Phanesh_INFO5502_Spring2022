this case is before us on remand from the california supreme court.we are to decide whether a contractual provision should be respected in determining the enforceability of a class action waiver in the contract between plaintiff christopher boehr and defendant discover bank where plaintiff alleges no violations of california substantive law and sues on behalf of a putative nationwide class.we conclude that the parties choice of delaware law should be respected,and that under delaware law the class action waiver is enforceable.we therefore grant discover bank petition.
background 
the factual and procedural background is amply summarized in the opinion of the supreme court.in brief boehr,a california resident,obtained a credit card from discover bank in.discover bank is domiciled in delaware,and the cardholder agreement contained a clause providing for the application of delaware and federal law.in,discover bank amended the cardholder agreement by adding an arbitration clause that prohibited both parties to the agreement from participating in classwide arbitration,consolidating claims,or arbitrating claims as a representative or in a private attorney general capacity.discover bank superior court cal th,d.
in,boehr filed a putative nationwide class action against discover bank in the superior court,alleging claims for breach of contract and violation of the delaware consumer fraud act.he alleged that discover bank had breached the cardholder agreement by imposing late fees and finance charges on payments that were received on the payment due date but after discover bank undisclosed deadline.boehr conceded in his complaint that,because of the provision,delaware law would govern his substantive claims,but he alleged that other issues related to the contract would be governed by california or other applicable law.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
discover bank moved to compel arbitration on an individual basis.the trial court ultimately determined that the class action waiver was unenforceable under california law and that enforcement of the class action waiver under delaware law would contravene a fundamental public policy of california law.the trial court severed the class action waiver from the agreement and ordered boehr to arbitrate his claim,leaving open the possibility that boehr could certify an arbitration class.discover bank then sought and obtained writ relief from us on the grounds that the federal arbitration act faa preempts california law to the extent that california law renders class action waivers unenforceable.we thus held that the class action waiver provision was enforceable under the faa and therefore never considered the issue now before us.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court granted boehr petition for review.the court held that under certain circumstances california law does prohibit enforcement of class action waivers without being preempted by the faa.the supreme court acknowledged,however,that we had not decided whether the enforceability of the waiver should be governed by delaware law rather than california law,pursuant to the provision in the cardholder agreement.the case was remanded to us to resolve that issue and,if necessary,to determine whether the class action waiver would be enforceable under delaware law.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
discussion 
governing law 
under california law,the enforcement of contractual provisions,including those in consumer adhesion contracts,is governed by section,subdivision of the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d.t he proper approach under restatement section,subdivision is for the court first to determine either whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.if neither of these tests is met,that is the end of the inquiry,and the court need not enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,either test is met,the court must next determine whether the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy of california.if there is no such conflict,the court shall enforce the parties choice of law.if,however,there is a fundamental conflict with california law,the court must then determine whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue,subd.if california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state,the choice of law shall not be enforced,for the obvious reason that in such circumstance we will decline to enforce a law contrary to this state fundamental policy.nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d,fns.omitted.
substantial relationship or other reasonable basis 
discover bank is domiciled in delaware.by statute,delaware requires that a revolving credit plan between a bank and an individual borrower shall be governed by the laws of delaware,tit.for these reasons,we see no grounds for denying either that delaware has a substantial relationship to the parties or that there is another reasonable basis for the contractual choice of delaware law,and boehr does not dispute either proposition.accordingly,we will apply delaware law to determine the enforceability of the class action waiver unless to do so would contravene a fundamental policy of california and california has a materially greater interest than delaware in determining the issue.
enforceability of class action waivers under delaware law 
discover bank argues that class action waivers are enforceable and not unconscionable under delaware law.discover bank cites a number of cases in support of its argument,but only one of them,edelist mbna am.bank,is a published decision of a delaware state court holding that a class action waiver is enforceable and not unconscionable.that case is a published decision of the superior court of delaware,but discover bank argues that the delaware court system does not have intermediate appellate courts,so the decisions of delaware trial courts are important sources of delaware law which are regularly followed.continental ins.pipher.
in opposition,boehr does not cite any delaware state court decisions that have held class action waivers unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable.instead,he discusses the delaware case law concerning unconscionability in general,and he argues on the basis of those cases that class action waivers are unconscionable under delaware law.boehr also urges us not to follow edelist mbna am.bank,supra,because it offers no explanation for its holding and is purely conclusory.
although boehr does present a colorable argument that class action waivers are unconscionable under delaware law,we can not presume to have a more developed understanding of delaware law than that of the superior court of delaware.it should be noted in this regard that the superior court of delaware is not merely a trial court.rather,it also hears appeals from every other delaware court except the court of chancery and the supreme court.for a useful overview of the structure of the delaware court system,see as of.edelist mbna am.bank,supra,though not itself an appellate decision,is the best authority of which we are aware concerning the enforceability of class action waivers under delaware law.we can not ignore it.moreover,the next strongest authority that we have located on the issue is the unpublished decision of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit in lloyd mbna am.bank,cir,which likewise affirmed the enforcement of a class action waiver under delaware law 
for these reasons,we conclude that the class action waiver in boehr cardholder agreement is enforceable,and not unconscionable,under delaware law.
fundamental policy and materially greater interest 
the parties vigorously dispute whether enforcement of the class action waiver in this case would be contrary to a fundamental policy of california.on the one hand,discover bank argues that the supreme court did not hold in this case that all class action waivers are unconscionable under california law,neither th
