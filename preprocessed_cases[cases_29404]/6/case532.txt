in filing a series of individual tax returns in the,william maloof claimed significant deductions for losses incurred by s corporations that he owned.under d,maloof deductions from these losses could not exceed his basis in the stock or debt of the corporations.recognizing that the losses greatly exceeded his initial investment in the corporations,maloof claimed that a million bank loan to the corporations in,on which maloof was a and guarantor,permissibly increased his basis in debt of the s corporation to the shareholder or possibly stock owned by the shareholder.see id.the relevant statutes and case law,however,permit an increase of the s corporation in basis in debt or stock only when the taxpayer makes an economic outlay to the corporation,and maloof status as a on the loan established just the possibility,not the reality,of an economic outlay for the corporation.we therefore affirm the decision of the tax court upholding over million in tax deficiencies issued by the internal revenue service against maloof.
maloof owns several s corporations,including level propane,park place management,park place,and neptune propane.when level propane experienced capital problems in,the s corporations together borrowed million from provident bank.under the loan documents,the s corporations are collectively referred to as the borrower,and the bank received a security interest in the equipment of the s corporations that the loan proceeds purchased,their inventory and accounts receivable as well as in some of level propane other assets.maloof agreed to be a on the loan and guaranteed the loan by granting the bank a security interest in a million life insurance policy on his life and in all of his stock in the s corporations.the loan makes him jointly and severally liable for the debt.
the s corporations made monthly interest payments on the loan through an account maintained with provident bank.in early,the corporations failed to keep up with the monthly payments,defaulted on the loan and entered involuntary bankruptcy.at no point did the bank sue maloof as a,take possession of his security interest or for that matter ever receive a payment from maloof for the loan.
relying on the losses incurred by his companies before the bankruptcy and on the taxation rules that apply to s corporations,maloof claimed significant deductions on his personal tax returns during the.in an effort to take advantage of the tax benefits from these losses,maloof claimed an increased basis in the debt or possibly stock of the s corporations based on the million loan from provident bank.in and,however,the irs issued notices of deficiency to maloof for over million for taking impermissible deductions on his individual tax returns for various tax years between and,contending that maloof could not premise an increase in basis on the provident bank loan.
the tax court upheld the irs deficiency ruling.citing court of appeals precedent and precedent of its own,the tax court concluded that a taxpayer must make an economic outlay for a loan to create basis,tax.op.at,and that s hareholder guaranties of loans to an s corporation do not constitute an economic outlay,id.at.the court also concluded that pledging personal assets or stock does not by itself increase the basis in debt or stock and refused to look at what maloof maintained was the substance of the loan transaction a loan to him from the bank as opposed to its form a loan to the s corporations from the bank.id.at.
two features of the tax laws governing s corporations set the stage for resolving this appeal.first,unlike a traditional c corporation,s corporations themselves generally do not pay taxes.see gitlitz comm r,d the very purpose of subchapter s is to tax at the shareholder level,not the corporate level.income is determined at the s corporation level not in order to tax the corporation but solely to pass through to the s corporation shareholders the corporation income.each shareholder of an s corporation thus pays taxes at individual rates on the pro rata share of the corporation income if there is any and receives the pro rata tax benefits,losses,deductions and credits of the corporation.see a.consistent with this system of taxation,the s corporation income and losses become the individual shareholder income and losses.see bufferd comm r,d the statute accomplishes these goals by means of a system under which corporate income,losses,deductions,and credits are attributed to individual shareholders in a manner akin to the tax treatment of partnerships.
second,the internal revenue code places a limitation on the loss deductions that an individual may take on his tax return.the deductions c annot exceed the shareholder basis in stock and debt.d.
the question,then,is whether maloof properly increased his basis in stock or debt when he became a and guarantor of the provident bank loan.if he did,if his basis in the corporations stock or debt increased by million after the july loan,then that would defeat some,though apparently not all,of the deficiencies charged by the irs.see tax.op.at.if he did not,then the tax court properly upheld the irs deficiencies.
the statutory language.the relevant statutory language undermines maloof argument.it provides 
d special rules for losses and deductions.
can not exceed shareholder basis in stock and debt.the aggregate amount of losses and deductions taken into account by a shareholder under subsection a for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of 
a the adjusted basis of the shareholder stock in the s corporation determined with regard to paragraphs and a of section a for the taxable year,and 
b the shareholder adjusted basis of any indebtedness of the s corporation to the shareholder determined without regard to any adjustment under paragraph of section b for the taxable year.
d emphasis added.
in accordance with this limitation,a taxpayer may use s corporation losses and deductions in completing his individual tax return so long as they do not exceed the sum of the adjusted basis of the shareholder stock in the s corporation and the shareholder adjusted basis of any indebtedness of the s corporation to the shareholder.the former method for adjusting a shareholder basis in stock turns on the corporation performance in a given year as well as on whether the shareholder has made any capital contributions to the corporation.see william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations west a shareholder basis in the stock of an s corporation is subject to adjustment from year to year generally,the adjusted basis of s corporation stock is increased by income passed through to the shareholder and is decreased by losses and deductions passed through to the shareholder.the adjusted basis in s corporation stock can not decrease below zero as a result of these adjustments.id.the basis of an s corporation shareholder in the stock of the corporation may also be increased by capital contributions made to the corporation.explaining that capital contributions to an s corporation represent an additional price paid for the shares of stock held by the individual shareholders.the latter method turns on whether the shareholder has lent money to the s corporation.
it is far from clear which provision maloof invokes in claiming a right to pass losses of the s corporation through to his individual tax returns.neither his appellate papers nor the decision below clarifies that he is pursuing one route to the exclusion of the other.that he relies on a guarantee with respect to the provident bank debt would suggest that he seeks to establish basis in debt.and with respect to the possibility that he means to argue that he increased his basis in his stock,he never says that the guarantee of the provident bank loan amounted to a capital contribution.one,of course,must be a shareholder to have any rights at all in this area,so a stray reference in his papers to increasing his basis in explaining that the loan guarantee amounted to a capital shows that he has picked this route of basis aggregation over the other.under these circumstances,while it appears that maloof means to argue that the loan
