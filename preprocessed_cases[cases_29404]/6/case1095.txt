background 
a.the parties and disputed transactions 
transohio is a subsidiary of tfc.in the,transohio was the largest savings and loan institution in ohio primarily concerned with taking in deposits from customers and lending in the local area.in,acc acquired a majority interest in tfc and adopted a very aggressive growth strategy.
in,the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic,an agency of the united states,was searching for a firm to acquire two failing institutions,citizens federal savings and loan association of cleveland citizens and dollar savings bank of columbus dollar.tfc offered and won a bid to cause transohio to merge with citizens and dollar.in august of,acc,tfc,and transohio entered into an assistance agreement with fslic,whereby fslic made an immediate cash contribution of million to transohio,agreed to purchase certain troubled assets of citizen and dollar for million,and agreed to indemnify acc,tfc,and transohio for expenses they might incur.along with its assistance,fslic further agreed that million in supervisory goodwill arising from the transaction would count as regulatory capital subject only to a amortization schedule without the regulatory capital promised,transohio would have been out of capital compliance and subject to immediate seizure as a result of its acquisition of the two insolvent thrifts.for their part,acc and tfc agreed to maintain transohio net worth at specified levels for five years,to not cause transohio to declare a dividend of more than percent of its net income without regulatory approval,and to observe certain restrictions regarding composition of transohio board of directors and loans to officers and directors.
transohio initially recorded approximately million of goodwill arising from the mergers under generally accepted accounting principles and an additional million for goodwill related to the fslic assistance.four months after the merger,tfc infused approximately million into transohio.
firrea and the government breach 
in august of,the government enacted firrea,which restricted transohio ability to count supervisory goodwill and capital credit toward compliance with its tangible capital requirement.as the supreme court noted in united states winstar,d,t he impact of firrea new capital requirements upon institutions that had acquired failed thrifts in exchange for supervisory goodwill was swift and severe.many institutions fell out of compliance and were either seized by government regulators or stayed in business only after massive private recapitalization.id.at.in this case,firrea deprived transohio of of its regulatory million.due to the change,transohio had to shrink its asset base in order to improve regulatory capital ratios,and sell many of its more lucrative assets.
firrea enactment caused a snowball effect that eventually resulted in the fdic seizure of transohio.the divestiture of assets together with the adverse publicity caused by the loss of capital led to higher cost of funds that added to tranohio burden.furthermore,transohio remaining assets suffered from credit losses,due to the shrinkage in.next,regulators imposed more stringent requirements on transohio due to its weakened state,forcing even more losses.in,the government compounded the effects by imposing individual minimum capital requirements imcr requiring transohio to increase tangible capital in less than days and did not allow transohio to use supervisory goodwill or capital credit toward that compliance.in july of,transohio was placed into receivership.
c.the cfc determination 
the cfc found the united states liable for million in damages to tfc due to the breach.the court held as a matter of law that the government was liable for breach of contract and that tfc incurred a loss of reliance interests as a direct result of the government breach in the amount of million.american capital iv.at.the court,however,held an evidentiary hearing to afford the government an opportunity to establish with reasonable certainty the losses that would have been incurred irrespective of the breach.id.
after hearing the evidence the court decided to reduce the award to million because tfc would have incurred losses irrespective of the breach.according to the cfc,approximately million in losses would have been sustained from until because of losses due to an aborted attempt to acquire amerifirst bank losses associated with a mortgage business valuation adjustments on corporate bonds and misconduct of transohio officers who managed a real estate portfolio.id.at.moreover,the cfc found that transohio value should be offset by the million in dividends transohio paid to tfc.id.at.in sum,the cfc reduced the damages award by approximately million.
the united states filed a timely appeal in this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

tfc recovery of transohio value 
first,the united states contends that the cfc improperly held that tfc was entitled to recover the equity value of transohio.the cfc held that even though the assistance agreement never mentioned an equity contribution by tfc,the agreement was subject to conditions previously discussed,namely the merger of transohio with dollar and citizen.american capital ii.at.the court found that tfc put on the table transohio ongoing business with equity valued at million,which was the contract price for the benefits in the assistance agreement.id.at.the government presents a argument that the assistance agreement never requires transohio equity to be contributed and that transohio,even though wholly owned,was a separate corporate entity that owned its own equity tfc was merely a shareholder.we agree with the government arguments and therefore reverse the cfc decision.
first,the assistance agreement does not require tfc to contribute its shares of transohio to the merger.we must give clear and unambiguous terms of a contract their plain and ordinary meaning.see landmark,at.we can not rewrite a contract or insert words to which a party has never agreed.see coast fed.bank united states,en banc.though tfc and acc signed the assistance agreement,at most that agreement makes it a condition of fslic assistance that the transohio merger was duly authorized by tfc,as the sole shareholder of transohio.emphasis added.acc and tfc other obligations through the assistance agreement and other written commitments only amount to agreements to maintain the capital of transohio or restrict the officers and directors of transohio.there are no provisions requiring tfc to contribute its stock.thus,the award of transohio equity value to tfc was improper under the terms of the contract itself.
second,the cfc holding runs afoul of the corporate form.we have regularly acknowledged the legal distinction between a corporation and its shareholders and rejected claims by shareholders to assert a breach of contract claim on behalf of the corporation.cal.fed.sav.loan ass united states,citing first hartford.pension plan trust united states,holding that a shareholder lacks privity of contract to sue the government for winstar damages when only the corporation entered into an agreement with the fdic fdic united states,karnes same cain united states,stating that the holding that there was no contract between the government and the shareholders of a thrift was consistent with this court prior cases addressing the issue castle united states,dismissing shareholders claims on the grounds that they had not established that the government had entered into a contract with them as individuals independent of their status as shareholders.as the supreme court has explained,
a basic tenet of american corporate law is that the corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities.see,first nat.city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d separate legal personality has been described as an almost indispensable aspect of the public corporation burnet clark.a corporation and its stockholders are generally to be treated as separate entities.an individual shareholder,by virtue of his ownership of shares,does not own the corporation assets and,as a result,does not own subsidiary corporations in which the corporation holds an interest.see fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations ed.a corporate parent which owns the shares of a subsidiary does not,for that reason alone,own or have legal title to the assets of the subsidiary and,it follows with even greater force,the parent does not own or have legal title to the subsidiaries of the subsidiary.
dole food patrickson,d.a shareholder participation in contract negotiations or funding of a particular transaction does not alter its intentional adoption of the corporate form to limit its own liability,at.to allow a shareholder to recover the same breach of contract damages both individually and through the corporation would result in an impermissible double recovery.id.at.
in certain circumstances we have allowed a shareholder to recover under a breach of contract theory,see,hansen bancorp,united states,however,recovery is only permitted when the shareholder has a direct,personal interest in a cause of action,franchise tax bd.of cal.alcan aluminium,d.in hansen,the hansens,private individuals,agreed to merge their healthy bank,raritan,with a failing thrift,hammonton,into a new intermediate company,hansen bancorp,in which they would own all the shares.at.under the agreement,the hansens were required to commit both cash and stock to the merger.id.at.because the contract required the hansens to personally contribute their stock in return for the new corporation in reliance on the government promise,we held that the hansens irrevocably contributed their raritan assets to a risky venture based solely on the government guarantees under the agreement,and were entitled to restitution of the investment.id.at.we further noted that in that situation the hansen contribution of stock to the venture was the equivalent of a cash contribution,and therefore,they could recover said contribution.id.
here,as in,tfc does not have such a direct interest.though transohio is a subsidiary of tfc and tfc made certain promises to maintain transohio capital,tfc rights to claim transohio equity losses resulting from the government breach were purely as a shareholder of transohio.this conclusion is supported by the assistance agreement itself,which conditions the agreement on tfc authorization of the merger as the sole shareholder.unlike hansen,tfc did not contribute the shares of transohio in reliance on the government promises.instead,transohio,as its own separate entity,chose to merge with citizens and dollar.
tfc can not randomly disregard the corporate form to its own benefit.transohio injuries that resulted in its losses and ultimate downfall are properly its own,and therefore its potential breach of contract claims against the government for those injuries must be brought in its name accordingly,we reverse the cfc holding that acc and tfc could recover the million book value equity of transohio.
c.the million capital infusion 
next,the united states maintains that tfc did not rely on the government promises before infusing million into transohio.the government argues that it created a genuine issue of material fact that tfc capital infusion was contemplated before the merger took place and therefore could not have been made in reliance on the government promises.tfc maintains that even if there is evidence before the merger suggesting that it planned to infuse capital into transohio,it would never have infused the cash in a transohio if it were not for the fact that the government promised favorable accounting and regulatory benefits that allowed transohio to remain solvent after it merged with citizen and dollar.thus,tfc contends that in relying on the government promise it invested money to support the resulting company and lost those funds as a result of the government breach.here,we agree with the cfc and affirm the court award of million in reliance damages for the capital infusion.
reliance damages are used to put the party in as good a position as it would have been in had the contract not been made.westfed holdings,united states,citing restatement second of contracts b restatement.more specifically,the injured party has a right to damages,including expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance,less any loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed.restatement accord westfed,at.
in order to recover reliance damages,the plaintiff loss must have been foreseeable to the party in breach at the time of contract formation.landmark,at.a loss may be foreseeable and therefore recoverable as a probable result of a breach because it follows from the breach a in the ordinary course of events,or b as a result of special circumstances,beyond the ordinary course of events,that the party in breach had reason to know.id.citing restatement.see also arthur corbin,corbin on contracts ed noting that net losses from collateral transactions may be included in the damages awarded,if at the time the contract was made the breaching party had reason to foresee that such expenditures would be made and that the breach would prevent their reimbursement.
here,the million was a collateral transaction that even though not explicitly contemplated by the agreement was at least foreseeable by the government.at the time of contracting,there was evidence that acc and tfc planned to infuse approximately million in capital into transohio.tfc presented evidence that it would never have made the infusion into a transohio without relying on the government promise.specifically,tfc presented the affidavit of its ceo and a government regulator indicating that tfc would not have moved forward with the infusion without some sort of reliance on the government promise.
