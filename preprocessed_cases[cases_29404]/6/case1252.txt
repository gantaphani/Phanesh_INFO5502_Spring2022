discussion 
iintroduction 
poseidon contends the trial court erred in sustaining demurrers to the first amended complaint,because that pleading alleges all the elements necessary for a breach of contract claim.poseidon argues the court was required to accept the allegations of the complaint as true and those allegations establish the parties intent that the late charge provision apply to the final payment on the note.poseidon further argues that,even if it is not entitled to the late charge,it can recover actual damages caused by woodland breach.finally,poseidon argues it is entitled to recover expenses incurred in initiating foreclosure.
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.blank kirwan cal d.the complaint must be liberally construed and given a reasonable interpretation,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.amarel connell d.we treat as true not only the complaint material factual allegations,but also facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.id.at.
a cause of action for nonpayment on a promissory note is one for breach of contract.fpi development,nakashima d.poseidon contends a cause of action for breach of contract requires four elements a contract,plaintiff performance,defendant breach,and damages.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.it is undisputed the first amended complaint adequately alleges the first three elements.this dispute centers on the fourth.
late charge 
the note contains the following late charge provision the maker acknowledges that late payment to payee will cause payee to incur costs not contemplated by this loan,the exact amount of such costs being difficult and impractical to assess.such costs include,without limitation,processing and accounting charges.therefore,if any installment is not received by payee when due,maker shall pay to payee an additional sum of of the overdue amount as a late charge.the parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that payee will incur by reason of late payment.acceptance of any late charge shall not constitute a waiver of the default with respect to the overdue amount,and shall not prevent payee from exercising any of the other rights and remedies available to payee,whether voluntary or involuntary.italics added.
poseidon contends the foregoing provision applies to the final balloon payment on the note,because it refers to any installment and a final payment is as much an installment as any other payment.the trial court disagreed,concluding the final payment is not an installment as that term is used in the note.we agree with the trial court.
when a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language,the first question to be decided is whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party.if it is not,the case is over.citation.if the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the court moves on to the second question what did the parties intend the language to mean southern cal.edison superior court th,d.the overriding goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting,ticor title ins.employers ins.of wausau th,d.
where contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results,we normally determine intent from the written terms alone.those terms are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage.
in kenney los feliz investment,the court stated the word installment is one of common use and has a meaning.century dictionary defines installment as partial payments on account of a debt due.standard dictionary gives this definition a partial payment of a price or debt due.bouvier law dictionary gives this definition a part of a debt due by contract and agreed to be paid at a time different from that fixed for the payment of the other part.id.at.under these definitions,a payment need only be part of the whole in order to be an installment.it need not be equal to the other payments.accord,powell central cal.fed.sav.loan d.t he term installment loan was defined in code of federal regulations section.as follows the term installment loan means any loan repayable in regular periodic payments,equal or unequal,sufficient to retire the debt,interest and principal.in mills herrod d,the court defined an installment as one of several successive payments in settlement of a debt.no mention was made in that case of the relative values of each payment or whether it was the first,middle or last payment in the sequence.
even a final balloon payment may be considered an installment.see wyatt union mortg.cal d,b alloon payment is the amount necessary to amortize principal and interest unpaid at maturity when the prescribed monthly installments have been insufficient to do so.code of federal regulations,title,part,which concerns the rates and terms of operating loans from the federal department of agriculture,states that installment payments may include equal,unequal,or balloon installments.b.
however,the fact that a final,balloon payment may be considered an installment within the common meaning of the term does not mean the parties so intended here.as noted above,we use the ordinary meaning of words unless the parties intended something else.specific provisions of a contract should not be considered in isolation.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.
in the present matter,the note provides that payments shall be made in monthly installments of commencing june.however,a final payment of principal and interest shall be due on march,or days after a tentative subdivision map is approved.
elsewhere,the note uses the word payment to encompass both the installments and the final payment.for example,the note provides that each payment shall be credited first to interest due and then to principal and that whenever any payment is due on a saturday,sunday or holiday,it shall be made on the following business day.if any payment is late,the note provides for an increased interest rate from the date payment was due until paid.these provisions easily apply to both the installments and the final payment.
by contrast,the note provides that i f default occurs in the payment of any installment under this note when due,the entire principal sum and accrued interest shall at once become due and payable this provision makes no sense when applied to the final payment,for which all principal and interest are already due and payable.
poseidon argues the first amended complaint alleges the parties intended that the late charge provision apply to the final payment.poseidon further argues the complaint alleges woodland acknowledged this intent in a letter from woodland counsel indicating at least one of the principals of woodland was willing to pay the late charge.
the allegation of the parties intent is a conclusion of fact,which need not be accepted for purposes of demurrer.see blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.furthermore,that allegation is belied by the plain language of the note,as we have described.as for the purported acknowledgment,there are many reasons why a party might be willing to pay a sum to an opponent other than an admission of liability.poseidon attempts to read too much into this correspondence.
in addition to the language of the note,the trial court interpretation saves the late charge provision from being an unlawful penalty.to avoid uncertainty and the cost of litigation if a breach occurs,the parties to a contract may include a liquidated damages clause to preset the measure of damages.allen smith th,d.a provision in a contract liquidating the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made,subd.b.such a provision will be considered unreasonable if the amount specified bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages the parties could have contemplated at the time of contracting.ridgley topa thrift loan cal th,d.in the absence of such relationship,a contractual clause purporting to predetermine damages must be construed as a penalty.ibid.a contractual provision imposing a penalty is ineffective,and the wronged party can collect only the actual damages sustained.ibid.
at the time of contracting,it is reasonable to assume the parties contemplated a late payment would result in poseidon loss of use of the amount due.however,the note contains another provision granting poseidon an enhanced interest rate in the event a payment is not made on time.this would more than compensate poseidon for the loss of use of the money due.
the late charge provision was never intended to compensate poseidon for loss of use of the money due.it provided that,in the event an installment becomes overdue,a late charge might be imposed to cover such costs as processing and accounting charges.hence,the purpose of the late charge provision was to compensate poseidon for administrative expenses.
there is no reason to believe that processing and accounting expenses caused by failure to make an installment payment would vary appreciably depending on the amount of the overdue payment.nevertheless,while overdue payment of an installment of would have resulted in a late charge of,overdue payment of a final payment of would result in a late charge of.if the late charge provision was intended to apply to both interim installments and the final payment,it could not possibly be considered a reasonable estimate of the damages contemplated by a breach.rather,it would be an unenforceable penalty provision.
a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.the only interpretation of the late charge provision that would make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried out is one that would make it inapplicable to the final payment.such interpretation is also consistent with the language of the note read as a whole.
poseidon contends validity of the late charge provision as applied to the final payment can not be determined on demurrer,because that issue depends upon evidence of the customary range of late fees in similar promissory notes.however,we can state as a matter of law a late charge provision covering administrative expenses that amounts to for one late payment and for another is not a reasonable attempt to estimate actual administrative costs incurred,whether or not it is customary in the industry.we therefore conclude poseidon is not entitled to a late charge as an element of damages.
collection expenses 
in its order sustaining demurrers,the trial court took judicial notice of various recorded documents related to the deed of trust securing the note.in particular,the court took judicial notice of the deed of trust,recorded april,an assignment of the note and deed of trust from poseidon to spartan mortgage services,spartan,recorded june,the first assignment an assignment of the note and deed of trust from spartan to thomas shanley,trustee of the shanley living trust shanley,recorded july,the second assignment a substitution of trustee by shanley,replacing chicago title company with red shield servicing,red shield,recorded july,the first substitution a substitution of trustee by poseidon,replacing chicago title company with damon mamalis,recorded february,the second substitution and a notice of default and election to sell under deed of trust signed by damon mamalis,recorded february,the notice of default.
the trial court concluded poseidon is not entitled to recover fees incurred for foreclosure as it had assigned the deed of trust and had no right to initiate forec
