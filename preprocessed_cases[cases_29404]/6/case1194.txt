overview of california law of priorities 
california starts with a first in time,first in right system of lien priorities,under which a conveyance recorded first generally has priority over any conveyance.thaler household finance th,other things being equal,different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation.
an instrument is deemed to be recorded when,being duly acknowledged or proved and certified,it is deposited in the recorder office,with the proper officer,for record.
this first in time,first in right system is modified by the recording statutes miller starr,cal.real estate ed,which allow subsequent purchasers to achieve priority under the theory.id.at.thereunder,every grant of an estate in real property is conclusive against the grantor,also against every one subsequently claiming under him,except a purchaser or incumbrancer who in good faith and for a valuable consideration acquires a title or lien by an instrument that is first duly recorded.stating the rule differently,civil code section reads in relevant part,every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee of the same property in good faith and for a valuable consideration,whose conveyance is first duly recorded 
under these rules,a subsequent purchaser obtains priority for a real property interest by acquiring the interest as a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration with neither actual knowledge nor constructive notice of a interest and first duly record ing the interest,recording before the interest is recorded,miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,hochstein romero d,bona fide purchaser who acquires interest in real property without notice of another rights in the property,takes property free of such unknown rights.
the elements of bona fide purchase are payment of value,in good faith,and without actual or constructive notice of another rights.citation.citation.gates rubber ulman d,italics omitted.the absence of notice is an essential requirement in order that one may be regarded as a bona fide purchaser.citation.ibid.
constructive notice is a legal fiction.lewis superior court th.for constructive notice to be conclusively presumed,the instrument or document must be recorded as prescribed by law,hochstein romero,supra,d at accord,lewis superior court,supra,at.the phrase recorded as prescribed by law means the instrument must be indexed.hochstein romero,supra,at see cady purser cal.a document not indexed as required by statute see,does not impart constructive notice because it has not been recorded as prescribed by law.citation.lewis superior court,supra,at,italics added.for more than a century it has been the law in california that a party does not have constructive notice of a recorded instrument until that document has been properly indexed so it can be located through a search of the public records.dyer martinez th,watkins wilhoit cal.
stated otherwise,constructive notice of an interest in real property is imparted by the recording and proper indexing of an instrument in the public records,dyer martinez,supra,th at watkins wilhoit,supra,cal.at cady purser,supra,cal.at hochstein romero,supra,d at first fidelity thrift loan alliance bank th.the recording of a document does not impart constructive notice t he operative event for purposes of constructive notice is actually the indexing of the document.lewis superior court,supra,th at.
plaintiff and defendant trust deeds are deemed recorded at the same time and neither bank is a subsequent purchaser.
applying these rules to the facts here,the undisputed evidence shows that plaintiff and defendant trust deeds were both deposited before business hours on september,and hence received the following stamp with the same date and time september,at am.pursuant to civil code section,both trust deeds are deemed recorded simultaneously.
defendant argues that plaintiff failed to carry its burden in moving for summary judgment because plaintiff lacked evidence about when the trust deeds were deposited in the recorder office.in its separate statement,plaintiff asserted as fact that the banks trust deeds were all delivered to the recorder office by title insurance company representatives at approximately on september.plaintiff supported fact with excerpts from tregg deposition.defendant argues that,where the trial court sustained its objection to tregg testimony in support of fact,there is no evidence about when the documents were actually deposited.
