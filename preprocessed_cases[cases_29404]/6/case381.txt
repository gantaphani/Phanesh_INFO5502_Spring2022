appellants,elena david,arleen stach,and victor hernandez,are the named representatives of a putative class of participants in two retirement plans sponsored by the bank of america corporation boa or the bank.they brought this civil enforcement action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,alleging that appellees,the bank and individual members of the bank corporate benefits committee,engaged in prohibited transactions and breached their fiduciary duties by selecting and maintaining mutual funds in the investment menu for the bank k plan and the bank separate but related pension plan collectively the plans.the district court dismissed all claims related to the pension plan for lack of article iii standing.thereafter,upon the completion of extensive discovery,the court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on all remaining counts as.declining to permit the filing of a fourth amended complaint,the district court ultimately dismissed the action with prejudice.this timely appeal followed.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm 
the plans are two retirement plans sponsored by boa the k plan and the pension plan.appellants are participants in the plans.appellees include the bank,which acts as sponsor of the plans,and the individual members of the bank corporate benefits committee cbc,who act as fiduciaries of the plans.the cbc has authority to make decisions with respect to adding,monitoring,removing,or replacing investment options in the plans.
the pension plan is a defined benefit plan and the k plan is a defined contribution plan.a participant benefits under the pension plan are based on a combination of compensation credits a percentage of the participant compensation that increases with age and length of service and investment credits the hypothetical investment return that would be realized if the participant compensation credits were invested in certain investment measures.appellees br.at.upon retirement,a participant is entitled at minimum to the full value of her compensation credits,regardless of the performance of the investment measures that the participant selects.boa,as plan sponsor,is responsible for making up any shortfall between the returns on the plan investments and the amount necessary to fund benefits owed to participants.any surplus beyond the amount needed to pay benefits reverts to the plan.the parties agree that the pension plan was overfunded,the plan assets were more than sufficient to pay out all vested benefits when appellants filed this action.
in contrast,participants in the k plan contribute a portion of their earnings to the plan,and those contributions are matched in part by the bank affiliates.individual plan participants choose how the plan assets are invested,but the cbc has authority to change the number of available investment options and to add or remove specific options from the investment lineup.
appellants filed this action in the northern district of california on august,and amended their complaint to include class allegations several months later.the case was transferred to the western district of north carolina in early.appellants filed their second amended complaint sac by consent on july.appellants alleged in the sac that appellees breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions in violation of erisa by selecting and retaining mutual funds as part of the investment mix for the plans.they alleged that many better options were available,and that most of the affiliated mutual funds offered participants poor performance and high fees.appellants alleged that these violations caused multimillion dollar losses to the plans.
appellees filed a motion to dismiss in part,which sought dismissal of the pension plan claims in the sac on the basis that appellants lacked article iii standing.appellees also sought dismissal of the cbc on the basis that the committee is not a person subject to liability under erisa,but they did not contest the allegation that the individual members of the cbc were properly before the court.the motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that it be granted.the magistrate judge also recommended that appellees motion to dismiss all claims against the cbc be granted because,as a matter of law,committees are not properly subject to erisa breach of fiduciary duty claims.the district court,adopting the findings in the magistrate judge memorandum and recommendation m r,concluded that appellants lacked constitutional standing to pursue the pension plan claims because they failed to plead any cognizable likely to be redressed by a favorable outcome in this litigation.the district court also adopted the m r with respect to appellees motion to dismiss all claims against the cbc,noting that appellants did not object to the magistrate judge finding.after the district court dismissed appellants claims related to the pension plan,appellees answered the sac.
on may,appellees moved for summary judgment on appellants k plan claims,asserting that those claims were.soon after the completion of briefing on the appellees motion for summary judgment,appellants moved for leave to file an amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure,arguing that such amendment would allege facts and legal theories sufficient to overcome appellees statute of limitation argument.david alphin,d,internal citation omitted.the district court granted appellants motion to amend and denied appellees motion for summary judgment.appellants then filed their third amended complaint tac.
in the tac,appellants asserted numerous claims on behalf of the k plan on the part of two classes the removal class consisting of k plan participants who invested in certain mutual funds between august,and december,and the selection class consisting of k plan participants who invested in certain mutual funds between july,and december.of the claims at issue on appeal,appellants brought counts i through iii on behalf of the removal class only they brought count iv on behalf of the selection class only 
specifically,appellants alleged in count ii that the members of the cbc breached their fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty by failing to remove the mutual funds from the investment lineup.that is,they contend that appellees effectively applied higher standards for removal of the bank proprietary funds than for removal of nonproprietary funds,and that the removal class period funds performed poorly and had significantly higher fees than other viable options.appellants alleged in counts i and iii that appellees violated erisa by causing the k plan to engage in prohibited transactions they assert that the discrete investment transactions that occurred as a result of appellees failure to remove the funds constituted transactions between the k plan and the investment manager,which was a subsidiary of the bank and accordingly a.finally,appellants alleged in count iv that the members of the cbc breached their duties of prudence and loyalty when they selected the funds for inclusion in the k plan investment lineup.
appellees answered the tac and filed their second motion for summary judgment on limitations.in response to appellees motion,appellants moved for relief under.f on the basis that responsive facts were not then available to them and that discovery was necessary on the statute of limitations issue.over objection by appellees,who highlighted appellants earlier discovery opportunities,the district court allowed appellants to take depositions and conduct other discovery to support their opposition to appellees second motion for summary judgment.the district court subsequently granted appellees second motion for summary judgment and ultimately entered a final judgment dismissing the action with prejudice.appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.
under erisa,plan fiduciaries are assigned a number of detailed duties and responsibilities,which include the proper management,administration and investment of plan assets,the maintenance of proper records,the disclosure of specific information,and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.difelice airways,cir quoting mertens hewitt,d.erisa requires that a fiduciary act with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.
erisa a,a,provides that a plan participant may bring a civil action against fiduciaries for breaches of their duties of loyalty and prudence as articulated in erisa a.appellants can not bring suit under a to recover personal damages for misconduct,but rather must seek recovery on behalf of the plan.loren blue cross blue shield of,cir citing.mutual life ins.russell,d for the proposition that a participant action brought pursuant to a must seek remedies that provide a benefit to the plan as a whole.in other words,appellants may bring suit under a on behalf of the pension plan,but they are not permitted to recover individually all relief must go to the plan itself.see id.
appellants argue that the district court committed reversible error in dismissing the pension plan claims alleged in the sac for lack of article iii standing.we review legal questions regarding standing de novo.see piney run ass county comm rs of carroll county,cir.because the standing issues in this appeal arise from a motion to dismiss,we look primarily to the operative complaint,the sac,for the relevant facts.see brockington boykins,cir.when standing is challenged on the pleadings,we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.pennell city of san jose,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.we do not,however,take account of allegations in the complaint labeled as fact but that constitute nothing more than legal conclusions or naked assertions.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.
it is undisputed that appellants have statutory standing to assert claims against appellees on behalf of the pension plan under erisa a,a.however,appellants asserting erisa claims must also have constitutional standing under article iii,const.art.iii.see in re mutual funds inv,cir wilmington shipping new england life ins,cir.as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,appellants bear the burden of establishing standing.wilmington shipping,at.the irreducible minimum requirements of article iii standing are 
an injury in fact,a concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest causation,a fairly trace able connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant and redressability,it is likely and not merely speculative that the plaintiff injury will be remedied by the relief plaintiff seeks in bringing suit.
sprint commc ns.apcc,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the core question here is whether participants have suffered an injury that supports article iii standing to bring erisa claims on behalf of a defined benefit pension plan where the plan is overfunded when the claims are filed and any surplus funding will revert to the plan.
the magistrate judge initial review of appellees motion to dismiss relied heavily upon glanton advancepcs,cir,in which the ninth circuit held that pension plan participants lacked standing to pursue claims under erisa a where the relief sought on behalf of the plan would not benefit the participants individually.id.at.applying glanton,the magistrate judge reasoned that appellants neither allege that they have been denied benefits,nor that their receipt of future benefits is in jeopardy.thus,the judge concluded that appellants have not suffered any injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable outcome in this litigation,and accordingly lack article iii or constitutional standing to assert claims as to the pension plan.the district court adopted the m r over appellants objection and dismissed counts i and ii of the sac,holding that because the plan is a defined benefit plan,the purportedly improper and excessive fees did not harm appellants interests in or benefits under the pension plan,and any recovery by the appellants would have absolutely no effect on the appellants entitlement to benefits.
appellants contend on appeal that they have suffered four distinct injuries,any of which confers constitutional standing.appellants br.at.first,they contend that they have representational standing to sue on behalf of the pension plan because erisa expressly authorizes participants to pursue redress for injuries to the plan itself.id.at.second,appellants assert that trust law and erisa provide standing to sue fiduciaries without proof of economic harm.id.third,appellants maintain that they suffered personal economic injuries because appellees fiduciary breaches diminished the pension plan assets,thereby increasing the risk that the plan would fail and that appellants retirement benefits would not be paid as promised.id.at.finally,appellants argue that they have standing to pursue their statutorily created rights,separate and apart from any economic injury or representational standing.id.at.
appellees argue that appellants have not suffered an article iii because they are entitled to receive a set level of retirement benefits that is unaffected by the performance of the plan underlying investments and,in any event,appellants could not demonstrate actual or imminent harm because the plan was overfunded when they filed their claims.appellees br.at.secretary of labor hilda solis secretary solis or the secretary,the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc,and the aarp,acting as amici curiae,urge reversal of the district court dismissal of appellants pension plan claims.
for the reasons that follow,we are constrained to affirm the district court dismissal of appellants pension plan claims.
representational standing 
appellants argue that under the supreme court decision in sprint,they have the same kind of representational standing as a trustee,fiduciary,or assignee.appellants br.at see also sol amicus br.at urging that appellants have article iii standing under sprint.
in sprint,the supreme court considered whether an assignee of a legal claim for money owed has standing to pursue that claim in federal court,even when the assignee has promised to remit the proceeds of the litigation to the assignor.at.sprint involved claims that had been contractually assigned lock,stock,and barrel by phone operators to aggregators for compensation allegedly owed to them by carriers.id.at.the sprint court relied upon vermont agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d,for the proposition that an assignee can sue based on his assignor injuries.id.at.
in vermont agency,the supreme court considered whether a qui tam relator has article iii standing to bring suit on behalf of the united states under the false claims act fca,which provides that a private party may bring suit to remedy an injury suffered by the united states,not the private party.see at.looking to the history of qui tam actions and the theoretical justification for relator standing,the court held that a qui tam relator under the fca has article iii standing.id.at.the court reasoned that an adequate basis for the relator suit is to be found in the doctrine that the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor.the fca can reasonably be regarded as effecting a partial assignment of the government damages claim.id.at noting that a lthough the court ha s never expressly recognized representational standing on the part of assignees,it ha s routinely entertained their suits and also suits by subrogees,who have been described as equitable assignees.internal citations omitted.
the sprint court,like the vermont agency court,conducted an extensive review of history and precedent,noting that 
courts have long found ways to allow assignees to bring suit that where assignment is at issue,courts both before and after the founding have always permitted the party with legal title alone to bring suit and that there is a strong tradition specifically of suits by assignees for collection.
appellants rely upon sprint for the proposition that article iii allows a plaintiff to sue for injury to another even if the plaintiff personally has no stake in the outcome of the case,provided there has been an injury to another the relief sought will remedy that injury and the plaintiff has the legal authority to bring the claim on behalf of the injured other.appellant br.at citing sprint,at.
of the three amici,only secretary solis addresses representational standing and sprint.see sol amicus br.at.the secretary argues that,u nder sprint,erisa section a appropriately assigns a plan action to participants whose legal victory would unquestionably redress the injuries to the plan for which they bring suit regardless of how the plan recovery is ultimately allocated,and thus provides them with the requisite constitutional standing.id.at quoting sprint,at citing vermont agency,at emphasis in original.
the district court found that sprint has no relevance to appellants claims on behalf of the pension plan because t he appellants in this case are not assignees standing on behalf of an assignor who has contractually assigned his rights.emphasis added appellees maintain that sprint does not extend to suits brought by pension plan participants under erisa.
we conclude that the district court correctly perceived controlling distinctions between the circumstances present in sprint and those present in this case.in sprint,although the supreme court did not expressly limit its holding to contractual assignment of legal rights,it emphasized the long history of allowing contractual assignees to bring suit based on an assignor injuries.further,sprint relied upon vermont agency,in which the court recounted the long tradition of qui tam actions,and the theoretical justification for relator standing in finding that the fca effect s a partial assignment of the government damages claim and that assignment of the united states injury in fact suffices to confer standing on the relator.sprint,at quoting vermont agency,at.appellants here do not assert the existence of any contractual agreement assigning the plan injuries and interests to them.absent such an assignment,and any history of extending theories of standing to the erisa context,we find no basis upon which to expand the reasoning in sprint to find that the appellants have standing here.
moreover,we observe that in the context at issue in sprint,the interests of the assignee and assignor in pursuing a claim to recover damages are fully aligned.however,in the erisa context,specifically in the case of a defined benefit plan where all plan participants are equally situated,extending the sprint theory of standing would result in a subset of plan participants being able to cause the entire plan to incur the considerable costs of litigating an alleged fiduciary breach claim even when those alleged harms did not result in any cognizable injury to the plan.such a suit would certainly be adverse to the interests of the plan.where there is no actual injury,we see little to be gained from an abstract challenge to alleged fiduciary misconduct at the cost of the plan and those participants who did not bring and may not approve of the suit.
trust law and erisa 
appellants also assert that they have standing to sue on the pension plan claims because t rust law has that a beneficiary has standing to sue the trustee for breach of the duty of loyalty even if the beneficiary does not claim the trustee breach caused pecuniary harm to the trust.appellant br.at.they argue that trust law extends to this context because erisa embodies these trust principles.id.at.however,appellants provide no authority for the proposition that trust law principles extend to the erisa context to confer article iii standing on appellants to permit them to sue on behalf of a defined benefit pension plan where the plan is overfunded when the claims are filed and any surplus funding will revert to the plan only.we find no basis to hold that it does.
direct injury 
appellants argue in the alternative that they were personally injured by appellees imprudent investment decisions.they contend that those investment decisions diminished pension plan assets and thereby increased the risk that the plan would fail and that their retirement benefits would be compromised.appellants br.at.appellants assert that this injury to their interest in the pension plan is sufficient for article iii purposes,and that an actual reduction in their retirement benefits is not required.id.appellees respond that a bsent an actual loss to defined benefit plan participants,as opposed to the plan itself,participants simply suffer no article iii.appellees br.at.the district court found that the alleged violations did not harm appellants interests in or benefits under the pension plan because any risk to the benefits promised by the defined benefit plan are born by the employer,and members of the defined benefit plan have a nonforfeitable right only to their accrued benefit,so that a plan actual investment experience does not affect their statutory entitlement.quoting hughes aircraft jacobson,d 
secretary solis,the pbgc,and the aarp,as amici curiae,urge that the risk of underfunding in a defined benefit pension plan,even where the plan is overfunded when the claims are filed,is an article iii.the secretary explains that losses like those that appellants allege in this case make promised benefits less secure and reduce future participants protection against future losses or a plan sponsors inability to pay.sol amicus br.at.the secretary further contends that the district court ruling is unworkable as a practical matter because it ties standing to the plan funding level,which is highly volatile as a result of dependence on various factors such as market conditions and interest rates.id.at a plan may,for instance,be overfunded at the time of the breach,underfunded when losses were incurred,overfunded at the initiation of litigation,and underfunded when benefit payments became due.thus,the secretary concludes that t he upshot of the district court opinion is to immunize fiduciaries from lawsuits by plan participants in any case involving an overfunded defined benefit plan,leaving no remedy for clear erisa violations in such cases.id.at.
the similarly contends that participants standing to sue for fiduciary breach in an ongoing defined benefit pension plan does not depend on proof of loss of benefits or the plan funding status.pbgc amicus br.at see also id.at emphasizing that neither lost benefits nor current plan funding is relevant to whether participants are injured by a plan loss from a fiduciary breach.with regard to whether benefits due to participants in a defined benefit plan are compromised in the event that the plan terminates in an underfunded state,the pbgc explains that w hen an underfunded pension plan terminates,pbgc typically becomes statutory trustee,adds agency funds as necessary,and pays participants their benefits under the plan,up to the statutory limits.id.at citing.pbgc further states that t he amount of statutory benefits that pbgc pays to participants can be greatly affected by the amount of plan assets,and that i n determining statutory benefits,pbgc values the plan assets,then distributes them to participants according to the provisions of the plan and the hierarchy in title iv of erisa,as implemented by pbgc regulations.id.at citing a,pt.thus,according to the pbgc,any drain of assets from a defined benefit pension plan can affect participants,because if the plan ultimately terminates in an underfunded state,pbgc may not pay their full benefits.id.at.
we find these theories of standing unpersuasive,not least because they rest on a highly speculative foundation lacking any discernible limiting principle.the supreme court has held that a participant in a defined benefit pension plan has an interest in his fixed future payments only,not the assets of the pension fund.hughes aircraft jacobson,d.the court has also opined that m isconduct by the administrators of a defined benefit plan will not affect an individual entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances a risk of default by the entire plan.larue dewolff,boberg associates,d emphasis added.
whether an article iii results from the possibility that a pension plan will terminate in an underfunded state,and pbgc will not pay full benefits is a question that has not been decided by the supreme court nor this court this case does not afford the opportunity for such a pronouncement.we find on this record the alleged risk to be insufficiently concrete and particularized to constitute an for article iii standing purposes.if the plan becomes underfunded,the bank will be required to make additional contributions.if the bank is unable to do so because of insolvency,participants vested benefits are guaranteed by the pbgc up to a statutory minimum.thus,the risk that appellants pension benefits will at some point in the future be adversely affected as a result of the present alleged erisa violations is too speculative to give rise to article iii standing.in addition,appellants would not benefit from any additional surplus that may result from a favorable outcome in this litigation because the boa pension plan expressly provides that any surplus reverts only to the plan and is not distributed to participants.
deprivation of statutory rights as injury in fact 
appellants contend,finally,that the deprivation of their statutory right to have the pension plan operated in accordance with erisa fiduciary requirements is sufficient to constitute an for article iii standing.appellants br.at see also sol br.at.they assert that they may sue to enforce legal rights vested in them by statute the right to ensure that the pension plan is operated in accordance with law,that fiduciaries discharge their duties with care,skill,prudence,loyalty,and diligence,and that fiduciaries do not engage in.appellants br.at.however,this theory of article iii standing is a as it conflates statutory standing with constitutional standing.as noted supra,these requirements are distinct we have subject matter jurisdiction over erisa claims only where the appellants have both statutory and constitutional standing.see in re mut.funds,at wilmington shipping,at.
accordingly,the district court did not err in finding that the appellants lack standing to sue on the pension plan claims.appellants and amici caution that this finding will leave defined benefit plan participants without an erisa remedy to fiduciary breaches whenever the plan is overfunded but we note that in situations where plan participants lack standing,the secretary always remains empowered under the statute to investigate the continuing viability of erisa plans and to bring suit to enforce erisa.et secretary of labor fitzsimmons,cir en banc.
we next turn to the issue of limitations.appellants argue that the district court committed reversible error in dismissing counts i through iv of the tac on the ground of limitations.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of appellants,the nonmoving party.eckelberry reliastar life ins,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.as the party asserting the affirmative defense of statute of limitations,appellees have the burden of proving facts showing that the limitations period had run prior to the filing of this action on august.columbia venture,llc dewberry davis,llc,cir.
under erisa,a plaintiff is limited by a general limitations period.the limitations period is shortened to three years in instances where the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach.id.because limitations period begins immediately upon the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation,can most accurately be described as a statute of repose.accordingly,the limitations period begins running when a specific event occurs,regardless of whether a cause of action has accrued or whether any injury has resulted.limitations of actions,at black law dictionary ed.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of counts i through iv of the tac.
counts i,ii,and iii 
appellants allege in count i of the tac that the cbc caused the k plan to engage in prohibited transactions in violation of erisa,by including funds in the plan investment lineup.in count iii,appellants allege that the bank itself participated in and abetted those prohibited transactions.
appellants argue that appellees violated erisa prohibited transactions provisions by failing to remove or replace the affiliated funds as plan investment vehicles at each of the committee meetings that occurred periodically during each year of the removal class period,and the limitations period therefore began to run anew at each cbc meeting at which members failed to remove the funds.see appellants br.at.appellees argue that the failure to remove funds constitutes a failure to act,which can not form the basis for a claim under.appellees br.at.they contend that the only affirmative act alleged is the initial selection of the funds,which occurred more than six years before appellants filed this action.id.at.
appellees argue in the alternative that counts i,ii,and iii are also barred under the limitations period in because appellants had actual knowledge of the alleged violation more than three years before filing.id.at.
the district court construed counts i,ii,and iii as challenging the initial selection of the funds,which undisputedly occurred no later than,and accordingly held that the claims are under the year limitations period in a.alphin,d at.
we agree with the district court.although appellants argue that claims i and iii are based only upon an omission,the failure to remove the funds from the k plan investment lineup,the alleged prohibited transactions and breach could only be based on the initial selection of the funds.
count i alleges that appellees,by their actions and omissions,caused the plans to engage in prohibited transactions under a a,c,and b,of erisa.section a provides 
a transactions between plan and party in interest except as provided in section of this title 
a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction,if he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes a direct or indirect 
a sale or exchange,or leasing,of any property between the plan and a party in interest 
c furnishing of goods,services,or facilities between the plan and a party in interest 
section b provides 
a transactions between plan and fiduciary a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not 
deal with assets of the plan in his own interest or for his own account,
in his individual or in any other capacity act in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party or represent a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its participants or beneficiaries,or 
receive any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with such plan in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.
to establish a claim under section a,appellants must show that a fiduciary caused the plan to engage in the allegedly unlawful transaction.lockheed spink,d.courts have held that a decision to continue certain investments,or a defendant failure to act,can not constitute a transaction for purposes of section a or b.wright metallurgical,cir the decision by the oremet defendants to continue to hold of plan assets in employer stock was not a transaction.tibble edison int l,d,sce alleged failure to act,however,can not constitute a transaction for the purposes of a d.we agree with this view.the common understanding of the word transaction implies that an affirmative action is required.see meriam webster dictionary transaction a something transacted especially an exchange or transfer of goods,services,or funds a an act,process,or instance of transacting.
accordingly,we find untenable appellants contention that their claims are timely because appellees failure to remove the affiliated funds at every committee meeting constituted a new prohibited transaction,and thus,a breach of fiduciary duty.the only action that
