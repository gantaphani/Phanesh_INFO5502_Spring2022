the issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred by disqualifying a law firm from representing the plaintiffs at trial,based on relationships between two of the firm attorneys and a defendant that ended several years before this litigation commenced.the defendant argued the attorneys received his confidential financial information in conjunction with making loans,and the plaintiffs could use it against him here,in making settlement demands.
we find error and grant the petition.even if the attorneys did receive the defendant financial information in making loans,he did not meet his burden of showing the information could give the plaintiffs an unfair advantage or affect the outcome of this litigation.gregori bank of america d.gregori.through no fault of the attorneys,the defendant produced to the plaintiffs in this action updated financial information showing substantial income and wealth,and although the court found the production was inadvertent we can not ignore its practical impact on the disqualification issue.under the circumstances,disqualification would serve no legitimate purpose and would unfairly deprive the plaintiffs of trial counsel of their choice 
factual and procedural background 
in may oaks management corporation and numerous individual condominium owners collectively oaks management filed a second amended complaint against william ayyad and william ayyad,together ayyad,and other defendants not involved here,for negligence,fraud,conspiracy,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of implied warranty and related causes of action.the complaint alleges oaks management is the governing board of the oaks condominiums,a condominium conversion project located in fallbrook,california ayyad and other defendants were involved in the development and sale of the project the defendants ignored grading,water intrusion,structural,landscaping and other problems with the project,and performed cosmetic repairs and marketed the condominium units as new and as a result,purchasers live in units that have no functioning heat,mold,water intrusion,dry rot,termites,and other significant structural problems.
oaks management attorneys of record were originally brian dawson and brendan ozanne,of dawson ozanne,and david veljovich,of the veljovich law group collectively,original counsel.trial was scheduled for january,and in september original counsel filed a notice of association of daral mazzarella and vincent bartolotta,of the law firm of thorsnes bartolotta mcguire tbm,as lead trial counsel.
ayyad moved to disqualify tbm on the ground its attorneys have knowledge of his personal finances and oaks management can use the information to his disadvantage,for instance in settlement negotiations.ayyad submitted a declaration that stated in he began obtaining loans for the acquisition and development of real property through pacific west realty group pacific west,a broker that facilitates loans through private investors.the private investors that funded ayyad loans included mtt partners,lp mtt partners,of which michael thorsnes is the general partner,and vjb partners,lp vjb partners,of which bartolotta is the general partner.bartolotta is a partner in the tbm firm,and thorsnes was previously a partner and has now retired to of counsel status.between and ayyad acquired five loans through pacific west,of which mtt partners contributed a total of,and in he borrowed through pacific west,of which mtt partners contributed and vjb partners contributed.ayyad satisfied the last of the loans in.
ayyad declaration also stated he was required to present information to pacific west on the properties he sought to purchase,pro formas,rent rolls and financial statements.ayyad understood pacific west provided the information to individual investors so they could determine whether to make a loan and he provided the information with the expectation of confidentiality.ayyad submitted copies of his loan application and supporting documents,which revealed his real estate holdings,assets,liabilities and net worth 
further,ayyad declaration stated that in thorsnes,on behalf of a third party,sought investment capital from ayyad.according to the declaration,during a meeting ayyad attended thorsnes told the third party ayyad was a good borrower,and made other general comments about ayyad,his financial history and his businesses.
ayyad also submitted a declaration by harry bigham,a certified financial planner and of pacific west.the declaration stated he customarily provided investors with information pertaining to the borrower financial ability to repay the loan.in october bigham held separate meetings with thorsnes and bartolotta to discuss underwriting the ayyad loan,and he brought loan files for each of them that summarized ayyad qualifications and included a copy of his financial statement.on conclusion of the meetings,thorsnes and bartolotta instructed bigham to maintain the loan files at pacific west with other documents of theirs,to which they had access during business hours.
bigham supplemental declaration stated he did not recall revealing any of ayyad specific financial information to thorsnes or bartolotta or whether either of them ever accessed their files at pacific west,and they had now instructed him to dispose of any information in the files pertaining to ayyad.a third declaration by bigham stated although i may not have specific present recollections about the specific information provided or the exact words used during my meetings with thorsnes and bartolotta relating to ayyad loan in,my recollection is that i did convey general financial information regarding ayyad to them to allow them to decide whether to invest in this loan.
in its opposition,oaks management argued ayyad waived any right of confidentiality by,in,voluntarily producing in this action a loan application for the property involved here,which contained more current financial information and showed he had substantial monthly income and net worth.oaks management also argued thorsnes and bartolotta did not actually receive any of ayyad financial information from pacific west.bartolotta submitted a declaration that stated when making loans through pacific west he relied on its evaluation and expertise,and he did not review any financial information of borrowers.thorsnes submitted a declaration that stated he had no recollection of receiving or reviewing any of ayyad financial information.
in reply,ayyad submitted a supplemental declaration that stated he did not authorize or consent to the production of his loan application and was shocked to learn of it.
after hearings on november and,the court granted ayyad motion to disqualify the tbm firm,pursuant to state bar rules of professional conduct,rule and this court opinion in raley,supra,d,among other cases.based on bigham declarations,the court presumed thorsnes and bartolotta had learned of ayyad financial information.the court explained an attorney,while acting in a role other than as an attorney,owes a duty of confidentiality to a,who later becomes his adversary.the mere possibility that the confidential financial information acquired by attorneys thorsnes and bartolotta while they acted as lenders to ayyad could be useful in this litigation,either for settlement offer purposes or in negotiation tactics,is sufficient to establish a conflict of interest necessitating disqualification the key factor is the attorney receipt of confidential information while acting in his dual status and the risk of using that information to gain an advantage of his adversary.the court rejected the argument that ayyad had waived his right of confidentiality by inadvertently producing the financial information in this case.
this writ proceeding followed,and we initially denied the petition summarily.oaks management successfully sought review,and the supreme court transferred the matter to us to issue an order to the superior court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.trial had been rescheduled for june,and on our own motion we stayed trial pending resolution of this proceeding.
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil.
the parties disagree as to the correct standard of review.ayyad contends an abuse of discretion standard applies as the trial court resolved disputed issues of material fact,such as whether tbm attorneys acquired his personal financial information during the relationship and whether he waived confidentiality by producing his loan application in this litigation.oaks management asserts that accepting the court factual findings as true,it erred as a matter of law by disqualifying the tbm firm and thus an independent review standard applies.we agree with oaks management and review the matter de novo.
disqualification principlesa 
a judge authority to disqualify an attorney has its origins in the inherent power of every court in the furtherance of justice to control the conduct of ministerial officers and other persons in pending judicial proceedings.neal health net,th,d see also code civ,subd.a.the power is frequently exercised on a showing that disqualification is required under professional standards governing avoidance of conflicts of interest or potential adverse use of confidential information.responsible citizens superior court th,d.
motions to disqualify counsel present competing policy considerations.on the one hand,a court must not hesitate to disqualify an attorney when it is satisfactorily established that he or she wrongfully acquired an unfair advantage that undermines the integrity of the judicial process and will have a continuing effect on the proceedings before the court.citations.on the other hand,it must be kept in mind that disqualification usually imposes a substantial hardship on the disqualified attorney innocent client,who must bear the monetary and other costs of finding a replacement.a client deprived of the attorney of his or her choice suffers a particularly heavy penalty where his or her attorney is highly skilled in the relevant area of the law.gregori,supra,d at.
the paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.the important right to counsel of one choice must yield to ethical considerations that affect the fundamental principles of our judicial process.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d.generally,the disqualification of an attorney vicariously disqualifies his or her firm.raley,supra,d at.
disqualification motions appear to arise most frequently in the context.t he per se rule of disqualification generally prevents an attorney from undertaking a representation which is adverse to a current client.citation.the attorney duty of undivided loyalty prevents such simultaneous representation,even on matters which are wholly unrelated citation,without the informed written consent of both clients.morrison knudsen hancock,rothert bunshoft th,d,italics added flatt superior court cal th,d,the primary value at stake in cases of simultaneous or dual representation is the attorney the client legitimate loyalty,rather than confidentiality.
additionally,disqualification may be based on successive representation.where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.thus,where a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d.when a substantial relationship is shown,the attorney access to confidential information during the first representation is presumed and disqualification in his or her representation of the second client is mandatory.ibid.
further,disqualification may be proper when,as here,an relationship is not at issue.in raley,supra,d,this court explained professional responsibilities do not turn on whether a member of the state bar acts as a lawyer.one who is licensed to practice as an attorney in this state must conform to the professional standards in whatever capacity he or she may be acting in a particular matter.citation.id.at,citing libarian state bar cal d,baron city of los angeles cal d.
in raley,former rule b was at issue,which provided a member of the state bar shall not represent conflicting interests,except with the written consent of all parties concerned.raley,supra,at.relying on a formal opinion of the state bar,we interpreted former rule b to extend to conflicts of interest arising from an attorney relationship with a nonclient when the relationship creates an expectation that the attorney owes a duty of fidelity.it may also arise where the attorney has acquired confidential information in the course of such a relationship which will be,or may appear to the person or entity to be,useful in the attorney representation in an action on behalf of a client.raley,supra,d at.
in raley,we held a conflict of interest disqualified a law firm gray,cary from representing a plaintiff carroll in an action,when a bank as trustee held percent of the stock of the defendant company raley,and a senior partner in the law firm zobell was a director of the bank and on the trust committee,which directed raley.raley,supra,d at.we pointed out that zobell duties on behalf of the b ank will require him to focus on the weaknesses of carroll lawsuit while,at the same time,zobell law firm advocates the merits of carroll action.id.at.further,zobell fiduciary relationship with raley and the t rust through his positions with the b ank and the trust c ommittee,on the one hand,and his partnership status with gray,cary,on the other hand,places the firm on both sides of carroll lawsuit.ibid.
in raley,we emphasized that the propriety of disqualification depends on the circumstances of the particular case in light of competing interests.the court must weigh the combined effect of a party right to counsel of choice,an attorney interest in representing a client,the financial burden on a client of replacing disqualified counsel and any tactical abuse underlying a disqualification proceeding against the fundamental principle that the fair resolution of disputes within our adversary system requires vigorous representation of parties by independent counsel unencumbered by conflicts of interest.raley,supra,d at.
disqualification is unwarranteda 
in contending the court correctly disqualified the tbm firm,ayyad relies predominately on raley.after raley was published,however,important changes were made to the rules of professional conduct.former rule,along with former rule requiring attorneys to preserve the confidentiality of client matters,became part of current rule following the supreme court adoption of the revised rules of professional conduct on november,effective may,and amended effective september.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d,tracinda th,d.unlike former rule,rule controls conflicts of interest and disqualification motions only in the context of relationships.in re lee th,d rule never becomes applicable where the party seeking the attorney disqualification fails to establish that such party was or is represented by the attorney in a manner giving rise to an relationship american airlines,sheppard,mullin,richter hampton th,d allen academic games leagues of america,allen.rule is inapplicable here because there was no relationship between tbm attorneys and ayyad.
moreover,although courts have cited raley after the abrogation of former rule see,allen,supra.at,it is also distinguishable on its facts,which are more compelling than those here.again,in raley,during the litigation at issue the bank as trustee owned raley stock,and the trust committee of which the attorney was a member appointed the company board of directors,operated the company and had settlement authority in lawsuits.as this court noted,the attorney positions with the bank placed his firm on both sides of the lawsuit.raley,supra,d at.further,the court held the attorney relationship with the nonclient create d an expectation that the attorney owe d a duty of fidelity.id.at,italics added.as the court explained in morrison knudsen hancock,rothert bunshoft,supra,th at page,d,the situation in raley was akin to that of simultaneous representation,where a law firm was in effect on both sides of a lawsuit.in simultaneous representation cases the paramount consideration is the duty of loyalty.
here,there is no direct conflict like the one in raley.no tbm attorney sat on the board of directors of ayyad business and ayyad was not asked to confront the same law firm in both the courtroom and the board room.raley,supra,d at.ayyad had relationships with mtt partners and vjb partners,and it is established that absent special circumstances not present here a loan transaction is at and there is no fiduciary relationship between the borrower and lender.union bank superior court th,fn,d kim sumitomo bank th,d peterson development torrey pines bank d.nymark heart fed.savings loan d,fn.copesky superior court d.price wells fargo bank d.mitsui manufacturers bank superior court d.lawrence bank of america d.in copesky superior court,supra,d,footnote,this court cautioned against the loose characterization of financial relationships as fiduciary,or fiduciary like,as in ordinary banking transactions the bank is in no sense a true fiduciary.
ayyad ignores this body of law and persists in claiming thorsnes and bartolotta have duties of fidelity that ethically preclude their firm from accepting employment adverse to him.at oral argument,ayyad cited valley bank of nevada superior court cal d,valley bank,in which the issue was under what circumstances a litigant may,through civil discovery,obtain financial information from a bank that its customer had disclosed in confidence.the court held that under the newly adopted article i,section of the california constitution,a bank customer has a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to financial information disclosed to the bank valley bank,supra,at,and before a bank may produce such information in litigation it must take reasonable steps to notify the customer of the pendency and nature of the proceedings and afford the customer the opportunity to assert his or her interests in the matter.id.at.valley bank does not hold there is a duty of fidelity between a lender and borrower,and indeed the opinion does not mention the terms fidelity,loyalty or fiduciary.
because no duty of fidelity is at issue,the primary consideration in this instance is one of confidentiality rather than loyalty.morrison knudsen hancock,rothert bunshoft,supra,th at,d raley,supra,d at.we agree ayyad had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the financial information he revealed to pacific west to obtain loans,but when no relationship exists m ere exposure to the confidences of an adversary does not,standing alone,warrant disqualification.in re complex asbestos litigation d.such a rule would nullify a party right to representation by chosen counsel any time inadvertence or devious design put an adversary confidences in an attorney mailbox.ibid.
rather,s ince the purpose of a disqualification order must be prophylactic,not punitive,the significant question is whether there exists a genuine likelihood that the status or misconduct of the attorney in question will affect the outcome of the proceedings before the court.thus,disqualification is proper where,as a result of a prior representation or through improper means,there is a reasonable probability counsel has obtained information the court believes would likely be used advantageously against an adverse party during the course of the litigation.disqualification is inappropriate simply to punish a dereliction that will likely have no substantial continuing effect on future judicial proceedings.gregori,supra,d at,italics added.
at oral argument,ayyad asserted the prejudice test of gregori is inapplicable because raley controls and the disqualification there was not based on any type of harm.that is incorrect,because in raley,supra,d at page,we considered the issue of harm as follows zobell ongoing dual status creates a risk of misappropriation of confidential information about raley pertinent to carroll lawsuit,and a lthough carroll has a right to counsel of his choice,and gray,cary has an interest in representing carroll,these factors are heavily outweighed by the ongoing risk presented to the protection of confidential information about raley.id.at.we further explained,raley should not be asked to confront gray,cary in both the courtroom and the board room.to verify gray,cary is not taking advantage of this conflict,raley will have to take further periodic legal steps,thereby injecting separate issues and proceedings into the litigation.in large part the financial burden and administrative disruption caused by this legal wrangling unrelated to the merits of carroll lawsuit will be borne by raley and the court.id.at.
moreover,in raley we set forth a balancing test that necessarily requires a consideration of potential harm.in allen,supra,the court explained that factors considered in raley balancing test must be evaluated against whether the adversarial system is compromised in the present case by the attorney conflict of interest.allen,at.when an attorney can not use confidential information gleaned from a nonclient to his or her disadvantage,the adversarial system would not be compromised by allowing the attorney to represent the opposing party.a no harm,no foul rule is applicable and ayyad was required to show prejudice.
it is undisputed that in,during discovery in this action,ayyad produced personal financial information from,which is two years more current than the most recent information he submitted to obtain loans through pacific west.the information revealed that in he had substantial monthly income and net worth.it is undisputed that oaks management,its original counsel and the tbm firm are privy to the information,and the information is obviously also available to its current counsel the court found the production was inadvertent,but notably,it did not address the effect of the production on the requirement of prejudice.
inadvertently produced privileged material can not be used at trial state comp.ins.fund wps,th,d mitsubishi electronics america,th,d,but there is also no suggestion the financial information ayyad submitted to pacific west to obtain loans can be introduced at trial.rather,ayyad theory is that the mere knowledge of tbm attorneys of his wealth gives oaks management an advantage in settlement negotiations or other matters.oaks management and its attorneys,however,can not unlearn the financial information ayyad produced here,and thus any possible receipt by thorsnes or bartolotta of his financial information is immaterial and would have would have no substantial continuing effect on future judicial proceedings.gregori,supra,d at.in other words,the parties are in the same position whether or not thorsnes or bartolotta reviewed ayyad loan application.
ayyad relies on chronometrics,sysgen,d.chronometrics,to dispute oaks management contention the disqualification of the tbm firm accomplishes nothing given ayyad production of his financial information.in chronometrics,an attorney was disqualified from representing plaintiff corporations in lawsuits based on his wrongful contact with a defendant.the case was based on former rule,wh
