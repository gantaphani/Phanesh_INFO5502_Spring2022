introduction 
in this case we hold that claims against a savings and loan association brought under business and professions code sections and and based upon allegations that,in effect,the savings and loan association breached contractual terms and made misrepresentations in conducting its business,are not preempted by federal law.we also hold that proposition,enacted by the california electorate on november,which amended sections et and et to eliminate the statutory grant of standing to bring actions to enforce those provisions to persons who did not suffer actual injury,applies to actions that were filed but not finally resolved before november,the effective date of the amendments.finally,we hold that if a plaintiff filed a representative action under section or on behalf of the general public before november,and can not meet the standing requirements under the statutes as amended by proposition,the plaintiff may,at the trial court discretion,be entitled to amend the complaint to substitute a plaintiff who meets the standing requirements.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.
background 
plaintiffs and appellants thomas branick and ardra campbell plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against defendant and respondent downey savings and loan association downey,alleging claims under sections and on behalf of the general public concerning certain practices in which downey engaged with respect to real estate financing transactions.in an amended complaint filed on february,plaintiffs alleged that downey engaged in unfair competition under section by misrepresenting the amount of government recording fees necessary to record documents incident to real estate transactions acquiescing in the title companies systematic overcharging and double charging of governmental document recording fees charg ing for recording substitutions of trustees,even though it had no legal or contractual entitlement to do so charg ing fees for recording reconveyances,including document recording fees,even though no third party was engaged to accomplish the reconveyances,in violation of its trust deeds and collecting the recording fee to record reconveyances twice in conjunction with title companies.under section,plaintiffs alleged that downey engaged in unfair competition by overstating the amounts of governmental recording fees necessary to record all documents needing to be recorded misrepresenting that it must collect governmental document recording fees for the recording of reconveyances though downey knew the title company would also demand such fee from sellers and refinancers misrepresenting that it could collect fees for recording substitutions of trustee even though downey knew it had no legal or contractual authorization to do so misrepresenting that it could collect fees for recording reconveyances,including document recording fees,even when no third party was engaged to accomplish the reconveyances,though this violated its trust deeds which did not authorize defendant to charge for any fees associated with a reconveyance unless the defendant engaged a third party to prepare record the reconveyance.plaintiffs do not allege that they personally engaged in any real estate financing transaction with downey,nor do they allege that they personally suffered any injury as a result of downey alleged unfair competition.instead,they allege that they bring their claims as a representative action on behalf of the general public.
downey moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that plaintiffs claims are preempted by federal law,specifically by the home owners loan act the hola and by regulations promulgated under the hola by the office of thrift supervision the ots.the trial court granted downey motion and entered judgment against plaintiffs.plaintiffs appeal from that judgment,arguing that the trial court erred in finding their claims preempted.
discussion 
standard of review 
because a motion for judgment on the pleadings is similar to a general demurrer,the standard of review is the same.citation.we treat the pleadings as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.dipirro american isuzu motors,th,d.we review the complaint de novo,giving the complaint factual allegations a liberal construction,to determine whether it states a cause of action under any legal theory.see also burnett chimney sweep th,d.and b ecause a motion for judgment on the pleadings,like a demurrer,raises only questions of law,we may consider new theories on appeal to challenge or justify the trial court ruling.citations.w e review the trial court disposition of the matter,not its reasons for the disposition.burnett,at,d.
federal preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,congress has the authority to preempt state law,art.vi,cl.however,i t will not be presumed that a federal statute was intended to supersede the exercise the power of the state unless there is a clear manifestation of intention to do so.citations.accordingly,w hether federal law preempts state law is fundamentally a question whether congress has intended such a result.citation.congressional intent to preempt may be either express or implied,either explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.citation.however,courts are generally reluctant to infer preemption citation.gibson world savings and loan th,d gibson.
federal regulations may preempt state law just as fully as federal statutes.washington mutual bank superior court th,d.a regulation preemptive effect does not depend on express congressional authorization to displace state law.citation.instead,the determinative issues are whether the agency intended its regulation to have a preemptive effect and the agency acted within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority by issuing the preemptive regulation.gibson,supra,th at,d.because the interpretation of statutes and administrative regulations are questions of law,we determine the preemptive effect of either statutes or regulations independently citation,without deferring to the trial court conclusion or limiting ourselves to the evidence of intent considered by the trial court.citation.ibid.
in the present case,the trial court determined that plaintiffs claims were preempted by federal law,finding that the hola occupies the field of lending regulation for federal savings associations and the allegations of this case.on appeal,downey argues that the trial court determination was correct because code of federal regulations section regulation,a regulation promulgated by the ots under the authority of the hola specifically,under section of title of the united states code,expressly preempts all state laws affecting the lending operations of federal savings and loan associations,including california unfair competition law to the extent it is applied to those lending operations.plaintiffs,on the other hand,argue that their claims sound in contract and tort law,and are the kinds of claims that are not preempted by regulation.plaintiffs are correct.
in gibson,supra,th,d,the fourth district court of appeal was presented with the same issue presented in this case,whether regulation preempted claims alleged under california unfair competition law based upon allegations that the savings and loan association charged borrowers for certain amounts in violation of the terms of the borrowers deeds of trust and failed to disclose that it was charging more for certain items than the association paid for those items.after a thorough analysis under united states supreme court precedent and under the formula suggested by the ots,the gibson court held there was no preemption.
the court in gibson explained that under the relevant precedents,w e must fairly light of the strong presumption against construe the precise language of the preemptive statute or regulation and we must look to each of the plaintiffs state law claims to determine whether it is in fact.citations.as to each state law claim,the central inquiry is whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the claims constitutes a requirement or prohibition of the sort that federal law expressly preempts.gibson,supra,th at,d.applying this framework to the claims before it,the gibson court noted that those claims are predicated on the duties of a contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations,on the duty not to misrepresent material facts,and on the duty to refrain from unfair or deceptive business practices.ibid.the court concluded that t hose predicate duties are not requirements or prohibitions of the sort that regulation preempts.that regulation preempts state laws that either purport to regulate federal savings associations or otherwise materially affect their credit activities.the predicate duties underlying the plaintiffs claims do not meet that description instead,the duties on which the plaintiffs claims are predicated govern,not simply the lending business,but anyone engaged in any business and anyone contracting with anyone else.on their face,they do not purport to regulate federal savings associations and are not specifically directed toward them.nor is there any evidence that they were designed to regulate federal savings associations more than any other type of business,or that in practice they have a disproportionate impact on lending institutions.any effect they have on the lending activities of a federal savings association is incidental rather than material.id.at,d.therefore,the court determined that the plaintiffs unfair competition claims,which were based upon alleged violations of contractual terms and misrepresentations,were not preempted under the relevant case law.
the gibson court also found that the plaintiffs claims were not preempted even under the formula suggested by the ots to determine whether a state law is preempted that formula was described by the ots at the time it promulgated regulation as follows t he first step will be to determine whether the type of law in question is listed in paragraph b of regulation.if so,the analysis will end there the law is preempted.if the law is not covered by paragraph b,the next question is whether the law affects lending.if it does,then,in accordance with paragraph a,the presumption arises that the law is preempted.this presumption can be reversed only if the law can clearly be shown to fit within the confines of paragraph c.for these purposes,paragraph c is intended to be interpreted narrowly.any doubt should be resolved in favor of preemption.gibson,supra,th at,d,quoting.applying this formula to unfair competition claims based upon breach of contractual terms and misrepresentations,the gibson court found that the types of laws that the plaintiffs sought to enforce were not listed in paragraph b the laws do affect lending businesses,just as they affect any other business that enters into contracts or makes representations during the course of its operations and the presumption of preemption is rebutted because the laws are general contract and commercial laws that only incidentally affect lending operations.id.at,d.thus,the court concluded that the unfair competition claims at issue in that case were not preempted under the ots formula.
the gibson court analysis applies in the present case,with the same result.although the unfair competition claims in this case are not pleaded with great clarity or precision,they appear to be based upon tort violations and,perhaps,contract breaches.thus,the claims are seemingly predicated on duties that govern anyone engaged in any business and anyone contracting with anyone else,and have only an incidental effect on the lending activities of a federal savings and loan association therefore,the claims are not preempted under case law or under the ots formula.
applicability and effect of proposition 
after the briefs were filed in this appeal,the voters of california passed proposition,which amended sections and to delete language that gave any person the right to bring an action to enforce those sections for the benefit of the general public,and to add language that an action under those sections can be brought by a private plaintiff,a prosecutor only if that plaintiff has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.united investors life ins.waddell reed,th,d.the amendments to those sections took effect on november,id,after the briefs were filed in this appeal.we asked the parties to file supplemental briefs,under government code section,to address whether the amendments apply to the present case and,if so,whether the matter should be remanded for possible amendment of the complaint.
applicability of proposition 
downey argues that proposition applies to this case because the initiative repealed the statutory right of persons to sue and therefore,under government code section,it applies to pending cases.downey also argues that even if government code section did not control,proposition applies to this case because the language of the initiative and the amended statute show that the voters intended the initiative to apply to existing lawsuits,and because the changes to the statutes are merely procedural.
plaintiffs contend that under precedent,statutory enactments do not apply retroactively unless there is clear legislative intent to the contrary and that there is no such intent with regard to proposition.they also contend that because the amendments affect standing to sue,the changes impact substantive rights and that therefore they can not be applied retrospectively without an expressed intent to do so.finally,they contend that government code section does not control in this case because proposition did not repeal the unfair competition law and because the unfair competition law is derived from common law.we need not determine the voters intent,nor whether the amendments are procedural or substantive,because we hold that under government code section the amendments have immediate effect in all pending cases alleging claims under sections or 
generally,there is a presumption that statutory enactments do not operate retroactively unless there is clear legislative intent to the contrary.see,evangelatos superior court cal d,b oth this court and the courts of appeal have generally commenced analysis of the question of whether a statute applies retroactively with a restatement of the fundamental principle that legislative enactments are generally presumed to operate prospectively and not retroactively unless the legislature expresses a different intention.but by virtue of government code section,this presumption does not apply when a statutory enactment repeals a statute that provides a purely statutory cause of action.in that instance,the enactment takes immediate effect in all pending cases in which a judgment has been entered but the matter is pending on the enactment contains a saving clause.governing board mann cal d,northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules assocs.th,d beckman thompson th,d.
government code section provides,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired.persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.the california supreme court explained the rule and its application despite the general presumption against retroactivity in callet alioto cal.the supreme court there stated it is too well settled to require citation of authority,that in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to the contrary,every statute will be construed so as not to affect pending causes of action.or,as the rule is generally stated,every statute will be construed to operate prospectively and will not be given a retrospective effect,unless the intention that it should have that effect is clearly expressed.it is also a general rule,subject to certain limitations not necessary to discuss here,that a cause of action or remedy dependent on a statute falls with a repeal of the statute,even after the action thereon is pending,in the absence of a saving clause in the repealing statute.citations.the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may
