plaintiffs and appellants tme enterprises,and james mcdaniel appellants appeal from a judgment,following a court trial,in favor of defendants and respondents norwest bank colorado norwest bank or the bank,norwest services,nsi,and norwest corporation collectively respondents in appellants consolidated actions for violation of subpart b of the federal reserve board regulation j regulation j,which incorporates uniform commercial code ucc article b and which governs wire transfers through the fedwire system fraud negligence civil conspiracy civil rico violations unfair business practices and other state and federal causes of actions appellants contend that substantial evidence does not support the trial court findings that norwest bank did not violate regulation j that respondents were not liable for negligence,civil conspiracy,civil rico violations,and unfair business practices and that respondents were not liable as alter egos of each other.appellants further contend that they are entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to enforce a march,discovery order requiring norwest bank to produce certain documents.
in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that pursuant to regulation j,which is applicable to this transaction,a bank accepting an incoming wire transfer of funds that specifies both an account number and a named beneficiary may rely on the account number even if the named beneficiary does not hold the account identified by the designated number,so long as the bank does not have actual knowledge of that inconsistency that actual knowledge of such an inconsistency does not exist unless bank personnel handling the transaction are aware that the name of the owner of the account number designated in the wire bears no resemblance to,and has nothing in common with,the named beneficiary and that,without reaching any issue of preemption,there is substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that the bank did not act negligently in accepting the wire transfer and in not freezing various accounts prior to the withdrawal of the monies from those accounts.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we hold,without reaching any preemption issue,that substantial evidence supports the trial court findings that respondents were not liable for civil conspiracy,civil rico violations,or unfair business practices that respondents were not liable as alter egos of one another and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion concerning the enforcement of the march,discovery order.we therefore affirm the judgment.
appellants were the victims of a fraudulent investment scheme in which million they sent by wire transfer ended up with vieri gaines guadagni gaines.appellants made the wire transfer through their bank,pacific business bank,to an account gaines maintained at norwest bank.gaines was also a signatory to several other norwest bank accounts owned by an entity called western distributing company.although appellants believed the account specified in their wire transfer was a trust account for the benefit of appellant james mcdaniel and designated in the wire transfer vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel as the named beneficiary,the account was in fact the joint personal checking account of gaines and his wife,janet guadagni gaines business associate,john sposato,as part of the fraudulent investment scheme,provided appellants with gaines account number and convinced appellants that gaines would hold the wired funds as a trustee for appellants benefit.ultimately,the funds were all withdrawn or transferred from accounts at the bank.sposato subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges in connection with the investment scheme.
at the time of the transaction at issue,norwest bank used an automated system for processing incoming wire transfers wire transfer system.the wire transfer system included a database of information on account holders who regularly used wire transfers wire transfer database.if the beneficiary of an incoming wire transfer was in the bank wire transfer database,the wire transfer system would automatically process the wire transfer by identifying the account number to be credited,posting the wired funds to that account,and recording the name and address of the account holder to whom the funds were credited.
if,on the other hand,an incoming wire transfer was to a beneficiary who was not a regular wire transfer customer of the bank,a repair operator would have to process the wire transfer manually.the operator would enter the beneficiary account number into a separate database of account holder information.if the beneficiary account number reflected a valid,existing account at the bank,the database would provide the operator with the name and address of the account owner,although it is not clear if the operator would be aware that it was a joint account or a trust account.the operator would then manually enter the name and address of the account holder into the wire transfer system for recordkeeping purposes only,and the wired funds would be credited to the account number identified in the wire.
norwest bank wire transfer system would not reject an incoming wire transfer if there was a discrepancy between the designated beneficiary name and account number,and would process the transaction so long as the account number was valid.accordingly,the bank policies and procedures for processing incoming wire transfers provided that the funds be posted to the account number specified,so long as the wire transfer instructions designated a valid and existing account number.norwest bank recorded the wire transfer beneficiary name and address as part of the transaction history in order to comply with bank secrecy act recordkeeping requirements however,the beneficiary name was not relevant for purposes of posting the wired funds.
norwest bank received appellants wire transfer on december.nsi handled all of norwest bank wire transfer operations.appellants wire transfer made through the fedwire system,as noted above,was for deposit to an account in the name of vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel,account number,which account was the personal checking account of gaines and his wife.
because gaines was not a regular wire transfer customer of norwest bank,his account information was not in the bank wire transfer database.patrick mahoney,the nsi operator who processed appellants wire transfer,could not recall appellants wire transfer or the procedure he followed when he processed that specific wire transfer.he could not explain why just the name vieri gaines guadagni was recorded without the words,trustee fbo mcdaniel in the transaction history.he said that because the bank policy was to post the funds to the account number specified in the wire transfer,omitting the words trustee fbo mcdaniel made no difference.he recalled that he was instructed during bank training sessions to include in the processing of the wire only the name of the credit party or designated beneficiary of the wire transfer and to omit such phrases as doing business as and trustee,because those words might cause the wire transfer system to reject the transaction.because appellants wire transfer specified a valid,existing account number at norwest bank,the transferred funds were posted to that account.appellants had no communication with respondents before or during the sending of the wire transfer.
on december,norwest bank received another wire transfer to gaines account,this time from james sanderson in the amount of.sanderson wire transfer specified that the funds were to be deposited to a trust account for his benefit and,like appellants wire transfer,designated gaines personal checking account number as the account to be credited.on december,gaines withdrew from the joint checking account he and his wife maintained at norwest bank and deposited the monies into his personal merrill lynch account.
in december,the bank issued a fraud alert,because of an unusual amount of telephone calls bank representatives received from individuals residing outside of colorado wishing to open accounts at the bank.in january,after appellants wire transfer had been accepted and posted,the bank initiated a fraud investigation of gaines account because of telephone calls bank representatives received from individuals inquiring about transactions relating to that account.there is conflicting evidence as to when telephone inquiries concerning gaines account took place however,there was evidence that the calls did not occur until after gaines had withdrawn appellants funds.
on or about january,gaines,at sposato direction,opened an account at norwest bank for an entity named allhandra.gaines is listed in the bank deposit agreement as allhandra and as a signatory on the allhandra account.gaines or a business associate of his told the bank representative who opened the allhandra account that the account was for international arbitrage trading.on january,gaines transferred either million or from his merrill lynch account to a western distributing account at norwest bank.the monies deposited into the western distributing account were subsequently withdrawn.in,after some investigation,the bank closed gaines personal account and all western distributing accounts.
appellants commenced actions against respondents,claiming that respondents had violated regulation j,and that respondents were liable,inter alia,for negligence,civil conspiracy,civil rico violations,and unfair business practices.appellants thereafter served on respondents numerous written discovery requests,including form and special interrogatories,requests for admission,and requests for production of documents.respondents served responses and objections to the discovery requests on july,september,september,and october.on february,appellants filed a motion to compel further discovery responses and the production of documents.on march,the trial court issued a minute order granting appellants motion to compel and requiring respondents to serve verified,full and complete responses,without objections to the discovery requests specified in appellants statement of questions and responses in dispute submitted as part of the motion to compel further discovery responses.
at trial,appellants argued that respondents had not complied with the march,discovery order.appellants further contended that the march,order required respondents to produce all responsive documents without regard to the privilege.the trial court disagreed with appellants contention that the march,order required the production of privileged documents.pursuant to stipulations with appellants,respondents provided a supplemental declaration stating that all responsive documents either had been produced or entered on a privilege log submitted concurrently with the supplemental declaration,and respondents produced two documents for an in camera review by the trial court,with a joint request by the parties that the trial court rule as to whether or not the documents were subject to the privilege.the trial court ruled that one of the documents was privileged and the other was not and ordered respondents to produce the document.respondents did so.the trial court did not order the production of any of the other documents listed on respondents privilege log.
following the trial,the trial court entered a judgment in favor of respondents.in support of that judgment,the trial court issued a statement of decision containing the following findings respondents did not violate regulation j,ucc section,or california uniform commercial code section respondents had no knowledge,within the meaning of regulation j,ucc section,or california uniform commercial code section,of the discrepancy between the trust account specified in appellants wire transfer and the owners of the account,vieri gaines guadagni and janet guadagni respondents owed no duty of care to appellants respondents were not alter egos of one another respondents were not negligent with respect to appellants respondents made no misrepresentations of any type to appellants and there was no evidence of fraud,negligent misrepresentation,civil conspiracy,civil rico violations,unfair business practices,negligence,gross negligence,conversion,or unjust enrichment against respondents.appellants filed this appeal.

regulation j 
regulation j governs the transfer of funds through the fedwire system and applies to the transaction at issue in this case.a.regulation j specifically incorporates article of the ucc b.the relevant portions of section of ucc article,provide a subject to subsection b,if,in a payment order received by the beneficiary bank,the name,bank account number,or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account,no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order can not occur.b if a payment order received by the beneficiary bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons,the following rules apply except as otherwise provided in subsection c,if the beneficiary bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons,it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order.the beneficiary bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.if the beneficiary bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons,no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer.if no person has rights as beneficiary,acceptance of the order can not occur.west laws ann,foll.pt,appen.
appellants argue that subsection a of ucc section applies because their wire transfer identified vieri gaines guadagni as trustee fbo mcdaniel,and no such trust account existed.they maintain that norwest bank should not have accepted the wire transfer because subsection a of ucc section prohibits a bank from accepting a wire transfer that refers to a person or account.subsection a of ucc section,is expressly subject,however,to subsection b,which governs payment orders that identify the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying account number,but a discrepancy exists between the name and account number.west laws,supra,at foll.the wire transfer at issue here designated the beneficiary both by name and by an identifiable account number,and such a discrepancy existed.ucc,subsection b therefore applies.
ucc,subsection b provides,in effect,immunity from safe harbor for a beneficiary bank that relies on the account number specified in a wire transfer order to identify the beneficiary of the order.see hawkland lawrence,uniform commercial code series funds transfers,clark clark,law of bank deposits,collections and credit cards ed.wire transfers,to clark.the safe harbor provision applies so long as the bank does not know that the beneficiary name and account number refer to different persons.know means to have actual knowledge.west laws,supra,foll,at,and the beneficiary bank has no duty to determine whether the name and account number specified in the wire transfer refer to the same person.west laws,supra,foll,at first security bank of new mexico,pan american bank cir.
the official comment to ucc section explains the reasoning behind the safe harbor provision a very large percentage of payment orders issued to the beneficiary bank by another bank are processed by automated means using machines capable of reading orders on standard formats that identify the beneficiary by an identifying number or the number of a bank account.the processing of the order by the beneficiary bank and the crediting of the beneficiary account are done by use of the identifying or bank account number without human reading of the payment order itself.the process is comparable to that used in automated payment of checks.the standard format,however,may also allow the inclusion of the name of the beneficiary and other information which can be useful to the beneficiary bank and the beneficiary but which plays no part in the process of payment.if the beneficiary bank has both the account number and the name of the beneficiary supplied by the originator of the funds transfer,it is possible for the beneficiary bank to determine whether the name and number refer to the same person,but if a duty to make that determination is imposed on the beneficiary bank the benefits of automated payment are lost west laws,supra,com.to off.com.reprinted at west ann.cal.ed.foll.
one authority has written,there can be arguments about when a bank knows that the name and number refer to different persons,but those too should be minimal.since to know is to have actual knowledge,not notice,and since it is implausible that a bank would knowingly make a large payment into a thief account,this seems a small escape.nevertheless,we would imagine that such cases could arise,particularly where a lucky thief does multiple transactions.white summers,uniform commercial code ed.
appellants contend that the provisions of ucc section,subsection b do not apply in this case because the bank processed their wire transfer manually rather than by an exclusively automated means.the official comment to ucc section makes clear,however,that the safe harbor provisions accorded to banks apply to manual wire transfer processing as well although the clear trend is for beneficiary banks to process payment orders by automated means,section is not limited to cases in which processing is done by automated means.a bank that processes by means or even manually may rely on a number as stated in section.west laws,supra,com.to.
on december,appellants wire transferred million to norwest bank for deposit to an account in the name of vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel,account number.the evidence at trial showed that norwest bank and nsi relied on the account number specified in appellants wire transfer and posted the transferred funds to that account.the bank policies and procedures in effect at that time for processing incoming wire transfers provided that funds be posted to the account number specified in the wire transfer,so long as that account was a valid and existing account at the bank.the account number specified in appellants wire transfer was a valid,existing account at norwest bank,and the transferred funds were posted to that account.
there was not sufficient evidence that norwest bank or nsi had actual knowledge that the holder of the account number specified in appellant wire transfer and the name specified in appellants wire transfer were different persons.appellants argue that the signature cards norwest bank maintained for gaines personal checking account gave the bank constructive knowledge that the gaines checking account was different from the trust account specified in appellants wire transfer instructions.constructive knowledge,however,is insufficient to establish a violation of regulation west laws,supra,com.to.
appellants contention that nsi repair operator patrick mahoney had actual knowledge that the beneficiary vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel identified in appellants wire transfer was different than the name listed in the bank account database as the owner of the account number specified in the wire transfer is unsupported by the evidence.also unsupported is appellants claim that mahoney had actual knowledge of the discrepancy because he purposely altered the name of the beneficiary by deleting the words trustee fbo mcdaniel when processing appellants wire transfer.mahoney testified that he could not recall appellants wire transfer,whether he manually entered the name of the beneficiary when processing that wire transfer,or from where the information concerning the identity of the beneficiary might have come.moreover,he testified that his practice would have been to delete words such as trustee and doing business as included in wire transfer instructions,only because those designations might cause the bank wire transfer system to reject the transaction and because only the account number was needed to complete the transaction.
even assuming that mahoney was aware of a difference between the names vieri gaines guadagni and jan guadagni and vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel,such awareness did not constitute actual knowledge that the name and number identify different persons.west laws,supra,foll.one authority,has noted any time a bank wire transfer system includes any review of the name on an account,the bank wire operator is almost certain to have actual knowledge that there is some type of mismatch or discrepancy between the name of the beneficiary identified in the wire and the name of the owner of the account designated in the wire.that does not mean,however,that the employee has actual knowledge that the name and the number refer to different people.it will be a rare case when the wire operator even knows who the named beneficiary and the owner of the designated account are.as a result,the bank should not be exposed to potential liability for accepting a wire unless there is a complete disconnect between the names.any other result would objectify the standard contained in ucc b and would throw the wire transfer system into turmoil.clark,supra,at.a complete disconnect is when the designated name and account name bear no resemblance to each other and have nothing in common with each other.
according to clark,the principle that a bank does not have actual knowledge that a beneficiary designated in the wire transfer and the owner of the account designated in the banks records refer to different persons unless there is at least some commonality in the names,is consistent with the purpose of ucc section b,which provision was a response to a few cases dealing with name or number discrepancies that are cited in official comment to the section.clark,supra,to.in those cases,bradford trust texas american cir wire was to frank rochefort,while designated account was in the name of colonial coins,securities fund services,american bank and trust of chicago.wire was to john bushman,trustee,while designated account was in the name of gerald haberkorn,the designated name and account name bore no resemblance to each other.according to clark,ucc b was adopted to require actual knowledge of a true conflict between the name and number on the wire similar to the type of complete disconnect illustrated by these cases.clark,supra,see also white summers,uniform commercial code,supra,and aba,business law section,working group on electronic financial services,subcommittee on electronic commercial practices,uniform commercial code committee,model funds transfer services agreement and commentary.
here,the name specified in appellants wire transfer,vieri gaines guadagni,trustee fbo mcdaniel,was sufficiently similar to vieri gaines guadagni,the name associated with the account number designated in the wire transfer,to preclude a finding of a complete disconnect between the two names.substantial evidence supports the finding that respondents did not have actual knowledge that the holder of the account number specified in appellants wire transfer and the name designated in the wire transfer were different persons,and therefore supports the trial court determination that respondents did not violate regulation j or,to the extent applicable,california uniform commercial code section.
