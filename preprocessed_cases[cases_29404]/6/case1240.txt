in this case involving claims of equitable contribution and subrogation,plaintiff morgan creek residential appeals from a judgment of dismissal,following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,in favor of defendants earl kemp and richard haws plaintiff contends its complaint states a claim for equitable contribution from and for subrogation under the california uniform commercial code undesignated section references are to the california uniform commercial code for monies paid by plaintiff pursuant to a letter of credit as we shall explain,plaintiff is not entitled to contribution from the guarantors because the liabilities of an applicant of a letter of credit,on the one hand,and the guarantors,on the other,are not equal.we shall also conclude plaintiff is not entitled to subrogation under the commercial code.we shall therefore affirm the judgment.
background 
in the operative first amended complaint for unjust enrichment,money paid,equitable contribution from,and subrogation plaintiff alleged as follows 
plaintiff is a land developer formerly entitling and developing real estate in a residential development known as morgan creek.defendants are developers merchant builders engaged in entitling and developing real estate homes for sale to the public in the morgan creek development.
one of the planned amenities of the morgan creek development was a golf course,golf club and clubhouse the amenities to serve the surrounding developments.the ownership of the amenities was in morgan creek golf club,llc the golf club,the members of which were west placer golf,llc stonebridge golf iv,llc stonebridge,and the stonebridge group tsg.defendant kemp was a principal of tsg.defendant haws was a principal of stonebridge and tsg.the other individuals named as defendants were principals of defendant lakemont homes,which was the managing member of west placer golf,llc.these lakemont defendants are not parties to this appeal.
during the course of development,the golf club applied for a million loan from citicapital commercial corporation citicapital in order to complete the golf course.as a condition of the loan,citicapital required loan guarantees from all of the named defendants.the guarantees were as follows kemp up to the sum of haws up to the sum of lakemont homes up to the sum of million and the individual lakemont principals up to the sum of each.the written guarantees,totaling were submitted to citicapital.
citicapital subsequently advised the golf club,through its members west placer golf,llc,stonebridge and tsg,that the guarantees were insufficient.the golf club,through its members,requested that plaintiff loan or advance additional sums in order to complete the golf course.plaintiff agreed and advanced and loaned the sum of approximately million to west placer golf,llc,the operating member of the golf club,to complete the golf course.
additionally,at the request of the golf club and defendants,plaintiff obtained and underwrote an unconditional letter of credit in the sum of million for the benefit of citicapital,as security for the loan.the issuing bank was northern trust bank.the terms of the letter of credit allowed citicapital to call the letter of credit upon any default in the loan from citicapital to the golf club.
the golf club million loan application to citicapital was thereafter reduced to million.citicapital approved the million loan the loan,and the golf club commenced construction of the golf course.the loan was secured by a note and deed of trust on the real property and personal property comprising the golf course and other amenities the property.
in july,several unpaid contractors filed mechanics liens against the real property on which the golf course was being built.as a result of this and other issues,citicapital gave notice of a loan default and opportunity to cure.the golf club,through its members,failed to take any action to cure the loan default.
citicapital then called the letter of credit and was paid the sum of million by northern trust bank.as a result of the contractual relationship with northern trust bank,plaintiff was required to and did immediately provide the sum of million to northern trust bank to satisfy the draw on the letter of credit.
the million drawn down on the letter of credit and obtained by citicapital was used to reduce the outstanding principal of the loan from to.it was not used to cure the default under the loan.as a result of the draw on the letter of credit and reduction of the outstanding principal of the loan,the amount of remaining secured debt on the property was reduced to an amount substantially equal to the fair market value of the property.
after the draw on the letter of credit and reduction of the outstanding principal of the loan by million,the lakemont defendants entered into an agreement with citicapital,pursuant to which the lakemont defendants sold the assets of the golf club,including the property,to ownership in a new entity known as step golf associates,obtained restated and restructured financing from citicapital in a loan amount already reduced by the million draw on the letter of credit,in the sum of approximately million the new loan.
the first two counts of the complaint,which are not at issue in this appeal,alleged unjust enrichment and money paid as against the lakemont defendants.
the third count,against all defendants,was for equitable contribution from.it alleged that,in obtaining and underwriting an unconditional letter of credit in the sum of million as security for the loan,plaintiff became a coguarantor with defendants up to the sum of million of the total guaranteed loan sum of million on behalf of the golf club for the benefit of citicapital.plaintiff has disproportionately paid its share of the guarantee of million and,by reducing the principal of the new loan for which it has no obligation,has benefited defendants to the extent that their guarantee or proportionate share thereof has been reduced.plaintiff million pro rata share of the million loan guarantee is only percent in paying million as a result of the draw on the letter of credit,plaintiff paid substantially more than its percent proportionate share of the total amounts paid by the guarantors to citicapital following the loan default.plaintiff alleged that equity and justice require that the defendants contribute to the million payment made by plaintiff in proportion to their percentage of total guarantee so that plaintiff is not unjustifiably penalized and defendants are not unjustly enriched.defendants refused plaintiff written demand for contribution.
the fourth count of the complaint alleged subrogation against all defendants.it alleged plaintiff was an applicant for a letter of credit that reimbursed an issuer of a letter of credit northern trust bank within the meaning of section plaintiff is subrogated to the rights of northern trust bank pursuant to section,subdivision b.pursuant to section,subdivision a,northern trust bank is subrogated to the rights of citicapital to the same extent as if northern trust bank were a secondary obligor of the loan from citicapital.plaintiff is also subrogated to the rights of citicapital to the same extent as if plaintiff were a secondary obligor of the loan from citicapital.plaintiff payment of million to northern trust bank was made to protect plaintiff own interest and was made as a result of its obligation under the letter of credit,not as a volunteer.pursuant to section,plaintiff million payment was one for which plaintiff was not primarily liable.plaintiff alleged it is subrogated to the rights of citicapital as against defendants and can obtain contribution from them pursuant to those rights,and such subrogation will not work an injustice to the rights of others.
the pleading prayed for judgment against each defendant in proportion to their percentage of total guarantee,such that plaintiff is reimbursed for all but its pro rata share 
defendants kemp and haws filed a demurrer to this first amended complaint,noting that the trial court,in its order sustaining a demurrer to the original complaint,said a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation.assuming arguendo such obligation was created,plaintiff has not alleged that it has paid more than the million it guaranteed so as to require contribution from the defendants.as the claims for contribution fail,the common count claim must also fail as it is alleged on the same facts.additionally,any arguments made by plaintiff regarding subrogation,which are not plead sic in the complaint,would also fail.such arguments directly contravene civil code section.
in their demurrer to the amended complaint,defendants kemp and haws argued plaintiff failed to add any new allegations that would avoid the legal effect of the court ruling that plaintiff is not a coguarantor and has no right of contribution or subrogation against kemp or haws.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court written ruling stated in part this court has previously ruled that a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation.while plaintiff argues that the first amended complaint is based on section,rather than civil code section,plaintiff arguments are without merit.section provides,an issuer that honors a beneficiary presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.in the present case,the applicant is plaintiff,not the individual guarantor defendants.as such,section does not apply.and,as civil code section provides that a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation,the claims for contribution and subrogation fail.
plaintiff appeals from the ensuing order of dismissal of plaintiff complaint against defendants kemp and order which constitutes a judgment subject to appeal.code civ,subd.a.
discussion 
standard of review 
this appeal from an order of dismissal following the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend presents questions of law,which we review de novo.walker allstate indem.th,d.
ii.equitable contribution 
plaintiff contends its amended complaint states or can be amended to state a viable claim for equitable contribution from defendants kemp and haws,because plaintiff and defendants kemp and haws were all who agreed to answer for the golf club debt in the event of a default,yet plaintiff was the only one who paid.we shall conclude plaintiff fails to show grounds for reversal because its unconditional letter of credit created for plaintiff a different level of liability than the level of liability created by the guarantees put up by defendants kemp and haws.
general legal principles 
civil code section provides except as provided in section effect of release,dismissal,or covenant not to sue of the code of civil procedure,a party to a joint,or joint and several obligation who satisfies more than his share of the claim against all,may require a proportionate contribution from all the parties joined with him.
civil code section authorizes a surety to pursue a contribution action against cosureties.
a claim for contribution stems from a legally recognized right forged from principles of equity and natural justice.citations.the right of contribution,although necessarily related to some former transaction or obligation,exists as an entirely separate contract implied by law.citation.in situations where two or more parties are jointly liable on an obligation and one of them makes payment of more than his share,the one paying possesses a new obligation against the others for their proportion of what he has paid for them.citation.borba farms,acheson d.
equitable contribution is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.fn.noting the right is codified in civil code section.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the party that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by others and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the insurance risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by,and to prevent one obligor from profiting at the expense of others.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.
equitable contribution allows for loss sharing among that share the same level of liability on the same risk as to the same principal.citation.rli ins.cna casualty of california th,d insurance case.the principle of equity on which the right of contribution is founded applies only where the parties are under a common burden of liability.weinberg heller,contribution was not an appropriate remedy for corporation which incurred court costs litigating a lawsuit for the benefit of itself and an individual,and which sought to enforce the individual promise to share the court costs.the california supreme court said in dictum in jessup farms baldwin cal d,the right to contribution embodied in civil code section rests upon principles of equity and natural justice.thayer cal,see also jackson lacy d.under fundamental principles of equity,a person who has paid no more than his or her just proportion of the debt can not secure contribution from a codebtor,even if the codebtor has paid nothing.citations.as a corollary to this rule,the california supreme court has held that equality of liability among persons whose respective situations are not equal is inequitable.blankenhorn,supra,at,cash customers who paid in full for stock purchased from broker were not in same class as marginal traders who had not paid in full,and therefore cash customers stock could not be pledged as security for broker debt.jessup farms,supra,cal d at,fn,italics added payments made by the principal obligor of four promissory notes should have been applied to extinguish the first note,hence extinguishing the liability of the defendant who cosigned only the first note,rather than ratably apportioned among the four notes.
application to this case 
in the case before us,plaintiff fails to show that defendants kemp and haws shared the same level of liability as plaintiff,so as to entitle plaintiff to receive contribution from them.thus,plaintiff put up an unconditional letter of credit while defendants kemp and haws put up guarantees.as we shall explain,the liabilities inherent in these two kinds of security are markedly different.
letter of credit 
as the trial court noted,the rules applicable to surety relationships do not govern the relationships between the parties to a letter of credit transaction.western security bank superior court,supra,cal th,d.a amendment to civil code section see fn,ante added the statutory language a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation.stats,ch.civil code section defines a surety or guarantor as one who promises to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another,or hypothecates property as security therefor.the california supreme court has said generally,a surety liability for an obligation is secondary to,and derivative of,the liability of the principal for that obligation.see,et by contrast,the liability of the issuer of a letter of credit to the letter beneficiary is direct and independent of the underlying transaction between the beneficiary and the issuer customer.citations.thus,as the amendment to civil code section made clear,existing law viewed a letter of credit as an independent obligation of the issuing bank rather than as a form of guaranty or a surety obligation.citations.the issuer of a letter of credit can not refuse to pay based on extraneous defenses that might have been available to its customer.citation.absent fraud,the issuer must pay upon proper presentment regardless of any defenses the customer may have against the beneficiary based in the underlying transaction.citation.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.
commercial code section,subdivision provides that a n issuer must honor a draft or demand for payment which complies with the terms of the relevant credit regardless of whether the goods or documents conform to the underlying contract for sale or other contract between the customer and the beneficiary.the california code comment to section states,subdivision reflects the concept that the letter of credit is independent from the underlying sales contract.west ann.cal.ed.this unique feature,referred to as the independence principle,is the primary characteristic of a letter of credit.absent fraud,the issuer must pay upon proper presentment regardless of any defenses the applicant for the letter of credit may have against the beneficiary arising from the underlying transaction.see,lumbermans acceptance security pacific nat.bank d.thus,the issuer of a letter of credit is never entitled to defend against payment based on extraneous defenses which might have been available to the primary obligor.san diego gas electric bank leumi th,d san diego leumi.
thus,when citicapital called the unconditional letter of credit furnished by plaintiff,neither plaintiff nor the issuer,northern trust bank,could assert any defenses except fraud to stop citicapital from collecting on the letter of credit.see san diego leumi,supra,th,d.
to the extent that resort to analogy is appropriate for such a singular creation as the standby letter of credit,its closest relative would seem to be cash collateral.western security bank superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
the guarantees 
a guarantee is a form of suretyship obligation,fn,ante.
as sureties,kemp and haws would have defenses to demands by citicapital which were not available to plaintiff.thus,civil code section says,a surety may require the creditor,subject to section of the code of civil procedure motion to enforce liability on bond given in an action or proceeding,to proceed against the principal,or to pursue any other remedy in the creditor power which the surety can not sic pursue,and which would lighten the surety burden and if the creditor neglects to do so,the surety is exonerated to the extent to which the surety is thereby prejudiced.see cadle world wide hospitality furniture,th,fn,d.in its reply brief,plaintiff concedes the applicant of a letter of credit is unable to assert suretyship defenses against the creditor.
because kemp and haws had suretyship defenses available to them,and plaintiff,as an applicant of a letter of credit did not,these parties did not share the same level of liability to citicapital.consequently,plaintiff has no viable claim for contribution against kemp and haws.weinberg heller,supra.at.
plaintiff arguments 
we shall address various arguments advanced by plaintiff in opposition to our conclusion.
plaintiff concedes there are distinctions between letters of credit and guarantees.plaintiff reply brief acknowledges that with a letter of credit,the beneficiary bank can count on being able to call the letter of credit without having to worry about suretyship defenses plaintiff reply brief further concedes that if a beneficiary bank calls a letter of credit,the issuing bank has to pay the beneficiary bank without regard to any suretyship defenses.
however,plaintiff argues the statutory a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation,fn,ante merely governs the relationship between the parties to the letter of credit transaction,not the relationship between the applicant and others.however,plaintiff fails to persuade,because no such limitation appears in the statute.
in arguing that the statute is limited to the relationship between parties to the letter of credit transaction,plaintiff notes the amendment adding to civil code section the provision that a letter of credit is not a form of suretyship obligation was part of a bill enacted to abrogate the holding of a court of appeal decision which held an issuing bank could assert defenses under an antideficiency statute code civ,to prevent a beneficiary bank from drawing down on a letter of credit.western security bank,supra,cal th,d,which reversed the judgment in the abrogated court of appeal case,noted,the legislature made its purpose explicit it is the intent of the legislature in enacting sections and of this act neither of which amended civil code section to confirm the independent nature of the letter of credit engagement and confirm the expectation of the parties to a contract that underlies a letter of credit,that the beneficiary will have available the value of the real estate collateral and the benefit of the letter of credit without regard to the order in which the beneficiary may resort to either.stats,ch.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.this expression of legislative intent says nothing about the intent of the amendment of civil code section.see western security bank,supra,at,d,noting section of the bill added an antideficiency statute excluding letters of credit from the antideficiency laws,and section made nonsubstantive changes to section assignment of proceeds of letter of credit.
in support of its argument that the distinction between letters of credit and suretyship obligations applies only to parties to the letter of credit transaction,plaintiff quotes from western security bank,supra,cal th at page,d,that the rules applicable to surety relationships do not govern the relationships between the parties to a letter of credit transaction.however,plaintiff reads too much into this quote.the dispute in western security bank was between the parties to the letter of credit transaction.id.at,d.
plaintiff cites matthews hinton d,for the proposition that w hether one is a surety depends not so much upon his relation with the creditor as upon his relation to the principal debtor.id.at.however,in matthews,which in any case predated the legislation at issue in this case,this court did not deal with any letter of credit but merely concluded that landowners who,together with their sublessees,signed a trust deed as principals,subjected themselves to primary liability.id.at.
we conclude plaintiff fails to show that the statutory distinction between letters of credit and suretyship obligations should be limited to parties to the letter of credit transaction.nothing in the statutory language contains the limitation urged by plaintiff.
plaintiff contends there is no reason why the distinction between a letter of credit and other types of security should eliminate the right of contribution.however,the reason is that equitable contribution is founded on the premise that the plaintiff and defendant share the same level of liability.jessup farms baldwin,supra,cal d at,fn,rli ins,supra,th at,d weinberg heller,supra.at.as we have explained,an applicant of an unconditional letter of credit does not share the same level of liability with a guarantor.insofar as plaintiff bemoans this result as harsh formalism elevating form over substance,plaintiff must take his complaint to the legislature,which codified the distinction between letters of credit and sureties.fn,ante.since this is a matter of legislative fiat,plaintiff reliance on subrogation cases from other jurisdictions is misplaced.
plaintiff argues defendants kemp and haws provide no authority for their implied premise that the affirmative defenses applicable in an action by the principal to obtain payment from a guarantor would automatically apply to an action for contribution from a.in plaintiff view,defendants kemp and haws are arguing they have affirmative defenses that they should be able to raise to the contribution action.plaintiffs say the subject of affirmative defenses is premature at the demurrer stage.however,plaintiff misconstrues defendants position and misses the point.kemp and haws argue the alleged default related to mechanics liens rather than a payment default on the citicapital loan and,while any default might trigger citicapital right to call on the letter of credit,only a payment default by the golf club would trigger the right to collect on the guarantees.certainly,this issue can not be resolved at this stage,since the guarantees are not part of the record.however,we need not resolve this issue in order to affirm the judgment.the demurrer does not depend on the assertion of affirmative defenses to the contribution claim.rather,plaintiff has to be able to allege it shared the same level of liability with defendants kemp and haws in order to sue them for contribution.plaintiff can not do so.
we conclude plaintiff,as a letter of credit applicant,had a different level of liability from kemp and haws,as guarantors,and therefore plaintiff has no viable claim for contribution against kemp and haws.
plaintiff case is not helped by its allegation that all defendants specifically asked plaintiff to put up the letter of credit.every party to this transaction was a big boy.nor does it matter that plaintiff says it would not have obtained the letter of credit had it known the outcome.
we conclude the trial court properly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the contribution count.
iii.subrogation 
plaintiff contends its complaint states a viable claim for subrogation under section fn,ante,in that plaintiff is subrogated to any rights of citicapital against defendants kemp and haws.plaintiff claims it can assert citicapital rights under the written guarantees to obtain pro rata contribution from kemp and haws.we disagree.
subrogation is defined as the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.by undertaking to indemnify or pay the principal debtor obligation to the creditor or claimant,the subrogee is equitably subrogated to the claimant or subrogor,and succeeds to the subrogor rights against the obligor.citation.as now applied equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.one who claims to be equitably subrogated to the rights of a secured creditor must satisfy certain prerequisites.these are payment must have been made by the subrogee to protect his own interest.the subrogee must not have acted as a volunteer.the debt paid must be one for which the subrogee was not primarily liable.the entire debt must have been paid.subrogation must not work any injustice to the rights of others.citations.caito united california bank cal d,caito.
thus,subrogation seeks to shift the entire obligation from one who paid to another who should have paid.
here,plaintiff does not show grounds for application of equitable subrogation.even assuming plaintiff did not act as a volunteer and even assuming plaintiff claim is not defeated by the fact it was primarily liable on the letter of credit,and even assuming the requirement that the entire debt be paid was satisfied by payment of the entire million letter of credit which was less than the total million the golf club owed to citicapital,defendants kemp and haws were not primarily liable on the citicapital obligation.rather,the golf club was primarily liable on the debt paid by plaintiff or rather,paid by northern trust bank and reimbursed by plaintiff.additionally,as noted by defendants kemp and haws,subrogation depends on the superiority of the equities of he who asserts it over those of the one against whom it is sought.king hartford acc.indem.plaintiff does not claim superior rights over defendants kemp and haws but merely equal rights.yet kemp and haws,as mere guarantors,bargained for limited exposure,as we explained in our discussion of the contribution issue.to allow plaintiff to recover from them on plaintiff letter of credit would work an injustice to the rights of kemp and haws 
plaintiff claims california law establishes an equitable subordination right in favor of cosureties which section,footnote,ante,extends to plaintiff regardless of whether plaintiff is a cosurety.plaintiff cites section,subdivision b,with inserted brackets an applicant such as plaintiff that reimburses an issuer of a letter of credit,northern trust bank is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary such as citicapital and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subdivision a fn,ante.italics omitted.in other words,argues plaintiff,whatever rights are enjoyed by northern trust bank as the issuer are also enjoyed by plaintiff as the applicant reimbursing the issuer million.plaintiff then asks rhetorically what rights does northern trust bank,and plaintiff by extension,enjoy plaintiff then cites section,subdivision a an issuer northern trust bank that honors a beneficiary presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary here,citicapital to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary according to plaintiff,this means that by statute northern trust bank is subrogated to the rights of citicapital to the same extent as if northern trust bank were a surety with defendants kemp and haws.since plaintiff has the rights of northern trust bank,plaintiff by statute is subrogated to the rights of citicapital to the same extent as if plaintiff were a surety with defendants kemp and haws.plaintiff says this means that,even though plaintiff paid citicapital through the vehicle of a letter of credit,and even though civil code section states that a letter of credit is not a suretyship obligation,plaintiff can still recover from defendants kemp and haws just as though plaintiff had paid citicapital on a personal guarantee.
plaintiff cites nothing supporting its interpretation of section.a more reasonable reading of that statute is that it allows plaintiff to go after the golf club as the primary obligor in default,but not kemp or haws,who were mere guarantors.that the golf club may now be an empty shell,as asserted by plaintiff,is not reason enough to adopt plaintiff interpretation of the statute.nothing cited by plaintiff allows a letter of credit issuer or applicant,by subrogation,to circumvent civil code section and step into citicapital separate rights against third parties not in default to the beneficiary and not liable for the portion of the indebtedness paid by the call on the letter of credit.
plaintiff says that,to understand its conclusion,we must first understand the historical differences between letters of credit and guarantees,and the problem that section was adopted to address.plaintiff notes that,before the enactment of section,an issuing bank obligation to pay a beneficiary bank on a letter of credit was independent of any suretyship defenses pursuant to common law codified in civil code section,fn,ante a principle known as the independence principle.the independence principle,in summary form,makes the letter of credit issuer obligation to pay a draw conforming to the letter terms completely separate from,and not contingent on,any underlying contract between the issuer customer and the letter beneficiary.citations.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.the independence principle deprived the issuing bank of a common law right of equitable subrogation.
section,a part of the california uniform commercial code,removed that impediment.as explained by the uniform commercial code comment by itself this section does not grant any right of subrogation.it grants only the right that would exist if the person seeking subrogation were a secondary obligor.the term secondary obligor refers to a surety,guarantor,or other person against whom or whose property an obligee has recourse with respect to the obligation of a third party.citation.if the secondary obligor would not have a right to subrogation in the circumstances in which one is claimed under this section,none is granted by this section.in effect,the section does no more than to remove an impediment that some courts have found to subrogation because they conclude that the issuer or other claimant rights are independent of the underlying obligation.if,for example,a secondary obligor would not have a subrogation right because its payment did not fully satisfy the underlying obligation,none would be available under this
