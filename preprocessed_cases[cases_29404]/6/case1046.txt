the appellants also claim that their businesses,houses,automobiles and other property were seized and in many cases sold substantially below their market value at auction by cbe for the benefit of cbe and ethiopia.many of the sales allegedly occurred under the pretext that the property was burdened by a tax debt or that a mortgage was in default.some sales proceeds may have been deposited into cbe bank accounts in the appellants names.corrected mem.of in opp to defs.refiled mot.to dismiss corrected mem.
on december,ethiopia and eritrea signed a peace agreement agreement providing for the permanent termination of military hostilities.one provision of the agreement created a claims commission commission to adjudicate claims for loss,damage or injury related to the conflict and resulting from a violation of international law.although the agreement established the commission as the exclusive forum for adjudicating claims arising from the conflict,it specifically provided for the continuance of claims filed in other fora before december.
the appellants brought suit in the district court on june.on august,the district court granted ethiopia and the cbe motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of personal jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens in favor of the commission.we overturned the dismissal,however,concluding that the commission inability to make an award directly to the appellants,and eritrea ability to set off the appellants claim s,against claims made by ethiopia,render the commission an inadequate forum.nemariam fed.democratic republic of ethiopia.
following our remand,jurisdictional discovery commenced in september.discovery disputes stalled its completion but the district court nevertheless directed ethiopia and the cbe to file a renewed motion to dismiss.on the retirement of the district judge who originally dismissed the action,the judge to whom it was assigned ordered the cbe and ethiopia to refile memoranda in support of their renewed motion to dismiss and ordered the appellants to refile a response.in an order dated november,the district court again dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.nemariam fed.democratic republic of ethiopia,d.this appeal followed.

bank account claims 
the district court dismissed the appellants bank account claims because they failed to satisfy both the rights in property and the owned or operated requirements of section a.see nemariam,d at.specifically,the district court held that a bank account constitutes an intangible contract right to receive funds from the bank,id.at,the expropriation exception does not apply to intangible property,id.at,and the appellants failed to demonstrate that the cbe benefited from its alleged control over the bank accounts,id.at although we disagree with the district court interpretation of the rights in property and the owned or operated requirements of section a,we nevertheless agree with the district court that the cbe neither owns nor operates the appellants bank accounts within the meaning of section a.
rights in property requirement 
as an initial matter,the appellants bank accounts constitute intangible property under ethiopian banking law.article of the ethiopian commercial code states,the contract of deposit of funds renders the bank owner of the funds deposited,irrespective of the mode of deposit.the bank may dispose of these funds in respect of its professional activity,subject to their repayment under the conditions provided in the contract excerpt from ethiopian commercial code of,reprinted in ja at emphasis added see also hardee george price,i t is the law that when money is deposited generally in a bank its ownership passes to the bank and the relation of debtor and creditor is at once created.thus,as the district court noted,once funds are deposited into a holder account,the holder simply has a contractual right to receive the funds upon request,not physical possession or even control of the actual funds.nemariam,d at see also citizens bank of strumpf,d bank account consists of nothing more or less than a promise to pay,from the bank to the depositor.a contractual right to receive payment constitutes intangible property.west multibanco comermex,cir certificates of deposit may be characterized as intangible property or contracts de sanchez banco central de nicaragua,cir contractual right to receive payment constitutes intangible property right.

in canadian overseas,the district court dismissed a claim brought under section a of fsia seeking payment for spare parts and related equipment allegedly delivered to a company acquired by the defendant and to recover for loans allegedly made to that company by its predecessor.id.at.focusing on fsia legislative history,the court concluded that the claim did not involve rights in property.it relied on the foreign sovereign immunities act of house report house report,which stated that the expropriation exception was in no way to affect existing law on the extent to which,if at all,the act of state doctrine may be applicable,at,cong.the house report further e.that as the hickenlooper 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court in the united states shall decline on the ground of the federal act of state doctrine to make a determination on the merits giving effect to the principles of international law in a case in which a claim of title or other right to property is asserted by any party including a foreign state or a party claiming through such state based upon or traced through a confiscation or other taking after january,by an act of that state in violation of the principles of international law 
e the district court in canadian overseas reasoned that,because the claim of title or other right to property language in the hickenlooper amendment has been interpreted to apply only to takings of tangible property and not to include intangible interests like a contractual right to payment,it had to interpret the similar language in section a as applying only to tangible property canadian overseas.at.otherwise,w ere the phrase rights in property taken in violation of international law in the fsia interpreted more broadly than the similar phrase utilized in the hickenlooper amendment,congress would have conferred jurisdiction for suits only to have them dismissed in accordance with the act of state doctrine.id.the court also noted that the further requirements in a that the property taken in violation of international law or any property exchanged therefor be present in the united states in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the united states by a foreign state or be owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state engaged in commercial activity in the united states suggested that section a is applicable to tangible property and is on its face inapplicable to a contractual right to be paid.id.ellipsis in original

despite the popularity of the canadian overseas decision in the district courts,see,peterson,d at,we find its reasoning unpersuasive.neither the plain language of section a nor its legislative history expressly states that the expropriation exception applies only to tangible property.moreover,the characterization of property interests is a distinction without a difference and is not generally recognized in international,federal,or state law.west,at the relationship between a depositor and bank arises only out of contract,a contract right is property.quoting panel opinion,revised,fourteenth semiannual report to the congress for the period ending june,foreign claims settlement comm n alterations in original alteration omitted see also banco nacional de cuba chem.bank trust,cir.the canadian overseas court conclusions rest instead on section a link to the hickenlooper amendment and the hickenlooper amendment applicability to tangible property only.we believe the first conclusion is erroneous and we therefore do not opine on the hickenlooper amendment reach.
at least two obstacles prevent a federal court from adjudicating on the merits a claim against a foreign sovereign foreign sovereign immunity and the act of state doctrine.section a and the hickenlooper amendment operate to remove these obstacles for a claim involving the expropriation of property in violation of international law.that is,section a provides subject matter jurisdiction by creating an exception to foreign sovereign immunity for a claim involving the expropriation of rights in property.a.and the hickenlooper amendment creates an exception to the act of state doctrine for a claim involving the expropriation of a claim of title or other right to property.e.
the canadian overseas court reasoned that because both the expropriation exception and the hickenlooper amendment serve a similar purpose,the statutes must be interpreted consistently.neither the text nor the legislative history of section a,however,supports such a reading.in fact,the house report relied on in canadian overseas suggests that the statutes were not to operate in tandem.it declared that section a deals solely with issues of immunity and that it in no way affects existing law on the extent to which,if at all,the act of state doctrine may be applicable,at,cong,emphases added.in other words,the house report indicates that the congress intended that the expropriation exception to foreign sovereign immunity operate independently from the hickenlooper amendment exception to the act of state doctrine.in a footnote following a citation to the hickenlooper amendment,the house report further explained 
the committee has been advised that in some cases,after the defense of sovereign immunity has been denied or removed as an issue,the act of state doctrine may be improperly asserted in an effort to block litigation the committee has found it unnecessary to address the act of state doctrine in this legislation since decisions such as that in alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,d demonstrate that our courts already have considerable guidance enabling them to reject improper assertions of the act of state doctrine.
id.at,cong,at,emphases added.thus,instead of limiting the expropriation exception to tangible property,the congress expressed confidence that federal courts would not apply the act of state doctrine too is,to improperl y prevent adjudication on the merits after jurisdiction had been established.
we are therefore free to interpret section a independent of the hickenlooper more important,we believe this interpretation to be the correct one.the plain language of section a as well as its legislative not limit its application to tangible property.moreover,there seems to us to be no reason to distinguish between tangible and intangible property when the operative phrase is rights in property.we therefore conclude that the expropriation exception applies to the appellants bank accounts.we next consider whether the cbe own s or operate s those accounts.
owned or operated requirement 
the district court concluded that the owned or operated language of section a requires a showing that the property benefited the government which allegedly expropriated it.nemariam,d at.in so holding,it relied on the only two reported decisions addressing the oceanica navigacion,compagnie nationale algerienne de navigation,cir,and greenpeace,state of france.unlike the district court,we are not persuaded by the reasoning of those decisions.
in vencedora,the fifth circuit dismissed a claim that an algerian corporation had tortiously deprived the appellant of its wrecked oil tanker following a salvage operation.at.the court held that the expropriation exception did not apply because owned or operated means more than possess ed or controll ed.id.at.citing fsia house report,the court explained 
s ection a was intended to subject to united states jurisdiction any foreign agency or instrumentality that has nationalized or expropriated property without compensation,or that is using expropriated property taken by another branch of the state.the vessel in this case thus would have been owned or operated under section a if some algerian agency had assumed control of the vessel and had used it to carry oil for the benefit of the algerian government.
id.internal citation omitted.the greenpeace district court adopted the fifth circuit reasoning.it held that a vessel allegedly impounded,inventoried and sealed.at,by the french navy was not owned or operated by france because neither france n or some french agency had assumed control of the vessel and had used it for the benefit of the french government,id.at.
we believe the vencedora holding runs contrary to the language and legislative history of section a.the phrase owned or operated plainly does not include a benefit requirement.to own is to have or hold as property or appurtenance possess,see webster third new international dictionary ed,and to operate is to exert power or influence,id.at.moreover,the legislative history the fifth circuit cited,at,cong,at,did not impose such a requirement or even refer to the owned or operated language.rather,the house report defined the phrase taken in violation of international law,stating,the term taken in violation of international law would include the nationalization or expropriation of property without payment of the prompt,adequate and effective compensation required by international law,at,cong,at.even assuming the report addressed the owned or operated language,the plain meaning of nationalization or expropriation dovetails with the plain meaning of owned or operated and thus weighs against imposing a benefit requirement.that is,to expropriate is to transfer the property of another to one own possession,webster,supra,at,and to nationalize is to invest in the central government of a nation the control or ownership of property,id.at.where the plain language of the statute is clear,the court generally will not inquire further into its meaning,at least in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary.meissner,internal quotation and citations omitted.accordingly,we decline to add a benefit element to the owned or operated requirement and conclude instead that the phrase owned or operated means possessed or exerted control or influence over the property at issue.
we nonetheless agree with the district court dismissal of the bank account claims for a different reason.wilburn robinson,we can affirm a grant of summary judgment on alternative grounds,if applicable.citing.newspaper guild,local.post.the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the cbe owned or operated their bank accounts.as explained supra,the cbe owns the funds in the appellants accounts.hardee,at.the property right at issue,however,is the appellants contractual right to receive payment and the cbe has neither taken possession of nor exerted control over that right.instead,accepting as true the appellants allegation that ethiopia and the cbe have in fact prevented them from accessing the funds in the accounts,see nemariam,d at,we believe the cbe has extinguished that contract right.see strumpf,at.noting,in bankruptcy context,bank refusal to pay depositor was neither a taking of possession of depositor property nor an exercising of control over it,but merely a refusal to perform its promise.emphasis added brewer socialist people republic of iraq,cir p laintiffs contract rights were not,the contract itself was repudiated by defendants.we find that such a repudiation is not equivalent to expropriation.citation omitted kalamazoo.at canadian overseas did not involve an expropriation but the simple repudiation of a contractual obligation.canadian overseas.at neither the defendant nor any other party claims ownership of the right to be paid under the contracts which the plaintiff asserts.that is,the cbe did not assume the appellants contractual right to it declined to perform its own contractual obligations.
because the appellants have failed to satisfy the owned or operated requirement of section a with respect to their bank account claims,ethiopia and the cbe are immune from suit on those claims.see.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.
account claims 
in a footnote,the district court also dismissed the appellants account claims.following its conclusion that the appellants intangible bank accounts do not constitute rights in property,the district court declared 
the papers submitted by both parties focus solely on the bank accounts as the property that has allegedly been taken and remains in that status.despite allegations in the complaint that the plaintiffs real property,their homes and businesses,were also illegally taken,there is no discussion of whether these tangible properties provide the basis for fsia jurisdiction.presumably these properties have not been discussed by the plaintiffs because they have been sold,and the proceeds from the sales have been placed in the plaintiffs bank accounts,thereby making the taking of the bank accounts as sic the only property that would form the basis for this court to have fsia jurisdiction.
nemariam,d at.in other words,the district court dismissed the appellants account claims because it presumed based on the appellants opposition to the motion to the bank account claims encompassed all property allegedly expropriated.
the appellants argue on appeal that the district court had no basis to so presume.appellants br.at.they maintain that they raised their account clai
