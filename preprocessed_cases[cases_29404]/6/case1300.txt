the city of oakland adopted an ordinance regulating consumer loans secured by oakland real property.federally chartered lenders were exempted.the american financial services association afsa sued the city,alleging that its lending ordinance was preempted by state law.on for summary judgment,the trial court upheld the ordinance subject to severance of the exemption for federal lenders.
afsa appeals from the ensuing judgment and from an earlier order denying its motion for a preliminary injunction.the city from that portion of the judgment ordering severance.we agree with the city position that,as a matter of law,no part of the ordinance is preempted by state law.accordingly,we reverse the judgment insofar as it orders severance of the exemption,and dismiss as moot afsa appeal from the order denying injunctive relief.
background 
assembly bill 
in the legislature adopted assembly bill reg.sess,legislation designed to regulate a segment of the home mortgage loan business in california known as lending.lending is the business of making loans,primarily home loans or equity lines of credit based upon the borrower equity in a home,to persons with low income,high debt relative to income,or impaired or limited credit histories.borrowers are generally charged stiffer fees and substantially higher interest rates than conventional borrowers.
some practices of the lending industry have been labeled predatory lending by critics.according to consumer groups who have lobbied for legislation to regulate the industry,lenders often employ deceptive sales techniques targeting communities.critics assert that some lenders try to steer unsophisticated,borrowers into accepting highly unfavorable fees,interest rates,and loan terms that often result in default,foreclosure,and loss of equity.on the other hand,industry representatives point out that lending has extended the benefits of home finance to many who would otherwise have no access to home credit.
ab regulates covered loans defined as home loans of or less in which either the annual percentage interest rate exceeds by eight percentage points or more a benchmark interest rate based on the yield of comparable treasury securities or the total points and fees payable at closing exceed percent of the loan amount,subd.b.
the legislation prohibits the lender from engaging in any of the following acts,among others,when making a covered loan imposing a prepayment penalty applicable after the first three years of the loan,failing to offer the consumer a choice of a loan with no prepayment penalty,or charging an excessive penalty as defined in the statute requiring the borrower to pay monthly payments in advance from loan proceeds including a provision raising the interest rate if the borrower defaults proceeding with the loan if the lender does not reasonably believe the borrower will be able to repay it based on the borrower income,employment status,other financial resources,and monthly debt encouraging the borrower to default on an existing debt to be refinanced by the covered loan including a term allowing the lender to accelerate the indebtedness in circumstances other than borrower fraud or default,or the exercise of a provision refinancing an existing home loan on terms that will not result in an identifiable benefit to the borrower making a loan without providing specified written notice to the consumer at least three business days prior to signing the loan documents stating that the consumer should consider obtaining loan counseling and describing how to obtain a list of counselors financing points and fees exceeding or percent of the loan amount,whichever is greater,subds.a,d,e,f,h,i,j,k.
ab contains an additional restriction applicable to a wider range of home loans than covered loans.the statute defines consumer loans as loans other than reverse mortgages,open lines of credit,bridge loans,or loans secured by rental property or a second home,that are secured by an residence containing up to four residential units,subd.d.no consumer loan,as so defined,may be structured to finance the premiums for any credit life,credit disability,credit property,or credit unemployment insurance,or to finance fees for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement.
the regulatory provisions of ab apply without distinction to both and federally chartered lending institutions.however,liability for a lender noncompliance does not extend to entities that purchase home loans on the secondary market.
the oakland ordinance 
the oakland city council began actively studying the issue of predatory lending in.a proposed ordinance addressing the issue was under consideration by the city council while ab was pending in the legislature.on october,just before ab was signed into law by the governor,the city council adopted an lending ordinance,ordinance,codified at oakland municipal code chapter.simultaneously,the city adopted amendments to its linked banking services ordinance requiring financial institutions to certify substantial compliance with chapter as a condition of receiving deposits of city funds or of participating in any development project or mortgage program.in its capacity as the governing board of the redevelopment agency,the city council also adopted a resolution barring financial institutions from any development project financed by that agency without furnishing a similar certification 
the ordinance regulates two defined categories of loans home loans and home loans.a home loan is defined as any loan other than a reverse mortgage,including a line of credit or an credit plan,that is primarily for personal,family,or household uses secured by oakland real property containing one to four residential units,or residential units of a condominium or cooperative,one of which is or will be the borrower principal dwelling and for a principal amount that does not exceed the current conforming loan amount established by the federal national mortgage association.
home loans are home loans,as so defined,that meet either of the following additional criteria for a first mortgage,an annual percentage rate that is three points or more than a benchmark rate derived from prevailing federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage association fhlm rates and,for junior mortgages,a rate five points higher than the benchmark or total points and fees that are equal to or exceed percent of the loan amount or,whichever is greater.
the ordinance prohibits the lender from engaging in any of the following acts,among others,when making a home loan imposing any prepayment penalty requiring the borrower to pay more than two monthly payments in advance from loan proceeds including a provision raising the interest rate if the borrower defaults proceeding with the loan if the lender does not reasonably believe the borrower will be able to repay it based on the borrower income,employment status,other financial resources,and monthly debt including a term allowing the lender to accelerate the indebtedness in circumstances other than borrower default or the exercise of a provision refinancing an existing home loan or other debt on terms that will not result in a reasonable and tangible net benefit to the borrower making the loan without obtaining written certification from an independent credit counselor that the consumer has contacted the counselor and either received independent counseling about the advisability of the loan transaction or waived the right to counseling refinancing a special mortgage that is or has specified preferential features unless an independent loan counselor has determined that the refinance is in the borrower best interests financing points and fees exceeding or percent of the loan amount,whichever is greater and charging a fee to modify or renew a loan or defer any payment,unless as part of a workout of default.
the ordinance includes the following restrictions applicable to the broader category of home loans the lender may not finance any credit life,credit disability,credit property,or credit unemployment insurance,or any other life or health insurance premiums as part of the loan the lender may not encourage a borrower to default on any debt in connection with a home loan that refinances any part of the borrower debt for loans,prepayment penalties may be charged if they expire after the first months of the loan and do not exceed percent of the total loan amount in the first year,percent in the second year,and percent in the third year and the lender may not make a home loan that violates any provision of the federal truth in lending act tila,as amended by the home ownership and equity protection act of hoepa et,or any applicable provision of the federal real estate settlement procedures act of respa et,or any regulations implementing these statutes.
unlike ab,the regulatory provisions of the ordinance apply only to lending institutions and specifically exclude federally chartered banks,savings and loans,and credit unions.also unlike ab,liability for a lender noncompliance extends to any person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a home loan on the secondary market.
the ordinance provides for civil enforcement and remedies,and declares that any person who willfully violates its provisions is guilty of an infraction.
trial court proceedings 
afsa filed this suit on october,seeking a declaration that the ordinance is preempted by state law,as well as an injunction against its enforcement.afsa moved for a preliminary injunction that the trial court denied by order entered on december.afsa timely appealed from the order denying its motion for an injunction appeal no.
the parties then filed for summary judgment.on june,the trial court entered an order finding that the ordinance was preempted to the extent that it exempted federally chartered lending institutions from its restrictions.the court held that the sentence exempting such institutions should be severed from the ordinance so that its provisions could be enforced against both state and federally chartered lenders subject to elimination of the federal exemption,the trial court denied afsa summary judgment motion and granted the city.judgment was entered severing the sentence exempting federal lenders,dismissing afsa complaint,and deeming the ordinance valid as modified.
afsa timely appealed from the judgment appeal no.the city from the judgment in appeal no.we ordered the appeals and consolidated for argument and decision.
discussion 
on the grounds detailed below,we find that the ordinance is neither preempted under civil code section to the extent that it exempts federally chartered financial institutions,nor is it invalidated in whole or in part by ab under any other theory of preemption.we begin with an overview of state preemption law.
applicable preemption law 
the general principles governing state law preemption were well summarized in city of los angeles cal th,d,under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith.citation.similarly,local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.citation.finally,local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area citation,or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality citations,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
it bears emphasis that a city police powers under article xi,section of the california constitution are as broad as the police power exercisable by the legislature itself.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.if the legislature has the power to regulate a certain area,municipalities have the power to regulate that same area.california rifle pistol city of west hollywood th,d california rifle.the issue is not whether oakland is constitutionally authorized to regulate predatory lending practices within its borders,but whether the legislature has acted to remove that power from oakland.id.at,d.
because oakland is a charter city,the home rule doctrine may also come into play.article xi,section of the california constitution reserves to charter cities the right to adopt and enforce ordinances that conflict with general state laws,provided the subject of the regulation is a municipal affair rather than one of statewide concern.johnson bradley cal th,d,horton city of oakland th,d.in analyzing whether an ordinance adopted by a charter city is preempted,we apply a procedure first,a court must determine whether there is a genuine conflict between a state statute and a municipal ordinance.citations.only after concluding there is an actual conflict should a court proceed with the second question,does the local legislation impact a municipal or statewide concern citation.in other words,the preemption question begins with an inquiry into the existence of a conflict.if there is no conflict,the home rule doctrine is not brought into play.horton city of oakland,supra,th at,d.because,as discussed below,we find no conflict between ab and the oakland ordinance,we do not reach the issue of whether the ordinance impacts a municipal or statewide concern.
afsa contends the ordinance conflicts with state law because it contains multiple provisions that contradict and duplicate state law,and because the ordinance trespasses into fields of regulation that the state has impliedly fully occupied.afsa further contends that even assuming the trial court was correct in finding only one portion of the ordinance sentence exempting federal court remedy of severing that provision is not permissible and can not save the ordinance.
contradiction preemption 
according to afsa,the ordinance contradicts and is inimical to state law in the following four areas exempting federally chartered lending institutions partially banning prepayment penalties making secondary market loan assignees liable for violations making loan counseling mandatory.
legal standard 
the parties cite apparently conflicting standards for determining when a local ordinance is inimical to a state statute.according to afsa,an ordinance is inimical to state law when it prohibits conduct state law authorizes or imposes stricter standards and makes impermissible that which state law has allowed.for this proposition,afsa cites great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,d,great western shows at,d,and this court decision in suter city of lafayette th,d suter at,d.
afsa reliance on these cases is misplaced.both cases in fact apply a much more stringent test for contradiction preemption than afsa advocates.in great western shows,the california supreme court upheld a los angeles county ordinance prohibiting the sale of firearms on county property against a preemption challenge even though state law permitted the type of sale barred by the ordinance.great western shows,supra,cal th at,d.the test applied in great western shows was whether the ordinance mandated what state law expressly forbids or forbids what state law expressly mandates.the mere fact that a local ordinance prohibits conduct that is not prohibited by state law is insufficient to establish that the ordinance is inimical to or contradicts state law under great western shows.id.at,d.
this court decision in suter also does not advance afsa position.in suter,we considered the effect of a state law that required gun dealers to store their firearms in a secure fashion by one of three specified means.suter,supra,th at,d.a gun dealer subject to the state law challenged a local ordinance requiring dealers to employ two of the specified methods in combination.id.at,d.we found no contradiction between state law and the local ordinance because it was perfectly possible to comply with both by complying with the more stringent local ordinance.id.at,d.since the state law did not expressly prohibit local regulation of the conduct,such regulation did not contradict state law merely because it imposed stricter requirements.ibid.
afsa proposed test for contradiction preemption,that the local ordinance imposes stricter requirements than state regulation of the same conduct,is incompatible with settled case law.see,in re iverson cal,stricter local regulation on sale of alcohol nat.milk.city of cal d,stricter local regulation of milk processing in re hoffman cal,enhanced local standards for milk contents sternall strand d,stricter local prohibition on gambling ex parte daniels cal,noting that if the legislature merely fixed a maximum speed limit for vehicles,and did not expressly prohibit lower limits,an ordinance setting a lower limit would not be in conflict.
thus,the standard we apply in this case is that there is no contradiction between the local ordinance and state law unless the ordinance mandates what state law expressly forbids or forbids what state law expressly mandates.great western shows,supra,cal th at,d.
exemption for federal lenders 
the trial court agreed with afsa that the ordinance exemption for federal lending institutions was inimical to the state law,as set forth in civil code section the trial court relied on portions of the statement of legislative intent found in subdivision a of the state statute,declaring that local regulatory guidelines must promote continued parity between the state and federal levels in order to avoid creation of discriminatory burdens upon state institutions and to protect interests held by california citizens and that the intent of the statute was to eliminate past and prevent future inequities between state and federal financial institutions doing business in california by creating a sensitive and responsive mortgage parity procedure.based on these provisions,the trial court suggested that the ordinance promotes conduct,namely disparate treatment of state and federal lenders,that section forbids.
we do not concur with the trial court expansive reading of civil code section,or with its finding that the ordinance is inimical to the state statute.when all parts of the state statute are read together,including both its statement of intent and its operative provisions,it becomes clear that the primary objective of the legislation was to create a speedier mechanism for the state to respond to changes in federal it chose adopting conforming changes in the regulation of state lenders.it is evident from its preamble that section was enacted at a time when congress and federal agencies were active in reforming the regulation of federally chartered lenders.in that environment,to avoid stranding state lenders under discriminatory burdens pending action by the state legislature,subdivisions b,c,and e grant the secretary of business,transportation and housing the blanket authority to respond quickly to changes in federal regulations by adopting equivalent state regulations on a temporary basis until the legislature had time to act.
it is not clear that civil code section places a mandatory duty to maintain parity on any state agency,much less on local agencies.amicus california bankers association cba takes the position that subdivision c compels the secretary to automatically adopt conforming changes within days following every change in federal lending regulations.although subdivision c states that the secretary shall adopt such regulations within days,the phrase such regulations refers back to subdivision b,which merely states that the secretary has the authority,not the duty,to adopt conforming regulations in response to federal initiatives.thus it is not clear whether the words shall adopt in subdivision c require the secretary to adopt state regulations conforming to every change in federal law,or merely require the agency,if it elects to exercise its authority under subdivision b,to do so within days.however,even under cba interpretation,the choice whether to follow the federal government lead is ultimately left to the legislature.subdivision e specifies that any parity regulations adopted by the state agency automatically expire after two years unless the legislature votes to make them permanent.thus,although subdivision a certainly reflects a legislative view that competitive parity between state and federal regulations is generally desirable as a matter of public policy,the statute stops far short of mandating absolute parity under all circumstances.
more importantly,we find no indication that in adopting civil code section the legislature intended to limit the power of local governments to adopt lending regulations.the statute addresses how the state should respond to federal actions jeopardizing competitive parity.the procedural solution it adopted was to expand the rulemaking powers of a state agency,not to limit any rulemaking power of local legislative bodies.on the subject of local legislation,the statute was entirely silent.no preemptive intent can reasonably be imputed to the legislature passing reference to l ocal regulatory guidelines in subdivision a.viewed in the context of the statute as a whole and of the problem it was meant to solve,the word local is used in that sentence merely to contrast california state guidelines with federal regulations that are promulgated outside of california.in fact,there is no suggestion in the record that any local jurisdiction sought to or did regulate mortgage lending practices at the time of section passage.
thus,we are unpersuaded that civil code section forbids local lending regulations that apply only to lenders.because we find that the clause of the ordinance exempting federal lenders was not preempted by state law,we do not reach the issue of whether severance of this clause was an appropriate remedy.
other contradiction claims 
afsa asserts that the following are additional contradictions between the ordinance and state law the ordinance prohibition on prepayment penalties in the case of home loans conflicts with financial code section,subdivision a,which allows prepayment penalties during the first three years of a covered loan subject to a specified ceiling the ordinance limitation and percentage restrictions on the amount of prepayment charges allowable for loans conflict with civil code section,subdivision b section of the ordinance,subjecting any assignee to all claims,actions,and defenses that could be asserted against the original lender,conflicts with ab exemption from liability of holders in due course and the ordinance requirement that borrowers contact an independent loan counselor before closing a home loan conflicts with ab which merely requires the lender to notify the borrower to consider obtaining loan counseling.
we do not find any of the cited provisions of the ordinance to be inimical to state law.none of these provisions penalizes conduct that state law mandates or expressly authorizes.although state law does not prohibit prepayment charges in circumstances where the ordinance either does prohibit such penalties or sets lower limits on their amount,there is no express language in state law mandating such charges or protecting them from further restriction or interference by local jurisdictions.since a lender can easily comply with the ordinance and state law by not charging prepayment penalties on home loans,not imposing penalties after the first three years,and limiting its charges based on the formula set forth in the ordinance,there is no contradiction.see suter,supra,th at,d.
likewise,ab exemption of holders in due course is not a blanket immunity from all possible liability under state and local law.it provides only that t he provisions of this division shall not impose liability on an assignee that is a holder in due course,emphasis added.it says nothing about the power of local legislative bodies to impose liability on holders in due course for violating local regulations.
finally,the loan counseling provisions do not conflict.the ordinance does not require borrowers to obtain independent loan counseling unless the new loan would replace a special mortgage with preferential terms.oak,a in most cases,it merely requires the lender to obtain a counselor certificate that the borrower has either waived independent advice or received it.a lender can comply with the ordinance and state law by not proceeding with any loan in oakland unless it has provided the notice required by state law and obtained the certificate required by the ordinance.there is no conflict between these requirements,both of which are intended to promote the use of independent loan counseling in the lending market 
accordingly,we find that the ordinance is not inimical to state law.
duplication preemption 
an ordinance may be preempted by state law if it is duplicative of state law,it criminalizes precisely the same acts which are prohibited by statute.great western shows,supra,cal th at,d,quoting pipoly benson cal d.a local ordinance is duplicative of general law if it is coextensive therewith in scope and substance,supra,cal th,d.the reason for the rule that provisions of a local ordinance are deemed to be preempted if they duplicate state law is that a conviction under the ordinance will operate to bar prosecution under state law for the same offense people orozco d,fn,thus setting up a conflict of jurisdiction.pipoly benson,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the application of preemption by duplication has been largely confined to penal ordinances.baldwin county of tehama th,d.
in this case,the predominant enforcement mechanisms under both ab and the ordinance are civil liabilities and administrative penalties,not criminal prosecution,oak.however,ab provides that certain violations by a licensed person may be deemed violations of the licensing law applicable to that person.knowing and willful violations of certain lender licensing laws are punishable as misdemeanors.bus,real estate licensing law,savings associations,credit unions,industrial loan companies,finance lenders,residential mortgage lenders.willful violations of the ordinance are punishable as infractions.thus,if we assume for the sake of analysis that any provisions of the ordinance do precisely duplicate state law,there is at least a theoretical possibility of conflicting prosecutions against the same lender for violating state and local law.however,criminal enforcement is so tangential to both ab and the ordinance that the realistic potential for any such conflict to materialize,much less to compromise either jurisdiction power to enforce its laws,is practically nil.
afsa contends the following prohibitions in the ordinance duplicate provisions of state law,including ab including terms requiring advance payments to be made from loan proceeds including terms raising the borrower interest rate upon default including a provision allowing the lender to unilaterally accelerate indebtedness financing points and fees above specified limits recommending default on an existing loan lending without a reasonable belief in the borrower ability to repay lending without an identifiable benefit to the consumer financing credit insurance premiums out of the loan and making a home loan that violates specified federal lending laws and regulations.
as to provisions through,it is undeniable that the prohibitory language in the ordinance is quite similar,although not substantively identical,to that in ab.however,the scope of the loan transactions to which these prohibitions apply is not the same.the ordinance provisions apply to home loans or to home loans in provision whereas the state law provisions apply in each case to covered loans.covered loans charge significantly higher interest premiums over market rates charge higher fees compared to home loans or home loans as defined in the ordinance.
relying primarily on cohen board of supervisors cal d,cohen,afsa contends that such differences in the scope of the loans covered by the two enactments do not affect the preemption analysis.cohen involved a preemption challenge to a local ordinance requiring permits for escort services.id.at.the ordinance also included a provision prohibiting an escort from engaging in any type of criminal conduct,as defined by state law,with the escort service customer.id.at.although it upheld the permitting provisions of the ordinance,the supreme court found the criminal conduct provision to be preempted on the ground that it unquestionably duplicates state criminal law insofar as it applies to escorts.ibid.thus,according to afsa,cohen teaches that a difference in scope between state law and an otherwise duplicative local ordinance will not save the latter from preemption.
we find cohen distinguishable.the escort service provision at issue in cohen incorporated the state criminal law by reference.there could be no question that it precisely duplicated state law,and that double jeopardy principles would be implicated by successive prosecutions under the escort ordinance and state law.see people sipe th,d double jeopardy applies to overlapping offenses unless each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.moreover,because the overlapping provisions of local and state law at issue in cohen were penal in nature,the risk of conflicting jurisdiction was real rather than,as in this case,remote at best.
most importantly,the ordinance and ab do not prohibit precisely the same acts and conduct.taking but one example for illustrative purposes,the ordinance states that n o lender may make a high cost home loan that includes any provision increasing the interest rate after default or delinquency.oak,h,emphasis added.ab states that a covered loan shall not contain a provision that increases the interest rate as a result of a default,subd.e,emphasis added.to prosecute a lender for violating section h,the city would have to prove several facts not required in order to prove violation of financial code section,subdivision e the benchmark interest rate set by prevailing fnma and fhlm rates at the time of the loan that the loan interest rate exceeded the benchmark rate by the required number of percentage points that the loan amount did not exceed the conforming first mortgage loan size limit for dwellings set by fnma and that the lender was.oak,equally,to prosecute under financial code section,subdivision e,the state would have to prove facts not required to be proven under the ordinance that the original principal balance of the loan does not exceed as periodically adjusted for inflation the benchmark yield on treasury securities of comparable maturities and that the annual percentage rate exceeds the benchmark rate by percentage points.thus,although the local and state provisions overlap,they are not coextensive under principles or preemption analysis 
other substantive differences distinguish the ordinance from state law as well.ab bars terms consolidating monthly payments to be paid in advance from loan proceeds whereas the ordinance bars consolidation and prepayment of more than two such payments.ab permits acceleration of the loan due to fraud or material misrepresentation while the ordinance contains no express exemption in such circumstances.ab limits the financing of points and fees to the greater of or percent of the loan amount while the ordinance sets a limit of the greater of or percent of the loan amount.ab establishes one set of presumption rules for determining whether the lender reasonably believes the borrower can repay and the ordinance establishes a different set of rules.ab creates a standard for determining whether a covered refinance loan is beneficial to the borrower while the ordinance creates a presumption of benefit if specified financial results are obtained by the refinance.in these and the other respects described above,provisions through of the ordinance are not coextensive with state law in scope and substance,and are not preempted,supra,cal th at,d.
afsa further claims that the ordinance prohibition on the financing of credit insurance is duplicative of financial code section.we disagree.the ordinance prohibition applies to lenders making home loans as defined in the ordinance the state law prohibition applies to any lender who makes a consumer loan as defined in financial code section.the definitions of home loan and consumer loan differ in several respects the principal amount of a home loan can not exceed the prevailing maximum amount for a conforming first mortgage home loan set by fnma a consumer loan is not limited in amount a home loan must be secured by real property located within the city of oakland a consumer loan can be secured by property located anywhere in the state a home loan can be secured by an condominium or cooperative unit a consumer loan can not a home loan includes lines of credit a consumer loan excludes these types of loans a home loan includes construction loans a consumer loan does not,subd.d.further,the ordinance prohibits financing of any life or health insurance premiums whereas ab prohibition is limited to the financing of premiums for various forms of credit insurance.oak,b.based on these differences,we find that the local and state prohibitions on financing credit insurance are not duplicative because they do not criminalize precisely the same acts.great western shows,supra,cal th at,d.
finally,afsa claims the ordinance duplicates state law by declaring that a home loan violating certain federal lending laws also violates the ordinance.see oak,afsa cites financial code section and business and professions code section as the duplicated state law provisions we find no impermissible duplication as to section.many types of lenders covered by the oakland ordinance are exempt from the provisions of the crmla.see,subd.g.for those lenders subject to both enactments,violation of respa would not subject the lender to criminal prosecution under state law and therefore implicates no double jeopardy concern.see,nothing in section and other penalty provisions of crmla authorizes criminal prosecution for violation of civil statutes incorporated by reference into crmla.
we are also not persuaded that the city attempt to provide additional remedies for violations of federal law is preempted because business and professions code section also provides remedies for the same conduct.in fact,the essence of section is to borrow violations of other laws and treat them as independently actionable.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d.the unfair business practices statute encompasses any practices forbidden by law,be it civil or criminal,federal,state,or municipal,statutory,regulatory,or.saunders superior court th,d.were we to disallow the city ordinance on the ground that section provides a duplicative remedy for its violation,the same logic would require preemption of all local ordinances regulating business because state law supplies an additional remedy for their violation.we decline to lend such sweeping effect to a statute plainly designed to supplement,not displace,local law.moreover,no criminal penalties are associated with section.see people toomey d.the rationale for preemption by duplication has no application here.
accordingly,we find that none of the ordinance provisions impermissibly duplicates state law.
implied preemption 
afsa contends that the ordinance is impliedly preempted by state law in addressing this issue,we are concerned solely with the legislature intent regarding preemption.this court view of whether it is good public policy to permit localities to adopt their own regulations in a particular subject area is wholly immaterial whether to preempt or not to preempt is a decision for the legislature,not for the courts the courts can not properly base decisions about preemptive intent upon subjective opinions of the legislature reasons.instead,the courts must simply determine whether the legislature did or did not intend to preempt.the reasons which might motivate one decision or the other are matters within the exclusive province of the legislature.california rifle,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
implied preemption may properly be found,moreover,only when the circumstances clearly indicate a legislative intent to preempt.horton city of oakland,supra,th at,d.the courts are reluctant to imply preemption because,if the legislature intended to take preemptive action,it would have been easy to include an express preemption clause in the legislation.california rifle,supra,th at,d.when,in addition,there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another,courts must be especially hesitant to imply an intent to preempt.fisher city of berkeley cal d.
the case law instructs us to organize our analysis of legislative intent around the following criteria the extent to which the field of regulation is occupied by state law whether state if not fully occupying the expressed in terms that clearly indicate a paramount state concern and whether the adverse effect of a local ordinance on transient state citizens outweighs any benefit to the locality,supra,cal th at,d.
afsa argues that,within the broad subject area of home loan regulation,ab fully occupies nearly every field,narrowly defined,that the ordinance touches upon.thus,ab fully occupies the fields of prepayment penalties,credit counseling,points and fees,to the exclusion of local regulation.according to afsa,the legislature has weighed the pros and cons of,prepayment penalties,and has decided when to allow them and in what amounts.the legislature having addressed that issue,afsa maintains,a city such as oakland may not reweigh the policy arguments and strike a different balance.
declaring that the city may not strike a different balance from the legislature begs the question of preemption.the oakland city council heard evidence,received staff reports,and made findings that predatory lending practices were having a particularly severe impact in oakland,causing conditions of blight,the loss of affordable housing,increase d displacement and economic dislocation,among other ills.the council found that oakland residents were prime targets for predatory practices due to the city relatively high property values and large population of and minority homeowners.it received evidence that loan counseling,which is not required by ab,would be the single most effective means of protecting oakland residents from such practices.absent preemption,it is proper and even necessary for municipalities to add to state regulations provisions adapted to their special requirements.cohen,supra,cal d at,quoting in re hoffman,supra,cal.thus,unless the legislature revoked its power to do so,oakland was free to fashion its own policies on predatory lending even if the legislature opted to strike a different balance 
we are thus left with the question of whether in enacting ab the legislature expressly or impliedly intended to set statewide minimum standards or statewide uniform standards for the home loan market.
in order to decide whether the legislature has impliedly preempted a field,we must first define the field,supra,cal th at,d.although our discretion is broad,the field must be defined to embrace subjects of legislation that are sufficiently that a court or local legislative body can detect a cohesive approach to the subject.galvan superior court cal d.we find the appropriate field in this case to be the regulation of abusive practices in the,home lending market.the core of ab is to describe prohibited provisions and acts for covered loans,a term defined in the legislation to reach only loans charging atypically high interest rates or fees.afsa itself characterizes ab as a bill addressing predatory lending,which is the term critics apply to certain practices in the lending market.on the other hand,classifying each separate type of loan term mentioned in financial code section as if it stood alone as a field of regulation ignores the logical connection between these practices,that all are associated with lending.
unquestionably,ab marks legislative entrance into the field of regulating lending practices.it can hardly be maintained that this area has been left untouched by the legislature.the issue is whether the legislature has so fully and completely covered this field as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.the legislation itself can not resolve this issue.it contains no expression of a legislative intent to preempt,nor does it contain language expressly permitting local ordinances on the same subject.the legislature remained silent on preemption,and we are left to discern from the circumstances surrounding the passage of ab what,if anything,that silence means.
the issue of preemption was by no means overlooked in the legislative deliberations on ab.as afsa itself points out,there were strongly held disagreements over preemption between industry representatives and consumer proponents of the bill.the legislature was made aware that at least one charter city had proceeded with its own legislation on the subject.at a state senate policy committee hearing on ab,held two weeks before its final passage,the committee members heard testimony in support of ab from the president of the oakland city council,ignacio de la fuente.councilmember de la fuente informed the committee that the city had proceeded with its own predatory lending ordinance after waiting two years to see if federal or state legislation would emerge on the subject.
in response to de la fuente testimony,a member of the committee expressed concern that if the bill was silent about preemption we could have a host of different policies from community to community based upon a city determination.in response,ab legislative author explained the bill silence on preemption in these terms we trying to make sure that everyone can live with the bill,industry and consumers alike and we decided to be silent on preemption,which does lend different interpretations.several industry witnesses expressing opposition to the bill emphasized that the absence of a preemption clause was an important concern to them.
at the time of the bill passage,legislators also had before them an opinion about the bill preemptive force by legislative counsel.legislative counsel opined that if is enacted,a local government ordinance to regulate lending would not be preempted by state law to the extent that the ordinance does not duplicate,contradict,or enter an area fully occupied by or another state law.the opinion also pointed out that ab contained no express preemption of local legislation,unlike many other state statutes that the opinion enumerated.
thus,if the legislature intended ab to have preemptive effect,several factors would have impelled it to include an express preemption clause in the bill its knowledge that local legislation on the subject of predatory lending was actually forthcoming its legislative counsel opinion that ab would very likely not preempt local regulation absent such a clause and the affected industry vocal preference for preemptive,statewide legislation.from the legislature silence in these circumstances,we can only infer that no bill expressing an intent to preempt local regulation would have commanded the votes for passage and,therefore,no such intent may be imputed to the legislature in adopting ab 
afsa concedes that ab would not have been passed had it contained an express preemption clause,but argues that the legislative history shows,equally,that no bill with an express authorization for local regulation could have passed either.from this,afsa concludes that the legislature silence weighs neither for nor against preemption.based on the circumstances surrounding the legislature consideration of ab,we can not agree with this proposition.
the legislature must be charged with knowing that its silence on preemption would open the door to local legislation on this subject.the legislature own counsel advised it that a valid local ordinance could be developed to regulate some aspects of lending.legislative counsel further noted that because such an ordinance would primarily affect local property owners and would have virtually no effect on,prevailing case law would favor local regulation.
this advice was consistent with prevailing legal precedents with which the legislature must also be presumed to be familiar.bishop city of san jose cal d.first,no case holds that a home rule city like oakland needs express legislative permission to enter into a field of regulation.cal,art.xi,home rule cites may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs people smith,d supp,revd.on federal grounds in smith california,d city needs no legislative permission to exercise local power.to the contrary,as noted earlier,when the legislature is silent on preemption,courts presume there is no intent to preempt.california rifle,supra,th at,d.second,as many cases have held,the validity of local regulation is presumed when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.gluck county of los angeles d.afsa makes no claim that all areas of the state are identically situated with respect to the prevalence and perceived impact of abusive lending practices.
under these circumstances we can not impute to the legislature an intent to preempt local legislation in the field of regulating lending practices.had the legislature intended to displace local regulations on this subject,it would certainly have included an express preemption clause in the legislation.we therefore conclude that the legislature did not intend to occupy the field,either fully or partially,so as to make it exclusively a matter of state concern.
there is also no basis for finding that local regulation of predatory lending would so adversely affect the transient citizens of the state that an intent to preempt may otherwise be inferred.afsa conceded this point in the trial court.the ordinance has no appreciable effect on citizens of the state who are not residents of oakland.it only applies to loans secured by real property located in oakland.
we therefore reverse the judgment insofar as it orders severance of the language exempting federally chartered lenders from its coverage and we dismiss as moot afsa appeal from the trial court order denying a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance appeal no.

the home loan interest rate and fee thresholds are both lower than the threshold levels for covered loans set by ab.as to home loans secured by oakland real property,it is undisputed that the loan provisions of the ordinance would apply to all home loans falling under the covered loan provisions of the state statute,and also reach some loans that do not come under the state law provisions.
under the ordinance,if the borrower ratio exceeds percent,the lender must justify its decision to approve the loan in a written statement provided to the borrower setting forth specific compensating factors justifying approval of the loan.oak,in contrast,under ab,a borrower is presumed able to repay if the borrower ratio does not exceed percent,but no presumption of inability to pay and no obligation to provide a written justification arises if the ratio
