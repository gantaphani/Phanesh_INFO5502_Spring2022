plaintiff larketta randolph filed this putative class action against defendants green tree financial and green tree financial collectively,green tree for alleged violations of the truth in lending act,et tila and the equal credit opportunity act,et ecoa.the district court ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration and dismissed the action with prejudice.in our prior opinion,randolph green tree financial,cir,we held that the arbitration agreement in this case defeated the remedial purposes of tila and was unenforceable because of the potentially high costs to randolph of pursuing arbitration.the supreme court reversed that holding in green tree financial randolph,d.
in doing so,the supreme court explicitly decline d to reach randolph argument that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable on the alternative ground that the agreement precludes randolph from bringing her claims under the tila as a class action,because we had not passed on that question.id.at.in a separate opinion four justices noted that issue had been properly raised in the district court and in this court,and observed that the supreme court majority opinion does not preclude us from deciding that issue on remand.id.at ginsburg,joined by stevens,souter,and breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part.we have received supplemental briefing on that issue,but before addressing it we must deal with a threshold issue randolph raises.
classwide arbitration 
randolph position in this remand is.first,she maintains she should be permitted to pursue the classwide relief she seeks in the arbitration proceeding itself which,of course,would moot the question of whether her inability to do so renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable.randolph maintains that classwide arbitration is not foreclosed by the language of the arbitration provision in her contract with green tree,and argues that reading a classwide remedy into the agreement would reconcile the federal arbitration act faa,et,goal of enforcing arbitration agreements with tila scheme of using private class actions as one way to enforce that statute.
the arbitration agreement itself which is set out in full as appendix a to this opinion is silent about whether randolph may pursue classwide relief in the arbitration proceeding.randolph argues that silence equates with permission instead of preclusion,that the faa itself does not forbid classwide arbitration,and that construing the arbitration agreement to authorize classwide relief will avoid unnecessary tension between the faa and tila.for authority randolph points to decisions of state courts in california and pennsylvania permitting classwide arbitration.see,keating superior court,alameda county,d.dickler shearson lehman hutton.
on the other hand,the two federal courts that have addressed this issue have held that classwide arbitration is available only if that remedy is expressly provided for in the parties arbitration agreement.see,champ siegel trading,cir s ection of the faa forbids federal judges from ordering class arbitration where the parties arbitration agreement is silent on the matter.gammaro thorp consumer discount,refusing to order classwide arbitration of tila claims where the arbitration agreement makes no provision for class treatment of disputes footnote omitted.we have not yet spoken to the precise issue,but in protective life insurance lincoln national life insurance,cir,we held that arbitrations may be consolidated only when the arbitration agreement so provides.the reasoning of our protective life decision may dictate that we join the seventh circuit and the district court of minnesota in holding that classwide relief may not be insisted upon in an arbitration proceeding if the agreement is silent on the subject of that type of remedy.or maybe not.we have no occasion to decide that today,because randolph did not properly preserve the issue of whether classwide relief is available in the arbitration proceeding itself.
randolph initially took the position that the availability of classwide arbitration was an open question in this circuit,but the district court held that our decision in protective life ruled out classwide arbitration and that,as a result,compelling arbitration in this instance will eliminate plaintiff ability to arbitrate her claims on behalf of a class.randolph apparently found that holding to her strategic liking and came to embrace it.instead of urging us to reject that holding,randolph first brief on appeal assured us that t here is no provision in the green tree contract for a class or consolidation of actions,and told us that the right to bring a class action can not be duplicated in arbitration.having saddled up that horse,randolph must continue riding it.
recently,in another remand from the supreme court,we declined to consider an issue that was not raised by the appellant when he was before us initially,citing the rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.united states ardley,cir.see also hartsfield lemacks,cir we note that issues that clearly are not designated in the initial brief ordinarily are considered abandoned.marks and citation omitted.a supplemental brief after remand from the supreme court is not a proper place for switching positions and resurrecting arguments abandoned earlier.we will decide what remains of this case based upon the district court previously unchallenged holding,and randolph position,that the arbitration agreement precludes any type of classwide relief in the arbitration proceeding.
enforceability of arbitration provisions precluding class action remedies for tila claims 
that brings us to randolph second position,which is that because the agreement she signed does not permit classwide arbitration,it is unenforceable.the issue is whether an arbitration agreement that bars pursuit of classwide relief for tila violations is unenforceable for that reason.the two principal decisions bearing upon this issue are gilmer lane,d,and bowen first family financial,cir.
in gilmer,the supreme court set out the standards for determining whether a federal statutory claim is subject to arbitration.the court stated that i t is now clear that statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement,enforceable pursuant to the faa,and went on to instruct us that 
although all statutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration,h aving made the bargain to arbitrate,the party should be held to it unless congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.if such an intention exists,it will be discoverable in the text of the statute,its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.
gilmer,at.at citations omitted.the gilmer court also held that the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show that congress intended to prevent waiver of a judicial forum in favor of an arbitral forum for the statutory claims.id.the court explained that an inherent conflict between the policies underlying a federal statute and the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate claims under that statute does not exist simply because the statute is designed not only to address individual grievances,but also to further important social policies because so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.id.at.at marks and citations omitted.
in light of those gilmer standards,we addressed in bowen the issue of whether the text of tila and its legislative history,or an inherent conflict between tila and the faa,would render an arbitration clause unenforceable,and we concluded that they did not.at.bowen involved claims made under ecoa,et,a necessary premise of which was the proposition that the tila grants consumers a right to litigate,individually and through a class action,any claims arising under the statute.id.at.in deciding whether tila created such a right,we considered the plaintiffs arguments about the role of class acti
