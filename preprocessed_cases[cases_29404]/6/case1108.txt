in this appeal,the acquirer of savings and loans associations also known as thrifts seeks damages from the united states for the latter breach of agreements permitting the acquired thrifts to treat as capital,for regulatory purposes,an item known as supervisory goodwill,and to amortize that asset over a substantial period.the court of federal claims found that the parties had entered into agreements regarding such treatment of supervisory goodwill and that the government had breached those agreements.granite mgmt.united states.the court then granted summary judgment for the government on damages,rejecting all the theories upon which the acquirer based its damage claims.granite mgmt.united states.damages op.
with one exception,we affirm the trial court rejection of those damage claims.we hold that the court of federal claims improperly granted summary judgment for the government on the claim that the acquirer could have sold the acquired thrifts for a higher price if the thrifts had been allowed to continue treating their supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital.we conclude that further development of the facts on that issue is necessary,and therefore we remand to the court of federal claims for that purpose.
a.the history and circumstances surrounding the savings and loan industry crisis during the late and early have been extensively discussed in opinions of the supreme court and this court.see united states winstar,d winstar united states,en banc see also,fifth third bank of ohio united states,home sav.of,fsb united states,glendale fed.bank,fsb united states.
during those years,more than thrifts failed and many others reached the brink of insolvency.to deal with the crisis,federal regulators encouraged healthy financial institutions and outside investors to purchase troubled thrifts.the regulators offered various financial incentives to thrift acquirers,including cash contributions from the government and favorable accounting treatment of an intangible asset known as supervisory goodwill,which reflected the amount by which the assumed liabilities of the acquired thrifts exceeded the value of the acquired assets.typically,the acquirers were permitted to include supervisory goodwill in the thrift reserve capital requirements and to amortize that asset over many years.
in response to continued financial problems in the savings and loan industry,congress in enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.firrea.that act,among other things,barred the thrifts use of supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital.as a result,many thrifts no longer complied with federal regulatory capital requirements a number of them became insolvent and were seized by regulatory authorities.
thrift acquirers filed lawsuits alleging that by enacting and enforcing firrea,and thus eliminating use of supervisory goodwill as a regulatory asset,the government had breached its contracts with the acquirers.in united states winstar,d,the supreme court affirmed this court en banc determination that firrea had that effect,and that the government was liable in damages for breach of contract.since winstar,this court has decided numerous cases.
b.the following underlying facts in this case are undisputed.in,the appellant granite management corporation granite then known as first nationwide financial corporation acquired four thrifts in three separate transactions,one transaction each in ohio state savings loan company and citizens home savings company,missouri louis federal savings loan association,and kentucky lincoln federal savings loan.the institutions were combined into a single thrift called first nationwide bank that was run by granite and its parent company,ford motor company ford.as a result of the acquisitions,granite also obtained branching rights that permitted that bank to expand from its california base into ten new states where the acquired thrifts were operating,some years before deregulation allowed competitors to enter interstate banking.
the government made a direct cash contribution of million to first nationwide capital.under assistance agreements by which the government authorized the three transactions,granite was permitted to treat nearly million as supervisory goodwill and to amortize that asset over years.the parties dispute the amount of the unamortized balance remaining in,when firrea was enacted.according to granite,the unamortized balance was approximately million.damages op.at.
by,first nationwide had become severely undercapitalized.in order to bring the bank into compliance with regulatory requirements,its parent,ford,provided it with million in additional capital.in,ford and granite sold first nationwide bank.
in,granite filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking damages for the government alleged breach of contract and related claims.in,the trial court granted granite motion for partial summary judgment on liability.the court ruled that the government had entered into contracts with granite covering the three transactions by which granite acquired the failing thrifts that the contracts authorized granite to treat supervisory goodwill as part of its regulatory capital and to amortize it over years and that the government,by enacting firrea,breached these contracts.liab.op.at.
granite then presented several alternative theories for determining damages,under which it would recover between million and million.damages op.at.first,granite sought its costs of administering and operating the acquired cost of performance under both reliance and restitution theories.second,granite contended that by acquiring the thrifts,it conferred a benefit on the government,and claimed the value of that benefit.third,granite sought the lost value of the supervisory goodwill it lost under firrea.granite proposed three bases for those lost value damages granite estimated cost of replacing the lost regulatory capital the cost of ford million capital infusion,which granite contends was required to replace the lost goodwill and the difference between the price at which first nationwide bank was sold and the higher price granite contends it could have obtained if first nationwide had included the supervisory goodwill.damages op.at.
the court of federal claims granted the government motion for summary judgment on damages.it rejected all of granite damages theories,several of which,it held,this court had previously denied in other cases.
in its brief as appellee,the government challenges the court of federal claims ruling that the government entered into a contract with granite regarding the ohio transaction under which granite acquired two thrifts,state savings and citizens home.citing two of our prior decisions,the government argues that as in those cases,it here made no contractual promise concerning a amortization period in connection with the state transaction and therefore committed no breach with respect to that transaction.because the government did not on that issue,it can not now raise it.
an appellee may rely upon any ground supported by the record for affirmance of the judgment,whether or not the lower court relied on that ground.if,however,the appellee seeks to change or modify the judgment rather than just affirm it,the appellee must file a.radio steel mtd,stating that a party will not be permitted to argue before us an issue on which it has lost and on which it has not appealed,where the result of acceptance of its argument would be a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance see also el paso natural gas neztsosie,d.
in the present case,in which the government did not file a,the government argument is not made as an alternative ground for affirmance of the judgment.to the contrary,the government is seeking to modify or change the judgment of the trial court.this is shown by the conclusion of the government brief,which states 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the trial court should be reversed with respect to the statewide home agreement and affirmed upon all other grounds concerning damages.
ordinarily,a ruling that the appellee can not seek a change in the judgment is made in circumstances where it is clear that the appellee could have.the present case presents a more complex situation in that the government effectively lost on the issue of liability for breach of contract,but ultimately prevailed on the issue of contract damages,making it less clear that the government could have from the final judgment.however,the facts do not warrant a different conclusion on this issue.
the trial court earlier liability order,which the government as appellee seeks to change,was not a final judgment and the government could not have directly appealed it.if the government had attempted to appeal from the final judgment insofar as that judgment incorporated the earlier liability order involving the ohio transaction,the government would have been faced with the problem that ordinarily a litigant can not appeal from a judgment in his favor.under the peculiar circumstances of this case,where the government challenges only part of the earlier order granting partial summary judgment,it might have been able to appeal.see glaros robertson,stating that grant of partial summary judgment from which no immediate appeal lies is merged into the final judgment and reviewable on appeal from that judgment,cited with approval in fifth third bank,at.the government also could have made its argument as an alternative ground for affirmance of the final judgment without seeking a modification of it.
in ef operating am,cir,the third circuit dealt with a similar situation.in that damages suit,the defendant,flaherty,moved for summary judgment,and also moved to dismiss the plaintiff complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court granted flaherty summary judgment motion,and,without explicitly ruling on flaherty personal jurisdiction motion,it ruled in favor of another defendant that had raised the same jurisdictional issue.the logical conclusion was that the district court decided against flaherty on the jurisdictional issue.id.at.
the plaintiff appealed from the final order granting summary judgment.the defendant,flaherty,attempted to contest the personal jurisdiction ruling without filing a.id.the third circuit held that because the defendant,b y seeking dismissal of the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,was not seeking to support the summary judgment on different grounds but rather was seek ing to vacate the summary judgment,the court would not consider the personal jurisdiction issue in the absence of a.id.at.
in this case,the government states that although it made the ohio transaction argument to the court of federal claims in its motion for summary judgment upon liability,the trial court never specifically addressed it,just as the district court in ef operating did not explicitly rule on the defendant motion for personal jurisdiction.like the defendant in ef operating,the first time the government raised this issue during this appeal was in its brief responding to granite appeal.the government made no attempt to appeal the trial court ruling on liability at any time.because the government does not simply seek to support the grant of summary judgment on damages,but instead explicitly asks that the judgment of the trial court be reversed with respect to the statewide home agreement,we rule,as the third circuit did in ef operating,that for lack of a,the government can not now raise this issue.the circumstances here do not warrant an exception to the general rule that without itself appealing,an appellee can not seek a change in the judgment under review.
in its appeal granite argues the same theories of damages that it presented to the court of federal claims.except for the claim discussed in part iv,below,we find its arguments no more persuasive than that court did.indeed,our precedent fully supports the trial court rejection of these claims.
granite seeks to recover its cost of performance for operating the acquired thrifts,under either a reliance or a restitution theory.reliance damages cover the amount a party expends in performing the contract in reliance on the other party anticipated performance.restitution damages are designed to restore the party to the situation that would have existed had there been no contract and no breach.these two theories may be analyzed together because,as this court stated in a previous case,a restitution claim based on recovery of the expenditures of the party in performance of the contract can be viewed as a form of reliance damages.lasalle talman bank,united states.granite conceded at trial that there was no substantive difference between the two theories and sought to recover an identical amount of damages under each.damages op.at.
granite claim is that it was damaged by its acquisition and operation of thrifts whose liabilities exceeded their assets,and that this deficit constituted its cost of performing the contract.in several cases,however,this court has rejected damage claims based upon the excess of liabilities assumed over assets acquired.cal.fed.bank,fsb united states,glendale,at.as the court of federal claims here stated,assumed liabilities are not a usable measure of either cost to the thrift or benefit to the government when calculating damages.damages op.at.
furthermore,as the government points out in its brief,granite alleged liability stemmed from the poor quality of the thrifts loans it acquired,rather than from the government breach of the contract permitting the use of supervisory goodwill.roger orders,granite damages expert who performed the accounting upon which granite based this theory of damages,stated that granite costs were incurred as a result of the acquisitions,not as a result of the breach.since granite cost of performance thus did not result from the government breach,it is not an appropriate measure of damages.see,glendale,at noting party entitlement to damages for any losses actually sustained as a result of the breach.
granite contends that it may recover the value of the benefit it conferred on the government by acquiring the four troubled thrifts.granite relies on the government own analyses of the savings it realized by contracting with granite rather than liquidating the four thrifts.
the court of federal claims correctly rejected this argument,based on our previous holdings that similar benefit conferred theories in cases measure damages in terms of a liability that never came to pass and thus are too speculative and indeterminate to succeed.glendale,at cal,at.see lasalle talman,at affirming court of federal claims determination that liquidation costs which the government allegedly avoided by acquirer assumption of thrift obligations were not a meaningful measure of damages admiral fin.united states,relying upon glendale in rejecting liquidation cost savings theory,aff.
the trial court determined that the government had other ways to deal with the problem,such as arranging for the sale of the thrifts to another buyer.it suggested that the government might well have pursued these other options had granite not acquired the thrifts,because neither the government nor granite ever liquidated the thrifts,and liquidation was an extremely rare and disfavored occurrence.damages op.at glendale,at noting the existence of alternatives to liquidating a failing thrift.
granite contends that summary judgment on this issue was erroneous because material issues of fact exist regarding whether these alternatives to liquidation were truly viable.granite argument that the thrifts were dogs,plagued by credit risk problems,which surely would have been liquidated if not acquired by granite,is unpersuasive.the record shows that other possible acquirers beside granite indicated interest in obtaining the thrifts that the branching rights associated with the thrifts had significant value and that granite itself sold,rather than liquidated,the thrifts combined at that point into first nationwide bank after their alleged devaluation by firrea.indeed,granite itself recognizes that there were other possible acquirers of at least three of the thrifts,when it suggests,as an alternative measure of damages,that it should recover at least the difference between what it paid for the thrift
