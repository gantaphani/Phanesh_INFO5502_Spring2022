in may,the united states congress enacted the protecting tenants against foreclosure act of ptfa or act,div.a,title vii,may,stat.and,in,the congress amended it,title xiv,july,stat.the act provides protections for bona fide tenants of residential real property at foreclosure following the date of its enactment until its sunset at the end of.ptfa.
subsequent to a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of residential property in august,tenants rosario nativi nativi and her son jose roberto perez nativi hereinafter jose perez or perez were displaced from the property converted garage unit,which they had been renting for several years.at the time of the foreclosure sale,appellants operative lease provided for a term through june.deutsche bank national trust company as trustee for american home mortgage assets trust mortgage backed pass through certificates,series deutsche bank or bank was the beneficiary under the deed of trust and the purchaser at the foreclosure sale.appellants sued respondents deutsche bank national trust company in its nontrustee capacity,deutsche bank as trustee,and american home mortgage servicing ahmsi.
the trial court granted respondents motion for summary judgment based on its determination that the foreclosure sale extinguished the lease under california law and,therefore,the immediate successor in interest did not step into the shoes of the landlord.the court concluded that the federal ptfa merely required the bank,as the immediate successor in interest,to give a day notice to vacate the premises to appellants and it imposed no affirmative duty on the bank to assist such tenants in recovering possession of the leased premises.the court further found that appellants could not establish that the bank excluded them from the property or put their belongings in the backyard.
appellants now challenge the trial court interpretation of the ptfa.they assert that the act created a relationship between the bank and them for the duration of their lease.the appeal raises difficult questions regarding the proper interpretation of the ptfa and the potential liability of an immediate successor in interest in foreclosed residential real property for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and wrongful eviction under california law.the parties have not raised any contention regarding the validity of the ptfa or asserted that congress exceeded its authority in enacting it.an amicus curiae brief was filed on behalf of the national housing law coalition,national law center on homelessness and poverty,the aarp,the national fair housing alliance,and the california reinvestment coalition in support of appellants.the american legal and financial network filed an amicus curiae brief that supports respondents position.
after careful and extensive consideration,this court concludes,solely as a matter of statutory interpretation,that the ptfa causes a bona fide lease for a term to survive foreclosure through the end of the lease term subject to the limited authority of the immediate successor in interest to terminate the lease,with proper notice,upon sale to a purchaser who intends to occupy the unit as a primary residence.the act impliedly overrides state laws that provide less protection but expressly allows states to retain the authority to enact greater protections.bona fide tenancies for a term that continue by operation of the ptfa remain protected by california law.
we conclude that the trial court analysis was mistaken and respondents were not entitled to summary judgment.accordingly,the judgment will be reversed.
appellants also challenge the trial court order granting respondent ahmsi motion for a protective order.we find the order was not within the trial court discretion and reverse.

enactment and amendment of code of civil procedure section 
code of civil procedure section was enacted in,effective july,in the wake of the foreclosure crisis.stats,ch.as enacted,it provided notwithstanding section,a tenant or subtenant in possession of a rental housing unit at the time the property is sold in foreclosure shall be given days written notice to quit pursuant to section before the tenant or subtenant may be removed from the property as prescribed in this chapter.stats,ch,former,subd.a,italics added.the section did not apply,however,if any party to the note remains in the property as a tenant,subtenant,or occupant.stats,ch,former,subd.b.the enactment of section was not intended to affect any local eviction ordinance.stats,ch.the legislature also declared that t his act does not,and shall not be construed to,affect the authority of a public entity that otherwise exists to regulate or monitor the basis for eviction.ibid.
section was amended in stats,ch,and the amendment went into effect on january.see cal,art.iv,subd.c,subd.a.as amended,section,subdivision a,provides notwithstanding section,a tenant or subtenant in possession of a rental housing unit under a lease or periodic tenancy at the time the property is sold in foreclosure shall be given days written notice to quit pursuant to section before the tenant or subtenant may be removed from the property as prescribed in this chapter.as amended,section,subdivision b,additionally provides that tenants or subtenants holding possession of a rental housing unit under a residential lease entered into before transfer of title at the foreclosure sale shall have the right to possession until the end of the lease term,and all rights and obligations under the lease shall survive foreclosure italics added.a residential lease is not entitled to this additional protection,however,where t he purchaser or successor in interest will occupy the housing unit as a primary residence,t he lessee is the mortgagor or the child,spouse,or parent of the mortgagor,t he lease was not the result of an arms length transaction,or t he lease requires the receipt of rent that is substantially less than fair market rent for the property,except when rent is reduced or subsidized due to a federal,state,or local subsidy or law,subd.b.section does not apply if any party to the note remains in the property as a tenant,subtenant,or occupant,subd.d.
in enacting the amendment of section,the california legislature was attempting to bring california law in line with the federal ptfa.an assembly floor analysis of the bill amending section explained the ptfa,which is currently scheduled to sunset on december,generally requires the purchaser of a home at a foreclosure sale to honor bona fide tenant lease unless the purchaser intends to occupy the home as their primary residence.if there is no lease,if the lease is terminable at will a tenancy,or if the purchaser will occupy the home as their primary residence,the tenant must be provided with a day notice to vacate unless a longer period is required by state or local law.as a result,currently federal law generally provides greater protection to tenants than state law by providing additional time days and imposes a requirement that the lease be honored under certain circumstances.this bill would make the state law provisions described above comparable to federal law by providing that a new owner of a foreclosed property must honor a tenant lease.assembly floor,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,see rules,office of senate floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.

provisions of the ptfa 
the ptfa was enacted as part of the helping families save their homes act of enacted in,div.a,title vii,may,stat.the ptfa is a very short act,consisting of only four sections.section of the ptfa establishes its short title.
section of the ptfa specifies the protections for bona fide tenants of foreclosed properties.section,subdivision a,of the ptfa provides in general.in the case of any foreclosure on a mortgage loan or on any dwelling or residential real property after the date of enactment of this title may,any immediate successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to the provision,by such successor in interest of a notice to vacate to any bona fide tenant at least days before the effective date of such notice and the rights of any bona fide tenant a under any bona fide lease entered into before the notice of foreclosure to occupy the premises until the end of the remaining term of the lease,except that a successor in interest may terminate a lease effective on the date of sale of the unit to a purchaser who will occupy the unit as a primary residence,subject to the receipt by the tenant of the day notice under paragraph or b without a lease or with a lease terminable at will under state law,subject to the receipt by the tenant of the day notice under subsection,except that nothing under this section shall affect the requirements for termination of any federal or tenancy or of any state or local law that provides longer time periods or other additional protections for tenants.
section,subdivision b,of the ptfa,provides that for purposes of this section a lease or tenancy shall be considered bona fide only if the mortgagor or the child,spouse,or parent of the mortgagor under the contract is not the tenant the lease or tenancy was the result of an transaction and the lease or tenancy requires the receipt of rent that is not substantially less than fair market rent for the property or the unit rent is reduced or subsidized due to a federal,state,or local subsidy.
section,subdivision c,of the ptfa,states that as used by this section the term mortgage loan has the same meaning as in section of the real estate settlement procedures act of.as amended in,section,subdivision c,also provides for purposes of this section,the date of a notice of foreclosure shall be deemed to be the date on which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as the result of an order of a court or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage,deed of trust,or security deed,title xiv,july,stat.
section,subdivision,of the ptfa inserted new language at the end of o f of united states code,title,section,which concerns low income housing assistance in the case of any foreclosure on any mortgage loan as that term is defined in section of title or on any residential real property in which a recipient of assistance under this subsection resides,the immediate successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to the lease between the prior owner and the tenant and to the housing assistance payments contract between the prior owner and the public housing agency for the occupied unit,except that this provision and the provisions related to foreclosure in subparagraph c shall not affect any state or local law that provides longer time periods or other additional protections for tenants.italics added.
under section of the ptfa,a sunset provision,the act is repealed and its requirements terminate on december.
shall assume such interest subject to 
appellants assert that the federal statute created a relationship for the remaining period of their lease,through june.they argue that the bank owed at least the same duties to them as any california landlord owes to its tenant.
respondents maintain that the ptfa only provides a defense to eviction proceedings in state court.they state that tenants can contest eviction proceedings,defend an unlawful detainer action on the grounds that the owner has not complied with the ptfa requirement to provide notice or permit continued occupancy.they contend there is not a single case in which the ptfa has been asserted as a basis for a tenant claims against a owner.they also suggest that the act at most provides only that a bona fide tenant has the right to occupy the premises until the end of the remaining term of the lease and did not make deutsche bank the landlord.

in determining whether section of the ptfa causes a bona fide lease to survive foreclosure despite contrary state law,we begin taking particular note of its phrases any immediate successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to and except that a successor in interest may terminate a lease italics added.we also observe that,despite respondents assertions,the act does not expressly state that the ptfa protections may be invoked only as an affirmative defense.the language of section of the act seems to indicate that a successor in interest takes title in the foreclosed property subject to a bona fide lease for a term because otherwise it would be nonsensical to provide that an immediate successor has the power to terminate a lease as specified.
on the other hand,congress could have been more straightforward.as indicated,section,subdivision,of the ptfa,which amended existing law to state the effect of foreclosure on housing assistance,contained more direct language the immediate successor in interest in such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to the lease between the prior owner and the tenant and to the housing assistance payments contract,subd.o f,italics added.congress could have also said,as did the california legislature,that all rights and obligations under the lease shall survive foreclosure,subd.b.
to the extent a statutory text is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we will consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.elsner uveges cal th,fn.omitted.accordingly,we turn to extrinsic aids to determine whether or not congress intended bona fide leases for a term to survive foreclosure and bind successors in interest.
legislative history 
on may,senator john kerry submitted an amendment sa to add the ptfa,as proposed,to another amendment sa to a bill,which was aimed at preventing mortgage foreclosures and enhancing mortgage credit.cong.rec.may.
on may,senator kerry called up the amendment for consideration.cong.rec.may.the senator stated that he was offering this amendment to address the needs of renters in properties that have been foreclosed.ibid.he argued congress has already taken extraordinary measures to help troubled borrowers in communities where they have abandoned foreclosed properties,but congress has done very little to help renters who have been paying their rent regularly on time but,unfortunately,they have landlords who are losing their property to foreclosure.so these renters are absolutely blameless victims in the foreclosure catastrophe that has hit the country these renters often have absolutely no idea that their home is about to be foreclosed.depending on the state they live in,they may be evicted with absolutely no notice.obviously,this could be particularly difficult for renters who do have the resources to relocate or even to do so very quickly.under this amendment,tenants in any federally related mortgage loan or any dwelling or residential real property with a lease have a right to remain in the unit until the end of the existing lease.if a new purchaser intends to use the property as a primary residence,then the lease may be terminated,but the tenant has to receive days notice to vacate.so what we believe is that this provides an appropriate level of protection.it does take away the right of someone who takes over the home in foreclosure to be able to then transition that property or it decides if that person is going to keep the property as a rental property,the person who already has a legitimate lease has a right to be able to stay.cong.rec.may.senator kerry declared that a landlord should not be allowed to come in,change the locks,and force out tenants who were there completely legitimately,with an expectation that they were coming home to their same old home.cong.rec.may.he explained furthermore,it states specifically that none of the provisions here would affect any state and local law that provides a longer time period or other additional protections to renters.so there is nothing here that reduces the protection renters get.ibid.
senator kerry gave examples of tenants returning home to find locks changed,utilities turned off,or possessions put out on the street.ibid.he stated it is well documented how foreclosure is already overpowering countless numbers of homeowners who are unable to pay their mortgages,but foreclosure is also causing a rampage of sudden evictions of renters.my amendment would stop that rampage and help unsuspecting renters from falling victim to foreclosure in which they played absolutely no part.ibid.
senator dodd offered his comments on the amendment.among other things,he stated that the measure requires at least days notice for all renters in federally related housing,but would honor the full term of any existing lease unless a new owner will occupy the home.cong.rec.may.he explained what senator kerry is saying here,at least for tenants who are in good standing on their properties,they should not be affected because the property ended up in foreclosure through whatever rationale that may have happened to the landlord.it seems to me,putting people out on the street is not what we ought to be doing at a time such as this.ibid.
on may,during further debate,senator kerry argued w e have taken a lot of effort to try to help troubled borrowers in communities that have foreclosed properties.here is the problem that exists.if you are a renter and living in a property that has been foreclosed on,you have nothing to do with the foreclosure,you are paying rent,you have a lease,but a lot of these people are getting kicked out of their apartments,out of their homes.what we want to do is provide them with a provision where they will have days if the people who foreclosed are going to use that residence as a primary residence.if the residence is going to continue to be a residence where they have a number of people renting and they will continue to use it as such,we want to leave those leases in effect until the end of the lease.we are protecting legitimate,low to folks in america who do not get protections otherwise from being just booted out on the street,which is literally what has happened in the absence of this protection.cong.rec.may.
the legislative history of the enactment of ptfa strengthens the case that its section was intended to cause bona fide leases for a term to survive foreclosure 
administrative construction 
we also take a look at administrative construction of the ptfa as an aid to judicial interpretation.although we are not bound by administrative decisions construing a controlling statute,we accord great weight and respect to the administrative construction.citation.the amount of deference given to the administrative construction depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.citation.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,italics omitted.when an administrative agency construes a statute in adopting a regulation or formulating a policy,the court will respect the agency interpretation as one of several interpretive tools that may be helpful.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th.
shortly after the ptfa was enacted,the department of housing and urban development hud issued a notice,entitled protecting tenants at foreclosure notice of responsibilities placed on immediate successors in interest pursuant to foreclosure of residential property,dated june.june.hud indicated that it was directing this notice to entities and individuals that participate in hud programs or with whom hud interacts in its hud programs but that these obligations are not limited to or housing.june.the notice announced the ptfa requires that tenants residing in foreclosed residential properties be provided notice to vacate at least days in advance of the date by which the immediate successor,generally,the purchaser,seeks to have the tenants vacate the property.except where the purchaser will occupy the property as the primary residence,the term of any bona fide lease also remains in effect.ibid.it specified section of the ptfa provides a tenant under any bona fide lease entered into before the notice of foreclosure has the right to occupy the premises until the end of the remaining term of the lease.the only exception to preserving the remaining term of the lease is for a purchaser who will occupy the unit as a primary residence.even under this exception,however,the tenant must still be provided with the day advance notice to vacate.june.
that june hud notice further explained that section of the ptfa makes conforming changes consistent with the section requirements to the section rental voucher assistance of the united states house act of act.june.the notice stated section o of the act is further amended by section to provide that the successor in interest in the case of any foreclosure of a property in which a voucher recipient resides assumes the interest in the property subject to the lease and hap housing assistance payment contract in place before the foreclosure.this provision confirms that the section tenant lease is,in effect a bona fide lease and that the hap contract survives the foreclosure,just as the lease does.june.
in a september,letter to fdic supervised institutions,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic explained that,under the ptfa,a ll tenants must receive a day notice before being evicted as the result of a foreclosure.fdic financial institutions letter,fil,as of.the letter stated with some exceptions,the law requires that in the event of foreclosure,existing leases for renters are honored to the end of the term of their lease.ibid.it further said the stated exceptions are for tenants without a lease,tenants with a lease terminable at will under state law,or where the owner acquiring the property will occupy it as a primary residence.in these cases,the tenants must receive a minimum of days notice to vacate the property.ibid.it advised that fdic examiners will monitor and enforce compliance with the requirements of this law in the same manner as other consumer protection laws and regulations.ibid.
by notice dated october,hud provided additional guidance on the ptfa.october.the notice addressed the interplay of the ptfa notice requirements with the notice requirements of the federal housing administration occupied conveyance regulations.october.it reiterated hud understanding of the ptfa.october.it explained that the date of notice of foreclosure had been defined by additional legislation.october.it stated to fall under the act,a bona fide lease must be entered into prior to the date of the notice of foreclosure,which is defined as the date on which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of an order of a court or pursuant to the provisions in a mortgage,deed of trust,or security deed.ibid.
in march,hud issued a notice providing further guidance on the relationship between fha federal housing administration regulations and protections for existing tenants under the ptfa.march.hud again described the ptfa protections of tenants,including the day notice requirement and preservation of the term of bona fide leases.ibid.it indicated that the requirements of the ptfa apply with respect to properties secured by mortgages as well as those in the section program.march.as to mortgagee compliance under the ptfa,the notice stated before completion of foreclosure,the mortgagee must confirm the identity of all occupants,determine each occupant possible rights for continued occupancy under the ptfa and state or local law,and attempt to obtain documentation of existing leases and tenancies.march.
the office of the comptroller of the currency occ issued a bulletin,dated december,to chief executive officers of all national banks and federal savings associations,department and division heads,and all examining personnel regarding guidance on potential issues with foreclosed residential properties.occ bulletin,occ,as of.in discussing the obligations of the national banks and federal savings associations collectively,banks as the owner of a foreclosed property,the occ bulletin warned that i n acquiring title to foreclosed properties,banks assume the primary responsibilities of an owner,including serving as a landlord for rental properties.ibid.the bulletin stated the protecting tenants at foreclosure act of provides tenants with protections from eviction as a result of foreclosure on the properties they are renting.ibid.it advised when a bank takes title to a house after foreclosure,it must honor any exiting rental agreement with a bona fide tenant and must provide days notice to the tenant prior to eviction whether or not the tenant has a rental agreement.ibid.
in early,the fdic provided guidance to assuming institutions regarding the cash for keys program.fdic,rsam guidance.pdf as of.it counseled that bona fide leases are protected under the ptfa for tenants under a lease who are current on their rental obligations,ptfa prohibits an eviction prior to the end of their lease terms the lease survives foreclosure.the new owner must fulfill the landlords responsibilities under the lease,but he is under no legal obligation to renew or extend the lease.there is an exception to the lease protection if the new owner intends to occupy the rental property as his primary residence,the new owner can break the lease,but the tenant must be given days from the eviction notice date to vacate the property.
construction of the ptfa 
no one disputes that the ptfa mandates that,at a minimum,an immediate successor in interest in foreclosed property give days notice to vacate to bona fide tenants of residential property.in light of the legislative history of the ptfa and the act consistent administrative construction,it also appears unmistakable that congress intended a bona fide lease to survive foreclosure through the end of the lease term by operation of the act.congress struck a compromise by preserving bona fide leases for the duration of their remaining terms while providing immediate successors in interest the authority to terminate a lease effective on the date of sale of the unit to a purchaser who will occupy the unit as a primary residence with the provision of at least days notice to vacate.ptfa,subd.a.
if section of the ptfa were read as only requiring a day notice to vacate,much of its statutory language would be mere surplusage.similarly,if that section were read as applying only to leases that already survive foreclosure under state law,then the act special protection for bona fide tenancies for a term would be rendered completely superfluous.the rules of statutory construction direct us to avoid,if possible,interpretations that render a part of a statute surplusage.citations.people cole cal th.courts must strive to give meaning to every word in a statute and to avoid constructions that render words,phrases,or clauses superfluous.citations.klein cal th.the principles of statutory construction preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.citation.hassan mercy american river hosp.cal th.
although respondents insist that the ptfa provides nothing more than an affirmative defense to judicial proceedings to oust a tenant from a foreclosed property,we find no language in the act suggesting such limitation.moreover,their position appears untenable when examined in the light of the ptfa legislative history,the evils to be remedied,and administrative construction of the act by federal entities.the object that a statute seeks to achieve is of primary importance in statutory interpretation.citations.lusardi construction aubry cal th.congress clearly intended the act to put a stop to measures like blocking bona fide tenants access,turning off their utilities,or removing the tenants possessions.if this court accepted the view that the ptfa could be invoked only defensively in court,bona fide tenancies for a term surviving foreclosure only by operation of the act would be largely unprotected and immediate successors in interest could interfere with tenants possessory rights with impunity so long as they did not commence eviction proceedings or other legal action in which the act could be raised as a defense.that result would be completely at odds with the aim of the act.
similarly,a conclusion that congress was merely bestowing the isolated right to occupy the leased premises through end of bona fide tenancies for a term would be inconsistent with the statutory language suggesting that bona fide leases for a term continue in effect a successor in interest may terminate a lease and the protective purposes of the ptfa.such an interpretation would lead to the absurd result that a bona fide tenant could occupy leased premises for the duration of a lease term with no obligation to pay rent as provided by the lease to a successor in interest and a successor in interest in a foreclosed property would not be obligated,by the lease implied warranty of habitability,to maintain leased dwellings in a habitable condition throughout the term of the lease.citation.peterson superior court cal th.
the interpretation of section of the ptfa that most reasonably comports with congressional intent is that a subordinate bona fide lease survives foreclosure for the remainder of the term by operation of the act regardless of the state law to the contrary and,consequently,the bona fide tenants under that lease and the immediate successor in interest in the foreclosed property have a relationship,although the lease may be terminated as provided in the act.gross superior court d,purchaser of property,which was subject to local rent stabilization ordinance,at nonjudicial foreclosure sale became a landlord by operation of law even though written lease agreement executed subsequent to the recordation of the deed of trust.
preemption 
appellants amici curiae assert that tenants rights under section of the ptfa preempt less protective state law.the united states supreme court has recognized that the supremacy clause of article vi of the constitution may entail of state law either by express provision,by implication,or by a conflict between federal and state law.citations.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.preemption principles are not inapplicable simply because real property law is a matter of special concern to the states the relative importance to the state of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a valid federal law,for the framers of our constitution provided that the federal law must prevail.citations.fidelity federal sav.and loan ass de la cuesta.the only reasonable conclusion with respect to the ptfa is that the congress intended to supplant less protective state law but not any state or local law that provides longer time periods or additional protections for tenants.ptfa,subd.a.accordingly,assuming the validity of the ptfa,the act prevails over state law that would otherwise extinguish a bona fide lease within the meaning of the act and the immediate successor in interest in foreclosed property takes subject to a bona fide tenancy for a term but it retains the power to terminate the lease as provided by the act.
no federal private right of action 
appellants do not dispute that the ptfa did not create a private cause of action under federal law.see nativi deutsche bank nat.trust,supra,wl,see also logan bank nat.ass cir wl,ptfa does not create a private right of action.the lack of federal private cause of action under the ptfa,however,does not determine state law claims in state courts.
some federal courts have determined that congress intended tenant rights established by the ptfa to be enforceable under state law.see ingo deutsche bank nat.trust,wl,ptfa was intended to allow tenants who are victims of the foreclosure crisis a protection that can be used in the state courts to combat unlawful evictions nativi deutsche bank nat.trust,supra,wl,congress intended to provide tenants additional rights which could be used in state court proceedings see also logan bank nat.ass n,supra,wl,ptfa nationwide federal policy and requirements are not rendered unenforceable by the absence of a federal private right of action.citation.for example,in webb green tree servicing,llc.june,wl,the court found it unnecessary to resolve whether the ptfa supports a private right of action because the plaintiff asserted a negligence claim.id.at,fn.it noted that t he existence of an express or implied private right of action is not necessary to a negligence claim based on a statutory violation.ibid.
illegality of converted garage unit does not make ptfa inapplicable 
respondents argue that appellant lease was void as a matter of law because the garage unit was illegal and,therefore,the ptfa did not apply.respondents did not rely upon evidence of the illegality of the garage unit in moving for summary judgment.moreover,we see nothing in the language or legislative history of the ptfa exempting leases involving illegal rental units.the essential goal of the federal law is to protect vulnerable tenants at foreclosure.its protective purpose to prevent abrupt dispossession of tenants as a result of foreclosure would be frustrated if we accepted respondents argument that the ptfa does not apply to illegal rental units.
in carter cohen th carter,a former tenant sued her former landlord for damages for rent overpayments.id.at.she had leased a detached guesthouse,which had been constructed without permits,located on a residential property that also contained a house.ibid.she claimed that the rent increases,imposed by her former landlord after he bought the residential property,exceeded the limits set by a municipal rent stabilization ordinance rso.ibid.the issue on appeal was whether former tenant was entitled to recover her excess rent payments even though the guest house lacked a certificate of occupancy and was not registered under the ordinance.id.at.the former landlord contended that the action to recover excess rent payments failed as a matter of law because the rental agreement was unlawful and outside the scope of the ordinance.id.at.he maintained that the rental agreement was void and unenforceable because the guesthouse had been built without permits,lacked a certificate of occupancy,and was unregistered under the rso.id.at.
the appellate court acknowledged that r ental agreements that were constructed without building permits or lack a certificate of occupancy are ordinarily regarded as unlawful and void.citations.th at.generally,the courts will not enforce an illegal bargain or lend their assistance to a party who seeks compensation for an illegal act.lewis queen ball sons cal d,lewis queen.ibid.but the appellate court refused to apply the rule in that case because otherwise public policy would be thwarted.id.at.
the appellate court in cohen stated that the rule barring the enforcement of unlawful contracts is not absolute.id.at.an exception to that rule exists w hen the legislature enacts a statute forbidding certain conduct for the purpose of protecting one class of persons from the activities of another,a member of the protected class may maintain an action notwithstanding the fact that he has shared in the illegal transaction.the protective purpose of the legislation is realized by allowing the plaintiff to maintain his action against a defendant within the class primarily to be deterred.in this situation it is said that the plaintiff is not in pari delicto.citations.lewis queen ball sons cal d at,italics omitted.ibid.when this exception applies,a plaintiff awareness that he or she may be participating in improper conduct does not bar relief under a statute if raising such a barrier would defeat the aim of the statute.id.at.it noted that c ourts have thus permitted parties to obtain benefits under a law enacted for their protection,despite their participation in transactions that contravened the law citation.id.at.the appellate court concluded that b ecause t he protective purpose of the legislation was realized by allowing carter to maintain her action against her landlord lewis queen,supra,cal d at,the trial court properly permitted her to assert her rso claim.id.at.
similarly in this case,permitting deutsche bank,the immediate successor in interest in the foreclosed property,to invoke the general rule that illegal contracts are unenforceable would allow it to circumvent the ptfa and frustrate its fundamental public policy purpose.at this juncture,we need not resolve whether an immediate successor in interest could lawfully terminate a bona fide tenancy for a term if a municipality brought an enforcement action for code violations or whether the ptfa would require the successor in interest to bring the property into compliance to avoid liability.

state law claims 
as discussed,we conclude that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the ptfa.respondents have not identified any legal bar precluding a bona fide tenant whose bona fide tenancy for a term survives foreclosure by operation of the ptfa from seeking state law remedies for violations of the tenant rights against an immediate successor in interest in a foreclosed property.appellants assert that the trial court should not have granted summary judgment in favor of respondents because triable issues of material fact exist with regard to their causes of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and wrongful eviction.

breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment 
where an immediate successor takes subject to a bona fide lease by operation of the ptfa,the scope of a california tenant right of occupancy for the remainder of the lease term must be derived from the lease itself and california law,which implies a contractual covenant of quiet enjoyment see,see also.

diaz had worked for advisors since february,and,at the time of her deposition in december,she had worked in the real estate industry for years.at the time of his deposition in february,dougherty had worked for advisors for about two and a half years.
at the time of her deposition in december,diaz had not received any training in working with foreclosed properties or eviction law.she had never seen an eviction notice or written a or day notice.she had not consulted any manual when she was dealing with the stoneylake property.diaz was not a real estate agent or broker.

dougherty job involves driving to foreclosed properties,taking photographs of the properties,and contacting the people still living there.each morning he receives a list of properties to visit after he clocks in.unless there is a no contact instruction,he knocks on doors and attempts to obtain the names and phone numbers of the persons still living on the property.
dougherty does not speak spanish.he does not bring an interpreter with him.if persons living on a property do not speak english,they communicate however they can.dougherty writes down contact information he obtains and turns it in at the end of the day.sometimes dougherty asks the person to write down his or her name if dougherty does not know the spelling or is unable to understand what the person said.he tries to find out whether the person is a tenant or a former owner.even if a person says he or she is a tenant,dougherty does not ask for a copy of the lease.the information that dougherty obtains is inputted into advisors computer system by another employee of advisors.
dougherty also provides notices to occupants as directed by the financial institution.advisors has a standard letter,which explains the property is now owned by the bank,asks occupants to please get in touch with advisors to work out relocation assistance,and provides a phone number.dougherty sometimes posts a no trespassing notice,a pg e notice,or a cash for keys cfk notice.

dougherty visited the stoneylake property a number of times.diaz never visited the property.
when dougherty went to the property on august,he filled out a form entitled reo initial inspection checklist.he recalled seeing several latino,adults and children,walking in and out of the front door of the house.dougherty recalled speaking to a person who spoke english,a younger woman whose name he believed was larisa.he was told that the property was tenant occupied.larisa said that she had rented the main house from a veronica cassalli and they had just moved in.dougherty was given the telephone numbers for a few people,including veronica cassalli.dougherty was told that the former owner son lived in the garage.dougherty did not look in the garage unit or go into the backyard.he gave a cfk notice to the occupants of the main house.the checklist form had a check next to take cfk letter with you and a notation on the form that says,gave to larisa 
after dougherty reported that people were living in the main house on the stoneylake property,diaz spoke by telephone to a female occupant of the main house,a yessica.the purpose of the call was to offer relocation assistance.diaz told yessica that the bank now owned the house and it wanted the property to be vacated.yessica was confused and upset.yessica said she had rented the house from the foreclosed owner and given a deposit and she and her family had just moved in the previous saturday,which diaz believed was the beginning of august.diaz believed that she offered for vacating the property within days.yessica told diaz that there was also a garage unit and that a relative of the foreclosed owner occasionally stayed there but the relative did not reside there.diaz asked yessica to speak with the occupants of that unit and let them know about the relocation assistance offer.every tenant on the property had to leave to be entitled to the money.
during his next visit to the stoneylake property,dougherty contacted a male in his early with black hair at the garage unit and was invited in.the unit was furnished and had all the signs that people were living there.dougherty did not ask for a copy of the lease.dougherty handed him the cfk notice.the checklist form for this visit,dated august,had a check next to take cfk letter with you and a notation on the form that says,gave to robert at the time of his deposition in february,dougherty was not sure if he had spoken to robert or a friend of robert.at his deposition,perez recalled receiving a paper from caucasian male around the beginning of august.
the august,checklist reflects that dougherty made contact with the occupants of the garage and took down a phone number for a robert nativi.diaz telephoned that number and left a couple of messages.when she reached someone and asked for the tenant,diaz was told she had the wrong number.
dougherty was not told that robert planned to be out of town for several weeks.dougherty never spoke with nativi.
dougherty did not recall ever asking for a lease from anyone living in either the garage or the main house on the stoneylake property.he acknowledged that he did not have a way to distinguish between a tenant and a squatter.
on august,nativi traveled to el salvador for a gallbladder operation and remained there for about two months.
diaz spoke with the people living in the main house multiple times.someone named yessica told her that two males were in the garage unit.yessica said that cazzali had decided to return the deposit yessica and her family voluntarily left the main house without being paid to relocate.
when perez left for texas in early september,the garage unit was fine.
sometime in the beginning of september,new occupants moved into the main house.diaz spoke with luis by telephone.he said that he was living there with his parents.luis was upset when he learned that cazzali did not own the property and she had no right to rent the main house.diaz never spoke with cazzali.
diaz spoke with luis a number of times.diaz asked luis about tenants in the garage.he said that the property was vacant when they moved in but there were items left in the backyard that cazzali had said she was going to donate.from this comment,diaz inferred that cazzali was the person who had taken the items out of the garage unit.
diaz was unsure whether relocation assistance was offered to this second set of renters.she might have mentioned to the servicer that the previous owner was recycling tenants and inquired whether to offer relocation assistance but she could not recall getting a response.
when perez returned to his stoneylake property on september,he found all their belongings,including appliances and furniture,outside in the yard.he was accompanied by another friend and their girlfriends.the lock to the garage unit had not been changed and he went in.the unit had been emptied of their things.he went to the main house,knocked on the door,and three people whom he did not recognize answered.perez told them that he lived in the other house and asked why his belongings had been thrown into the backyard he was told that they were going to call the police.the police arrived.perez gave veronica number to an officer.the officer left for a time and,when he returned,he told perez that the house was in foreclosure and perez could not stay there.perez took some clothes that he could carry with him and he left.at the time of his deposition in may,perez still had no idea who had put their belongings into the backyard.
luis left diaz a message that he had called the police because an unidentified male,who claimed to live in the garage unit,was trying to break into the garage area.luis was under the impression that he was renting the entire property including the garage.
when diaz called luis back,luis said that he had told the man,no,you do live here.i live here.i do know who you are,and i am not letting you in.luis related telling police that he was renting the property from cazzali,nobody had been living there when he moved in,and he did not know the man.diaz thought that the police had told the man he had to leave.at diaz deposition in december,after she looked at a september,city of sunnyvale police department report,which named luis ayala as the reporting party rp,referred to stoneylake court,and stated rp having problem with four subjects,possibly squatters or trespassers,diaz memory was refreshed concerning the date luis told her that he had called the police.
on september,perez spoke to veronica,who told him to call diaz.when perez telephoned diaz,she said that she could not help him.
at her deposition,diaz recalled receiving a call from robert who said that he had been out of town,he wanted to get back in,and he wanted to do relocation.diaz recalled saying,if you have the key,i ca stop you from letting yourself back in because i am still trying to work out relocation with everyone.robert told diaz he was one of the occupants of the garage but luis would not allow him to go back in.according to diaz,she said,it is out of my hands,basically.
robert was adamant about getting back into the property.diaz told him,i do have a key.i did change locks.if you can get back in,i guess you can get back in.at this point in time,i am at a standstill.i ca do anything.robert said that the occupant of the main house would not let him back in.
diaz recalled that,at some point,robert had said,all of my stuff is in the backyard.why is it back there you removed it.according to diaz,she disclaimed touching his stuff and told him that the main house tenant said all that stuff was already in the yard when he moved in.diaz did not know whether robert and jose were one and the same person.
perez did not tell his mother about the situation because she had gone to el salvador for surgery and he did not want to bother her.perez had nowhere to stay and no car he was homeless for a period.he eventually called nativi boyfriend,with whom he did not get along,and asked to stay with him.
on october,nativi returned to the area.on october,nativi went to the stoneylake property to try to get into her unit.nativi called the police and showed the responding officer her paperwork establishing that she had the right to live there.when nativi saw her belongings outside in the yard,she cried.her household furnishings and personal items had been removed.nativi put some things in bags and removed decomposed leaves from a sofa.the officer left and,when he returned about a half an hour later,the officer told her that he had spoken with a tenant,the tenant had given him paulette telephone number,and the officer had spoken with paulette.the officer told her to leave and not come back unless the bank called.
naviti never met diaz or spoke with her directly.nativi does not speak english and understands very little english.
diaz recalled speaking with a police officer on the telephone.diaz was asked by a police officer,who has rights to the property.diaz remembered telling the officer that she did not know,the property was in foreclosure,her job was to attempt to work out the relocation of the occupants,and,as far as she knew,luis was the property occupant.she told the officer that luis had told her that he had a lease agreement with cazzali and the property was vacant when he moved in and s o i do know where this other person is coming in.the officer indicated they would work it out.at her deposition,diaz asserted that she did not give any indication who had the right to be in the property because nobody really did.
a police report,dated october,described the incident.it stated that a former renter was present at the property and claimed that the new renters moved her items outside while she was on a trip to south america.it reported that the current renters provided photographs showing that the items were already outside when they moved into the house in august.the report stated that the house was and residents have an arrangement with and pay rent to the bank.the reporting officer stated that he had spoken with paulette,who works for the bank,and she had verified the renter statement.during her deposition,diaz asserted that the reporting officer had misunderstood what she had said.
according to diaz,she told the police officer that the property had been foreclosed upon,the previous owner had rented the property to the tenants,and she was in the process of trying to get them removed.she asserted that she would never have said that the bank was accepting rent from the tenants because that was not true the bank did not have any sort of rental agreement with them.
diaz denied that she instructed the police to exclude perez from the property at the end of september and she denied that she instructed the police to exclude nativi from the property at the end of october.
diaz received a letter addressed to her from the bay area legal aid and she forwarded it to ahmsi.diaz did nothing further.as far as diaz knew,appellant nativi and her son had not been allowed back into the property.
dougherty visited the property on november.the checklist form for that date notes,no access to garage.at his deposition,dougherty explained that he could not get though the side gate because it had several locks and ropes and chains around it.he tried knocking on the car garage door.dougherty had not put ropes and chains on the gate and he had no idea who did.the checklist form had a check next to.dougherty saw furnishings,clothing,trash in the front and rear yards.there were big piles.he had no idea who put those things there.no one had instructed dougherty to take the furnishings out of the garage unit and throw them into the yard and he did not do it.

dougherty final december,checklist form for the stoneylake court property notes that the property requires trash out and yard service 
a third set of people moved into the main house but diaz did not have any communications with them.they were finally evicted in march through an unlawful detainer proceeding.
advisors did not access the garage unit and remove possessions from it or instruct anyone else to remove them on its behalf.advisors did nothing to prevent appellants from recovering their possessions out in the yard.advisors did not deny a request from appellants to retrieve their property from the premises.
neither ahmsi nor advisors,nor anyone acting on their behalf,ever rented out the main residence.neither ahmsi nor advisors,nor anyone acting on their behalf,ever denied appellants access or changed the locks to the garage unit.neither ahmsi nor advisors,nor anyone acting on their behalf,ever entered the garage unit without consent or discarded appellants personal belongings and furniture in the garage unit.neither ahmsi nor advisors,nor anyone acting on their behalf,requested or instructed any of the occupants of the main residence to remove the belongings and furniture from the garage unit.

nativi first moved into the stoneylake property in june and,at that time,cazzali was the owner.nativi is not related to cazzali.
nativi apartment was reached by walking through a gate next to the main house into the backyard where the entrance to the apartment was located.when she tried to access her apartment on october,the gate was padlocked and she could not get into her apartment.she stated,the police had to get the people in the main house to let me through the main house so that i could get to the door to my apartment.nativi never gave permission to anyone to remove her furniture and personal belongings from her apartment.nativi was removed from her home by police.since she did not have enough money for the first and last month rental payments and security deposit on a new apartment for her son and herself,they slept on the floor of a friend studio apartment,which was less than feet by feet.
on november,nadia aziz,a bay area legal aid attorney and one of the attorneys of record representing appellants,sent a letter informing deutsche bank that appellants had lost possession of premises and demanding that appellants be restored to the property.the letter,which was actually addressed to diaz at advisors,indicated that appellants had been tenants at the property for three years,they had rented the converted garage unit,and nativi had prepaid rent to the former owner for the months of august and september.a copy of the written lease,which was attached to the letter,indicated that the lease term continued through june.the letter asserted that the federal ptfa requires a bank to honor a tenancy agreement for the remaining term of the lease if the lease was entered before the foreclosure sale.it requested that appellants be compensated for damage to their property as a result of the new tenants illegally entering their unit and throwing their property out at your instruction and that appellants be restored to the premises and be allowed to remain in the premises until the end of the lease term on june.
deutsche bank responded by letter,dated november.counsel for deutsche bank stated in the letter that it had not rekeyed the property,disposed of appellants personal property,or taken possession of the property and it had not instructed anyone else to do so.the letter advised that appellants would have to regain access to the property,and seek redress for their alleged damages,from the persons responsible.in the letter,counsel asserted that appellants were entitled only to a day notice to vacate,which had been posted on the property on august.the letter warned that if appellants failed to vacate the premises by november,eviction proceedings would be commenced against them to recover possession and to obtain damages for their unlawful detention of the property.
supplemental evidence submitted by respondents 
respondents submitted a supplemental declaration of their attorney charles mckenna together with a special interrogatory response from nativi and an excerpt from nativi deposition testimony.a special interrogatory asked nativi to describe the circumstances of her alleged denial of access to her unit.nativi responded on october,the police refused to let her into her unit after diaz,who had knowledge of her tenancy,told the police officer that she had no right to be in the unit.on november,her counsel requested that she be allowed to regain possession to the unit and the bank attorneys refused.the deposition testimony was part of the same testimony previously submitted,which indicated that nativi retrieved some belongings and put some clothing in plastic bags.
respondents also belatedly submitted the supplemental declaration of christy gunvalsen,which was not referenced in their separate statement of undisputed material facts.gunvalsen stated,i n the course and scope of my employment as neighborhood preservation officer,i have access to and am a custodian of records for the city of sunnyvale department of public safety file pertaining to the real property at stonylake sic court,sunnyvale,california.according to gunvalsen,a t all times,the converted garage apartment at the stonylake sic court property has constituted an illegal unit,in violation of the applicable city of sunnyvale municipal ordinances.
supplemental evidence submitted by appellants 
appellants also submitted the declaration of madeline howard,another attorney representing appellants.she indicated that,despite diligent efforts,appellants had been unable to contact officer alan harnett until july,and had not been able to obtain a sworn declaration from him until august.his declaration was attached to her declaration 
officer harnett stated that he was a detective for the department of public safety for the city of sunnyvale,california.on october,he responded to a call at stoneylake court in sunnyvale.when he arrived at the property,nativi informed him that she was tenant in the garage,she had just returned from an extended trip,people had moved into her home,and her belongings had been removed from her home.he observed personal property,which looked damaged,in the back and side yard.he spoke with the people living in the main house,who told him that they had made arrangements with,and were paying rent to,the bank which owned the house.the people said the place was empty when they moved in and showed him pictures of the personal property in the backyard.he had spoken with a bank representative,paulette,who told him that the people living in the main house were the only ones who had a right to be at the property and that nativi had no right to be there.consequently,nativi was told she had to leave.the officer incident report was attached to his declaration.
attorney howard declaration further explained that walker ahmsi assistance vice president,whose declaration was submitted in support of summary judgment failed to appear for her noticed deposition on july,and she was not produced until august.walker acknowledged in her august,deposition testimony that she had never directly talked to anybody at advisors and she had never been to the property.she indicated that the information in her declaration regarding occupants came from her attorney.
triable issues of material fact 
the evidence is uncontroverted that appellants were living in a garage unit on the stoneylake property under a lease at the time of foreclosure,their belongings were taken out of the unit and dumped outside,and each of them was turned away and directed to leave when they separately tried to return after a temporary absence.
respondents presented evidence that with respect to the stoneylake property,the bank was acting through ahmsi,which hired advisors.the evidence showed that ahmsi,advisors,and those acting on their behalf with respect to the stoneylake property,did not take appellants personal property out of the garage unit or instruct any of the occupants of the main residence or anyone else to do so.respondents produced evidence that ahmsi,advisors,and those acting on their behalf,did not change the locks to the garage unit or deny appellants access to the unit.their evidence showed that neither ahmsi nor advisors rented the main house to any of the groups of occupants.respondents also produced evidence showing that diaz only learned of the september incident in which luis had called the police after it occurred and diaz had not instructed the police to exclude appellant perez from the property.further,their evidence indicated that diaz did not instruct the police to exclude appellant nativi from the property at the end of october.accordingly,respondents made a sufficient showing to meet their burden and shift the burden to appellants to produce sufficient admissible evidence to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact.see,subds.d p aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at.
on appeal,appellants claim that triable issues of material fact remain with respect to the bank liability for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment on the following theories by offering cash for keys deals to occupants of the stoneylake property,it was foreseeable that one of the tenant s would do whatever was necessary to secure that prize,including ridding the property of appellants and their possessions,failing to reinstate appellants to the premises after appellants tried to enter their rental unit because diaz knew,or should have known,that appellants had a right to return there and refusing to assist them in regaining possession of the leased premises in response to their attorney november demand letter.
appellants cite andrews mobile aire estates,supra,th for the principle that a landlord may breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to take action when a disturbs a tenant quiet enjoyment where the landlord has the ability to rectify the situation but refuses to do so.the case does not stand for this broad proposition.
although andrews recognized t he perpetrator of the interference with the tenants quiet enjoyment need not be the landlord personally,it also observed that an actionable breach may occur where the interference is caused by a neighbor or tenant claiming under the landlord.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at see,lee placer title th,shopping center tenant claimed covenant was breached by landlords failure to remedy ventilation problems caused by adjoining dry cleaning business.id.at,fn.omitted,italics added.in andrews,the interference with tenants quiet enjoyment was caused by a disruptive tenant who leased the adjacent space in a mobile home park from the park owner.id.at.
unlike the present case,andrews involved the mobilehome residency law,et,which regulates relations between the owners and the residents of mobilehome parks.cacho boudreau cal th.andrews observed that the mobilehome residency law expressly preserves the park owners ability to secure the quiet enjoyment of mobilehome park tenants by authorizing park owners to pursue eviction or injunctive relief against offending tenants.andrews,supra,th at.
the appellate court in andrews stated a mobile home park owner can not disregard conduct by a tenant upon the park premises that constitutes a substantial annoyance to other homeowners or residents,subd.b.faced with such a situation,the covenant of quiet enjoyment requires a reasonable response by the landlord,which may include conducting an investigation and thereafter,taking appropriate action,which may include,inter alia,the issuance of a warning to the offending party,the pursuit of injunctive relief against the tenant to enjoin the violation,or,if necessary,the commencement of eviction proceedings.th at.it concluded that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on the breach of contract claim on the ground mobile aire had no duty under the lease to evict the disruptive tenant because there were triable issues of material fact whether the level of interference by the disruptive tenant was sufficient to amount to a deprivation of the complaining tenants right to quiet enjoyment,whether mobile aire had notice of the interference,the nature of any investigative and corrective measures a reasonable landlord should have taken,a warning,a petition for injunctive relief pursuant to,or other measures to secure the disruptive tenant compliance,and thereafter,the extent of the complaining tenant recoverable damages.id.at.
respondents take the position that they had no obligation to act,citing sarina pedrotti,which stated the landlord covenant of quiet enjoyment and possession of leased premises is equivalent to a stipulation that the lessee shall not be rightfully disturbed in his possession during the term,not that he shall not be disturbed at all.the lessor is not responsible under the covenant for the acts of a mere trespasser,though the effect of the trespasser acts may be to deprive the lessee of the benefits of the lease,the latter remedy being against the trespasser,not against the lessor.that statement accurately conveys the traditional view concerning the extent of a landlord liability under an express or implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.see carty blauth cal,it is a general rule that an express or implied covenant for quiet possession secures the lessee against acts or hindrances of the lessor and persons deriving their title through him,or from a paramount title,but not from the acts of strangers.citations.mcdowell hyman cal,this covenant,whether expressed or implied,means that the tenant shall not be evicted or disturbed by the lessor or by persons deriving title from him,or by virtue of a title paramount to his,and implies no warranty against the acts of strangers.it is equivalent to a stipulation that the lessee shall not be rightfully disturbed in his possession during the term,not that he shall not be disturbed at all.citation.playter cunningham cal,the lessor is responsible upon the covenant for his own acts,and for the acts of others claiming by title paramount to the lease,but he is not responsible for the acts of a mere trespasser.the effect of these acts may be to deprive the lessee of the benefit of the lease,but the remedy is against the person by whom the acts were committed,and not against the lessor.see also lost key mines hamilton d.
we recognize,however,that a landowner can not interfere with his tenant possession or enjoyment by allowing others to enter upon the land.citation.brown derby hollywood hatton cal d.a residential tenant has a right to recover damages for deprivation of peaceful possession occasioned by a succession of a landlord wrongful acts that result in constructive eviction.tooke allen,supra,d at.a landlord is bound to refrain from action which interrupts the tenant beneficial enjoyment.citations.guntert city of stockton d.
in considering whether the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the bank,as landlord,was liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or wrongful eviction in the unusual circumstances of this case,we find section of the restatement second of property,landlord and tenant,helpful.it provides in part except to the extent the parties to a lease validly agree otherwise,there is a breach of the landlord obligations if,during the period the tenant is entitled to possession of the leased property,the landlord,or someone whose conduct is attributable to him,interferes with a permissible use of the leased property by the tenant.rest d,landlord and tenant,italics added.comment b to that section explains an unauthorized possession of all or any part of the leased property by the landlord,or someone whose conduct is attributable to him,is an eviction of the tenant that could be cured by the tenant himself.the rule of this section does not require the tenant to take the legal steps available to him to eliminate the eviction,although that option is open to him.instead he may treat the landlord as in default and pursue the remedies available to him under this section for the default.id.at.
another comment to that restatement provision states possession of the leased property by a third person,or other conduct thereon by a third person,without the consent of the tenant,will be attributable to the landlord,so that the tenant can invoke the rule of section of the restatement second of property,only if the landlord is a contributing factor to the unauthorized possession or conduct by the third person.rest d,landlord and tenant,com.c,italics added.another comment thereto provides the landlord is not in default under the rule of this section unless he fails to eliminate the interference promptly after a request to do so.prompt elimination means immediately if the interference is the conduct of the landlord himself,and as soon as possible if the conduct which must be stopped is that of a third person that is attributable to the landlord.rest d,landlord and tenant,com.e.
keeping these principles in mind,we now sequentially examine appellants claims,beginning with the cash for keys offers.with respect to this theory,appellants argue that the cash for keys offers provided a strong financial incentive to rid the stoneylake property of the nativis and their possessions.they cite weirum rko general,cal d,which concerned a wrongful death tort action based on the death of a driver who was forced off the highway by a negligent radio listener who was pursuing a disc jockey automobile to the next stop to collect a cash prize being offered on the radio.id.at.the primary question before the supreme court was whether defendant radio station owed a duty to decedent arising out of its broadcast of the giveaway contest.id.at.insofar as appellants opposition suggests a tort duty arose out of the cash for keys offers,it raises issues outside the pleadings.it is well settled that documentary evidence filed in opposition to a defendant motion for summary judgment may not create issues outside the pleadings,nor is it a substitute for an amendment to the pleadings.citation.robinson hewlett packard d.
furthermore,appellants presented no evidence that a cash for keys offer prompted someone to dispossess appellants by taking all their property out of the garage unit.the trial court ruled that nativi statement that an occupant of the main residence told her that the bank instructed her to remove the items was hearsay.appellants submitted no other evidence that any occupant understood a cash for keys offer as an instruction or invitation to remove appellants property from the garage unit and acted accordingly.the evidence produced indicated that the first two groups of occupants with whom dougherty or diaz had contact voluntarily left the property without participating in any cash for keys offer.
appellants failed to present sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the dumping of all their property was attributable to the bank or those acting on its behalf based on a cash for keys offer proffered by advisors consequently,neither the bank nor those acting on its behalf were required to promptly remedy that situation to avoid liability for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment see rest d,landlord and tenant,coms.c and e thereto.
we turn next to appellants claim that diaz should have investigated their claims that they were tenants,diaz knew or should have known that they had a right to return to the garage unit,and respondents breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to restore appellants to the garage unit.the evidence indicates that advisors employees initially learned that someone was living in the garage at the time of foreclosure.when appellant perez tried to return home in september after being away,he found that all his family things been removed from the garage unit and strangers were living in the main house.diaz learned of the incident only after the fact.
appellants did not produce admissible evidence that the occupants who prevented appellant perez from returning to live in the garage unit in september were claiming as tenants under the bank consequently,even if andrews mobile aire estates,supra,th is understood as requiring a landlord to take action against a tenant who is disrupting the quiet enjoyment of another tenant,appellants did not produce evidence showing that it applied to the conduct of that second group of occupants.appellants failed to provide evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could infer that the conduct of the bank,or anyone acting on its behalf,was a cause a contributing factor of the actions that kept appellant perez from returning to live in the garage unit during that september incident and,therefore,those actions were attributable to the bank and the bank,or those acting on its behalf,were required to take remedial action to avoid breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.see rest d,landlord and tenant,coms.c and e thereto.
respondents evidence indicated that diaz subsequently received a telephone call from a male,whom she knew as robert and who appears to have been appellant perez.the caller said that he was a tenant in the garage and he wanted to get back in but a person in the main house had not let him on the property.diaz told him she could not do anything.no evidence was produced that,as of that point in time,the bank,or anyone acting on its behalf,had interfered with appellants possession or quiet enjoyment.
nevertheless,we find advisors failure to ascertain whether appellants were bona fide tenants of the garage unit troubling,especially after diaz was made aware of the plight of appellant perez.in our view,the ptfa protection of bona fide tenancies for a term would be empty if it did not impliedly impose a legal duty on immediate successors in interest in foreclosed properties to make reasonable efforts to identify all bona fide tenants and determine whether they are entitled to continue as tenants under a bona fide lease for the remainder of the lease term.this duty may,under the particular circumstances,include requesting a copy of a lease,if any,from persons living on the premises or claiming to be tenants.we see nothing in the act that places the onus on tenants,who may be unsophisticated or lack resources,to provide this proof without request.
we recognize that a successor in interest failure to reasonably determine whether residential occupants of foreclosed property are bona fide tenants does not in itself amount to constructive eviction or substantial interference with a permissible use of the property.nevertheless,where a successor in interest in foreclosed property fails to reasonably identify a person as a bona fide residential tenant of the property and,in its dealings with others concerning rightful occupation of the property,unreasonably fails to inform or misinforms a as to the bona fide tenant right to occupy leased premises,such omission or conduct by the successor may,under particular circumstances,constitute a contributing factor to that interference with the bona fide tenant possession and quiet enjoyment and render that interference attributable to the successor in interest.see rest d,landlord and tenant,com.c thereto.
the evidence indicates that,about a month after appellant perez was turned away,appellant nativi tried to return to the garage unit.the police were called and an officer spoke with the occupants of the main house on the stoneylake property.after he spoke with diaz by telephone,the officer directed appellant nativi to leave and not return unless the bank called.appellants produced the declaration from officer harnett,who had responded to the property when appellant nativi was trying to get back into her home on october,according to the officer,diaz made affirmative representations to him that nativi was not a tenant and she had no right to be on the property and,consequently,he told nativi to leave.we believe this evidence raises triable issues of material fact whether the bank,through diaz conduct,was a cause a contributing factor of third parties substantial interference with appellants possession of the garage unit and the bank,and those acting on its behalf,thereby became responsible for promptly taking remedial action see rest d,coms.c e,see also code civ,subd.b stats,ch,former bank of america,owens,if a successor property owner has credible evidence that a resident of foreclosed property is not a bona fide tenant,the successor owner is free to bring an eviction proceeding against the resident without providing the ninety days advance notice mandated by the ptfa.
as to the november letter from the bank attorney,the bank legal position was ostensibly predicated on the fact that the notice of default had been recorded before appellants entered into their most recent lease where a landlord does not physically interfere with tenants possession and merely wrongfully serves a notice to quit,tenants can recover damages for a wrongful eviction only if the landlord acted with malice.see asell rodrigues d.the mere threat to resort to legal process,made in good faith,can not amount to a constructive eviction.lindenberg macdonald cal d.a landlord is not liable for a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment or a constructive eviction when he wrongfully commences an eviction proceeding in good faith,even though the tenant vacates the premises in response to the wrongful notice to quit.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fn.omitted.
beyond the bank letter threatening an unlawful detainer action,however,there was evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find that the conduct preventing appellant nativi return to the garage unit in october was attributable to diaz and ultimately to the bank.the evidence indicated that,with respect to the stoneylake property,advisors was responsible for informing the property occupants of the foreclosure,facilitating their relocation if possible,and preparing the property for resale.the evidence does not show that advisors took steps to determine whether appellants had the right to remain as tenants of the garage unit through the end of their lease term by operation of the ptfa.in light of all the evidence,we conclude that a triable issue of material fact exists whether the bank letter was issued in good faith or whether it was part of a larger course of conduct amounting to constructive eviction by the bank 
protective ordera.parties contentions 
appellants complain that,after the trial court had already ordered ahmsi to produce documents,ahmsi brought a motion for a protective order and the trial court improperly granted it.they assert that ahmsi failed to move promptly for such order or present good cause for its issuance.appellants maintain that the documents would be of acute interest to the general public because they set forth the servicer policies and procedures for the disposition of property owned by the banks and the public has a keen interest in the ongoing mortgage crisis and how banks are dealing with the properties they foreclose on and the tenants who live there.appellants state that t he issue is whether the public should have a right to that information as well.they urge us to vacate the protective order for all the foregoing reasons.
respondents counter that the trial court properly granted their motion for a protective order because there was no good faith basis for appellants to disseminate respondent ahmsi proprietary data outside the confines of this lawsuit.
procedural history 
on april,appellants served respondents by mail with their notice of deposition of ahmsi person most qualified to testify pmq and requested the production of the documents,including ahmsi policies,procedures,and practices concerning marketing and selling,servicing,or contracting with third parties to manage california real estate,effective between january,to present,at the deposition.ahmsi objected to the request for production of those policies,procedures,and practices on multiple grounds,including on the basis that appellants request seeks confidential proprietary information protected from disclosure by california right to privacy in a letter dated june,ahmsi counsel again indicated that the company policies and practices were proprietary information.
on june,appellants took the deposition of ahmsi pmq and ahmsi counsel objected to questions on the ground of confidential proprietary information.the deponent did not have the requested documents.
by noticed motion filed on june,appellants moved to compel further responses to requests for admissions,further responses to deposition questions,and production of documents.
on july,the trial court granted in part appellants motion to compel further discovery.it ordered ahmsi pmq to appear for further deposition,answer certain deposition questions,and produce documents in response to three of appellants requests concerning ahmsi policies,procedures,and practices regarding marketing and selling,servicing,and contracting with third parties to manage real estate owned by lenders.it ordered such discovery to take place within calendar days.
ahmsi received the order,which had been served by mail,on july.in an email dated friday august,appellants counsel indicated that appellants would not stipulate to a protective order.the parties agreed that the deposition of amhsi pmq would take place on august.
on august,respondents filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time for notice on a motion for a protective order.in support of the application,respondents filed their counsel declaration,which stated in part there is absolutely no prejudice to plaintiffs whatsoever in keeping these documents from dissemination outside of this lawsuit,yet ahmsi is severely prejudiced if these documents are not provided any protection at all.no factual basis or articulated reasoning was given for this assertion.the declaration did not even affirmatively assert that the documents constituted or contained confidential commercial or private information.
with their application,respondents submitted a sweeping proposed order that provided procedures for designating material as confidential and challenging confidentiality designations,extensive restrictions regarding the use of designated materials in discovery and in court,and provisions for the return and destruction of materials received at the conclusion of the litigation the proposed order broadly stated all confidential information produced or exchanged in the course of this case not including information that is publicly available shall be used by the party or parties to whom the information is produced solely for the purpose of this case.
the parties stipulated that the documents produced at the august,deposition would be conditionally protected as confidential pending the court ruling on ahmsi motion for a protective order.
a notice of motion for a protective order was filed on august.the parties agreed that the ex parte application would be deemed the moving papers.
appellants opposed the motion on the grounds that it was untimely and ahmsi had not shown that the documents should be protected.they pointed out that the motion was not accompanied by a declaration from any amhsi employee attesting that the documents were confidential and proprietary and that ahmsi would be harmed by their disclosure.appellants argued that it was imperative that the public have access to information concerning the management and eviction practices of servicers such as ahmsi.
on september,the trial court granted ahmsi request for a protective order.the court found there had been a showing that the information is proprietary in nature.the formal order,filed november,adopted the proposed comprehensive protective order.

t he issuance and formulation of protective orders are to a large extent discretionary.see coalition against police abuse superior court d,raymond handling concepts superior court th.ruling on motions for protective orders will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.see moskowitz superior court d.
first,as to the timeliness of the motion for a protective order,the promptness of the request turns on the facts.appellants motion for a protective order was not untimely as a matter of law because it was made after the order compelling further deposition and production,especially since it was contesting the dissemination of the documents,not their production.see code civ,subd.a stadish superior court th,upon a proper showing a party may even after it has waived its right to object to the production of documents,and has produced most of the documents requested seek a protective order restricting dissemination of the documents under former code civil procedure,section,subdivision e.here,within a week of learning that appellants would not agree to a protective order and before the date agreed upon by the parties for the deposition and the deponent production of documents,ahmsi applied for an order shortening time for notice of a motion for a protective order.it then promptly filed its motion.appellants have not shown that the court abused its discretion by considering the motion on its merits.
the propriety of the protective order is a different issue.the state has two substantial interests in regulating pretrial discovery.the first is to facilitate the search for truth and promote justice.the second is to protect the legitimate privacy interests of the litigants and third parties.citation.the interest in truth and justice is promoted by allowing liberal discovery of information in the possession of the opposing party.citation.the interest in privacy is promoted by restricting the procurement or dissemination of information from the opposing party upon a showing of good cause.citations.citation.the trial court is in the best position to weigh fairly the competing needs and interests of parties affected by discovery.citation.stadish superior court,supra,th at.a trial court must balance the various interests in deciding whether dissemination of the documents should be restricted.id.at.further,even where a motion for a protective order is denied in whole or part,the trial court may still impose terms and conditions that are just.code civ,subd.g see code civ,subd.g same.
parties to civil litigation,recognizing the broad policies favoring discovery,often choose to avoid costly and motion practice by entering into stipulations for protective orders that permit production but limit disclosure and use of discovered information deemed by the producing party to contain confidential,proprietary,private information.they thereby defer or obviate the need for specific court determination as to the propriety of designating materials confidential unless and until that designation is challenged.citations.mercury interactive klein th.in this case,however,the parties were not able to reach an agreement.
where a party must resort to the courts,the burden is on the party seeking the protective order to show good cause for whatever order is sought.citation.fairmont ins.superior court cal th.even assuming california trial courts may in appropriate circumstances issue an umbrella protective order that allows the parties to designate as confidential documents produced in discovery but see stadish superior court,supra,th at trial court impermissibly delegated to the parties the responsibility of determining which items of discovery contained trade secrets and specifies the permissible use of those designated documents,the declaration submitted in support of amhsi motion for such a protective order was entirely conclusory and lacked any factual specificity.see people superior court d,declaration cont
