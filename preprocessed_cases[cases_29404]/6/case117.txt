background 
the critical facts are not in dispute.on march,the debtors,stephen jamo and lynn jamo husband and wife,initiated proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on the filing date,they owed to katahdin federal credit union the credit union.this indebtedness was composed of owed on a promissory note secured by a first mortgage on their residence in millinocket,maine owed on unsecured personal loans and owed on credit cards.
in their bankruptcy petition,the debtors indicated that they desired to reaffirm the mortgage obligation.when their attorney inquired about reaffirmation,the credit union responded,through counsel,that it would not enter into a reaffirmation agreement unless the debtors also agreed to reaffirm their other indebtedness with the credit union.in taking this position,the credit union cited a policy that stated in relevant part 
it shall be the policy of the credit union to allow members to reaffirm debts owed to the credit union.if members have more than one debt with the credit union,all debts must be reaffirmed or.reaffirmation will not be granted to members who wish to have some debts excused discharged,and to reaffirm others.
initially,the debtors counsel tried to get the credit union to accept a reaffirmation of the secured indebtedness alone.when that effort failed,he signaled that the debtors would consider reaffirming all of their obligations to the credit union.the credit union then proposed a comprehensive reaffirmation package that bundled the debtors outstanding obligations into two loans each secured by a home mortgage and dramatically reduced the debtors total monthly payments.the debtors executed the papers presented by the credit union.
the deal came a cropper when the debtors counsel balked.see c a b stipulating that,as a condition precedent to reaffirmation,counsel for a represented debtor must certify that the agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary agreement by the debtor and does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor.in refusing to approve the arrangement,the lawyer singled out the proposed reaffirmation of the unsecured debts and questioned whether his clients were succumbing to the extortion that is inherently present in the credit union all or nothing approach to reaffirmation.
the linked reaffirmation agreements were filed with the bankruptcy court.absent counsel stamp of approval,however,the court had no choice but to reject them 
the debtors promptly notified the credit union that they remained willing to reaffirm the mortgage,shorn of any linkage to the unsecured debts.further negotiations ensued.the credit union and the debtors reached a second accord,this time purposing to reaffirm the secured indebtedness on its original terms and to reaffirm the unsecured debts without interest.despite these changes,the debtors lawyer remained adamant in his refusal to endorse the arrangement.
although the revised agreements lacked the imprimatur of the debtors counsel,the debtors filed them with the bankruptcy court.the debtors then commenced an adversary proceeding charging the credit union with a violation of the automatic stay,a,and seeking sanctions.after some skirmishing not relevant here,the bankruptcy court concluded that the credit union efforts to condition reaffirmation of the mortgage debt upon the simultaneous reaffirmation of other unsecured debts violated the automatic stay in two ways.jamo i,at.first,the credit union insistence upon linkage constituted an impermissibly coercive attempt to the debtors into reaffirming their separate,unsecured obligations.id.at.second,the credit union had engaged in prohibited conduct by threatening to foreclose on the debtors home.id.at.
consistent with these conclusions,the court enjoined the credit union from foreclosing on the mortgage for any reason,calling the mortgage on account of an asserted payment default for at least one year,collecting or attempting to collect any attorneys fees or costs accruing prior to the effective date of the injunction,conditioning any reaffirmation of the mortgage debt upon the debtors reaffirmation of their unsecured obligations,and withholding its consent to reaffirmation of the mortgage debt on the terms specified in the original loan documents.id.at.effectively,then,the bankruptcy court overrode the parties agreement to reaffirm the unsecured debts and as a sanction compelled reaffirmation of the mortgage debt on its original terms.to cap matters,the court awarded attorneys fees and costs to the debtors.id.at.
the credit union appealed,but the bap affirmed the judgment.jamo ii,at.this further appeal ensued.
ii.the merits 
we traverse an analytical path that delineates the structure of,and the relationship between,two mainstays of the bankruptcy code reaffirmation and the automatic stay.we turn then to the question of whether the credit union transgressed the automatic stay either by conditioning reaffirmation of the mortgage indebtedness upon the reaffirmation of separate,unsecured obligations,or by engaging in tactics.
a.the statutory interface.
to put this case into perspective,it is necessary to understand how the practice of reaffirmation and the operation of the automatic stay implicate bankruptcy practice.we turn to that task.
reaffirmation.within thirty days of filing a bankruptcy petition,a chapter debtor must serve a statement of intention with respect to outstanding consumer debts that are secured by property of the bankrupt estate.a.the debtor may,of course,surrender the collateral to the secured creditor.id.to retain it,however,he must a demonstrate the applicability of a recognized bankruptcy exemption,b pay off the secured creditor in full thereby redeeming the collateral,or c reaffirm the secured debt id.the focus here is on reaffirmation.
the reaffirmation option is spelled out in c.we recently explained that section c requires reaffirmation agreements to satisfy five general criteria.such an agreement must 
i be executed before the general discharge has been granted 
ii be in consideration for a dischargeable debt,whether or not the debtor waived discharge of the debt 
iii include clear and conspicuous statements that the debtor may rescind the reaffirmation agreement at any time prior to the granting of the general discharge,or within sixty days after the execution of the reaffirmation agreement,whichever occurs later,and that reaffirmation is neither required by the bankruptcy code nor by nonbankruptcy law 
iv be filed with the bankruptcy court and 
v be accompanied by an affidavit of the debtor attorney attesting that the debtor was fully advised of the legal consequences of the reaffirmation agreement,that the debtor executed the reaffirmation agreement knowingly and voluntarily,and that the reaffirmation agreement would not cause the debtor undue,financial hardship.
whitehouse laroche,cir.
there is,however,an overarching requirement.section c makes manifest that reaffirmation requires a meeting of the minds.the statutory text uses the word agreement no less than nineteen separate times,and this pervasive emphasis can only mean that congress envisioned reaffirmations as consensual.in conventional legal parlance the essence of an agreement is the existence of mutual consent,black law dict.ed restatement second of contracts,and the presumption is that congress knew and adopted the widely accepted legal definitions of meanings associated with the specific words enshrined in the statute,united states nason,cir.
we conclude,therefore,that section c envisions reaffirmation agreements as the product of fully voluntary negotiations by all parties.whitehouse,at motors acceptance bell in re bell,cir.two things follow from this conclusion.first,both the creditor and the debtor must consent to reaffirmation.see in re turner,cir home owners funding belanger in re belanger,cir see also collier on bankruptcy ed.t o be an enforceable agreement,the reaffirmation agreement must be one to which both the debtor and creditor agree.second,just as a debtor is not obliged to seek reaffirmation,so too a creditor retains the right to reject any and all reaffirmation proposals,for whatever reason.in re turner,at brown.state employees credit union in re brown,cir in re bell,at.
we add a caveat.although reaffirmation is consensual in nature,the myriad safeguards erected by congress reflect its recognition that a debtor decision to enter into a reaffirmation agreement is likely to be fraught with consequence.in point of fact,reaffirmation represents the only vehicle through which an otherwise dischargeable debt can survive the successful completion of chapter proceedings.moreover,once a debt is reaffirmed,the creditor can proceed to enforce its rights as if bankruptcy had not intervened.because reaffirmation constitutes a exception to the tenet that underpins the bankruptcy fresh start reaffirming debtor must be afforded some protection against his own potentially decisions.
section c reflects congress intent to provide this protection,thereby safeguarding debtors against unsound or unduly pressured judgments about whether to attempt to repay dischargeable debts.in re duke,cir collier on bankruptcy,supra.to cloak debtors in this protective garb,courts generally have insisted that reaffirmation agreements strictly comply with the conditions enumerated in the statute,whitehouse,at dubois ford motor credit,cir bessette avco fin,cir,cert.denied,d.by like token,courts have insisted upon a showing that a reaffirmation agreement is not the product of abusive creditor practices.in re duke,at.
the automatic stay.the automatic stay is one of the fundamental protections that the bankruptcy code affords to debtors.as its name suggests,the stay springs into effect upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.sunshine,fdic,cir.the stay effectively suspends all collection efforts including foreclosures,thus giving the debtor breathing room.see soares brockton credit union in re soares,cir see also a prohibiting any act to collect,assess,or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding.the automatic stay remains in effect unless and until a federal court either disposes of the underlying case,c,or grants relief to a particular creditor,id.d f.
the interplay.congress encouragement to creditors and debtors alike to move expeditiously to negotiate reaffirmation agreements is in some tension with the automatic stay.although congress has explicitly excepted a handful of actions from the purview of the stay,see id.b,this enumeration does not include the negotiation of reaffirmation agreements.taken to an extreme,the automatic stay could be construed to prohibit all contact between creditors and debtors pertaining to dischargeable debts,including the negotiation of reaffirmation agreements.but the bankruptcy code should be read as a whole,with a view toward effectuating congress discerned intent.msr exploration,meridian oil,cir.such a commonsense approach leads us to reject a reading of the automatic stay provision that would effectively preclude all negotiations anent reaffirmation.to read the automatic stay provision that expansively would emasculate section c and thwart congress evinced intent of allowing parties to reach arm length reaffirmation agreements without undue delay.as the seventh circuit astutely observed 
the option of reaffirming would be empty if creditors were forbidden to engage in any communication whatsoever with debtors who have obligations.if that were the rule,it is also hard to see what purpose the detailed rules governing enforceability of reaffirmation agreements contained in c would serve.
in re duke,at.
to be sure,there is a fine line between negotiations and predatory if the automatic stay is to have any bite,it must forfend against the latter.courts have labored long to plot this line.the most sensible one that we that a creditor may discuss and negotiate terms for reaffirmation with a debtor without violating the automatic stay as long as the creditor refrains from coercion or harassment.cox zale,cir pertuso ford motor credit,cir.we believe that this measured approach gives effect to all parts of the statutory scheme,affording all parties a reasonable opportunity to consummate binding reaffirmation agreements while at the same time shielding debtors from unseemly creditor practices.accordingly,we hold that,while the automatic stay is in effect,a creditor may engage in negotiations pertaining to a reaffirmation agreement so long as the creditor does not engage in coercive or harassing tactics.
b.the attempt at linkage.
this brings us to the question of linkage whether a creditor attempt to condition reaffirmation of a secured debt upon reaffirmation of separate,unsecured debts crosses the line and should be deemed coercive as a matter of law.both the bankruptcy court,jamo i,at,and the bap,jamo ii,at,answered that question affirmatively.for purposes of our review,we focus on the bankruptcy court decision,scrutinize that court findings of fact for clear error,and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law,without according any special deference to the bap pronouncements.brandt repco printers,in re healthco int l,cir.
there are two different ways in which a debtor might prevail on the linkage issue.the first is if a per se rule applies,that is,if any and all efforts by creditors to construct such a tie are deemed inherently coercive and,therefore,violative of the automatic stay.the second is even if an all or nothing negotiating posture is not per se coercive,a creditor still might violate the automatic stay by articulating or acting upon that policy in an inappropriate manner during the course of negotiations.we examine both alternatives.
the per se rule.both lower courts took the position that a creditor refusal to reaffirm a secured debt unless the debtor simultaneously agrees to reaffirm additional,unsecured debts constitutes a per se violation of the automatic stay.jamo ii,at jamo i,at.this is an abstract legal proposition,and,as such,engenders de novo review.main.dep t of envtl.prot.in re main,cir in re soares,at.
to some extent,we write on a pristine page no federal court of appeals has spoken to the issue.there is,however,a smattering of apposite case law.the bankruptcy courts that have addressed the question mostly reject a per se rule.see,in re brady,in re briggs,schmidt am.fletcher bank trust in re schmidt,but see green cash register.ci.in re green,holding that such an attempt at linkage is inherently coercive and,therefore,violates the automatic stay.
we too reject a per se rule.when an individual debtor voluntarily files for bankruptcy,he usually has the option of proceeding under either chapter or chapter.unlike chapter,chapter contains a cram down provision,a b,which permits a debtor to retain the collateral underlying a secured obligation without the creditor approval.bank of boston burr in re burr,cir.even if a debtor belatedly decides that cramming down is in his best interest,a decision to file under chapter ordinarily is not irrevocable.the bankruptcy code,with only a few exceptions,see a,allows a debtor who initially has filed for chapter relief to jump midstream to chapter.
conversely,a debtor who persists in traveling the chapter route knows that reaffirmation depends entirely on his ability to come to terms with the secured creditor.he also knows or,at least,has every reason to expect that the creditor may drive a hard bargain.hence,a debtor must bear some degree of responsibility for choosing to proceed under chapter.
perhaps more important,the bankruptcy code does not outlaw linkage as an element of reaffirmation negotiations.the absence of such a prohibition makes sense,for a secured creditor insistence on linkage does not forc
