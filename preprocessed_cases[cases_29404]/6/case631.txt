monon corporation once was among the largest manufacturers of,containers,and container chassis,producing about units a day.early in,however,monon principal customer cut back on orders and the lost business could not be replaced.production fell to about units a day in january,dropping to in april and in august.this decline in sales produced a liquidity crisis,as the firm fixed obligations and payroll could not be cut as fast as the order book shriveled.thomas rosby,monon ceo and holder of of its equity,and john franklin,its cfo and holder of,watched the finances closely.
much of monon working capital came from congress financial corporation,a factor that advanced credit on the security of monon inventory and receivables.monon could draw on the credit as soon as it started production of each new unit.during monon began a fraud.it would,for example,report starting units on a day when only actually entered production.as sales continued to decrease,however,monon had to report more and more early starts,so that it could retire older advances.congress was left unsecured for the difference between actual and reported production.the unsecured draw against the revolving credit increased from about million in march to million in august,when congress discovered the fraud.after monon filed for bankruptcy on september,congress completed many of the falsely reported units at its own expense and risk.its net loss was about million.
monon also borrowed from credit corporation and anthem premium finance.these firms made loans that monon was supposed to use to prepay insurance policies monon agreed to retire the loans with monthly payments roughly equal to the cost of insurance for that month,and the balance was secured by the policies cash value.for simplicity we refer to all of this as insurance even though some workers compensation coverage was arranged through other devices.if,for example,monon secured workers compensation coverage for million a year,the premium finance company would advance that money the unearned portion of the premium that is,the premium attributable to future months would be returned if monon should cancel the policy and thus could be used as security for the loans.during monon reported making larger prepayments than it actually had done.this left credit and anthem unsecured for the difference,and after monon bankruptcy anthem was saddled with net losses of about million and credit about million.
a grand jury charged rosby and franklin with mail and wire fraud for making or causing to be made the misrepresentations that persuaded the lenders to advance funds without the promised security.michael peterson,monon insurance broker,was indicted at the same time and pleaded guilty he testified for the prosecution.following the jury guilty verdict,both rosby and franklin were sentenced to months in prison plus restitution of about million the sum of the three lenders net losses.
defendants principal arguments in this court collapse to a single contention that the false representations were not material because,by making prudent inquiries,the lenders could have figured out what monon was doing.to the extent defendants maintain that they did not know what the lenders were being told,the jury contrary conclusion is unimpeachable.they do not contend that the jury was bound to find that the lenders actually understood the truth,and they did not ask for an instruction presenting the knowledge question to the jury,but they do say that even taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution the evidence compels a conclusion that cautious lenders ought to have done more,or better,checking,and that these inquiries would have turned up the truth.
this line of argument starts with neder united states,d,which held that materiality is an element of the offense under.the court observed that fraud is a staple term of the common law and should be read to include its constituents,including materiality,unless congress provides otherwise which it did not in.see also,ernst ernst hochfelder,d securities fraud entails proof of scienter,because this is required at common law tsc industries,northway,d discussing the materiality requirement dirks sec,d drawing on common law to conclude that securities fraud entails proof of duty to disclose.having established that materiality is essential,defendants maintain that at common law a party can not close his eyes to a known risk or act with indifference to that risk but must make reasonable attempts at.for this proposition defendants cite only cases in the illinois state courts the significance of that choice will become clear later.according to defendants,some of the lenders employees had their suspicions yet failed to follow up.this means,defendants insist,that the representations were not material.
defendants recognize that under other federal statutes a representation may be material even though the hearer strongly suspects that it is false.a witness commits the crime of perjury,for example,if he lies under oath about a subject important to the proceeding,even though the grand jury believes that it knows the truth.united states kross,cir united states goguen,cir united states richardson,cir.see also,united states enterprises,d that grand jury already thinks it knows the truth is no defense to a subpoena,for evidence may be material if it can corroborate or refute existing beliefs kungys united states,d false statement to immigration officials violates a even if agency readily could have discovered the truth united states whitaker,cir material false statement to investigating agency violates even if agency knows the truth.a representation is material if it has a tendency to influence the decision of the audience to which it is addressed.see neder,at,citing restatement of torts basic levinson,d.by referring to the common law,however,neder departed from the approach of perjury and other statutes by imposing on the audience a duty to investigate for its so defendants maintain.
this confuses materiality with reliance.at common law,both materiality in the sense of tendency to influence and reliance in the sense of actual influence are essential in private civil suits for damages.that why,if the issuer of securities furnishes an investor with the truth in writing,the investor can not claim to have been defrauded by an oral misrepresentation whether the writing actually conveys the truth or just calls the oral statement into question,the investor is on notice.see,acme propane,tenexco,cir.it is also why an investor disclaimer of reliance on certain representations,as part of a declaration that the investor has done and is relying on his own investigation,defeats a private damages action for securities fraud.see,rissman rissman,cir jackvony riht financial,cir breyer,enterprises,caruso,ginsburg.
reliance is not,however,an ordinary element of federal criminal statutes dealing with fraud.neder so holds for in particular.t he government is correct that the fraud statutes did not incorporate all the elements of fraud.the requirements of justifiable reliance and damages,for example,plainly have no place in the federal fraud statutes.at.emphasis in original.once the supreme court excludes reliance as a separate element of the offense,it will not do for appellate judges to roll reliance into materiality that would add through the back door an element barred from the front.reliance is not an aspect of the materiality element in prosecutions.accord,united states fernandez,cir united states gee,cir.
defendants do not argue that by extending credit,despite monon noncompliance with some of the contracts written terms,the lenders agreed to modify their arrangements and forego the promised security.maybe such an argument has been withheld because those employees of the lenders who suspected or should have suspected what was afoot lacked authority to change the deal.episodes modeled on potemkin villages suggest as much whenever lenders senior personnel or auditors called to check on their collateral,monon scurried to convey the appearance though not the reality of extra production starts or insurance with cash value.that monon continued m
