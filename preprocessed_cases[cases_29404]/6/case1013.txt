csb and first american,cash america,and georgia cash america 
county bank and express check 
fbd and creditcorp 
appellants,banks and agents,contended that the banks were making loans to georgians using the agents in georgia.the type of loans at issue in this case are loans that are,loans,in amounts up to for terms of four to days,with maturity dates generally coinciding with the borrower next payday,so that the loans are termed payday loans.at maturity,the borrower is required to repay the principal plus a finance charge of anywhere from to of the amount advanced,depending on the term of the loan.for a loan,these finance charges are equivalent to an annual percentage rate of interest between and.
the particular payday loan programs at issue in this appeal are evidenced by the consumer loan agreement and the separate servicing agreement provided by bankwest,which we have been led by the parties to believe are typical of those used by all four banks and their agents.prior to the enactment of the georgia act at issue,appellants were making and administering the type of payday loan program reflected in the loan and servicing agreements in the record.
procedural history 
in april,the georgia legislature enacted senate bill.laws,now codified at ann.to the act.the act provides that its effective date is may.
shortly after the act was passed,each of the four appellant banks,joined by its georgia agent or agents,filed a complaint the complaints against the appellees,the georgia attorney general and the georgia secretary of state the state.each complaint sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against enforcement of the act,as well as a declaratory judgment that the provisions of the act that apply to their payday loan programs and servicing agreements,which predated the act,were preempted by federal law and were unconstitutional.the district court consolidated the four cases and heard argument on the motions for a preliminary injunction.
because the act was scheduled to go into effect on may,the district court entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the act against appellants in their respective conduct of their payday loan businesses at issue in the case.
two days before the temporary restraining order was set to expire,the district court denied appellants motions for a preliminary injunction and refused to enter an injunction pending appeal.the district court found that appellants had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits as to any of their claims.the court also concluded that the balance of harms favored the state and weighed against issuing an injunction and that enjoining enforcement of the act would harm the public interest.
appellants then filed notices of appeal as well as motions asking this court to issue an injunction pending appeal.we denied the motions for an injunction pending appeal.
on june,a panel of this court affirmed the district court preliminary injunction ruling in a decision.see bankwest.on december,this court en banc granted appellants petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel decision.see bankwest,baker,cir.
on march,while the case was being briefed at the en banc stage,the state filed a suggestion of mootness.the state contends that this appeal is now moot as a result of regulatory actions or activities of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic that,as a practical matter,have caused the appellant banks not only to cease making the type of loans at issue but also to withdraw from the servicing agreements that were the subject of the preliminary injunction ruling.in short,the state argues that appellants are no longer pursuing or even poised to pursue or resume the particularized loan program and servicing agreements that were the subject of the preliminary injunction motions and this appeal.appellants filed responses to the suggestion of mootness,which we detail later,most of which contend that the appeal is not moot.
on april,the en banc court vacated its order granting rehearing en banc and remanded the appeal to the panel to address the mootness issue,bankwest,wl cir,which we now do.
ii.discussion 
cessation of payday loans and servicing agreements 
the state suggestion of mootness represents that as a result of the regulatory actions or activities of the fdic,the appellant banks have ceased making the type of payday loans at issue in this appeal and have withdrawn from the servicing agreements or agency relationships with the appellant parties also at issue here.
appellants do not contest the state factual representations,and indeed,their written responses appear to concede them.for example,bankwest response to the suggestion of mootness acknowledges that 
the fdic advised bankwest that it should exit the payday lending business unless it could immediately present to the fdic a plan as to how it intended to satisfy the fdic stated concerns at this time,bankwest has elected not to pursue such a plan with the fdic,and is effectively out of the classic payday lending business in georgia 
bankwest response to suggestion of mootness at.similarly,csb response states that b ecause of regulatory pressure from the fdic unrelated to the merits of this case,the bank is in the process of discontinuing its payday loan program csb response to suggestion of mootness at.
likewise,county bank response states that 
i n,the fdic issued its guidelines on payday lending which became effective in july.as a result of these new federal rules that limited the number and duration of payday loans,county bank made a determination that it was no longer profitable for county bank to be involved with this type of lending.as of december,county bank ceased offering payday loans and,as of december,county bank ended its relationships with all of its loan servicers.
county bank and express check response to suggestion of mootness at.in the same vein,fbd response states that t he state suggestion of mootness with respect to fbd is based on a press release issued by fbd to the effect that the bank has been forced by the fdic to discontinue making payday loans.fbd response to suggestion of mootness at.fbd does not contest that it issued the press release,which the state provided to this court,or that it has stopped making the type of payday loans at issue here.
as we have already noted,this appeal involves a specific type of loan program in georgia,termed payday lending,that was conducted through a particular set of loan and servicing agreements.the amounts,terms,duration,and conditions of the loans at issue and the extensive provisions of the servicing agreements formed the factual foundation of the preliminary injunction ruling in the district court and framed the issues on appeal.see bankwest,d at bankwest,at bankwest,at carnes,dissenting.
given the recent developments and significant change in factual circumstances,including the complete collapse of the factual underpinning of the preliminary injunction ruling,we agree with the state that the present appeal from the preliminary injunction ruling no longer presents a justiciable controversy within the meaning of article iii of the constitution.we now discuss the constraint on our jurisdiction and then explain why we must dismiss this appeal as moot.
principles 
the rule that federal courts may not decide cases that have become moot derives from article iii case and controversy requirement.sierra club epa,cir see also const.art.iii.a n action that is moot can not be characterized as an active case or controversy.al najjar ashcroft,cir citation omitted.the requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings,trial and appellate.lewis cont l bank,d accord horton city of augustine,cir.
dismissal of a moot case is required because mootness is jurisdictional.sierra club,at.the case or controversy constraint imposes a dual limitation known as justiciability on federal courts.de la teja united states,cir citations omitted.the doctrine of justiciability prevents courts from encroaching on the powers of the elected branches of government and guarantees that courts consider only matters presented in an actual adversarial context.id.citations omitted.
as the supreme court has defined the doctrine of mootness,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.id.at citing powell mccormack,d.a case can become moot either due to a change in factual circumstances,or due to a change in the law.coral springs,city of sunrise,cir.if a lawsuit is mooted by subsequent developments,any decision a federal court might render on the merits of the case would constitute an impermissible advisory opinion.adver.city of miami,cir,cert.denied,d see also coral springs,at.an appellate court simply does not have jurisdiction under article iii to decide questions which have become moot by reason of intervening events.brooks.state bd.of elections,cir citations omitted.t he article iii case or controversy requirement mandates that the case be viable at all stages of the litigation it is not sufficient that the controversy was live only at its inception.id.citation omitted.we determine on a basis whether a case or controversy exists.gte directories publ g trimen,cir hendrix poonai,cir.
application of principles to this appeal 
application of these principles to this appeal is not difficult.the payday loan programs that formed the heart of,and gave rise to,the preliminary injunction ruling are no longer being used by any of the appellants.more importantly,the fdic has taken certain regulatory action and appellants have now abandoned their servicing agreements and are no longer in a position to offer,or resume offering,the payday loans that were the subject of the preliminary injunction ruling.as a result,appellants no longer have a legally cognizable interest in obtaining an injunction against enforcement of the act as it might have applied to their making and administering these particular types of payday loans and servicing agreements.see de la teja,at stating that a case is moot when the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.
indeed,the motions for a preliminary injunction and the district court ruling on them were specific as to the particular loan program reflected in the loan and servicing agreements in the record.stated another way,the appeal before us is about the validity of the act as applied to a specific type of payday loan said to be between the appellant banks and georgia borrowers,and serviced and marketed through a specific type of servicing agreement between the banks and a specific type of agent in georgia.we recognize that the parties still dispute whether the act is legally valid.however,appellants have not just ceased but have exited the payday loan business reflected in the loan and servicing agreements in the record.for that reason,they no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the issue of whether the act can be validly applied to those loans and servicing agreements.in short,there is no actual adversarial context for our ruling in this appeal.see id.at noting that courts consider only matters presented in an actual adversarial context citation omitted.thus,this appeal of the district court denial of appellants motions for a preliminary injunction no longer presents a live controversy 
appellants,or at least some of them,raise two primary arguments as to why their appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling is not moot.we address each argument in turn.
collection of loans 
three of the appellants bankwest,express check,and creditcorp argue that the appeal is not moot because they already own or may purchase loans that were made before the effective date of the act,which they have not collected.they say that they are afraid to collect those loans because of the threat that the act sanctions will be applied to them.they contend that the act can not be validly applied to those loans,and therefore,the state should be enjoined from attempting to apply it to them.
more specifically,bankwest states that it had loans outstanding of over representing funds advanced on small excess rate loans prior to the effective date of the act that it stopped collecting due to the risk of violating the act.bankwest response to suggestion of mootness at.bankwest asserts that if the act were deemed to be preempted,it would evaluate whether to resume collection activities or sell its portfolio,taking into account the relevant costs and benefits.id.at 
one servicer,express check,asserts that in april,it acquired all of county bank uncollected loans,worth approximately,and that it ceased collecting those loans as of the effective date of the act.additionally,creditcorp,another servicer,states that it intends to collect loans currently outstanding to fbd if the georgia law is preempted,although creditcorp concedes that it has not purchased any of the loans made by fbd and is only informed that fbd would need creditcorp to collect those loans in georgia if and when the georgia law was overturned.decl.of creditcorp president steve scoggins at scoggins decl.
the insurmountable hurdle for appellants is that these uncollected loans,by appellants own admission,were made prior to the effective date of the act,and in this case,the state has never suggested that the act applies retroactively to loans made before the effective date of the act.indeed,the state conceded in the district court that the act does not apply to loans,the district court agreed,bankwest,d at,and no party has suggested in its appellate briefs that the act does apply to loans.
therefore,although some appellants own or may purchase uncollected loans,there is no case or controversy as to those loans.see graham butterworth,cir where florida attorney general and local state attorney had repeatedly stated that the statute does not prohibit the appellants proposed conduct,the appellees could not enforce the statute against the appellants,and the case was render ed moot see also christian coal.of cole,cir case was moot where the supposed enforcement policy of a regulatory body was evidenced only by a withdrawn advisory opinion and the plaintiffs could be reasonably certain that charges would never be filed under the enforcement policy.indeed,appellants make no allegation that the state or anyone else has threatened to prosecute them under the act for their loans.
furthermore,even without the georgia attorney general explicit concession,there would be no credible or objectively reasonable threat of future enforcement of the act against these loans.doe pryor,cir plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a statutory provision where there was no credible threat of their being prosecuted under it after the state attorney general had stated that it could not be constitutionally applied to them and where fear of prosecution was not objectively reasonable.georgia law is clear that the act does not apply to these loans.the georgia
