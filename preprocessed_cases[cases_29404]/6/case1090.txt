this is a tax refund action brought by taxpayer national westminster bank plc natwest,a united kingdom corporation,for the tax years.the government appeals from the judgment of the united states court of federal claims trial court or court that natwest is entitled to a refund of plus interest for the tax years at issue.central to the trial court judgment is the issue of whether the application of treasury regulation is consistent with the united states obligations under article of the convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains,the treaty.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
the treaty,which governs this dispute,was initially negotiated and signed by the united states and the united kingdom in at.as may be surmised from its title,the treaty states that its purpose is the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains.id.at.of particular import to this case,article governs the taxing authority of the signatories with respect to the business profits of an enterprise operating in both countries.id.at.
natwest is a united kingdom corporation engaged in international banking activities.for the tax years,natwest conducted wholesale banking operations in the united states through six permanently established branch locations collectively the branch.on its united states federal income tax returns for the years at issue,natwest claimed deductions for accrued interest expenses as recorded on the books of the branch.on audit,the internal revenue service irs recomputed the interest expense deduction according to the formula set forth in treasury regulation.the formula excludes consideration of interbranch transactions for the determination of assets,liabilities,and interest expenses.reg.a the formula also imputes or estimates the amount of capital held by the branch based on either a fixed ratio or the ratio of natwest average total worldwide liabilities to average total worldwide assets.id.b.pursuant to the irs recalculation of the interest expense deduction,natwest taxable income was increased by approximately million for the years at issue.
natwest concluded that the increased income would result in an additional tax liability of at least million in the united states for which a foreign tax credit would not be available in the united kingdom.natwest thus requested,under article of the treaty,that the united kingdom enter competent authority proceedings with the united states to resolve the double taxation issue.pursuant to the competent authority proceedings,the united kingdom presented natwest with a settlement offer,which natwest concluded did not sufficiently address its double taxation concerns.natwest rejected the settlement offer,paid the additional taxes,and filed suit in,claiming that the irs application of to an international bank such as natwest violated the terms of the treaty.
the treaty 
after the initial signing of the treaty on december,certain provisions not at issue here were amended by three protocols signed between august and march.at.the treaty took effect on april.id.at.article,entitled business profits,states as follows 
the business profits of an enterprise of a contracting state shall be taxable only in that state unless the enterprise carries on business in the other contracting state through a permanent establishment situated therein.if the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid,the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in that other state but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.
subject to the provisions of paragraph,where an enterprise carries on business in the other contracting state through a permanent establishment situated therein,there shall in each contracting state be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
in the determination of the profits of the permanent establishment,there shall be allowed as deductions those expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment,including a reasonable allocation of executive and general administrative expenses,research and development expenses,interest,and other expenses incurred for the purposes of the enterprise as a whole or the part thereof which includes the permanent establishment,whether incurred in the state in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.
id.at emphasis added.relating the terms of the treaty to the present appeal,a contracting state is the united kingdom,the other contracting state is the united states,an enterprise is natwest,and a permanent establishment is the branch.the emphasized portion of paragraph sets forth the separate enterprise principle and frames the dispute in this case.
treasury regulation 
treasury regulation was proposed on february,adopted on december,and took effect on february.as described by the government,the regulation sets forth a formula for apportioning the interest expense of foreign corporations.the formula applies to all foreign corporations with permanent establishments in the united states and makes no exception for banks or other financial institutions.
at the outset,i loans,assets,liabilities,and interest expense amounts resulting from loan or credit transactions of any type between the separate offices or branches of the same foreign corporation are disregarded.a.the deductible interest expense is then calculated according to a formula.in step one,the permanent establishment assets total value of all assets of the corporation that generate,have generated,or could reasonably have been or be expected to generate income,gain,or loss effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states are determined according to the books of the permanent establishment,exclusive of the intracorporate transactions disregarded under a.b.in step two,the permanent establishment liabilities are estimated either by multiplying the assets by a capital ratio of or by the ratio of the average total amount of corporate worldwide liabilities to the average total value of corporate worldwide assets.b.in step three,the interest deduction is computed under either the branch pool method or the separate currency pools method.b.the irs used the branch pool method to audit the branch.under this method,the permanent establishment is allowed an interest deduction on the larger of the liabilities or the average total amount of liabilities,again exclusive of transactions disregarded under a,shown on the books of the permanent establishment.b i a,b.the branch pool method further specifies which interest rate s will be used to determine the total amount of the interest expense deduction.id.
proceedings in the court of federal claims 
the parties agree,both before the trial court and on appeal,that the treaty requires that the branch be taxed as if it were a separate enterprise from separate enterprise principle.the parties differ with respect to the manner in which the separate enterprise principle treats interest expenses on intracorporate loans,interbranch loans between the branch and natwest other branches and the allocation of capital to the branch.the trial court decided these issues in three separate summary judgment opinions and orders.
on for partial summary judgment,the trial court concluded that the application of to a bank such as natwest violated the terms of the treaty.westminster bank,plc united states,turner,natwest i.during briefing,the united kingdom submitted an amicus brief supporting the natwest position and advocating the result arrived at by the trial court.see br.amicus curiae of the hereinafter amicus br.specifically,the court found that the exclusion of all interbranch transactions from the determination of the allowable interest expense violated the separate enterprise principle of the treaty.natwest i.at.the court concluded that the separate enterprise principle required that the determination of the profits of the branch be based on the books of account as the branch would maintain them if it were a distinct and separate enterprise dealing wholly independently with the remainder of the foreign corporation,without reference to the worldwide information of natwest.id.at.the books of account,however,are subject to adjustment as may be necessary for imputation of adequate capital to the branch and to insure use of market rates in computing interest expense.id.subsequent to the issuance of the natwest i opinion,judge turner retired and the case was transferred to judge firestone.
the parties then filed for partial summary judgment regarding the manner in which the irs should determine or estimate the amount of adequate capital held by the branch.westminster bank,plc united states,firestone,natwest ii.the government argued that it was permitted to attribute capital to the branch based on regulatory and marketplace capital requirements that applied to bank corporate yardstick.id.at.natwest argued that the treaty did not permit the imputation of capital to the branch based on capital requirements to which it was not subject.id.at.the court ruled in natwest favor,concluding that the separate enterprise principle did not require or allow the government to adjust the books and records of the branch to reflect hypothetical infusions of capital based upon banking and market requirements that do not apply to the branch.id.at.rather,the court adopted natwest position that only capital actually allotted to the branch is relevant to a determination of the branch tax liability and that the irs may only allocate additional capital to the extent that the books of the branch do not properly record allotted capital.id.at.
after the decision in natwest ii,the moved to reopen discovery regarding the amount of capital that the books of natwest home office show as being allotted to the branch.the government put forth a new theory that capital held by other branches should be imputed to the branch,but the court found that the government waived this theory by failing to present it during the briefing stage of natwest ii.westminster bank,plc united states,hereinafter order denying reconsideration.
in the third summary judgment opinion,the trial court considered whether uncontroverted facts supported natwest assertion that,consistent with the holdings of natwest i and natwest ii,the branch was entitled to a refund of plus interest.westminster bank plc united states,natwest iii.the court partially granted natwest motion for summary judgment and reached the following conclusions the books and records of the branch were accurately maintained the six branch locations of the branch constituted a single permanent establishment under the treaty the branch did not claim deductions based on interest expenses paid on allotted capital or amounts to be treated as allotted capital the branch paid and received arm length interest rates on money market transactions and issues of material fact required a trial on whether the branch paid and received arm length interest rates on clearing account transactions.id.at.the parties then settled the remaining issue of interest rates on the clearing account transactions,and the court entered final judgment in natwest favor.the government timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the government presents three issues on appeal.first,the government appeals the ruling of natwest i and argues that the application of treasury regulation to natwest is consistent with the expectations of the united states and the united kingdom at the time the treaty was negotiated,signed,and entered into force.second,the government appeals the ruling of natwest ii and submits that as an alternative to,the proposed corporate yardstick method is a permissible means for imputing capital to the branch.last,the government appeals the ruling of the order denying reconsideration and requests that it be allowed to take discovery of natwest home office books to determine the capital actually allotted to the branch.should we uphold natwest i,natwest ii,and the order denying reconsideration,the government does not appeal the trial court ruling in natwest iii.

the entire context of the treaty is informed by,and is based on,the office of economic cooperation and development oecd draft double taxation convention on income and capital draft convention.see natwest i.at exec,at,as reprinted in,technical explanation of the convention between the government of the united states of america and the government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains signed at london,on december,as amended by the notes exchanged at london on april,the protocol signed at london on august,and the second protocol signed at london on march,submitted to the senate foreign relations committee at hearings held on july,reprinted in,hereinafter technical explanation.as published,the model articles of the draft convention issued as annex i to a report of introductory and explanatory material.draft convention.annex ii consists of commentaries on the articles of the draft convention commentaries that are intended to be of great assistance in the application of the conventions and,in particular,in the settlement of eventual disputes.draft convention see also natwest i.at.the senate report and the technical explanation both state specifically that article of the treaty is based on or substantially similar to article of the model convention.see at.
in natwest i,the trial court concluded that the application of to the branch of natwest violated the separate enterprise principle of the treaty.at.focusing on paragraphs and of article,the trial court concluded that the plain language of the treaty required that for a determination of the taxable income of the branch,
the branch is to be regarded as an independent,separate entity dealing at arm length with other units of natwest as if they were wholly unrelated,except that the branch may deduct,in addition to its own expenses,a reasonable allocation of home office expense.words such as distinct and separate and the phrase dealing wholly independently emphasis added would appear to permit no other interpretation.
id.at.the trial court also analyzed the commentaries,which describe payments of interest made by different parts of a financial enterprise a bank to each other on advances,as distinct from capital allotted to them,as narrowly related to the ordinary business of such enterprises.natwest i.at quoting draft convention.thus because expressly disregards payments of interest on these types of interbranch transactions,the court concluded that was inconsistent with the treaty as applied to the branch of natwest natwest i.at.the court further noted that if the branch was a subsidiary of natwest separately incorporated in the united states,the interest expense on transactions between the branch and foreign natwest branches would be subject to adjustment but would not be disregarded.id.at see also reg.a.
on appeal,the government criticizes the trial court conclusion in natwest i on the following grounds the court ignored the treaty plain language the court misapplied the commentaries that support the government position the court ignored the parties shared expectations and the court did not accord proper deference to the treasury consistent determination that the regulation is consistent with article.
we agree with the trial court analysis of the plain language of the treaty.on a fundamental level,we do not read the separate enterprise language of article,that the branch business profits be determined as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment as permitting transactions between the permanent establishment and the enterprise to be disregarded.as did the trial court,we find the comparison to a separately incorporated subsidiary instructive.in that situation,intracorporate transactions recorded on the subsidiary books are not disregarded,but are adjusted to reflect arm length terms.see,reg.a defining arm length interest rate as the rate of interest which was charged,or would have been charged at the time the indebtedness arose,in independent transactions with or between unrelated parties under similar circumstances.the plain language of the treaty thus indicates that adjustment of the terms of intracorporate transactions is required and that the disregard of these transactions is prohibited.
to the extent that the government submits that the reasonable allocation language of article,is relevant to whether is permissible under the treaty,the government misreads the treaty.with regard to allowable deductions for a determination of the profits of a permanent establishment,the model convention,which differs slightly from the treaty,reads as follows 
in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment,there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred,whether in the state in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.
draft convention.the treaty modifies this language by including a nonexclusive list of executive and general administrative expenses that are incurred on behalf of the enterprise as a whole,natwest worldwide enterprise including the branch and that may be partially allocated to the permanent establishment,natwest branch.
in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment,there shall be allowed as deductions those expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment,including a reasonable allocation of executive and general administrative expenses,research and development expenses,interest and other expenses incurred for the purposes of the enterprise as a whole or the part thereof which includes the permanent establishment,whether incurred in the state in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.
at emphasis added.importantly,the reasonable allocation language refers to expenses,such as interest,that are incurred for the purposes of the enterprise as a whole.furthermore,a comparison of the treaty to the model convention indicates that no reasonable allocation is necessary for expenses,such as interest,that are directly incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment.
as previously noted,the draft convention was published as part of a document that included the commentaries,the purpose of which is to illustrate or interpret the provisions and to be of great assistance in the settlement of eventual disputes.natwest i.at quoting draft convention.accordingly,the draft convention states that article settles the question of the expenses which must be allowed as deductions in computing the profits of the permanent establishment.draft convention.among these expenses that must be allowed are interbranch payments of interest on advances,as distinct from capital allotted to the permanent establishment.draft convention.this commentary indicates that disregard of interbranch transactions is inconsistent with the draft convention and the treaty as modeled thereon.
on the separate enterprise principle specifically,the commentary to article,states,t he profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are those which that permanent establishment would have made if,instead of dealing with its head office,it had been dealing with an entirely separate enterprise under conditions and at prices prevailing in the ordinary market.draft convention.to determine these profits,it is always necessary to start with the real facts of the situation as they appear from t he business records of the permanent establishment and to adjust as may be shown to be necessary the profit figures which those facts produce.id.exceptions to this rule,however,may exist where no separate accounts exist.id.allowing for formulaic allocation in the absence of separate accounts.the commentary goes on to explain that adjustment to the accounts of the permanent establishment may be necessary in situations such as when the transactions between a permanent establishment and a head office do not reflect market pricing,market interest rates for financial enterprises.id.at.
consistent with the commentary to article,the commentary to article,focuses on whether an expense is incurred by a permanent establishment,rather than whether the expense is paid to a foreign branch of the same worldwide enterprise.f or the sake of removing doubts,the commentary states that article,specifically recognizes that in calculating the profits of a permanent establishment allowance is to be made for expenses,wherever incurred,that were incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment.id.at.the commentary explicitly includes as a deductible expense payments of interest made by different parts of a financial enterprise a bank to each other on advances,as distinct from capital allotted to them,in view of the fact that making and receiving advances is narrowly related to the ordinary business of such enterprises.id.at.
the government argues that the use of formulaic allocations for taxing purposes by both parties during the period between the signing of the treaty and its entry into force is evidence that the parties did not intend for the treaty to prohibit the use of allocation formulas.the government position is undermined in two important respects.first,in the united kingdom abandoned its formula then in use after concluding that the formula was inconsistent with the separate enterprise principle.second,the interest expense allocation formula used by the united states was significantly different than that prescribed by.
the record demonstrates that during the negotiation period of the treaty,the united kingdom did employ a formulaic allocation when determining the interest expense deduction of a branch of a foreign,incorporated in the united states bank.the government reliance on this use in furtherance of its appeal is misplaced.referred to in the record as the price waterhouse formula pw formula,the united kingdom used the ratio of the bank worldwide total free capital to total liabilities and compared the liabilities of the branch to the bank total liabilities to allocate free capital to the branch for taxation purposes.natwest ii.at.if the branch allocated free capital was less than the net balance owed to the bank head office,a formula was then used to calculate the interest rate on the remainder of the net balance less an amount equal to allocated capital that would be used to determine the amount of the deduction.unlike,the pw formula does not disregard transactions simply because they occurred between branches of the same worldwide enterprise.in addition,the united kingdom abandoned use of the pw formula in after determining that the formulaic capital allocation violated the separate enterprise principle under the treaty that was in effect before the treaty entered into force in.natwest ii.at citing counsel opinion.the separate enterprise language of that earlier treaty was nearly identical to the language of the treaty and the united kingdom continued to maintain that the pw formula was equally violative of the supplanting language in the treaty.see inland revenue,banking manual app.this contemporaneous conduct of the united kingdom supports the position taken in its amicus brief filed with the trial united kingdom has never interpreted the provisions of the treaty as allowing a taxing authority to disregard interbranch transactions when computing the interest expense properly deductible by a permanent establishment.amicus br.letter from hunter,inland revenue,to donald bergherm,assistant commissioner international,internal revenue service march,re request for competent authority consideration dated july.
nor is the government position supported by its own conduct contemporaneous to the negotiations of the treaty.the government points to revenue ruling,concluding that the interest expense apportionment formulas of treasury regulation were permissible in view of the business profits article of the treaty,which was also based on oecd model convention,as supporting its argument that treasury consistent interpretation of is informative of the united states intent as a signatory to the treaty.this argument,however,overlooks the key difference between the allocation formula of and the formula of,that does not explicitly disregard interbranch transactions when determining the interest expense deductible by a permanent establishment.reg.e v,vi apportioning appropriate amount of worldwide interest expense to permanent establishment.in addition,expressly stated that if treaty provisions apply to the determination of taxable income,the treaty takes precedence over the regulation reg.f iv.
the government submits that its unwavering,position is to be accorded significant deference.the government correctly notes that a lthough not conclusive,the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.sumitomo,at.according great deference to agency position where treaty signatories,neither of which were parties to the lawsuit,agreed as to interpretation.courts nevertheless interpret treaties for themselves.kolovrat oregon,d.moreover,because we are to interpret treaties so as to give effect to the intent of both signatories,xerox,at,an agency position merits less deference where an agency and another country disagree on the meaning of a treaty,see iceland steamship,eimskip dep t of the army.finally,this court,when considering different provisions of the treaty,has declined to defer to treasury contemporaneous interpretation where it conflicted with the contemporaneous intent of the senate.xerox,at rejecting agency interpretation that was published during the ratification process and reasserted at trial.
the government is correct to assert that it has unwaveringly interpreted as being consistent with the treaty and other similar treaties based on the draft convention.see,rul,consistent with treaty rul,consistent with treaty.indeed,in a report issued in,the oecd itself acknowledged that the united states interpretation of article of the draft convention allowed for the application of to international financial institutions.comm.on fiscal affairs,oecd,transfer pricing and multinational enterprises hereinafter oecd report.the oecd report is,however,the earliest indication in the record of the treasury belief in the consistency between and the treaty.given the gap between the signing of the treaty and the issuance of the oecd report and the gap between the implementation of the treaty and the issuance of the report,the consistent position of the treasury as of can hardly be read as dispositive of the issue of the intent of the united states and the united kingdom in when the treaty was when considering that was not even proposed until february.furthermore,to the extent that the oecd report establishes that the united states had taken the position that is consistent with the treaty,the report establishes that of the oecd members including the united kingdom,the united states and japan were the only two that interpreted the draft convention in this fashion.oecd report.thus,even if the united states interpretation of the draft convention,and thereby the treaty,can be established as of the publication date of the oecd report,the united kingdom contrary interpretation is established as of the same date.
the record,therefore,contains no evidence prior to the oecd report that either party understood the separate enterprise principle as allowing a method of determining the interest expense of the branch that disregards interbranch transactions.the predecessor to this court,however,did consider conduct of the parties,i n an appropriate case,to be relevant to the interpretation of a treaty terms.life,at.in life,the court of claims found that the government proffered interpretation at trial was consistent with the legislative history of the treaty at issue,the almost contemporaneous subsequent legislative action,and the negotiation of later signed treaties.id.at.it was this consistency that lent interpretive weight to the government conduct.id.with respect to the treaty,the united states conduct after the adoption of is internally consistent as of the publication of the oecd report,but the government fails to adequately support its contention that this conduct is consistent with the expectations of the united states and the united kingdom when the treaty was signed.the record evidence of the united states conduct seems even less relevant in view of the signatories contemporaneous acknowledgment that the treaty is based on the model convention,the commentary to which explicitly authorizes deductions for interest expenses incurred on interbranch advances.
in sum,we find that the plain language of the separate enterprise that expenses incurred for the benefit of the branch be deductible,including interest expenses paid to foreign branches of natwest.our reading of the plain language finds direct support in the commentary and the contemporaneous understanding of the united kingdom.moreover,there is very little evidence that the contemporaneous understanding of the united states differed in any way from that of the united kingdom.lastly,the government current interpretation of the treaty is entitled to minimal deference where it contravenes the treaty language and negotiation history,as well as the contemporaneous expectations of the united kingdom.for these reasons,we conclude that treasury regulation is inconsistent with the treaty as applied to a permanent establishment of an international financial enterprise,the branch of natwest during the tax years at issue.
after rejecting the application of to the branch in natwest i,the court considered in natwest ii the method by which the books of the branch should be adjusted for the imputation of adequate capital to the branch and to insure use of market rates in computing interest expenses.natwest i.at natwest ii.at.the government argued that the separate enterprise principle required the branch to be taxed as if it were a separately incorporated institution and that the branch should be deemed to hold an amount of capital equal to that required of similarly sized banks,as compared to for the largest banks the corporate yardstick.natwest ii.at.conversely,natwest argued that the imputation of capital on any basis other than an adjustment of the branch books to reflect actually allotted capital was improper under the treaty.id.at.
at issue is whether the separate enterprise principle was intended by the parties to require a permanent establishment to be taxed as a separately incorporated institution or to be taxed according to the reality of its situation and accounts
