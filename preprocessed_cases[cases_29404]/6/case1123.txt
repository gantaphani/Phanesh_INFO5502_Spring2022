this is an appeal from a district court decision holding a patent invalid for indefiniteness.because we conclude that the patent is not indefinite,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
bancorp services,is the owner of united states patent,system for managing a stable value protected investment plan the patent.the patent describes a system for administering and tracking the value of life insurance policies in separate accounts.the kinds of life insurance policies that are subject to the system claimed by the patent include separate account policies issued pursuant to corporate owned life insurance coli and bank owned life insurance boli plans.under separate account boli and coli plans,the policy owner pays a higher premium than is needed to fund the death benefit.the extra money can then be invested in a variety of financial assets.under federal tax law,the death benefit is not taxed and the gains from the investment assets are even if the policy is ultimately surrendered.banks and corporations have purchased such policies on the lives of their employees to help fund,on a basis,future benefits for the group of insured employees.
separate account policies have existed since the,but their use has been limited because of what is known as the problem.accounting rules ordinarily require boli and coli plan owners to report,from quarter to quarter,the cash surrender value of any policies they own,the amount the owners would receive if they surrendered the policies.that value varies as the market fluctuates,however.banks and corporations would prefer to report a more predictable,stable value on their financial statements,which is what a stable value protected investment allows.
stable value protected investment systems provide a mechanism for stabilizing the reported value of life insurance polices by arranging for a third party guarantor,called the stable value protected writer,to guarantee a particular value for the life insurance policy,regardless of its market value,should the policy have to be paid out prematurely.in order to offset the risk to a potential guarantor for providing that service,the guarantor is paid a fee and restrictions are placed on the policyholder right to cash in the policy.the patent provides a system for administering variable life insurance policies,including those containing stable value protected investments.the patent provides a computerized means for tracking the book value and market value of the policies and calculating the credits representing the amount the stable value protected writer must guarantee and pay should the policy be paid out prematurely.
bancorp obtained a patent on its invention with a priority date of september.in january,bancorp filed suit against hartford life insurance company hartford in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri alleging that hartford had infringed the patent.international corporate management group,icmg,a hartford affiliate,was later added as a defendant.several other claims and counterclaims were added to the lawsuit,but the only issue remaining in dispute on this appeal is bancorp claim against hartford and icmg for patent infringement.
in february,the district court granted summary judgment for hartford and icmg on bancorp patent infringement claim.bancorp,hartford life ins.the court held all the independent claims of the patent invalid for indefiniteness because each of those claims used the term surrender value protected investment credits,which the court held was fatally indefinite.the court noted that the term surrender value protected investment credits was not defined in the patent,and after considering both the text of the patent and the extrinsic evidence proffered by the parties,the court found the term to be so unclear in meaning as to render the patent claims invalid.
the court rejected bancorp argument that the term surrender value protection meant the same thing as stable value protection,a term that is used and defined in the specification.because the court interpreted the term surrender value to mean the value of the entire policy,the value of all of the investments that make up the entire policy minus a surrender charge any outstanding debt,the court concluded that surrender value protected investment credits appeared to refer to credits to the overall policy surrender value rather than to credits applicable to the stable value protected components of the policy.
the court found support for that view in the claim language that referred to the surrender value protected investment credits for the life insurance policy,while,as the court explained,stable value protected investments are only one component,or investment division,of the values that contribute to the overall policy value.the words surrender value,the court concluded,necessarily implicate the value of the entire policy.
in addition,the court noted that the independent claims of the patent used the terms stable value protected investment and surrender value protected investment credits in close proximity.the court regarded the use of the two different terms in the same claims as supportive of hartford contention that they were not meant to be synonymous.
summarizing its review of the intrinsic this case the claims and written description of the district court concluded that it tends to support the conclusion that the two phrases,surrender value protected and stable value protected can not be synonyms for one another.before adopting that conclusion,however,the court looked to the extrinsic evidence,the evidence offered by the parties as to how the claim language would be understood by persons of skill in the art.
after reviewing the extrinsic evidence offered by each side,the district court credited the testimony of hartford expert that the term surrender value protected investment credits did not have a meaning to persons of skill in the art.the court rejected the testimony of bancorp principal expert on the ground that he was an expert in stable value funds but was not shown to be an expert in life insurance administration.for that reason,the court stated that it can not accept his opinion as evidence of what persons skilled in the art would or would not understand in regard to the phrase surrender value protected investment credits.in addition,the court rejected the testimony of one of the inventors of the patent on the ground that the proffered inventor testimony concerned what the patentee subjectively intended the claims to mean instead of what those skilled in the art would understand the claims to mean.finally,the court rejected bancorp evidence that before the priority date of the patent hartford and its associated companies had used the term surrender value protected investment in their internal communications.the court declined to consider that evidence on the ground that it revealed only hartford internal use of the term and thus did not constitute a public use of the term that would suggest a widely understood meaning for the term in the industry.after reviewing the extrinsic evidence,the court concluded that bancorp had not proffered evidence from any expert skilled in the art of life insurance administration who could state that he understood the meaning of the term surrender value protected investment credits,while hartford had presented at least one expert skilled in the art of life insurance administration who stated that the phrase surrender value protected investment credits would be indefinite to a person skilled in that field of art.based on that testimony and the court reading of the patent,the court concluded that the term surrender value protected investment credits is indefinite and that the asserted claims of the patent,all of which contain that term,are therefore invalid.

the question on which the indefiniteness issue in this case turns is easily stated.all of the independent claims in the patent refer to surrender value protected investment credits for the life insurance policy.hartford argues that the term surrender value protected investment credits is indefinite because the patent does not expressly define the term because the meaning of the term can not be inferred from anything in the patent and because the term does not have a commonly understood meaning to persons of skill in the pertinent fields of art.bancorp responds that the patent makes clear that the term surrender value protected investment credits means the same thing as stable value protected investment credits,a term that is used throughout the patent,and that persons of skill in the pertinent art would so understand it.both bancorp and hartford agree that the acronym svp,which is used throughout the patent,refers to stable value protected investments.bancorp argues that the acronym svp also should be understood to refer to surrender value protected investments,and that the terms svp,stable value protected investments,and surrender value protected investments should all be understood to refer to the same concept.
we agree with bancorp that the meaning of the term surrender value protected investment credits is reasonably discernible and that the asserted claims of the patent are therefore not invalid for indefiniteness.it is true that the entire term surrender value protected investment credits is not defined in the patent,and bancorp has not pointed us to any industry publication that defines the term.nonetheless,the components of the term have meanings,which allow the reader to infer the meaning of the entire phrase with reasonable confidence.
first,the term surrender value has a clear meaning to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art.namely,as the district court noted,surrender value is generally interpreted to mean the value of all of the components of a life insurance policy minus any surrender charges outstanding debt.see bancorp,hartford life ins,slip op.at,citing barron dictionary of insurance terms ed.second,the specification of the patent and the extrinsic evidence make it clear that the term protected investment refers to the underlying investment components of an insurance policy or policies whose return is stabilized over time in return for a fee.see patent,to.finally,the specification makes clear the meaning of the word credits.the specification explains that the invention calculates credits due to the targeted return and a present daily investment value.id.at,ll.a credit,therefore,is the difference between the actual value of an investment and the smoothed out or targeted return value of that investment.viewing these components of the claim term together,it is reasonably clear that surrender value protected investment credits means the difference between the actual value of a protected investment and the targeted return value of that investment at the time the protected life insurance policy is surrendered.from this analysis,we conclude that the term surrender value protected investment is not indefinite,but instead has essentially the same meaning as the term stable value protected investment,which the parties agree has a meaning as used in the patent and in the field of investments.
in support of its argument that the patent makes clear the meaning of the term surrender value protected investment credits,bancorp points to dependent claims,and,and the portion of the specification that corresponds to those claims.each of those claims recites notifying a surrender value protected investment writer of the investment value and the value of the underlying securities for the current day.the portion of the specification that corresponds to that claim language states in step,the system notifies the svp writer of the current day investment value and the value of the underlying securities.patent,ll.the correspondence between the claim language and the quoted language from the specification is so close,bancorp argues,that the inference is inescapable that the term svp is intended to be equivalent to the term surrender value protected investment.because it is undisputed that svp,as used in the patent,refers at least to stable value protected investments,bancorp argues that the correspondence between the claim language surrender value protected investment writer and the language of the specification svp writer indicates that the terms surrender value protected investment,stable value protected investment,and svp all mean the same thing as those terms are used in the patent.
we agree with bancorp that the correspondence between the reference to surrender value protected investment writer in the specified claims and the reference to svp writer in the portion of the specification relating to those claims provides substantial support for bancorp contention that,as used in the patent,the terms stable value protected investment,surrender value protected investment,and svp are equivalent.indeed,hartford offers no satisfactory alternative explanation for the apparent correspondence between the term surrender value protected investment and the acronym svp in claims,and,and the portion of the specification dealing with the subject matter of those claims.
instead,hartford seeks to counter that inference from the text of the patent by pointing out that the term surrender value protected investment credits is not defined,or even used,anywhere in the specification,and that each of the independent claims uses both the term stable value protected investment and the term surrender value protected investment.the failure to define the term is,of course,not fatal,for if the meaning of the term is fairly inferable from the patent,an express definition is not necessary although of course the inclusion of a definition would have avoided the need for this and difficult inquiry into indefiniteness.see all dental prodx,llc advantage dental.the question therefore is whether,even in the absence of any express definitions,it is reasonably clear that the term surrender value protected investment credit means the same thing as stable value protected investment credit.
with respect to that question,hartford is correct that the use of both terms in close proximity in the same claim gives rise to an inference that a different meaning should be assigned to each.see ethicon,surgical,stating that if two terms described a single element,one would expect the claim to consistently refer to this element with one or the other of the two terms,but not both,especially within the same clause.that inference,however,is not conclusive it is not unknown for different words to be used to
