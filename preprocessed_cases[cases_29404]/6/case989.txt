section b of the real estate settlement procedures act respa provides 
b splitting charges.no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
b.the principal question this appeal presents is whether,in connection with a residential mortgage loan,charging a loan discount known as points or discount points to provide a specific,interest rate constitutes the rendering of a real estate settlement service within the meaning of b.the district court,dismissing the appellant borrowers complaint for failure to state a violation of b,held that the borrowers payment of such points was not for the rendering of a real estate settlement service.we agree,and therefore affirm the court ruling.
this is a class action brought against quicken loans,quicken by two sets of borrowers keidrick wooten and mitzi wooten,his wife,and billy buckhaults and cheryl buckhaults,his wife these plaintiffs purportedly represent everyone who obtained a residential mortgage loan from quicken and was charged points,but did not receive the specific,interest rate quicken promised.the wootens and buckhaults transactions differed thus,we set them out separately.
before doing so,however,we should point out that plaintiffs counsel,in drafting the complaint in this case,failed to attach to the complaint the notes and mortgages the wootens and buckhaults executed.defense counsel attached the notes to quicken motion to dismiss the complaint,and the district court,over plaintiffs objection,made the instruments part of the complaint relying on them in granting quicken motion.the complaint also alleges that quicken furnished the respective borrowers the statement required by the department of housing and urban development,settlement statement,and that the,on line,indicated that quicken was charging the borrowers a loan discount percentage,or points,for the specific interest rate stated in the mortgage note.as was the case with respect to the notes and mortgages,the presented to the borrowers were not part of the complaint.nor were they attached to quicken motion to dismiss,or referred to by the district court in its dispositive order.to the end that the facts surrounding the loan closings may be presented in full,we consider as part of the complaint both the the borrowers received and,as the district court did,the notes they executed 
on july,the wootens entered into a residential mortgage transaction with quicken.they executed an adjustable rate note for,payable in years,at an initial fixed interest rate of per annum quicken charged the wootens a loan discount fee of,an amount equal to of their loan amount.the wootens did not negotiate for a of the interest rate nor did they receive a lower interest rate in return for paying points.compl.nonetheless,as indicated on line of the that quicken gave them at closing id,they paid a loan discount of for the interest rate stated in their mortgage note,
on july,the buckhaults entered into a residential mortgage transaction with quicken.the buckhaults executed a note for,payable in years,at a fixed interest rate of per annum quicken charged the buckhaults a loan discount fee of,an amount equal to of their loan amount.the buckhaults did not negotiate for a of the interest rate nor did they receive a lower interest rate in return for paying points.id.nonetheless,as indicated on line of the that quicken gave them at closing,id,they paid points,a loan discount of for the interest rate stated in their mortgage note,
the buckhaults and quicken entered into a second residential mortgage transaction on april.id.the buckhaults executed an interest first note for,payable in years,at a fixed interest rate of per annum this time quicken charged the buckhaults a loan discount fee of,an amount equal to of their loan amount.the buckhaults did not negotiate for a of the interest rate nor did they receive a lower interest rate in return for paying points.id.nonetheless,as indicated on line of the that quicken gave them at closing,id,they paid a loan discount of for the interest rate stated in their mortgage note,
the wootens and buckhaults instituted this class action on july.their complaint contained two counts,both founded on the facts recited in parts and count i,brought under b of respa,b and c,alleged that quicken charged the wootens and buckhaults a loan discount fee for which no interest rate discount was given or bargained for id.specifically,
the section charges listed on the were imposed for services that were not bona fide,not rendered,not paid or for nominal,unreasonable or duplicative services for which no fees were earned and for which no fees should have been imposed,all in violation of respa at,and respa implementing regulations,regulation x,at 
id.stripped to its essentials,count i alleges that the agreements the wootens and buckhaults made with quicken did not call for a discounted interest rate and thus did not require the payment of a loan discount,or points.they nonetheless paid the points,receiving nothing in return.
count ii,claims for breach of contract alleged as follows quicken and plaintiffs entered into contract s and quicken charg ed plaintiffs for points but did not actually provid e a n interest rate discount or alternatively charge d for points when no agreement was made for points.id.quicken breached the contract s by charging plaintiffs a loan discount fee without actually providing a lower interest rate or other reasonable service in return.id.the gist of count ii is that the wootens and buckhaults paid quicken for a discounted interest rate but did not receive one,or,alternatively,quicken charged the wootens and buckhaults points they were not supposed to pay.
having laid out the facts surrounding the mortgage loan transactions as described in the complaint,we turn now,in part iii,to the sufficiency of count i to state a case for relief under b of respa and regulation x.in part iv,we consider whether count ii states a case for breach of contract.
the district court concluded that points are not a settlement service,within the meaning of b of respa,but a sum paid to provide an interest rate lower than the interest rate the market required the court thus treated the points as part of the interest quicken charged for the loans.
for a mortgage lender charging of points to violate b,the points must be charged or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan.accordingly,in reviewing the district court dismissal of count i,we begin with the question of whether points represent a charge for rendering a settlement service.if they do not,we proceed to the question of whether the points quicken charged constituted payment for settlement services rather than for providing the borrowers with interest rates.
we begin our analysis with the text of respa,noting that we are necessarily limited in our interpretation of settlement service by the statutory definition and the regulations interpreting it.see,schwarz city of treasure island,cir contemplating the meaning of residence in the context of defining dwelling,beginning with the definitions provided by the applicable statute and hud regulations and,finding nothing applicable,proceeding to the common or ordinary meaning of the term.respa defines a settlement service as any service provided in connection with a real estate settlement.examples of qualifying services include 
origination of a federally related mortgage loan including,but not limited to,the taking of loan applications,loan processing,and the underwriting and funding of such loans rendering of services by a mortgage broker including counseling,taking of applications,obtaining verifications and appraisals,and other loan processing and origination services,and communicating with the borrower and lender provision of any services related to the origination,processing or funding of a federally related mortgage loan provision of title services,including title searches,title examinations,abstract preparation,insurability determinations,and the issuance of title commitments and title insurance policies rendering of services by an attorney preparation of documents,including notarization,delivery,and recordation rendering of credit reports and appraisals rendering of inspections,including inspections required by applicable law or any inspections required by the sales contract or mortgage documents prior to transfer of title conducting of settlement by a settlement agent and any related services provision of services involving mortgage insurance provision of services involving hazard,flood,or other casualty insurance or homeowner warranties provision of services involving mortgage life,disability,or similar insurance designed to pay a mortgage loan upon disability or death of a borrower,but only if such insurance is required by the lender as a condition of the loan provision of services involving real property taxes or any other assessments or charges on the real property rendering of services by a real estate agent or real estate broker and provision of any other services for which a settlement service provider requires a borrower or seller to pay.
in addition,both the provision of title certificates and the handling of the processing,and closing or settlement qualify.
settlement is defined as the process of executing legally binding documents regarding a lien on property that is subject to a federally related mortgage loan.
while the,but illustrative,list of examples provides some guidance,neither the statutory text nor the regulations define what is meant by service.failing a statutory or regulatory definition,we must turn to its common and ordinary meaning.schwarz,at citing coal ass chater,cir.
black law dictionary defines service as the act of doing something useful for a person or company,usu ally for a fee.black law dictionary ed.the definition in webster third new international dictionary is substantially the same action or use that furthers some end or purpose conduct or performance that assists or benefits someone or something deeds useful or instrumental toward some object.webster third new int l dictionary see also webster new world dictionary ed defining service as an act giving assistance or advantage to another,including friendly help also,professional aid or attention.as these sources suggest,the service referred to by respa includes any act undertaken to bring about the execution of a mortgage and note.united states graham mortg,cir t he common thread running among the listed services is that each is an ancillary or peripheral service that is not directly related to the closing of a real estate sale covered by respa.that definition does not include the act of negotiating advance interest terms such as points.
we can find nothing in the legislative history surrounding congress amendments to respa,which were enacted specifically in response to graham,to suggest a broader definition of settlement service.prior to the amendments,the definition of settlement service ended with the phrase services rendered by a real estate agent or broker.patton triad guar.ins,cir.after graham held that the making of mortgage loans was not a settlement service,congress responded by adding the phrase the origination of federally related mortgage loan including,but not limited to,the taking of loan applications,loan processing,and the underwriting and funding of loans,stat.house report explained the reason behind the change 
this mortgage origination issue is before the committee because of the graham decision.united states graham mortgage,cir.in that case,graham mortgage corporation was accused of violating the provisions of section a of respa by charging a developer fewer points on mortgage loans than it customarily charged in exchange for the developer referral to gmc of other mortgage loan customers.although the sixth circuit rejected the government argument by reasoning that the statutory definition of settlement services did not clearly extend to mortgage lending procedures,the committee believes that mortgage lending must be included as a settlement service to preserve the effectiveness of respa as a consumer protection statute.
at,reprinted in.the amendments do not alter our analysis.
as a preliminary matter,we dispense with any comparison to graham.that case involved a loan origination fee,a fee charged by a lender to cover the administrative costs of making a loan.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.this case,in contrast,involves the payment of loan discount points.see graham,at defining point as a fee or charge collected at the inception of the loan,including both loan origination and discount payments,in addition to the interest rate stated on the face of the loan.
moreover,we must note,as the district court did,that respa is still limited to services,a term the statute leaves undefined and that the court in graham did not address.id.at because of the illumination provided by the list of settlement services in of respa,we need not rely upon any purported common understanding of the term service,assuming that such an understanding exists.we can not conceive of a circumstance in which the charging of loan discount points would qualify under our definition of service.the points paid by the wootens and buckhaults were ostensibly in exchange for an interest rate below market,to raise the yield on the loan to the market rate.vandenbroeck commonpoint mortg,cir citations omitted,abrogated on other grounds by bridge phoenix bond indem,d.as such,the points affect the interest rate and go to the very heart of the loan itself.
the wootens and buckhaults do not disagree that the interest rate on the mortgage note is not,per se,a settlement service.br.of appellants at.instead,as prima facie evidence that discount points qualify as a settlement service,they rely on hud placement of the loan discount fee within the number series dedicated to items payable in connection with loan and an informational booklet provided to potential borrowers neither argument is availing.
the that quicken provided the wootens and buckhaults discloses discount points on line.line concerns the loan origination fee,line the appraisal fee,line the credit report,line the lender inspection fee,line the mortgage insurance application fee,and line the assumption fee.because every item in the,save line,represents a fee for a settlement service,the wootens and buckhaults infer that discount points are also qualifying fees.we do not draw such inference.points in this context are part of the loan agreement,not a service provided to borrowers therefore,regardless of its location on the,the line charge could not be for a settlement service.
more troubling,however,is their suggestion that we should defer to the accompanying booklet for our definition of settlement services.hud regulations specifically state that the special information booklet is not a rule,regulation,or interpretation for purposes of respa,meaning that even if the statutory language were unclear,we would owe the booklet no deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see thorpe housing auth.of durham,d comparing a regulation promulgated in a hud manual to handbooks and booklets and concluding the latter are mere instructions,technical suggestions,and items of consideration.
in sum,based on our understanding of the statutory text,we conclude that points are not a settlement service.we now proceed to the question of whether,as the wootens and buckhaults contend,the points they paid were not for a interest rate but,instead,were for services unrelated to interest.
in reviewing de novo the district court dismissal of count i we,like the district court,assume that the factual allegations in the complaint are true and give the plaintiffs the benefit of reasonable factual inferences.
to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows
