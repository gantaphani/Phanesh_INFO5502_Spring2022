in this case,neither the march nor the april construction contract,between dell merk and franzia bobcat central,contained an attorney fees clause.however,both the note and the security agreement executed by dell merk for the loan from bank contain an attorney fees clause.the note requires dell merk to pay attorney fees incurred by bank in any collection upon default.the security agreement required dell merk to pay bank any attorney fees it incurred in connection with the enforcement of th e agreement.
after judgment was entered against bank,franzia,a nonsignatory to both the note and security agreement,filed a motion for attorney fees contending it was entitled to fees from bank under the reciprocity provision of section because bank would have been entitled to its fees if it had prevailed in the litigation against franzia.the trial court granted franzia its attorney fees and costs in the amount of.
we conclude franzia was entitled to attorney fees and costs for its defense of bank claim of breach of the obligation to pay for failure to make the first progress payment jointly payable to dell merk and bank.since bank only challenges franzia entitlement to its fees and not the amount of the award and since it appears the trial court reduced the originally requested fees to eliminate fees solely attributable to franzia action against dell merk,we shall affirm the amended judgment.
