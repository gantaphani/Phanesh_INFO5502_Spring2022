in prior litigation,pnc financial successfully claimed a foreign tax credit for taxes paid on its behalf in brazil.that credit,the internal revenue service argues,must be reduced by the amount of an indirect subsidy pnc received from the brazilian government.the tax court agreed,and we now affirm.
in an international tax case as complicated,economically and litigiously,as this one,we do well to start with the basics.when a bank makes a loan abroad,the interest income is susceptible to tax in both the united states and the foreign state.congress avoids international business by giving a credit for taxes paid to the foreign government,less any credit,refund,or subsidy given the taxpayer by the foreign government.reg.e.interest income of,for example,where the relevant tax rate in the was and in the foreign country was with a refund,would work out to to the foreign country and to the irs.were the foreign rate with no refund,would flow to that country and nothing to the irs.thus the two countries are on a when one country tax revenue goes up,the other goes down.
this case,or rather this iteration of this case for it is the third time we have heard an appeal from the tax court concerning the same transaction,is a peculiar elaboration of these simple principles during the and early,in an effort to increase its reserves of foreign currency,brazil government borrowed and using tax breaks encouraged its people to borrow substantial amounts from foreign lenders.in,fiscal crisis led nearly to default on the loans,and brazil embarked on a debt restructuring plan with an international consortium of banks.according to the plan,brazil central bank stepped in as common debtor for the foreign banks,becoming a middleman on the old loans paying the creditors what was owed to them from the original borrowers and in turn receiving payments from the original borrowers and,since brazil still needed foreign credit to function,borrowing billions of dollars in additional funds.appellant pnc financial services group,formerly riggs national corporation and subsidiaries lent a portion of those additional funds.in and,brazil taxed pnc interest income at a rate,which came to in and in.but a provision of brazilian law,hanging on from happier economic days when the brazilian government incentivized borrowing from foreign lenders,gave subsidies for these taxes worth of the total in,and in.this appeal is about the tax treatment of that in subsidies.at first glance,it seems obvious enough that pnc should receive a credit of less toward its income tax,and less toward its income tax.but three factors complicate the picture.
first,pnc loans to the central bank were net,not gross.riggs ii gives a matchless explanation of the difference,which we will not belabor here.suffice it to say that in a gross loan agreement,the lender pays local brazilian taxes on his interest income or the borrower withholds it,while in a net loan,the borrower contractually agrees not only to pay interest to the lender,but also to pay any local brazilian tax that the lender owes on that interest income.riggs ii,at.this is not necessarily a boon to lenders,for all else being equal,lenders must compensate borrowers for paying lenders taxes with lowered interest rates.the real difference between gross loans and net loans,riggs ii explains,lies not in who licks the stamp on the envelope to the brazilian government,but in who bears the economic burden of the tax.id.with a net loan,the borrower bears that burden,for the borrower faces the risk of change in local tax rates,while the lender net income the interest payments is stable.with a gross loan,the lender suffers the loss or reaps the benefit of change it is his net income that might vary with taxes.either way,however,the foreign government imposes legal liability for the local tax on the lender,and so either way the irs credits the foreign tax payments.reg.f 
second,the central bank is,as riggs ii put it,no ordinary brazilian borrower.at.created by law to implement brazil monetary and fiscal policies including issuing currency,required to act on behalf of brazil government and prohibited from acting on behalf of anyone else,able to contract in the name of the national treasury,responsible for managing foreign lending to brazilian borrowers,and under the control of the minister of finance,the central bank is a part of brazil federal government,as all parties agree.the federal constitution of brazil makes the central bank immune from tax on its own income,and in fact until the central bank operated,along with the national treasury and the banco de brasil in which brazil government held a controlling share,a centralized system for funding brazil government that jointly controlled brazil tax revenue although it was the banco de brasil that actually held the government tax revenue in its coffers.thus,if it were legally possible for the brazilian government to impose a tax on its central bank,it is not clear how it would be economically possible for the central bank to pay it at most,the money would go from the brazilian government right pocket to its left.and so when the central bank takes out net loans from a lender,certain questions arise will brazilian law,in keeping with the principle that tax payments incidental to net loans are payments on behalf of lenders,require the central bank to pay despite the bank constitutional immunity from taxes if so,should the irs credit those payments if the brazilian government refunds a portion of them to the central bank,should the irs subtract some of the refund from the credit 
we must pause at this point to understand pnc and the central bank or rather,brazil interests on the eve of their lending arrangement.only if the central bank was subjected to compulsory tax payments on pnc behalf could pnc qualify for the credit.see riggs ii,at.and such payments would represent no economic burden for brazil even if the central bank actually moved cash from its vaults to the banco de brasil vaults.see id.at.so both pnc and brazil had an interest in seeing the central bank subjected to the compulsory payments.for pnc,every cent thus paid to the brazilian government was money pnc would not have to pay to the irs and for brazil,the tax just meant,so far as we can tell,more credit at a lower interest rate.the only loser in the arrangement was the irs,which,economically speaking,would simply have transferred wealth to brazil for brazil and pnc to split.see id.the irs ends up on the wrong end of the.
only the central bank constitutional immunity from taxes stood in the way,and the third complexity in this case concerns how that immunity was overcome.given their interest in the foreign tax credit,pnc and other banks went to brazil highest ranking authority on tax matters,the minister of finance,to request definitive guidance on whether the central bank would be subjected to the compulsory tax payments on their behalf.the most natural way for the minister to answer yes would have been to hold the central bank tax immunity inapplicable in net loan arrangements,since the entity pays standing in the lender shoes.but this way was closed brazilian law already had authority for the opposite proposition.id.at.another way,however,was open,for the money pnc loaned the central bank was available and officially intended for to private borrowers in brazil.if the central bank could not stand in for the private lenders,perhaps it could stand in for these private borrowers.the minister issued a private letter ruling,not available to the public but binding on the parties under brazilian law,which riggs ii describes 
the minister deemed it appropriate to look through the central bank to those ultimate private for purposes of deciding the proper tax treatment of the loans.and it was settled brazilian law that a private borrower in a net loan was required to pay the tax obligation it had contractually assumed from the lender.the minister concluded that the aspect of the loans compelled an analogy to the garden variety private borrower situation,and that the central bank must as a substitute for such borrowers pay the income tax incident on the interest 
id.first alteration in original.this reasoning further complicates the irs question.if the brazilian revenue service looks through the central bank status because the central bank stands in for,should the irs follow suit in granting credits and subtracting subsidies should it matter that,in the event,none of the money ever was 
as a statutory matter,these questions shape up as interpretations of and associated portions of the and tax code and regulations.in riggs i,the issue was whether to permit the foreign tax credit at all,and it turned on whether the central bank tax payments were compulsory,as the minister had ruled,or voluntary.the tax court,viewing the minister private letter ruling as nothing more than perhaps an administrative advisory opinion,conducted its own analysis of brazilian law,concluded that the payments were voluntary,and denied pnc the credit.wl,at,tax.lexis,at.we reversed in riggs ii.as we saw it,the tax court had sat in judgment on and effectively declared invalid the minister order to the central bank to pay foreign sovereign official act within its own territory.the act of state doctrine shields such acts from american courts review.at.we remanded so that the tax court may determine in the first instance whether the taxes were in fact paid by the central bank,and whether riggs credits must be reduced by the amount of any subsidies that the central bank may have received.id.at.
riggs iii and iv resolved the first of those two questions.in riggs iii,citing accounting irregularities,the tax court held that pnc failed to establish that the withholding taxes in issue were paid by the central bank on petitioner behalf.wl,at,tax.memo lexis,at.since pnc was again ineligible for the credit,the tax court did not reach the subsidies issue.but in riggs iv,we reversed.pnc had submitted official brazilian receipts stating that the tax had been paid.these receipts were entitled to the common law presumption of regularity for the official acts of public officers,and while this presumption was rebuttable,the accounting irregularities that moved the tax court were the sort of clear or specific evidence needed to rebut it.riggs iv,at internal quotation marks omitted.there could no longer be any question that pnc was entitled to a foreign tax credit.riggs iv remanded to determine whether the tax credits should be reduced by any subsidies that may have been paid to the central bank.id.at.
riggs v takes up this last issue.in and,recall,brazil had a subsidies system sometimes called a pecuniary benefits system in this litigation that effectively returned of any tax payment brazilian borrowers in international net loans made on their foreign lenders behalf.mechanically,the two halves of the the tax payments and receiving the simultaneous,both occurring before paying the interest to the foreign lender and in such a way as to credit brazil national treasury only with the amount by which the withholding tax exceeded the subsidy.riggs v,wl,at,tax.memo lexis,at quoting nissho iwai am.comm r,wl,tax.lexis,at.in the tax court,no one doubted that this arrangement would have amounted to an indirect subsidy and properly reduced pnc foreign tax credit had the borrower been a private party past litigation in what have come to be called the brazilian tax cases,amoco comm r,cir,laid that question to rest.see norwest comm r,cir finding an indirect subsidy to the extent that the brazilian government rebated a portion of the taxes brazilian borrowers paid on lenders behalf cont l.comm r,cir same first chi.comm r,cch,wl,tax.memo lexis,at,same nissho iwai,wl,tax.lexis,at,same.what makes this case unique is the presence of and role played by the central bank standing in for private borrowers.the financial identity between the central bank and the brazilian government,the same thing that had made it puzzling to think of the central bank making compulsory tax payments,also makes it puzzling to think of the central bank receiving governmental subsidies.but taking its cue from the brazilian minister of finance private letter ruling,the tax court held that the central bank received the subsidy not as an agent of the brazilian government,but rather on behalf of the,so that it was proper to treat the central bank as separate from the brazilian government for purposes of the subsidy regulation.riggs v,wl,at,tax.memo lexis,at.
pnc has appealed and now the issue of the subsidy is before us.
pnc position in this appeal is that the brazilian government can not give its central bank a subsidy because the two are,for tax purposes,one and the same.the subsidy regulation applicable at the time,reg.e has,functionally,three parts.first,it defines a foreign subsidy as a payment by any means such as through a refund or credit,by the foreign country to the taxpayer or someone engaged in a transaction with the taxpayer,where the payment is determined,directly or indirectly,by reference to the amount of income tax.second,it regulates direct subsidies if a foreign country pays a subsidy directly to a taxpayer,that amount must be subtracted from the taxpayer foreign tax credit.third,distinguishing indirect subsidies,it states that a foreign country is considered to provide a subsidy to a taxpayer if the country provides a subsidy to another person that e ngages in a transaction with the taxpayer here too the subsidy must be subtracted from the credit.the brazilian government payments to its central bank,calculated by taking of the income tax pnc owed brazil,fit the definition of a subsidy but clearly are not direct subsidies,as all parties agree.the question is whether those payments qualify as indirect subsidies.pnc claims they do not because t he central bank is part of the brazilian government indeed,as far as brazil finances are concerned,the central bank is the brazilian government.appellant reply br.emphasis in original.therefore the brazilian government paid the subsidy in question to itself,which,pnc argues,puts the payments outside the indirect subsidy regulation.the sole issue before us is whether,in the circumstances of this case,the brazilian government subsidy was paid to another person within the meaning of treasury regulation e.
as a threshold matter,we must determine what it means for the recipient of a subsidy to be another person does this mean a person other than the foreign country,or other than the taxpayer read in isolation,e,with its careful distinction between direct and indirect subsidies,appears to ask whether the recipient is the taxpayer.however,because the indirect subsidy regulation seems on the whole to contemplate a transaction with three parties foreign government,taxpayer,and taxpayer local partner,the opposite pnc also plausible,especially as it avoids the notion of a government paying a subsidy to itself.as the commissioner has not opposed pnc reading,we shall assume for purposes of this appeal that pnc credit should be reduced if and only if the recipient of the subsidy the central bank is a person other than the brazilian government.
pnc points to evidence that the central bank is part of the foreign country,appellant reply br,and hence can not be another person.if we faced this question in a the arrangement,without the minister of finance private letter ruling,and without the five hearings,appeals,and remands that preceded this might well answer it as pnc proposes.there is,after all,no denying the central bank relationship to the brazilian government.but we do not operate in a vacuum we are bound by determinations in earlier iterations of this case.pnc factual argument,however convincing it might be,was properly before the court in riggs ii,not here.we can not ignore the holding in that case and consider the facts de novo.see llewellyn,the bramble bush,oceana publications explaining how,depending on legal context or posture,the facts in a case can be far from the reality of raw events and miles away from life.
pnc proposed outcome would make a virtue of inconsistency,applying disparate treatment to two legs of a simultaneous transaction.had the central bank handed to the brazilian government and the brazilian government handed,even more accurately,had the central bank netted the transaction out itself and only handed over in the first would have us take legal account of the and ignore the given back.
inconsistency is the antithesis of the rule of law.lashawn barry,en banc.of the various doctrines,principles,and practices we use to police inconsistency,some of which go to the root of what law is,doctrine is most applicable here t he same issue presented a second time in the same case in the same court should lead to the same result.id.emphasis in original see also arizona california,d as most commonly defined,the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.crocker piedmont aviation,when there are multiple appeals taken in the course of a single piece of litigation,doctrine holds that decisions rendered on the first appeal should not be revisited on later trips to the appellate court.doctrine encompasses issues decided both explicitly and by necessary implication.lashawn,at quoting crocker,at.the identity or of the central bank and the brazilian government for purposes of the tax arrangement in this case was decided by necessary implication in riggs ii.
riggs ii was a subtle case.the issue was whether the central bank payments to the brazilian government on pnc behalf should be regarded as voluntary or compulsory in light of the foreign minister private letter ruling stating that the payments were compulsory.the court applied the act of state doctrine,which in its classic formulation holds that the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory,underhill hernandez,and in its modern formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory,banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d.since banco nacional,the doctrine has been understood to arise from the separation of powers,reflecting the strong sense of the judicial branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder the conduct of foreign affairs.kirkpatrick envtl.tectonics,int l,d internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this doctrine to the minister of finance private letter ruling was not straightforward.for one thing,the doctrine is typically applied to tangible acts,like the expropriation of property,rather than the ruling of a government official.see riggs ii,at.for another,applying the doctrine to a foreign official ruling might run contrary to federal rule of civil procedure,directing courts to independently determine issues of foreign law,and its tax law equivalent,tax court rule.in a crucial passage threading these obstacles,the riggs ii court reasoned that 
whether or not it can be said that the brazilian minister of finance interpretation of brazilian law qualifies as an act of state,the minister order to the central bank to withhold and pay the income tax on the interest paid to the bank goes beyond a mere interpretation of law.the minister,after all,ordered that the central bank must,in substitution of the future not yet identified debtors of the tax,the,pay the income tax such an order has been treated as an act of state.the tax court conclusion on brazilian no tax is imposed on a net loan transaction involving a governmental entity as declared,invalid,the minister order to the central bank to pay the taxes.the act of state doctrine requires courts to abstain from even engaging in such an inquiry.
id.bracketed text in original internal citations omitted.put in the affirmative,the holding here is that american courts must accept as given that the brazilian government levied a compulsory tax payment on the central bank,where the central bank stood in for.thus what riggs ii resolved by necessary implication was the status of or role played by the central bank with respect to the pnc transaction.that resolves the present appeal,for if the central bank stood in for when it paid pnc taxes,it also stood in for them when it received of those tax payments back in subsidies.
pnc tries to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the riggs ii court disavowed the rationale when it refused to hold that the minister of finance interpretation of brazilian law qualifies as an act of state.the act of state at issue in riggs ii,as pnc interprets the case,was solely the minister order,the bare imperative to the central bank to pay taxes.indeed,as pnc sees it,the act of state doctrine can not encompass the rationale behind a foreign government acts.the holding of riggs ii,on this argument,would be that american courts must accept as given that the brazilian government levied a compulsory payment on the central.
but the rationale and the minister interpretation of brazilian law are not one and the same,and the court refusal to call one an act of state in no way implies rejection of the other.the minister private letter ruling has three parts the bare imperative,the rationale,and a broader discussion of the central bank legal situation in various types of financial transactions.the last of these is the likely antecedent for riggs ii reference to an interpretation of brazilian makes good sense when one notices that the rationale is not an interpretation of law at all.far from rejecting the logic,riggs ii in fact repeated that,restated the minister order in such a way as to incorporate after disclaiming the minister interpretation of brazilian law as an act of state w hether or not it can be said that the brazilian minister of finance interpretation of brazilian law qualifies as an act of state t he minister ordered that the central bank must,in substitution of the,pay the income tax id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in concluding that the central bank is another person in the sense of the treasury regulation,we need not apply the act of state doctrine.rather,in the interest of consistency,we need only adhere,as a matter,to the necessary implications of riggs ii.there,the court held that,based on the act of state doctrine,american courts had to accept the minister determination that the brazilian government had compelled the central bank to remit tax payments on pnc behalf,standing in for the.in that role,the central bank was distinct from the brazilian government.thus,as the payment and the subsidy are both part of the same indivisible transaction,riggs ii necessarily implies the central bank is likewise distinct for purposes of the subsidy.
two last points round out this argument.first,doctrine is prudential the supreme court has instructed that courts may reopen what has been decided,though they should as a rule be loath to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as where the initial decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.christianson colt indus.operating,d quoting messinger anderson.internal quotation marks omitted,and arizona,at.see also lashawn,at.pnc has failed to persuade us that there is error or injustice,particularly when every previous court to address the issue has regarded pnc tax arrangement in brazil as a stratagem for avoiding taxes.see riggs i,wl,tax.lexis,at riggs ii,at riggs iii,wl,at,tax.memo lexis,at.
second,the root principles at work principle that courts must be consistent with one another and the principle that governmental entities may in some circumstances be treated as private when taking on a private role or a venerable lineage.see republic of argentina weltover,d putting a distinction between a government exercises of uniquely sovereign power and ordinary private power at the heart of foreign sovereign immunity alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,d plurality opinion recognizing a traditional distinction between the public and governmental acts of sovereign states on the one hand and their private and commercial acts on the other bank of the planters bank of,wheat.marshall,w hen a government becomes a partner in any trading company,it devests itself,so far as concerns the transactions of that company,of its sovereign character,and takes that of a private citizen.henry friendly,indiscretion about discretion,emory,t he most basic principle of jurisprudence is that we must act alike in all cases of like nature.internal quotation marks omitted.
in place of the analysis above,pnc asks us to follow the seventh circuit approach from amoco commissioner,cir.but as described below,amoco shares none of the factual circumstances we find dispositive here,for which reason we decline to follow it in the instant case.
virtually every page of pnc briefs is studded with references to amoco,which involved the tax consequences of a complicated oil exploration arrangement between amoco,a oil company operating in egypt,and the egyptian general petroleum corporation,an entity owned and controlled by the egyptian government for the purpose of managing egypt oil wealth.egpc contracted to pay amoco egyptian income tax on amoco in a net loan then took a credit on its own egyptian taxes exactly equal to what it paid for amoco.egpc had no tax immunity and ordinarily paid income taxes as if a commercial entity.the question for the seventh circuit was whether amoco should be permitted a foreign tax credit on its taxes under,or whether the credit egpc took in egypt should,under the same subsidy regulation at issue in our case,count as an indirect subsidy,reducing amoco credit to zero.the tax court had found no indirect subsidy because egpc was part of the egyptian government,and thus by definition it was incapable of receiving a subsidy from itself.id.at.the seventh circuit affirmed,but on somewhat more modest reasoning.finding t he question of how to treat enterprises exceedingly complicated,the court favored a functional approach over rules and refused to decide whether it is impossible in all circumstances for a government to grant a subsidy to one of its wholly or majority owned enterprises.id.at.in amoco case,the court found no indirect subsidy for two reasons first was egpc economic identity with the egyptian government egpc profits go straight to the treasury,and it would never feel any losses,because the treasury would absorb them,and second was the fact that,as an economic matter,egpc alone received the benefit of the credit while amoco unquestionably bore the economic burden of the taxes imposed on its operations by egypt.id.at.
pnc argues that its situation is identical to the one in amoco it too contracted with a foreign governmental entity that agreed to pay its american partner local taxes,received some of the tax money back,and shares an economic identity with the foreign government.thus it too should benefit from the idea that,as pnc characterizes amoco holding,when the benefit of the subsidy is provided to the foreign government,there is no subsidy within the meaning of the regulations since it is impossible for the foreign government to subsidize itself.appellant br.
but to start with,that is amoco rather,it is only half of amoco holding.the other half is the economic analysis concluding that the taxpayer bore all the burden of the foreign tax and received no benefit from the foreign in our case,the tax brazil formally levied on its central bank represented only a benefit to pnc.even more importantly,amoco lacked every factual feature we have found decisive in this appeal no tax immunity,no private letter ruling or equivalent,no or analogue for them,and no controlling precedent.unless we ignore the facts and the history of this case,we are bound to regard the central bank as standing in for private parties.indeed,pnc comparisons between the central bank in this case and egpc in amoco are premature logically prior to any such the first analytic step in many cases that turn on someone or something governmental fixing on the role that person or entity played in the particular circumstances of the case.the seventh circuit itself said as much t he kind of legal issue presented and the context of the suit has been more important than the label governmental or,amoco,at and was careful to cabin its conclusions accordingly.
both pnc and the dissent would have us answer the question of the central bank status as if indifferent to all context and background.this we can not do.as we agree with the tax court that,under the facts of this case,it is proper to treat the central bank as separate from the brazilian government and deem the bank another person within the meaning of the subsidy regulation,the judgment of the tax court is 
i share the majority frustration with this,the latest of what seems to have become a judicial,riggs vi return of the subsidy.we are unanimous in the hope that it is the last of the sequels.we disagree,however,about what our role in this case should be,and i think it a disagreement worthy of some discussion.while i share my colleagues unease over pnc stratagem for avoiding taxes,op.at,such discomfort alone can not determine the outcome of a case.both facts and law are fundamental to our conclusions,and although the facts of this case are complicated,the law is simple.this case turns entirely on the plain language of controlling tax regulations.that language is clear,unambiguous,and dispositive.its they may not within our power to forestall,and its neutral application does not,as the majority suggests,create any inconsistency.on the contrary,our abandonment of a textual approach creates inconsistencies galore,putting us conspicuously at odds with the text of both and relevant brazilian law,our own precedent,and the reasoned decision of a sister circuit.the court analysis also obscures two important principles it seeks to clarify the act of state doctrine and the doctrine.accordingly,i dissent.
the text of controlling law requires our disposition in favor of pnc.we are reluctant to disregard an agency interpretation of its own regulation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language air transp.ass of,quoting thomas jefferson shalala,d internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the plain language of the relevant treasury regulation is sufficient to compel an alternative reading.the question for the court is whether foreign tax credits properly claimed by pnc should be reduced by the amount of subsidy payments made by the brazilian government to the central bank of brazil.see riggs subsidiaries comm r,riggs iv remanding this issue to the tax court.the controlling provision of law is reg.e ii which provides in relevant part that a payment constitutes a subsidy only if it is paid by a foreign country to another person.the resolution of this appeal thus depends on whether the brazilian government a foreign country has made payments to another person within the meaning of reg.e ii.our sole task is to determine whether the central bank is another person for the purpose of the relevant regulation.see op.at.
given the ample amount of judicial ink put to paper concerning the relationship between and among riggs bank,the central bank of brazil,and the government of brazil,our analysis need not be labored.it is uncontested,as the court observes,that the central bank is a part of brazil federal government,id.at,id.at,and required by brazilian law to act on behalf of brazil government and prohibited from acting on behalf of anyone else,id.at.and yet the court simultaneously contends that the brazilian government and the central bank of brazil are distinct,see id.at,and concludes that the central bank stood in for when it received tax payments back in subsidies,id.at.i disagree.the answer to the question before us is apparent the central bank is unquestionably part of a foreign country and therefore not another person.no one disputes that riggs taxes have been retained by the brazilian government.the functional transfer of funds within a government is not a transfer to another person.the regulations confirm this conclusion by clarifying that when a subsidy is paid to a political subdivision of a foreign state issuing the subsidy,the subsidy is paid to the foreign country itself.reg.g.i fail to see ambiguity in this text that would permit any alternative conclusion.
even my colleagues agree that,in a vacuum,our disposition ought to be.see op.at w e might well answer the question as pnc proposes.there is,after all,no denying the central bank relationship to the brazilian government.but the court,perhaps frustrated by the outcome that this straightforward analysis of the text and neutral application of law requires struggles to justify the opposite result.observing that we do not operate in a vacuum,id.at,the court concludes that a decision in favor of pnc would ratify an intolerable inconsistency,see id.at.again,i disagree.on the contrary,the court,in trying to restore clarity to the confusing legal interpretation of a foreign minister and,perhaps,in its attempt to reach what it deems a just end to a troubling case,has contorted what precious little logic remains available to us and,in so doing,has overstepped the limits of its authority.
the majority error flows from its mistaken effort to impose consistency on the reasoning of a foreign,the dubious conclusion that the central bank stood in for when it paid pnc taxes,see id.at.from my colleagues perspective,it is not possible to conclude that the central bank was compelled to pay taxes to the government of brazil without also concluding that the central bank acted in the place of and is,therefore,another person for the purpose of our tax law.the majority observes that when it was compelled to remit tax payments on pnc behalf,standing in for the the central bank was distinct from the brazilian government.thus,as the payment and the subsidy are both part of the same indivisible transaction,riggs ii necessarily implies the central bank is likewise distinct for purposes of the subsidy.id.at emphasis in original.but in fact we specifically held otherwise in riggs national subsidiaries commissioner,riggs ii,declining to conclude that the central bank of brazil was distinct from the government of brazil,much less that it acted in the place of.such a conclusion would not have been supported by law,nor by logic.as the court itself notes,the central bank is required to act on behalf of brazil government and prohibited from acting on behalf of anyone else.op.at.
ironically,my colleagues disregard for the logical flaws in the minister reasoning is animated by their desire to circumvent what they misconceive to be another logical problem how this court,in riggs ii,could have deferred to a conclusion if that conclusion were based on a false premise.in other words,how could we have deferred to an act of state,the order that the central bank pay taxes on pnc income without having accepted,by necessary implication,see op.at,the reasoning offered to justify the state act,that the central bank stood in for but this is no logical problem at all.we deferred to the act because the act of state doctrine compelled us,regardless of the underlying premise.that is the purpose of the doctrine,which precludes us from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory,banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d,and the nature of deference,which precludes us from sit ting in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory,underhill hernandez.the fact that the minister of finance looked through the central bank for the purposes of deciding the proper tax treatment of loans,see riggs ii,at,does not require that we base our own conclusions on the result of that awkward analysis.had the minister of finance based an order on his observation that the sky is orange,we would still defer to the order,regardless of the reasoning.no implications,therefore,necessary or otherwise,fell out of our decision that the central bank paid taxes on behalf of pnc other than the fact that pnc could claim foreign tax credits in the amount of those taxes.
i agree that in the interest of consistency,we need to adhere to the necessary implications of riggs ii.op.at.but that is not what the court has done.contrary to its own representation we can not ignore the holding in a previous case and consider the facts de novo.op.at the court has adopted,de novo,the interpretation of a foreign official that contravenes the text of foreign law an observation that both the commissioner and the tax court have shared.t he central bank,under brazilian law,was constitutionally immune from having to pay withholding tax with respect to its net loan interest remittances abroad.riggs comm r,riggs i,rev on other grounds,riggs ii.this is precisely the error we avoided in our previous holding.we are hesitant to treat an interpretation of law as an act of state,for such a view might be in tension with rules of procedure directing courts to conduct a de novo review of foreign law when an issue of foreign law is raised.see.tax court.riggs ii,at.the act of state doctrine did not compel our deference to the legal interpretation of a foreign state and therefore offers no support for the majority conclusion.nor does our holding in riggs ii bolster the court conclusion that we are bound by the law of this case to abandon our unanimous plain language interpretation of controlling law.nor has the court offered any analysis to support its novel conclusion that the central bank should be considered to have acted on behalf of despite the explicit prohibition against acting on behalf of anyone but the government of brazil.see op.at.in fact,the majority admits to being puzzled as am i by how,even if it were legally possible for the brazilian government to impose a tax on its central bank it would be economically possible for the central bank to pay it at most,the money would go from the brazilian government right pocket to its left.id.precisely.it is similarly puzzling to suppose that when the brazilian government pays subsidies to the central bank,it is doing anything more than the same motion in reverse.why then are these two halves of the same transaction,occurring simultaneously,treated differently because an act of state compelled us to recognize the first half,mandatory payment of tax while no such act compels our recognition of the second half,payment of subsidy.whereas we were obliged in riggs ii to accept the fact that the central bank had been compelled to pay taxes despite all evidence to the contrary,we were not nor are we now obliged to accept the argument that the central bank stood in the place of and is therefore another person for the purpose of our tax law.it was our required deference in one case,not required in another,that accounts for our disparate treatment to two legs of a simultaneous transaction,see id.at,which,frustrating though it may be to those who dislike the outcome,is not at all inconsistent.
far from being indifferent to all context and background in this case,op.at,i am mindful of our duty to respect the effect of our previous holdings and the bounds of our role in this case.i also share my colleagues interest in policing inconsistency in our jurisprudence,see id.at,and therefore find myself motivated by the same concerns expressed by the court,but reach the opposite conclusion.i believe that the court analysis has ignored conclusive authority,created inconsistencies where none need exist,and ultimately put us at odds with the plain language of law,our own precedent in this case,and the reasoned analysis of a sister circuit.
first,the court decision ignores the language of the controlling tax regulation.the plain meaning of another person is clear,despite the majority initial interpretation of that dispositive phrase.see id.at read in isolation,e appears to ask whether the recipient is the taxpayer.emphasis in original.the words another person are most naturally in isolation and in the relevant mean a third party that is neither the foreign government nor the taxpayer.thankfully,this is not a source of disagreement,as the majority ultimately concludes that for purposes of this appeal another person is a person other than the brazilian government,and t here is,after all,no denying the central bank relationship to the brazilian government.op.at.
a textual approach to the case would therefore seem appealing,not only because of the clarity it offers,but also because the relevant regulations did
