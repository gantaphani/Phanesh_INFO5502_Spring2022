this is a winstar related case in which the court of federal claims held that the government had breached an agreement with a savings and loan company that the latter could use a particular method of accounting in determining its capital for regulatory purposes,and awarded damages of approximately.in its appeal the government has challenged only the award of damages.it contends that the breach of the agreement did not cause the injury for which the plaintiffs were awarded damages.we affirm.
a.the facts relating to the financial problems of the savings and loan industry in the early and the federal government attempts to alleviate the situation are well known and need only to be briefly summarized here.at that time a large number of savings and loan companies also known as thrifts were in serious financial straits and facing insolvency.federal regulators devised a program under which economically healthy thrifts would acquire ones.to encourage such action,the regulators offered various benefits to the acquiring thrifts,which usually were incorporated in written agreements with them.these included treating the excess of the amount paid for the acquired thrift over that entity value known as regulatory goodwill as an asset in determining the acquiring thrift compliance with the thrift regulatory capital requirements.the agreements also permitted the acquiring thrifts to amortize their regulatory goodwill over a substantial period,generally years.
in congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea,stat,which made significant changes in governmental regulation of the savings and loan business.these included prohibiting thrifts from using regulatory goodwill as a capital asset for regulatory purposes and requiring them to phase out that practice over a period.in the act,congress also prohibited thrifts from using subordinated debt as part of their regulatory capital.
as a result of firrea,many thrifts became insolvent and the regulators liquidated them.
a number of thrifts filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking damages on a variety of theories.in united states winstar,d,the supreme court upheld this court decision that the united states was liable for breach of contract to thrifts with which it had agreed to permit the use as regulatory capital of regulatory goodwill that had been created in connection with the thrifts acquisition of a failing thrift.in winstar,the supreme court did not address the appropriate measure or amount of damages for such breach.id.at.in a number of subsequent decisions,this court has addressed various damages questions arising in such cases.see,first heights bank,fsb united states,granite mgmt.united states,westfed holdings,united states.
b.the basic facts in this case,as found by the court of federal claims,are largely undisputed.
in the mid,the appellee citizens federal bank citizens and its predecessor and affiliates were a successful and thrift.at the request of the federal regulators of the thrift industry the regulators,in and citizens acquired two thrifts.in connection with those acquisitions and to encourage them,the regulators entered into written acceptance agreements with citizens under which citizens was authorized to treat the excess of the acquired thrift liabilities over the purchase price as regulatory goodwill,which would be amortized over years and could be used to satisfy citizens requirements.citizens obtained million of regulatory goodwill in connection with the acquisition and million in connection with the acquisition.citizens fed.bank united states.citizens fed.bank united states,breach op.
following the enactment of firrea,in citizens still was in compliance with the requirements,although its coverage margins were greatly reduced.
prior to the enactment of firrea,citizens had a large amount of subordinated debt,which its depositors held.firrea prohibited the use of such debt as part of a thrift regulatory capital.to deal with that problem,citizens issued preferred stock in exchange for the subordinated notes.while this exchange improved citizens situation,it had an adverse tax consequence for citizens because although the interest it had paid on the notes was deductible,the dividends paid on the preferred stock that was substituted for them were not.
citizens also reduced its assets which,in conjunction with the substitution of preferred stock for subordinated debt,enabled it to comply fully with the new regulatory capital requirements that firrea mandated.
citizens then filed the present suit in the court of federal claims,seeking damages for the government alleged breach of the provisions in the assistance agreements permitting it to use regulatory goodwill as part of its regulatory capital and to amortize it over years.the court first held that the government had breached the assistance ruling which,as indicated,the government does not here challenge.
the case then proceeded to the damages phase,in which citizens initially sought damages exceeding million,based on various theories of damages lost profits,restitution,reliance,and cost of capital replacement.after three rounds of summary judgment motions,in which most of citizens theories were rejected,a trial was held to determine what mitigation damages citizens was entitled to for the costs it incurred in replacing the regulatory capital it had lost as a result of firrea.
the court awarded citizens damages of consisting of the following elements its transaction costs of for the exchange of preferred stock for debt for the difference between the dividend rate on the preferred stock and the interest rate on the subordinated notes and as compensation for the diminished cash flow resulting from the adverse tax consequences of the exchange.
in so holding,the trial court ruled that the proper standard for determining whether the government breach of contract caused citizens damages was whether the breach was a substantial factor in causing the damages rather than,as the government urged,whether the damages were attributable to and resulted entirely from the breach.
as just noted,in assessing damages the trial court applied the substantial factor theory of causation,that a defendant that has breached a contract is liable for those damages the other party to the contract suffered for which the breach was a substantial factor in causing the damages.the government contends that the court used the wrong standard.the proper standard,the government argues,is causation,under which the breaching party is liable only for those damages that it directly and entirely caused.
according to the government,the proper standard governing causation in breach of contract claims is that announced by our predecessor,the court of claims,more than years ago in myerle united states.there,the court of claims held that a plaintiff can only recover those items of damage which are the proximate result of the acts of the government for a damage to be direct there must appear to be no intervening incident not caused by the defaulting party to complicate or confuse the certainty of the result between the cause and the damage the cause must produce the effect inevitably and naturally,not possibly or even probably there must not be two steps between the cause and damage.id.at.the government contends that under this standard,which it urges this court consistently has followed,it should have been awarded summary judgment and citizens should not have recovered anything.
our cases dealing with the proper standard of causation may appear superficially somewhat inconsistent in applying the substantial factor and but for theories.we discern a common thread among them,however the selection of an appropriate causation standard depends upon the facts of the particular case and lies largely within the trial court discretion.the standard is comparable to that governing selection of an appropriate methodology for determining damages,which lies within the trial court discretion.see cybor fas,en banc the amount of damages determined by a district court is a question of fact that is reviewed for clear error on appeal,while the method used by
