msk eyes,ltd msk and its founder,muhannah kakish kakish,appeal from an order of the district court granting summary judgment to wells fargo bank wells fargo.msk and kakish appellants brought an action against wells fargo on a myriad of claims arising from their banking relationship,including breach of contract,credit defamation,business disparagement,defamation,interference with prospective business advantage and economic expectancy,violation of the minnesota garnishment statute,and negligence.having jurisdiction under,we affirm.
this case has a lengthy,and somewhat complicated,factual background.we recite it below,as simply and briefly as possible.
a.the banking relationship 
kakish incorporated msk in the state of minnesota in october to develop a chain of retail eyewear stores.kakish is the founder,president,chairman of the board,and majority shareholder of msk.msk originally aspired to open fifty retail stores in five years and stores in ten years but has yet to open one store.
in april,msk signed a promissory note on a loan from wells fargo.kakish and his brother,raed kakish raed,personally guaranteed the msk loan.in june,wells fargo dishonored a number of checks drawn on the msk in excess of it had not yet deposited the funds into msk checking account.according to appellants,wells fargo led them to believe the loan was processed when,in fact,it was not.when the third parties contacted wells fargo regarding the dishonored checks,a loan officer made disparaging remarks about kakish qualities as a businessman and suggested msk was a shady operation.as a result of the injury wells fargo allegedly inflicted on its reputation,msk claims it lost several lucrative business opportunities and began to incur financial difficulties.msk overdrew its wells fargo checking account,causing checks issued to be returned without payment.within three months,msk defaulted on the loan.
previous litigation 
prior to the current litigation,the parties were involved in two relevant lawsuits in the state of minnesota,one in ramsey county and one in hennepin county.in the first suit,filed on november,in ramsey county,wells fargo sought to collect overdraft charges on the msk checking account.in the second suit,filed one week later in hennepin county,wells fargo sought to recover the outstanding principal,interest and attorneys fees related to the defaulted msk loan.we first address the hennepin county litigation.
hennepin county litigation 
on november,wells fargo sued msk,and kakish and raed as guarantors,in hennepin county court to recover the outstanding principal,interest and attorneys fees related to the defaulted msk loan.in response,appellants asserted counterclaims against wells fargo for breach of contract,deceptive and unlawful trade practices,libel and slander.wells fargo and appellants settled the hennepin county litigation on july,pursuant to a document entitled mutual release.raed was not a party to this settlement.
the mutual release provides,in relevant part,in consideration for a payment from kakish and the release of all claims asserted by appellants against wells fargo,
wells fargo does hereby release and forever discharge muhannah kakish of and from each and every claim,demand,liability and cause of action which wells fargo ever had,presently has or claims to have against msk eyes,muhannah kakish or his agents,their representatives,successors or assigns that relate in any way to wells fargo april,claims against msk eyes,pursuant to a promissory note dated april,in the original principal amount of and the personal guaranty of muhannah kakish dated april,guarantying the obligations of msk eyes,to wells fargo.
wells fargo did not release its claims against msk or raed,as a guarantor.according to wells fargo,it intentionally did not release msk because a release of the underlying loan may have jeopardized its ability to obtain payments from raed as a personal guarantor.
the parties stipulated the terms of the settlement were confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone except,among others,the corporate directors,officers or shareholders of wells fargo and msk eyes the parties further agreed not to comment on the resolution of their disputes if contacted by third parties,other than to say the parties in good faith disputed their liabilities thereunder and the matter was resolved by mutual release.following the settlement,wells fargo posted a note on the msk account that stated in all capitalized letters do not give any information on this customer out to anyone,if any callers claim to be customer please refer them to an officer right away 
pursuant to a stipulation signed by wells fargo and appellants,the hennepin county district court dismissed all claims between the parties with prejudice on july.the parties acknowledged the stipulation did not constitute a waiver of wells fargo causes of action against raed or an agreement to dismiss wells fargo claims against raed.raed ultimately defaulted in the hennepin county litigation,and the court entered a judgment against him in the amount of.in june,wells fargo agreed to vacate the judgment,and raed agreed to pay toward the msk loan in monthly payments of from july,until march.wells fargo and raed further agreed the full outstanding balance on the msk loan would immediately become due and payable if raed defaulted on his payments.
wells fargo maintained the msk account as active on its books,credited each settlement payment,and adjusted the outstanding balance accordingly.according to wells fargo,the msk account remained active until the bank received raed final settlement payment in march.wells fargo claims it sent msk monthly statements detailing the outstanding balance,interest accrued,and payments received from july until early.kakish acknowledges receiving statements from may onward,but disputes receiving any before that time.
ramsey county litigation 
meanwhile,despite resolving the hennepin county litigation,neither msk nor kakish filed an answer to wells fargo complaint in the ramsey county collection action for overdraft charges on the msk checking account.on october,wells fargo,kakish and msk settled the hennepin county litigation and executed the mutual fargo requested a default judgment in the ramsey county litigation against only msk,because the checking account was only in msk name.on november,the ramsey county district court entered judgment against msk in the amount of.msk never challenged or appealed the ramsey county judgment.between june,and june,wells fargo served six garnishment summons on community first national bank community first,another bank where msk kept an account.wells fargo collected a total of towards the ramsey county judgment.
disputed monthly statements account information 
leroy miller miller is kakish domestic partner,who cohabitated with kakish at times.miller invested in msk,served on its board of directors,and allowed msk to operate out of his property.he is also the sole owner,director,and employee of leroy miller design.on august,leroy miller design voluntarily petitioned for chapter bankruptcy and reported owning only a interest in msk.
in early,miller had power of attorney for kakish during the several months kakish was out of the country.miller,who was a board member,opened msk mail while kakish was away.at this time,miller noticed wells fargo was sending msk statements,which referenced an outstanding balance as well as garnishment notices wells fargo served on community first.
in september,miller contacted wells fargo regarding the msk account.a wells fargo officer told miller he needed signed authorization before the bank could provide him any information regarding the msk account.miller informed kakish.kakish wrote a letter to wells fargo,dated september,stating i hereby authorize wells fargo bank to release information relating to msk eyes muhannah kakish and related accounts to leroy miller design miller then faxed wells fargo the following request on the company letterhead of leroy miller design 
please provide a reference for msk eyes muhannah kakish.a release for the information should be on file at this time.please fax information to leroy miller design.
on october,wells fargo faxed the following information to the fax number provided by miller the current balance,opening balance,opening date april,interest rate,maturity date july,and the amount of monthly payments.wells fargo included the following disclaimer 
by accepting this information,you warrant that receipt by you is lawful,you agree that it will not be disclosed to anyone else or used in an unlawful manner,you acknowledge that its completeness and accuracy is not guaranteed,it may not disclose the entire relationship of the customer with the bank and is subject to change without notice,and you agree to indemnify and hold the bank harmless against all loss resulting from providing this information to you.
wells fargo is not responsible for the information included in this fax being viewed by persons other than the intended recipient upon printing at this fax number.
at the time miller received the requested information,leroy miller design had already filed for chapter bankruptcy and,thus,miller was personally unable to invest additional funds in msk.miller stated in his deposition the only impact the receipt of this information had on him was to dampen his enthusiasm to seek new investors for msk.he stated he did not know whether anyone new would have invested in msk had wells fargo not disclosed the above information to him.
after miller received the account information from wells fargo,kakish and miller told other directors,shareholders,consultants and potential investors in the garnishment proceedings,which resulted from the ramsey county litigation.they volunteered also that wells fargo continued to send msk statements regarding the loan,and was attempting to collect the debt.appellants allege,as a result of their of wells fargo actions against them,they have incurred damages in excess of million dollars in lost profit.
present litigation 
appellants commenced this action against wells fargo alleging credit defamation,business disparagement,defamation,interference with prospective business advantage and economic expectancy,negligence,and violation of the minnesota garnishment statute wells fargo moved for,and the district court granted,summary judgment on all claims.this appeal followed.
appellants claims are based on three primary contentions wells fargo improperly obtained the ramsey county default judgment and garnished funds from community first in violation of the mutual release wells fargo inaccurately maintained the msk account on its books because msk had been relieved from its obligation to pay the debt pursuant to the mutual release and wells fargo wrongfully communicated msk account information to leroy miller design.the district court dismissed all claims premised on the first contention with prejudice,concluding it lacked jurisdiction because the claims were barred under the doctrine.the district court granted summary judgment to wells fargo on the surviving claims of breach of contract,defamation and credit defamation,business disparagement,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,and negligence as they related to the second and third contentions.the court also granted wells fargo summary judgment on the claim it violated the minnesota garnishment statute,chapter.
the doctrine is applied to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.the doctrine does not apply to cases that raise independent issues.see riehm engelking,cir.the fact that a judgment was entered on a party default does not alter the applicability of the doctrine.fielder credit acceptance,cir.
the doctrine does not bar appellant claims premised on wells fargo activities in filing the ramsey county action and in enforcing the resulting judgment.although appellants complain of injuries caused by the state court judgment,their claims do not seek review and rejection of that judgment.they do not challenge the court issuance of the judgment or seek to have that judgment overturned.we have distinguished claims attacking the decision of a state court from those attacking an adverse party actions in obtaining and enforcing that decision 
if a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly erroneous decision by a state court,and seeks relief from a state court judgment based on that decision,bars subject matter jurisdiction in federal district court.if,on the other hand,a federal plaintiff asserts as a legal wrong an allegedly illegal act or omission by an adverse party,does not bar jurisdiction.
riehm,at citing noel hall,cir.
appellant claims fall into the latter category because they assert allegedly unlawful conduct committed by adverse parties,which does not require the federal district court to overturn the state court order.because the state court judgment would still be intact even if wells fargo breached the mutual release by obtaining that judgment,appellant breach of contract claims do not seek review and rejection of that judgment.likewise,it is possible to conclude wells fargo committed various torts in enforcing the judgment without concluding the judgment itself is invalid.appellant claims are independent and not barred by because they allege unlawful conduct only in seeking and executing the state order.riehm,at.
therefore,the district court erred in concluding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this aspect of appellant claims.reversal is not required,however,since we may affirm on any basis supported by the record.richmond higgins,cir.as discussed infra,summary judgment is appropriate on appellant claims arising out of the ramsey county litigation because they fail on the merits 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court determination of state law,its conclusions of law,and its grant of summary judgment and we can affirm on any ground supported by the record.gamradt fed,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,demonstrates there are no outstanding issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.habib nationsbank,cir.
breach of contract 
appellants argue wells fargo breached the mutual release by prosecuting the ramsey county litigation,by maintaining allegedly inaccurate records that reflected a balance owed by msk,by sending msk account statements reflecting this balance,and by disclosing the status of the msk loan to leroy miller design.under minnesota law,to prevail on a breach of contract claim,appellants must show formation of a contract performance by appellants of any conditions precedent a material breach of the contract by wells fargo and damages.parkhill.mut.life ins,d,citing briggs trans.ranzenberger.
by the plain language of the mutual release,wells fargo released only kakish from liability relating to the promissory note.appellants argue the release of kakish also released the others because wells fargo did not execute a release,which specifically preserves claims against the remaining defendants and indemnifies the released defendants.when a settlement agreement does not contain a pierringer release the general rule is that the release of one alleged tortfeasor will release all others if the settlement agreement manifests such an intent,or if the plaintiff received full compensation in law or in fact for damages sought against the remaining tortfeasors.johnson brown,quoting bixler by bixler penney,emphasis in original.
the rule originates in gronquist olson,where a married couple defaulted on a promissory note.after a jury found them responsible for the debt,the wife settled part of the debt with the plaintiffs,who then dismissed their action against her before judgment was entered.her husband argued the agreement discharging her operated to discharge him as well.the minnesota supreme court applied the following rule where a party receives a part of the damages from one of the wrongdoers,the receipt thereof not being understood to be in full satisfaction of the injury,he does not thereby discharge the others from liability.id.at.the court stated 
we believe that the factors determinative of whether a release of one of several joint will operate to release the remaining wrongdoers should be and are the intention of the parties to the release instrument,and whether or not the injured party has in fact received full compensation for his injury.if we apply that rule,then,where one joint is released,r egardless of what form that release may take,as long as it does not constitute an accord and satisfaction or an unqualified or absolute release,and there is no manifestation of any intention to the contrary in the agreement,the injured party should not be denied his right to pursue the remaining wrongdoers until he has received full satisfaction.
id.at see also wall fairview hosp.and healthcare,applying gronquist and determining the intent of the parties was not to release their claims against all of the defendants and opining to hold otherwise would also contradict our strong public policy of encouraging settlement.johnson,at applying gronquist as the modern rule and noting application of a more rigid rule,which released all other tortfeasors in the absence of a pierringer release,could prevent a plaintiff from being made whole luxenburg industries,applying gronquist and rejecting the proposition that release of one joint tortfeasor automatically discharges the others.
the mutual release states wells fargo releases only kakish.the agreement contains no manifestation of any intention to release msk or raed from the debt.where the language of an agreement is clear,courts are to enforce the plain meaning of the agreement.current techn.concepts,irie.furthermore,the terms of the agreement required kakish to pay only toward the defaulted loan.under these facts,there can be no implied release of the other debtors wells fargo was free to pursue the balance of the debt from msk and raed.since wells fargo did not release msk from liability for its debt,it did not breach the agreement by maintaining a record of the debt,continuing to seek payment from raed,and crediting his payments against msk account.moreover,since the mutual release covers only kakish,wells fargo did not breach the contract by initiating and enforcing the ramsey county default judgment against msk.
wells fargo did agree to keep the terms of the settlement confidential.the information it released to leroy miller design,however,did not disclose the existence of litigation history and did not include the terms of the parties settlement.thus,wells fargo did not breach the agreement with respect to confidentiality of terms.
with respect to kakish claims,wells fargo did not break any promise it made to kakish.the breach of contract allegations made by appellants relate only to msk and do not identify any wrong against kakish in his personal capacity.kakish has no claim.
because neither appellant has a viable claim for breach of contract,summary judgment was properly granted to wells fargo.
defamation claims 
we next address appellants claims for defamation,credit defamation and business disparagement.as the district court recognized,neither party identified facts or legal authority to distinguish the claims as separate.we therefore analyze the three claims under the minnesota law of defamation.
in order for a statement to be considered defamatory it must be communicated to someone other than the plaintiff,it must be false,and it must tend to harm the plaintiff reputation and to lower him in the estimation of the community.stuempges parke,davis,citing restatement second of torts prosser,handbook of the law of torts at ed.defamation claims require a showing of publication by the defendant to a third party.an exception to the rule applies if the plaintiff is compelled to publish a defamatory statement to a third person and it was foreseeable to the defendant that the plaintiff would be so compelled.lewis equitable life assurance soc y.under this exception,which must be cautiously applied,plaintiffs have a duty to mitigate and are required to take all reasonable steps to attempt to explain the true nature of the situation and to contradict the defamatory statement.id.
appellants first allege defamation arising out of wells fargo prosecution and enforcement of the ramsey county litigation.appellants allege wells fargo defamed them by disclosing to others a debt that had been released.first,to the extent appellants allege defamation based on wells fargo disclosures made during the ramsey county litigation,such publication is protected by absolute privilege.mahoney hagberg newgard.second,to the extent appellants allege defamation based on wells fargo disclosure of that judgment to community first,wells fargo is protected by the defense of truth.stuempges parke,davis.wells fargo was truthful when it communicated to community first that it had obtained a judgment against appellants and was owed money pursuant to that judgment.
appellants next allege defamation based on two additional communications,both of which disclosed account information and reflected a balance owed by msk.first are the monthly account statements sent to msk.second is the october fax from wells fargo to leroy miller design.at the outset,we find neither of these communications defamed kakish.defamatory words,to be actionable,must refer to some ascertained or ascertainable person and that person must be the plaintiff.brill.mines,see schlieman gannett,holding jury instructions in a defamation action were proper when they required a false and defamatory statement which actually refers to the plaintiff.neither the fax to leroy miller design,nor the msk monthly account statements refer to kakish.consequently,the district court properly granted summary judgment to wells fargo on kakish claims for defamation,credit defamation and business disparagement.
we begin with the monthly account statements.the statements were mailed to the attention of msk only.msk therefore relies on the theory of compelled disclosure to meet the publication requirement.although the record does not contain any written communications or even meeting minutes demonstrating msk,kakish deposition testimony is he informed msk board of directors and at least one investor,who was not on the board,that wells fargo was claiming msk owed a debt.the record does contain unsworn letters from msk board members and investors,who stated they were no longer willing to invest in msk when they found out wells fargo was pursuing msk for the balance on the promissory note,a matter kakish had told them was settled the letters reflect deep distrust of kakish and the authors conclusions kakish must have lied to them about the settlement.
we agree with the district court msk was not compelled to to investors that wells fargo was pursuing it for the defaulted loan.first,wells fargo was not pursuing msk for the balance of the loan it was keeping the defaulted loan on its books until the conditions of its settlement with raed were satisfied.as stated in the background section,wells fargo had specifically retained its right to pursue raed for the full balance of msk loan in the event raed missed any of his settlement payments.there is no evidence in the record that wells fargo demanded payment from msk or suggested it would take legal action against msk to recover the balance owed.second,wells fargo hennepin county action against msk for the debt was dismissed with prejudice and,by law,wells fargo could no longer collect from msk.third,wells fargo could not have foreseen msk would feel compelled to inform its investors of actions wells fargo was not taking.
with respect to the inclusion of the debt on msk monthly account statements,appellants argue that information was material to investors because it related to the financial strength and creditworthiness of the company.we disagree.the information about the defaulted loan was irrelevant to the actual financial strength and creditworthiness of msk wells fargo did not demand payment from msk and gave msk no reason to believe it intended to take legal action to recover the debt.thus,no reasonable investor would have needed to k
