civil code section section requires credit card issuers engaged in extending credit to cardholders by means of a preprinted check or draft known as convenience checks in the industry to disclose on the front of an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft,in clear and conspicuous language,all of the following information that use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account.the annual percentage rate and the calculation of finance charges,as required by section of regulation z of the code of federal regulations,associated with the use of the attached check or draft.whether the finance charges are triggered immediately upon the use of the check or draft.
alleging systematic violations of section,plaintiff allan parks filed a class action lawsuit against defendant mbna america bank,mbna for its purportedly unlawful business practices under business and professions code section et.mbna is a national banking association,organized under the laws of the united states and regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ.see et the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to mbna,following rose chase bank usa,cir rose in finding section preempted by federal law applicable to national banks.we conclude section is not,on its face,preempted and therefore reverse.section does not preclude national banks from exercising their authority to lend money on personal security under section of title of the united states code seventh.furthermore,without a factual record,a court can not conclude that section significantly impairs national banks authorized activities 
as the court granted judgment on the pleadings to mbna,we assume the truth of,and liberally construe,all properly pleaded factual allegations in parks complaint.stone street capital,llc california state lottery com.th,stone street.
in february,mbna issued a credit card to parks.mbna sent several preprinted drafts to his residence and the residences of other similarly situated proposed class members in late.the drafts sent to parks and the other proposed class members did not contain any of the three disclosures required by section.parks used two of the preprinted drafts other proposed class members used drafts sent to them.parks and the other class members incurred finance charges and interest charges for each transaction,as interest accrued as of the date of the transactions there was no grace period as is typical in credit card transactions.
parks,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,sued mbna in june for its alleged violations of business and professions code section et.several years into the litigation,mbna renewed a previously rejected motion for judgment on the pleadings,basing its renewed motion on subsequent case law rose,supra.the court granted mbna motion and entered judgment against parks.
discussion 
we review the judgment de novo,as it was based on the trial court grant of mbna motion for judgment on the pleadings.stone street,supra,th at.
in all material respects,rose,supra,is factually identical to the case before us.in rose,class action plaintiffs sued chase bank usa,chase for its alleged violations of section.rose,at.the convenience checks provided by chase to its cardholders lacked disclosures required under section.rose,at.the district court granted chase motion for judgment on the pleadings and the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed.id.at.both courts held federal law preempted section as applied to national banks.rose,at rose chase manhattan bank usa d.
parks asserts rose was wrongly decided.we are not bound to follow federal court precedent however,numerous and consistent federal decisions may be particularly persuasive when they interpret federal law.etcheverry service,cal th,overruled on another ground in bates dow agrosciences llc.if we are persuaded federal law preempts section as applied to national banks,the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl obligates this court to honor federal law by holding section inapplicable to mbna.
uncontroverted legal framework 
we begin our analysis by setting forth several uncontroversial propositions.first,federal law can preempt state law in one of three ways expressly by actually conflicting with state law or by exclusively occupying a legislative field.miller bank of america,th,miller.
second,federal banking law sometimes,but not always,preempts state regulation as applied to national banks.business activities of national banks are controlled by the national bank act nba or act,et,and regulations promulgated thereunder by the occ.citations.as the agency charged by congress with supervision of the nba,occ oversees the operations of national banks and their interactions with customers.watters wachovia bank,watters.f ederal control shields national banking from unduly burdensome and duplicative state regulation.citations.federally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or the general purposes of the nba.id.at.
third,national banks are authorized by the nba to carry on the business of banking by loaning money on personal security seventh.it is uncontested that federal law authorizes mbna to extend credit by way of convenience checks to parks and other credit card customers.smiley citibank cal th,it is clear that national banks are authorized to conduct credit card programs,to issue credit cards to holders,and to provide money thereunder to such persons and to others on their behalf in exchange for goods or services.but there is no reference to state law in the text of the nba with regard to the business of loaning money on personal security.the nba does not explicitly answer whether state law requiring particular disclosures in connection with convenience checks is preempted.
fourth,occ issued regulations in that purport to explain which state laws pertaining to estate lending powers of national banks are preempted.in relevant part,these regulations provide except where made applicable by federal law,state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized estate lending powers are not applicable to national banks.a national bank may make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning viii disclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in credit application forms,credit solicitations,billing statements,credit contracts,or other documents.d.state laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the estate lending powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent that they only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks estate lending powers contracts torts criminal law rights to collect debts acquisition and transfer of property taxation zoning and any other law the effect of which the occ determines to be incidental to the estate lending operations of national banks or otherwise consistent with the powers set out in paragraph a of this section.e fn.omitted.
fifth,the federal truth in lending act tila,title of the united states code section et,and its accompanying regulations regulation z,code of federal regulations part et,require specific disclosures by businesses offering consumer credit including national banks issuing credit cards.tila grants the board of governors of the federal reserve system and not occ power to prescribe regulations and carry out the purposes of tila.b,a.mbna is compelled by tila and regulation z not to mention contract law to disclose the terms of the convenience checks it offers to consumers.but nothing in federal law specifies that such disclosures must be provided in an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft,subd.a.moreover,nothing requires use of the precise language required in section,subdivision a that use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account.subject to certain exceptions,tila does not annul,alter,or affect the laws of any state relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions,except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter,and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.a.neither party contends section is preempted by tila or is otherwise inconsistent with tila.
the rose cases holding section is preempted 
the district and circuit courts in rose engaged in slightly different analyses.the ninth circuit observed that congress explicitly granted national banks the power to loan money on personal security and that chase exercised this power by extending credit via convenience checks.rose,supra,at.the court distilled the following rule from supreme court precedent where,as here,congress has explicitly granted a power to a national bank without any indication that congress intended for that power to be subject to local restriction,congress is presumed to have intended to preempt state laws such as cal.ibid.given the stated legal rule and the circumstances of the case,the rose court held it was required by supreme court precedent to conclude section was preempted.rose,at.rose relied on three supreme court cases in support of its conclusion watters,supra,at barnett bank of marion county,nelson,barnett and franklin nat.bank of franklin square people,franklin.rose,at.
the rose district court began with a similar analysis.rose chase manhattan bank usa,supra,d at.in addition,the district court proceeded to analyze code of federal regulations part d.rose chase manhattan bank usa,supra,at.the district court found part d to be compatible and consistent with prior supreme court decisions.rose chase manhattan bank usa,supra,at.the district court further found part d to be a valid exercise of the comptroller power to preempt inconsistent state law rose chase manhattan bank usa,supra,at under the notice and comment rulemaking procedures prescribed by title of the united states code section.this regulation preempts section because it deems inapplicable to national banks state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized estate lending powers d and it authorizes a national bank to make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning d isclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in documents d viii rose chase manhattan bank usa,supra,at.
we must affirm the judgment if we agree either that the result in rose,supra,at page,follows from supreme court precedent,or that code of federal regulations part d is a validly enacted regulation that preempts by its own force section.
no preemption by the nba 
as noted above,the nba in particular,seventh provides little guidance on the question of whether state laws requiring disclosures in addition to those required by federal consumer protection law should be preempted when applied to national banks.unlike the ninth circuit court of appeals,we do not think united states supreme court authorities provide an easy answer either 
in franklin,new york passed a law prohibiting all entities other than savings banks or savings and loan associations from making use of the word saving or savings or their equivalent in its banking or financial business,or use any advertisement containing the word saving or savings,or their equivalent franklin,supra,at,fn.federal law authorized national banks to receive savings deposits.id.at.the appellant violated the state law by using the word saving and savings in advertising,in signs displayed in the bank,on its deposit and withdrawal slips,and in its annual reports.id.at.the supreme court found a clear conflict between new york law and federal law.id.at.the supreme court held national banks must be permitted to accept savings deposits further,national banks may not be restricted from describing or advertising its services as savings accounts because this is necessary to compete in the business of accepting deposits in the banking industry.ibid.
in barnett,the supreme court was presented with the question of whether a federal statute that permits national banks to sell insurance in small towns a state statute that forbids them to do so.barnett,supra,at.the florida statute at issue stated,in essence,that banks can not sell insurance in florida except that an unaffiliated small town bank may sell insurance in a small town.id.at.the court first observed there was no irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes national banks could comply with both federal law and state law by not acting as an insurance agent in florida.id.at.but the court concluded the federal grant of authority national banks may act as the agent for insurance sales was designed to grant a broad,not a limited,permission.id.at.the court next summarized relevant law n ormally congress would not want states to forbid,or to impair significantly,the exercise of a power that congress explicitly granted.to say this is not to deprive states of the power to regulate national banks,where unlike here doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank exercise of its powers.id.at.the court held the florida statute was preempted.id.at.
in watters,the supreme court was faced with the question of whether national banks operating subsidiaries which are entities are properly regulated by state regulators via licensing schemes,reporting requirements,and visitorial powers the last being the regulatory power to conduct audits and surveillance of the regulated entity.watters,supra,at.the court reiterated states are permitted to regulate the activities of national banks where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank or the national bank regulator exercise of its powers.but when state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority,enumerated or incidental under the nba,the state regulations must give way.id.at.the supreme court concluded that,because national banks were authorized by statute and regulation to do business through operating subsidiaries and because federal law vested visitorial powers over national banks solely to the occ,national banks operating subsidiaries are subject solely to the visitorial oversight of the occ and not state regulators.id.at see a no national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by federal law.the supreme court interpretation comported with code of federal regulations part,which provides that state laws applied to operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank watters,at,but the court explicitly declined to clarify whether the occ regulation was owed any deference.id.at.
in sum,according to pertinent supreme court conflict preemption precedents,the nba precludes states from forbidding,or impairing significantly,the exercise of a power explicitly granted to national banks by the nba.
on its face,section does not forbid the exercise of a banking power authorized by the nba.section does not bar national banks from loaning money on personal security through convenience checks.instead,section is a generally applicable disclosure law applying to any credit card issuer that extends credit to a cardholder through the use of a preprinted check,subd.a.rather than forbidding the loaning of money via convenience checks,section,subdivision a,merely requires clear and conspicuous disclosures of three items of information and requires those disclosures to be attached to the convenience checks.
but the question remains whether section significantly impairs the exercise of the power to lend money on personal security.the court grant of judgment on the pleadings precludes an examination of the factual question of how national banks are actually burdened by section.clearly,section facially imposes some burden whether significant or not on national banks.and regardless of the particular burden imposed by section,mbna and other national banks would prefer to avoid navigating particular regulatory regimes in each of the states.does section or any similar state disclosure law amount to a significant impairment of mbna power to loan money on personal security as a matter of law 
an affirmative answer to this question would have the benefit of establishing clarity in the law.national banks could safely ignore section and other state disclosure laws without considering whether a particular statute will be preempted based on a trial court factual findings.see rose,supra,at where,as here,congress has explicitly granted a power to a national bank without any indication that congress intended for that power to be subject to local restriction,congress is presumed to have intended to preempt state laws such as cal.
but our role,of course,is not to divine the best policy.we are tasked with deciding whether the nba which is itself silent on the question of disclosure obligations preempts section,not whether congress should have preempted all state consumer disclosure laws when it enacted tila or the nba.and,according to the united states supreme court,the preemption test is not whether the law causes any impairment of the exercise of banking powers the test is whether such impairment is significant.
one federal district court case explored the preemption question with regard to the extensive disclosure requirements mandated by civil code section.american bankers association lockyer d american bankers.a variety of federally regulated financial institutions including but not limited to national banks chartered under the nba challenged the validity of civil code section on the grounds that it was preempted by various federal banking laws.american bankers,at.the banks introduced evidence showing estimated costs of compliance with the statute.id.at.the court ultimately granted summary judgment and a permanent injunction to the banks,prohibiting california from enforcing the statute against all federally chartered credit card issuers.id.at.
the american bankers court first explained that tila savings clause a is expressly limited to tila and does not purport to preclude other federal law from preempting state regulation of disclosures.american bankers,supra,d at.
as to the nba,the court,reviewing the evidence and deferring to an occ amicus brief and opinion letter,concluded civil code section imposed substantial monetary and burdens on national banks.american bankers,at.the court further indicated its agreement with occ position in that certain de minimus disclosure requirements might not be preempted by federal law.the court opined that one portion of the statute fell within the de minimus exception as its effects were salutary and its burdens were minimal.id.at see,subd.a a credit card issuer shall,with each billing statement provided to a cardholder in this state,provide the following on the front of the first page of the billing statement in type no smaller than that required for any other required disclosure,but in no case in less than capitalized type a written statement in the following form minimum payment warning making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.but the court ultimately concluded that civil code section,subdivision a,could not be severed from the remainder of the statute in order to be enforced only against some federally chartered institutions the national banks.american bankers,at.
american bankers is a mixed bag for the parties in this case.on the one hand,the ultimate result was the preemption of civil code section,a california statute that regulates disclosures provided by credit card issuers.on the other hand,the statute at issue in american bankers is lengthy and detailed,and the court reached its decision only after considering actual evidence of the burdens placed on banking institutions.under american bankers,some disclosure laws are simply not significant enough to be preempted.
moreover,our california supreme court endorsed leaving some nba preemption decisions open to factual proof in a different context years ago although conceivably information not contained in the pleadings might lead to a different conclusion,such information is not before us in reviewing a judgment upon demurrer.we can not presume,without evidence,that prohibiting a national bank from setting unreasonable prices or enforcing an unconscionable contract will render that bank less efficient,less competitive or less able to fulfill its function in a national banking system.see perdue crocker national bank cal d,perdue discussed below in detail.
we conclude that when a state disclosure requirement does not,on its face,forbid or significantly impair national banks from exercising a power granted to it by congress under the nba,national banks claiming preemption must make a factual showing that the disclosure requirement significantly impairs the exercise of the relevant power or powers.section does not,on its face,significantly impair federally authorized powers under the nba.it consists of a brief disclosure requirement that applies only to convenience checks.of course,given the procedural posture of this case,mbna has not yet had an opportunity to submit evidence establishing a significant impairment.we need not elucidate a precise yardstick for measuring when a state law significantly interferes with the exercise of national banks powers.american bankers,supra,d at noting the absence of such a yardstick,commenting that the threshold of preemption is in some cases remarkably low,but also indicating other burdens are insufficient to warrant preemption.
no preemption by code of federal regulations part 
federal regulations may preempt state law just as fully as federal statutes.miller,supra,th at.a regulation issued by occ,code of federal regulations part d,purports to preempt the application of certain state laws to national banks.in addition to the district court in rose,several other courts have applied code of federal regulations part to invalidate state laws as applied to national banks.see miller,supra,th at without examining validity of occ regulations,holding,to be preempted by d iv augustine fia card services,d,claims under california unfair competition law against credit card issuer for retroactively increasing interest rates preempted by d iv.
it is clear that code of federal regulations part d,if valid,expressly preempts section.this regulation deems inapplicable to national banks state laws that obstruct,impair,or condition a national bank ability to fully exercise its federally authorized estate lending powers d and it authorizes a national bank to make estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning d isclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in documents d viii.in light of this clear,specific language,it would be disingenuous to claim that section falls within one of the general categories identified in code of federal regulations part e,in which state law is not preempted,state law pertaining to contracts,torts,or a ny other law the effect of which the occ determines to be incidental to the estate lending operations of national banks or otherwise consistent with the powers set out in paragraph a of this section.
parks claims code of federal regulations part is invalid insofar as it purports to preempt section.the thrust of parks argument is that occ lacked authority to essentially announce that the nba preempted the field of disclosure law or,more broadly,consumer protection law with regard to national banks.as discussed above,the nba itself has traditionally been interpreted as preempting state consumer protection legislation that conflicted with the nba terms by foreclosing banking activities authoriz
