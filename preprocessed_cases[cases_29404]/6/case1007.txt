in this appeal,we must decide whether certain monetary transfers from one internal revenue code subchapter s corporation scorporation to two other s corporations constituted bona fide loans,and,if so,whether those loans were effectively discharged,thereby resulting in cancellation of indebtedness income to the borrower corporations and their shareholder,emery ellinger,iii ellinger the district court concluded that the distributions at issue were not true loans and that,therefore,ellinger,as a shareholder in the borrower s corporations,could not claim cancellation of indebtedness income to adjust his basis on his income tax return.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the internal revenue service irs.ellinger challenges that decision and argues on appeal that there is sufficient evidence to show that the monetary transfers constituted bona fide loans and that they were effectively discharged.because we conclude that ellinger has failed to show the existence of a debt,we affirm the district court order.
background 
ellinger was the owner of a interest in three distinct,closely held corporations aberdeen marketing,aberdeen,globaltel,globaltel,and promail,promail.each of these corporations previously had elected to be taxed as s corporations in,aberdeen made monetary transfers of to globaltel and to promail.in its corporate accounting records,aberdeen initially characterized these transfers as creating debt obligations owed by globaltel and promail.
at the end of,aberdeen made adjustments to its books and recharacterized these transfers as distributions to aberdeen shareholder,ellinger and as capital contributions to globaltel and promail the irs audited ellinger tax return and took issue with the characterization of the transfers as capital contributions to globaltel and promail.because the irs contended that the transfers constituted debts owed from globaltel and promail to aberdeen,the irs asserted that ellinger was not entitled to rely on the putative capital contributions to increase his basis in the globaltel and promail shares.accordingly,the irs disallowed ellinger attempted deductions on his return.
ellinger disputed the irs position concerning his tax return and filed an appeal with the united states tax court ellinger subsequently settled the dispute with the irs,with the two parties entering into a series of closing agreements in settlement of that case in the closing agreement between the irs and aberdeen,the parties agreed that the readjustment of the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail would be disregarded.moreover,aberdeen and the irs agreed that 
advances made by the taxpayer aberdeen to globaltel in the amount of and to promail in the amount of constitute d genuine indebtedness owed by globaltel and promail to the taxpayer aberdeen as of december.
ex.a at emphasis added.
the irs entered into separate written agreements with globaltel and promail,respectively.in each of these closing agreements,the parties similarly agreed that the recharacterization of the transfers from aberdeen would be disregarded.contrary to the aberdeen closing agreement,however,the closing agreements with globaltel and promail failed to refer explicitly to the transfers from aberdeen as genuine indebtedness.rather,each of these closing agreements stated 
none of the amount of funds advanced by aberdeen to either globaltel or promail in is attributable to loans from,or paid in capital contributed by,either globaltel or promail shareholders for purposes of determining shareholder basis under section.
ex.a at,ex.b at.each of the closing agreements indicated that they were final and conclusive in nature and that each was subject to the internal revenue code sections that expressly provide that effect be given to their provisions.see,ex.a at,ex.b at,ex.c at.
two additional developments occurred that are germane to ellinger appeal.first,in,aberdeen acquired all of the assets of globaltel and promail,as well as all of the third party debts of those entities in the wake of the acquisition,aberdeen absorbed globaltel and promail into its operations globaltel and promail ceased to exist as independent entities.as to the transfers that aberdeen had made in to globaltel and promail,aberdeen wrote off those debts from its corporate books.see,ex.d,at.
the second significant development in this case occurred in,when the supreme court decided gitlitz commissioner,d.in gitlitz,the supreme court held that cancellation of debt income cod income constitutes an item of income under section of the code.at.at.as such,the court held that cod income passes through to the shareholder of an s corporation.id.moreover,the court held that cod income,like any other item of income in a,could be relied upon to increase the shareholder basis in the stock of the s corporation.see also pugh,at stating that the language of section requires that the shareholder basis be increased by the amount of cod income that passed through to him from the s corporation.
in the wake of gitlitz,ellinger filed an amended tax return for the tax year,wherein he claimed additional net operating losses attributable to globaltel and promail.ellinger claimed an increase in the basis of his globaltel and promail stock as a result of the cod income that was realized when aberdeen acquired those two companies and canceled their debts in.because the cod income led to an increase in the basis of ellinger stock in globaltel and promail,ellinger also sought to claim certain suspended losses and carry them back for two previous tax years,and.accordingly,ellinger filed amended tax returns for and and sought refunds in the amount of and,respectively.when the irs denied ellinger claim,ellinger filed a complaint in the district court seeking a refund of the amounts specified on his amended tax returns.
both parties moved for summary judgment.ellinger motion hinged on the language of the closing agreements that the irs had entered into in,in settlement of the prior tax court litigation.ellinger contended that the language in the closing agreement between the irs and aberdeen,in which the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail expressly were characterized as genuine indebtedness,ex.a at,conclusively established that the transfers at issue were to be viewed as debts by the companies.at.ellinger further argued that aberdeen writing off of the debt of globaltel and promail in,in the course of acquiring those companies,effectuated a cancellation of the debt,thereby resulting in cod income to globaltel and promail.accordingly,ellinger contended that he was entitled to increase his basis in his globaltel and promail stock,thereby taking advantage of suspended losses on his tax returns.
the irs motion conceded that ellinger would be entitled to a refund under gitlitz if he could prove that globaltel and promail realized actual cod income in.the irs contended,however,that there was insufficient evidence to show that the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail constituted bona fide debts.furthermore,the irs argued that there was no evidence that aberdeen ever canceled the debt.because there was no debt and because there was no discharge of debt,the irs argued,globaltel and promail never received cod income,and,consequently,ellinger could not seek to pass through the cod income to increase his basis.
the irs also took issue with ellinger reliance on the closing agreement to establish a genuine debt between aberdeen and globaltel and promail.the irs maintained that the closing agreement with aberdeen established that the transfer constituted a genuine debt on aberdeen books as between the irs and aberdeen,but noted that in this case ellinger was seeking an increase in his basis as a shareholder of globaltel and promail.the irs pointed out that the globaltel and promail agreements were devoid of any language characterizing the transfers as genuine debt.consequently,the irs contended that the globaltel and promail agreements,standing alone,failed to establish that the aberdeen transfers were debt obligations.instead,the irs asserted that the language of those two closing agreements evinced only an intent to agree to disagree as to the categorization of the transfers from aberdeen.at.
the summary judgment motions were referred to a magistrate judge,who reviewed the parties arguments and prepared a report and recommendation for the district court.in her report,the magistrate judge first observed that the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail lacked any indicia of bona fide indebtedness.applying the analysis that we set forth in lane united states,cir,the magistrate judge concluded that there was no objective evidence to support ellinger contention that the transfers were debts rather,she concluded that the transfers were more likely intended to be capital contributions to globaltel and promail.
secondly,the magistrate judge report agreed with the irs position that the closing agreements were intended to be read separately,as individual contracts.therefore,the magistrate judge found that there was no language in the closing agreements between the irs and globaltel and promail to support ellinger characterization of the transfers as debts.although there was indeed evidence of a debt in the aberdeen closing agreement,the magistrate judge concluded that this separate agreement with aberdeen did not relate to the tax liabilities of globaltel,promail,or the shareholders of these two companies.at.moreover,because the language of the globaltel and promail agreements was clear and unambiguous,the report indicated that it would be improper to consider evidence that went beyond the four corners of the agreement,such as the language of the agreement with aberdeen.
as a final matter,even assuming that the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail constituted genuine debt,the magistrate judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show that an effective discharge of the debt had occurred,thereby resulting in cod income for globaltel and promail.the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge in its entirety and granted summary judgment to the irs.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
ellinger argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the government.we review a district court grant of summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.gibson rtc,cir.in doing so,we apply the same legal standards as those that controlled the district court.real estate financing rtc,cir.according to those standards,summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.in this particular case,the parties have conceded that no issues of fact are in dispute rather,the parties disagreement centers on the legal consequences that flow from the facts of this case.because there are no disputed factual issues,our review involves a determination as to whether the district court conclusions were proper as a matter of law.see owens storehouse,cir.
ellinger argument on appeal is.first,ellinger argues that the transfers made from aberdeen to globaltel and promail did constitute bona fide debt,and that there is sufficient evidence to support that characterization.ellinger second contention flows from the first he argues that a valid discharge of the putative debt occurred when aberdeen acquired globaltel and promail and wrote off the debt on aberdeen corporate books,thereby creating cod income for globaltel and promail.because we do not accept the first of ellinger contentions,we need not address the second.
whether the transfers from aberdeen constituted actual debts 
debt for federal income tax purposes connotes an existing,unconditional,and legally enforceable obligation to repay.hubert,subsidiaries comm r,wl.the irs regulations governing the bad debt deduction define a bona fide debt as a debt which arises from a relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money.c.a capital contribution or a gift is not a debt.see id.courts,in reviewing a monetary transaction to determine whether it constitutes a bona fide debt,must review closely the objective facts of the transaction,roth steel tube comm r,cir,rather than whatever characterization that the taxpayer subsequently chooses to ascribe to it.we have held that taxpayers are liable for the tax consequences of the transaction they actually execute.selfe united states,cir.that is,taxpayers are bound by the form of their transaction and may not argue that the substance of their transaction triggers different tax consequences.id.

in lane,we established a test to aid courts in determining whether transfers to a corporation constitute debt or equity.at.although lane involved the question of whether a transfer constituted a debt for purposes of the bad debt deduction under,the lane test has been applied subsequently in a number of cases in this circuit to determine whether a particular monetary transfer constituted a debt.see,selfe,at in re hillsborough holdings.the thirteen lane factors that should be considered in determining whether a transfer is a bona fide debt are 
the names given to the certificates evidencing the indebtedness 
the presence or absence of a fixed maturity date 
the source of payments 
the right to enforce payment of principal and interest 
participation in management flowing as a result 
the status of the contribution in relation to regular corporate creditors 
the intent of the parties 
thin or adequate capitalization 
identity of interest between creditor and stockholder 
source of interest payments 
the ability of the corporation to obtain loans from outside lending institutions 
the extent to which the advance was used to acquire capital assets and 
the failure of the debtor to repay on the due date or to seek a postponement.
at.we made clear in lane that these factors are not rigid rules but are rather helpful guidelines to be considered and weighed by the court.id.at.additionally,a court is not bound to consider all thirteen of the lane factors it needs to weigh only those factors that are relevant to the particular transaction.id.
in expressly adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,the district court applied the lane factors that it deemed were germane to ellinger case and concluded that the transfers paid from aberdeen to globaltel and promail did not constitute bona fide debts.the court noted that there were no promissory notes executed in connection with the transfer of funds and that ellinger could not recall if there was any interest rate agreed upon in connection with the transaction.the court also observed that the funds transferred to globaltel and promail were not secured by any collateral,nor were any of the funds transferred by aberdeen ever repaid.in light of these findings,as well as the general lack of formalities attendant to the transactions,the district court concluded that the transfers in question did not constitute bona fide debts as a matter of law in the absence of a valid debt running from aberdeen to globaltel and promail,the district court reasoned that ellinger could not rely upon cod income to increase his cost basis in his shares of globaltel and promail.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the irs.
we conclude that the district court decision was fundamentally sound.applying our analysis in lane,it is clear that the transfers from aberdeen to globaltel and promail lacked the traditional indicia of debt.there were no promissory notes evidencing indebtedness on the part of globaltel and promail.there was no evidence presented to show that the purported loan had a fixed maturity date,which we have previously held is a highly significant feature of a relationship.sinnett pontiac,comm r,cir.ellinger asserted in his deposition testimony that efforts were made to collect the putative debt from globaltel and promail,but he presented no documentary evidence to show that aberdeen ever actively attempted to recover the funds that it transferred.although ellinger testified that promail comptroller tried to get the money,cash flow when they had it,try to pay that back,ex.d at,ellinger failed to demonstrate a right to enforce payment of principal and interest by showing either a specific protocol for enforcing the loan in the event of a default,or,failing that,a mutually agreed repayment schedule.see lane,at.
moreover,ellinger evidence as to the parties intent was based solely on his contention that aberdeen,globaltel,and promail agreed at the outset that the transfers would be considered loan obligations.yet we have instructed that courts must look beyond the declarations of the parties and examine the objective facts to determine whether the parties intended the advances to constitute debt.id.at citation omitted.one fundamental indicator suggesting an intent to create a loan is the presence of an interest rate as our predecessor circuit has held,a true lender is concerned with interest.curry united states,cir.
ellinger stated in his deposition that he did not recall whether the transfers contained a provision for the payment of interest.during oral argument,his attorney acknowledged that no interest rate was charged in connection with these transfers.the fact that aberdeen would transfer a total of to two fledgling,unprofitable companies without any interest rate provisions,and without any collateral to secure repayment,belies ellinger assertion that the distributions were true,enforceable debts.rather,the objective facts of the transaction do not evince an intent to create a debt between the companies.
we also made clear in lane that in order for a monetary transfer to be construed as a valid debt,the expectation of repayment must not depend solely on the success of the borrower business.lane,at.in lane,the taxpayer asserting the existence of a loan indicated that he would demand repayment from the borrower corporations when it was good for their business.id.at.we held that where repayment was in some way tied to the fortunes of the business,it was unlikely to be a bona fide loan to a borrower corporation.id.citation omitted.in this case,ellinger similarly testified that aberdeen expected to be repaid when globaltel and promail businesses were successfully fix ed and started turning a profit,ex.d at.ellinger further testified that once globaltel and promail had a positive cash flow,he would seek to be repaid.id.these statements suggest that ellinger and,implicitly,his controlled corporation,aberdeen expected to be repaid by globaltel and promail if and when those companies became profitable and repayment became feasible.under our analysis in lane,such evidence militates against finding the transfers to be true debts.
b.the effect of the irs closing agreements 
to circumvent the obvious impact of lane on his case,ellinger argues that t he traditional indicia of bona fide indebtedness became irrelevant when the government and the parties executed the closing agreements.appellant br.at.specifically,ellinger asserts that the closing agreement entered into between the irs and aberdeen,in settlement of the prior tax court litigation,explicitly stated that the advances made by aberdeen to globaltel constitute d genuine indebtedness owed by globaltel and promail to aberdeen,ex.a at.ellinger construes this provision as a by the irs that the transfers in question were to be viewed as debt he contends that,because the provision in the aberdeen closing agreement conclusively binds the irs to the view that the transfers were debts,the irs should not be permitted to take a different position in characterizing the transfers 
ellinger appeal hinges on the language of the aberdeen closing agreement.in effect,he has conceded that the only evidence he has to show the existence of a bona fide debt is the language of that document.the problem with ellinger argument,however,is that the reference to the transfers as debts only appears in the closing agreement between the irs and aberdeen the closing agreements between the irs and globaltel and promail,on the other hand,are devoid of any such language 
section of the code authorizes the secretary of the treasury to enter into written settlement agreements with any person relating to the liability of such person in respect of any internal revenue tax for any taxable period.a.such agreements are deemed to be final and conclusive,and shall not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon.b.in turn,t reasury regulations authorize the commissioner of internal revenue to enter into written closing agreements relating to a person tax liability and give these agreements final and conclusive effect.crowell irs,cir citing a,c.

ellinger is seeking to the claimed cod income based upon his position as a shareholder in globaltel and promail,not as a shareholder in aberdeen.in reviewing the globaltel and promail closing agreements,however,those two documents are silent as to whether the transfers from aberdeen constituted genuine indebtedness.indeed,they fail to take any clear position as to how the transfers should be viewed these two contractual agreements,standing alone,do not indicate that the parties to them the irs,globaltel,and promail expressly agreed to treat the transfers as bona fide debts.there is no evidence that the nature of the transfers was ever specifically noted as settled between the parties to the two agreements.see id.in examining the agreements between the irs,globaltel,and promail according to general principles of contract interpretation,we can conclude only that the transfers were viewed by the parties,rather,as transactions.on their face,the closing agreements do not settle conclusively that the transfers to globaltel and promail constituted genuine debts.
it is true,as ellinger contends,that the closing agreement between aberdeen and the irs described the transfers as genuine indebtedness,ex.a at,but that agreement only binds the parties to that agreement,aberdeen and the irs.as the district court correctly observed,t he closing agreement signed by aberdeen does not relate to the tax liabilities of globaltel,promail,or the shareholders of those two companies.at.it bears reiterating that ellinger tax refund claim is based upon his standing as a shareholder in globaltel and promail,not his standing as a shareholder in aberdeen,and the contractual language of the agreements between those two corporations and the irs fails to prove the existence of a debt.we agree with the decisions of the tax court holding that courts should avoid includ ing as part of the globaltel and promail agreement s matters other than the matters specifically agreed upon and mentioned in the closing agreement.see zaentz,at.
ellinger contends that the globaltel and promail closing agreements must be construed contextually he seeks to interpret those agreements alongside the more explicit language of the aberdeen agreement.in effect,ellinger would have us view the globaltel and promail closing agreements as partially integrated contracts.i f a docu
