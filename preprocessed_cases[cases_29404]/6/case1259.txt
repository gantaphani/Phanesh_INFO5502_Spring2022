introduction 
plaintiffs linda mckell,scott david pasnikowski and susan nero appeal from an order of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to their second amended complaint without leave to amend.plaintiffs challenge the propriety of the trial court ruling.we reverse the order of dismissal and direct the trial court to overrule defendants demurrer as to certain of plaintiffs causes of action.
factual and procedural 
plaintiffs brought this action for damages and equitable relief against defendants as a class action.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer and dismissed the action without ruling on the question whether the case could proceed as a class action.
in their first amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged causes of action for violation of the unfair competition law ucl,bus,et violation of the consumers legal remedies act clra,et unjust of a constructive trust breach of contract breach of bailment agreement and conversion.the basis of all causes of action was defendants overcharging plaintiffs for underwriting,tax services,and wire transfer fees in conjunction with home loans.defendants charged plaintiffs more for these services than defendants paid the service providers.
the trial court sustained defendants demurrer with leave to amend.it explained that plaintiffs causes of action turn on the alleged existence of an agreement requiring washington mutual to charge no more than costs for underwriting,tax services,and wire transfers.plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument that they had no express contractual statement requiring washington mutual to limit charges to costs,so they were relying on an allegedly implied requirement.the court found the first amended complaint unclear as to how such a requirement could be implied from plaintiffs dealings with washington mutual.
the trial court allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaint to allege with specificity why the agreement to charge plaintiffs only costs is implied,how the agreement,as implied,is binding on washington mutual,and why the agreement definitively requires washington mutual to charge costs.the court required plaintiffs to amend each cause of action to explain specifically how washington mutual misconduct related to the agreement.
in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that they obtained federally related mortgage loan s from washington mutual to purchase their homes.as a condition of obtaining the loans,washington mutual required them to pay the costs of automatic underwriting and wire transfers.it did so by disclosing on the settlement statement the purported costs of these fees.the cost to washington mutual of underwriting and wire transfers is substantially less than the amounts washington mutual represents on its settlement statement.
additionally,washington mutual required plaintiffs to pay a tax services fee.the deeds of trust provided by washington mutual,prior to the close of escrow,stated lender may require borrower to pay a one time charge for a real estate tax verification reporting service used by lender in connection with this loan.
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac were created to expand opportunities for home ownership.they are mandated to increase the affordability of home ownership by reducing the cost of borrowing.according to freddie mac,for every reduction in closing costs,another families qualify to purchase a home.
in,fannie mae and freddie mac began requiring lenders who sell loans to them to use automated underwriting software.this software quickly analyzes the borrower ability to repay the loan and assigns an underwriting score.if the score indicates an acceptable risk,the underwriting process is complete,and fannie mae and freddie mac guarantee they will purchase the loan on the secondary market.
the automated underwriting software significantly decreases the cost and risk of underwriting to the lender as well as the time for closing a loan.fannie mae and freddie mac charge just to underwrite a loan,and they can issue a purchase guarantee in minutes.freddie mac estimates that the automated software should save to in closing costs.loans close in five days rather than to days.
rather than passing on the savings resulting from the automatic underwriting program,washington mutual charged borrowers hundreds of dollars for underwriting services which cost only.it charged plaintiff mckell,and plaintiffs pasnikowski and nero,for underwriting services.it did not disclose to borrowers that in many cases it was performing no underwriting services,it was charging them significantly more than the cost of those services and it was retaining the difference.washington mutual intentionally concealed and continues to conceal these practices from borrowers by listing the inflated underwriting charge on the settlement statement while failing to disclose that this is not the actual cost incurred.such a practice deceives consumers by leading them to reasonably conclude that the amount listed is the amount incurred.
washington mutual also requires borrowers to pay third party vendors to obtain information about property taxes on the property being purchased.washington mutual charges borrowers more for the third party vendor services than the vendors charge,without performing any additional services,and retains the difference,unbeknownst to the borrowers.
similarly,washington mutual pays a flat fee to wire money to another bank or title company.it charges borrowers fees for this service well above its costs,without performing any additional services and without disclosing the markup to borrowers.
the foregoing practices,plaintiffs alleged,violated the ucl prohibition against unlawful business practices,in that they defrauded and misled plaintiffs in violation of the civil code and common law violated the california residential mortgage lending act crmla,et violated the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et and housing and urban development hud regulations and policy statements interpreting respa they violated regulation x et violated clra unjustly enriched defendants constituted an unconscionable provision in violation of civil code section,subdivision a and violated united states code sections and prohibiting knowingly making a false statement on a settlement statement.the practices also violated the ucl prohibitions against unfair and fraudulent business practices,in that they were likely to deceive the public and did,in fact,defraud and mislead plaintiffs and frustrate the public policy behind the aforementioned state and federal laws and regulations.
in their breach of contract cause of action,plaintiffs alleged that washington mutual requires its borrowers to pay the cost of automatic underwriting and wire transfers by disclosing on the settlement statement the purported costs of these fees.additionally,a s a condition to obtaining a loan,pursuant to the deed of trust supplied by washington mutual,washington mutual also requires its borrowers to pay a tax services fee.the deed of trust states that the lender may require borrower to pay a one time charge for a real estate tax verification reporting service used by lender in connection with this loan.washington mutual breached its contract because instead of charging plaintiffs for underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services,washington mutual charged plaintiffs amounts in excess of those services.
plaintiffs breach of bailment agreement cause of action was based on washington mutual wrongful use of fees plaintiffs paid it for underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services.their cause of action for conversion was based upon washington mutual overcharging for the services and refusing to return the money it overcharged plaintiffs.
defendants again demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
the court explained that plaintiffs causes of action relied on an implied requirement that defendant charge them costs only.printing charges for underwriting services,on statements,without more,does not create a requirement that defendants charge costs.the statements reflect what washington mutual charges customers for settlement services and not necessarily what washington mutual pays for those services.
while the court did not address each individual cause of action,it noted that washington mutual arguments as to these causes of action appear ed meritorious.for example,respa applies when a lender charges fees for services it did not provide and splits the unearned amounts with third parties.additionally,plaintiffs alleged no affirmative misrepresentations,likelihoods of deception,or duties to disclose sufficient to state a cause of action under clra or the ucl.moreover,with no implied requirement to charge only costs,plaintiffs did not allege a breach of contract,breach of bailment agreement or conversion.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in requiring them to plead a contract as the foundation for all causes of action and to plead their causes of action with heightened particularity.we need not determine whether the trial court erred,in that we will review the second amended complaint de novo to determine whether plaintiffs have stated a cause of action.
plaintiffs further contend they have stated a cause of action for breach of the ucl,which is not dependent upon the existence of a contract.we agree that plaintiffs have stated a ucl cause of action based on fraudulent,unfair and unlawful business practices.this cause of action is not preempted by federal law.
plaintiffs assert that they pled a cause of action under clra.they have not pled a cause of action under clra.
plaintiffs aver they pled a cause of action for breach of contract.we agree that they pled a cause of action for breach of contract.
finally,plaintiffs contend their common law causes of action also are sufficiently pled.we disagree plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they have stated a cause of action for of a constructive trust,breach of bailment agreement or conversion.
discussion 
ipleading of review 
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the plaintiff complaint,whether it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action upon which relief may be based.code civ,subd.e friedland city of long beach th,d.in determining whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,the trial court may consider all material facts pleaded in the complaint and those arising by reasonable implication therefrom it may not consider contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.moore conliffe cal th,d,montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.the court also may consider matters of which it may take judicial notice.code civ,subd.a city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.the court should not sustain the demurrer without leave to amend if the complaint,liberally construed,can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,jager county of alameda th,d.
on appeal,we review the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend de novo,exercising our independent judgment as to whether a cause of action has been stated as a matter of law and applying the abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the trial court denial of leave to amend.williams housing authority of los angeles,supra,th at,d montclair parkowners city of montclair,supra,th at,d.plaintiff bears the burden of proving the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer or abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d coutin lucas d.
the rules of pleading require,with limited exceptions not applicable here,only general allegations of ultimate fact.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,lim.internat.th,d.the plaintiff need not plead evidentiary facts supporting the allegation of ultimate fact.committee on children television,general foods cal d.a pleading is adequate so long as it apprises the defendant of the factual basis for the plaintiff claim.lim,supra,at,d.
the trial court here required plaintiffs to amend their complaint to allege with specificity why the agreement to charge plaintiffs only costs is implied,how the agreement,as implied,is binding on washington mutual,and why the agreement definitively requires washington mutual to charge costs.the court further required plaintiffs to amend each cause of action to explain specifically how washington mutual misconduct related to the agreement.
we perceive no abuse of discretion in requiring plaintiffs to plead a factual basis for implying an agreement by washington mutual to charge only costs.to the extent the court may have required plaintiffs to plead additional evidentiary facts,its ruling would have been in error.committee on children television,general foods,supra,cal d at,lim,supra,th at,d.we need not make the determination as to whether there was error,in that we review the second amended complaint de novo and make our own determination as to whether plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,under any theory.williams housing authority of los angeles,supra,th at,d montclair parkowners city of montclair,supra,th at,d.
as to the trial court requirement that plaintiffs explain how each cause of action relates to the implied agreement,again,we need not determine whether there was error.we will make an independent determination as to whether plaintiffs pleaded an implied agreement and whether such agreement is required to plead a specific cause of action.williams housing authority of los angeles,supra,th at,d montclair parkowners city of montclair,supra,th at,d.
the purpose of the ucl bus,et is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.citation.kasky nike,cal th,d.it defines unfair competition to mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by the false advertising law et.kasky,supra,at,d.
the scope of the ucl is quite broad.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.because the statute is framed in the disjunctive,a business practice need only meet one of the three criteria to be considered unfair competition.south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance th,d.
a cause of action for unfair competition under the ucl may be established independent of any contractual relationship between the parties.acree general motors acceptance th,d fletcher security pacific national bank cal d.thus,the determination whether plaintiffs have stated a cause of action for violation of the ucl is not dependent upon their ability to plead the existence of an implied agreement to charge only costs for underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services.
fraudulent business practices 
plaintiffs first contend they have alleged a ucl cause of action based on fraudulent business practices.a fraudulent business practice is one which is likely to deceive the public.massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d accord,bank of the west superior court cal th,d.it may be based on representations to the public which are untrue,and also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under the ucl.massachusetts mutual life ins,supra,at,d prata superior court th,d.the determination as to whether a business practice is deceptive is based on the likely effect such practice would have on a reasonable consumer.lavie procter gamble th,d.
in people dollar systems,d,defendants prepared invoices for customers whose rental cars were damaged while in their possession,showing the retail cost for the repairs to the cars.defendants paid a discounted price for parts and repairs,however.they did not inform the customers that they were charging them more than the actual cost of the repairs.this practice left customers with the erroneous impression that defendants are passing on only the actual repair charges.at.the court concluded that d efendants practice of charging its customers a higher retail repair rate without explanation or substantiation is a deceptive business practice which falls within the protection of the ucl.id.at.the customers would not reasonably understand that they were being charged a sum considerably in excess of defendants actual repair costs.id.at.
plaintiffs alleged that on their settlement statements,washington mutual disclosed the purported costs of underwriting and wire transfers,and on their trust deeds,washington mutual stated that they might be required to pay a tax services fee.looking at these documents,plaintiffs reasonably would conclude that the fees charged were the costs washington mutual incurred in providing these services.the fees charged were substantially above washington mutual costs,however.as in people dollar systems,supra,washington mutual practice of charging its customers more for services than the actual cost of those services,with no indication to the customers that they were doing so,may constitute a deceptive business practice within the meaning of the ucl d at,as a reasonable consumer likely would believe that fees charged in connection with a home mortgage loan bore some correlation to services rendered.
whether a practice is deceptive or fraudulent can not be mechanistically determined under the relatively rigid legal rules applicable to the sustaining or overruling of a demurrer.schnall hertz th,d.rather,the determination is one question of fact,requiring consideration and weighing of evidence from both sides before it can be resolved.gregory albertson,th,d schnall,supra,at,d.plaintiffs allegations,however,are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent business practices under the ucl.schnall,supra,at,d.
we reject washington mutual claim that its business practices can not be considered deceptive or fraudulent,in that federal law only requires that the statement itemize the charges imposed on the buyer and seller.a b.that the statement merely lists the charge imposed does not preclude a finding it is deceptive.see massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court,supra,th at,d prata superior court,supra,th at,d see,people dollar systems,supra,at.
unfair business practices 
a business practice is unfair within the meaning of the ucl if it violates established public policy or if it is immoral,unethical,oppressive or unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits.schnall hertz,supra,th at,d saunders superior court th,d but see communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at and at,d,dis.opn.of kennard,the determination whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.citation.wilner sunset life ins.th,d.
as with the determination whether a practice is fraudulent,the determination whether it is unfair is one of fact which requires a review of the evidence from both parties.schnall hertz,supra,th at,d.it thus can not usually be made on demurrer.saunders superior court,supra,th at,d.
here,plaintiffs alleged a violation of public policy resulting in harm to consumers.specifically,they alleged a violation of the federal public policy of expanding opportunities for home ownership by reducing the cost of borrowing,in part through the use of automated underwriting software.they alleged harm to consumers through washington mutual failure to pass on to borrowers the savings resulting from the use of automated underwriting software.similarly,they alleged a violation of public policy and harm to consumers through overcharging for wire transfers and tax services.
washington mutual response is twofold.first,it claims that,under the doctrine of judicial abstention,the court should not get involved in setting prices for services.
courts in california have long applied an abstention doctrine in cases involving matters of complex economic policy.desert healthcare dist.pacificare fhp,th,d.this doctrine has been extended into the ucl arena,particularly where federal regulations also are involved.id.at,d see,wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d california grocers bank of america th,d korens zukin d.where a ucl action would drag a court of equity into an area of complex economic policy,equitable abstention is appropriate.in such cases,it is primarily a legislative and not a judicial function to determine the best economic policy.desert healthcare,supra,at,d.
while we appreciate the wisdom of abstention in matters calling for a legislative determination of economic policy,we do not believe abstention is required in the instant case.as set forth more fully below,the legislative determination as to the propriety of washington mutual actions already has been made through the enactment of the applicable laws.thus,by addressing plaintiffs ucl claims,we are doing no more than enforcing economic policies.
second,washington mutual claims that,since its lending practices are strictly regulated,the court should not interfere in the matter by determining that its practices are unfair.the ucl is not,and never was intended to be,a mechanism for challenging the price of goods and services as simply too high.
in support of this second claim,washington mutual cites communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at page,d.simply holds that a plaintiff may not bring an action under the ucl challenging business practices specifically permitted by other statutes.id.at,d.washington mutual cites no statutes specifically permitting its challenged practices.
moreover,the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is not that washington mutual fees are too high.it is that washington mutual leads borrowers to believe it is charging them for the cost of certain services it provides,when in reality it is charging them substantially in excess of such costs.therefore,plaintiffs have alleged unfair business practices within the meaning of the ucl.
unlawful business practices 
unlawful business acts or practices within the meaning of the ucl include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.a practice is forbidden by law if it violates any law,civil or criminal,statutory or judicially made saunders superior court th,d,federal,state or local smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d.
by extending to business acts or practices which are unlawful,the ucl permits violations of other laws to be treated as unfair competition that is independently actionable.citation.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d,communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.even if the violation of another law does not create a private right of action,if the violation constitutes unfair competition,it is actionable.kasky,supra,at,d.
as stated above,plaintiffs alleged that washington mutual practices violated numerous laws,including both california,et,clra,et,civil code section,subdivision a and federal,hud regulations and policy statements interpreting respa,regulation x et,united states code sections and.we focus on respa,as have the parties and the attorney general 
congress enacted respa in in order to reduce the costs consumers pay to settle their real estate transactions.sosa chase manhattan mortg.cir.congress found that significant reforms in the real estate settlement process are needed to insure that consumers throughout the nation are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices that have developed in some areas of the country a.through respa,congress sought to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate that will result in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers and sellers of settlement costs and in the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of certain settlement services,b.
respa requires that lenders use a uniform settlement statement form known as the form.the form must conspicuously and clearly itemize all charges imposed on the borrower in connection with the settlement a.
respa also prohibits kickbacks and unearned fees.sosa chase manhattan mortg,supra,at.section b of respa hereinafter section b,b specifically provides no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
with respect to the question whether section b prohibits charging more than costs,federal courts have focused on the word and,attempting to determine whether a single person can violate the section,or whether both a giver and an acceptor are required for a violation.kruse wells fargo home,cir noted that t he fourth,seventh,and eighth circuits have held that the text of section b clearly and unambiguously does not prohibit,charging plaintiffs for settlement services provided by vendors in excess of the fees that the vendors charged to the defendants for those services,w ithout performing any additional services.kruse,supra,at.courts in those circuits reasoned that the word and in section b phrase no person shall give and no person shall accept requires that there be both one or more persons who give and one or more persons who receive a settlement services fee other than for services actually performed for there to be a violation of the statute.see haug bank of america,cir,krzalic republic title cir,cert.den,d boulware crossland mortg.cir.
however,the eleventh circuit in sosa chase manhattan mortg,supra,concluded that t he and in subsection b operates to create two separate prohibitions giving a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable acceptor,and accepting a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable giver.kruse wells fargo home,supra,at,quoting from sosa,supra,at.thus,if the lender pays a third party for services and,though performing no additional services itself,charges an additional amount to the borrower,it receives that additional amount other than for services actually performed,in violation of the statute.kruse,supra,at,citing sosa,supra,at.
the kruse court found nothing in the language of section b to compel a conclusion as to the correct interpretation of the section.it thus proceeded to a determination whether to give deference to hud policy statement on the question.kruse wells fargo home,supra,at.that policy statement,set forth in regulation x,reads a settlement service provider may not levy an additional charge upon a borrower for another settlement service provider services without providing additional services that are bona fide and justify the increased charge.accordingly,a settlement service provider may not the cost of another provider services without providing additional settlement services such payment must be for services that are actual,necessary and distinct services provided to justify the charge.cfr g.the hud regulation implementing section b states a charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section.cfr c.policy statement.at italics added alteration in the original footnote omitted.kruse,supra,at,fn.
under federal law,deference to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute is mandatory under certain circumstances.kruse wells fargo home,supra,at,citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.deference is said to be mandatory when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.kruse,supra,at,quoting from united states mead,d see also cable telecomm.brand x,d.it appeared to the kruse court that congress had delegated authority to hud generally to make rules carrying the force of law and that the hud policy statement was promulgated in the exercise of that authority kruse wells fargo home,supra,at.
deference also may be mandatory depending upon to what extent the underlying statute suffers from exposed gaps in policies,especially if the statute itself is very complex,as well as on the agency expertise in making such policy decisions,the importance of the agency decisions to the administration of the statute,and the degree of consideration the agency has given the relevant issues over time.kruse wells fargo home,supra,at.the kruse court reviewed the history of hud interpretations of respa,concluding the fact that the policy statement was apparently the culmination of hud reflections on the meaning of section b as applied to over a period of years is further reason to defer to it.kruse,supra,at.additionally,hud has expertise in making policy decisions regarding federally related home mortgage loans,justifying deference to such decisions.id.at.
after weighing the relevant factors,the kruse court concluded that mandatory deference must be accorded to hud interpretation of section b with respect to.kruse wells fargo home,supra,at.thus,in accordance with hud policy statement,section b prohibits a settlement service provider from mark ing up the cost of another provider services without providing additional settlement services.kruse,supra,at.
we are,of course,not bound by decisions of the lower federal courts,even on questions of federal law.mclaughlin walnut properties,th,d black department of mental health th,d.we find kruse persuasive,however,and adopt that court reasoning as our own.
as the kruse court noted,section b does not state clearly and unambiguously that it applies only when there are both a giver and an acceptor of any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.absent clear and unambiguous language in a statute,we interpret a statute in a manner consistent with the language therein and with legislative intent.people gardeley cal th,d,moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.we accord great weight to the contemporaneous administrative interpretation given to a statute unless that interpretation is palpably erroneous.sharon superior court cal th,d,stolman city of los angeles th,d.where the administrative agency interpreting the statute has special expertise and its decision is carefully considered by senior agency officials,that decision is entitled to correspondingly greater weight.sharon,supra,at,d,pacific legal foundation unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.
hud interpretation of section b is not palpably erroneous.first,the language of the section is reasonably susceptible people smith cal th,d,richards,chartered construction th,d of the interpretation given it by hud.as noted in the hud policy statement,section b is written in the disjunctive to the extent it prohibits giving or accepting any portion,split,or percentage of any charge for real estate settlement services other than for services actually performed.it thus applies to more than just a split of unearned fees between two or more persons.at.moreover,had congress intended that section b apply only when two or more persons were involved,it could have clearly specified so.murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,people connor th,d.
additionally,as hud points out,its interpretation of section b is consistent with congress stated intent to protect consumers from unnecessarily high settlement charges.at.allowing a single settlement service provider to charge unearned fees would be contrary to the congressional finding when enacting respa that consumers need protection from unnecessarily high settlement charges.id.at.as previously stated,the goal in interpretation of a statute is to interpret it in a manner consistent with legislative intent.people gardeley,supra,cal th at,d,moyer workmen comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.
washington mutual position is that section b is unambiguous and requires both a giver and a receiver of the fee for settlement services.as stated above,we reject that position.washington mutual also claims that plaintiffs state law causes of action have been preempted by federal law,and the trial court properly sustained its demurrer without leave to amend on that basis.
congress has the power under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution to preempt state law as to matters over which it has authority,art.vi,cl.bronco wine jolly cal th,d.whether state law is preempted by federal law is a question of congressional intent.bronco wine,supra,at,d.intent to preempt may be express or implied.ibid.it is express when congress explicitly states that it is preempting state law.ibid.it will be implied i when it is clear that congress intended,by comprehensive legislation,to occupy the entire field of regulation,leaving no room for the states to supplement federal law citation ii when compliance with both federal and state regulations is an impossibility citation or iii when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.ibid.
in areas traditionally regulated by the states,we start with the presumption that preemption was not intended.preemption will not be found unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.bronco wine jolly,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted accord,medtronic,lohr,d.the party claiming a state law is preempted by federal legislation has the burden of demonstrating preemption.bronco wine,supra,at,d.
even where an intent to preempt state law is found,we must determine the scope of that preemption.medtronic,lohr,supra,at.in doing so,we are again guided by the intent of congress.id.at.
this brings us to washington mutual bank superior court th,d,decided by division five of this district.the case involved a petition for writ of mandate in brown washington mutual bank super.county,no,the case in which hud submitted a letter stating its position that where lenders or others charge consumers prices for services performed by the third party providers without performing additional services,such charges constitute splits of fees or unearned fees in violation of section b of respa.fed.reg.at.
the brown case involved allegations similar to those in the instant case.washington mutual demurred,in part based on the doctrine of preemption.the trial court rejected the claim of preemption and overruled the demurrer.washington mutual filed a petition for writ of mandate to review that ruling.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court noted that both respa and regulation x contain preemption clauses.both clauses provide that respa does not preempt state law except to the extent it is inconsistent with federal law.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d.thus,the doctrine of express preemption applies.id.at,d.
the court pointed out that w hen congress has expressly defined the extent to which state law is preempted,a court will interpret the effect of the preemption language by focusing on the plain wording of the provision citation,but will narrowly construe the precise language of the preemption clause in light of the strong presumption against preemption.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d.where federal law expressly preempts state law only to the extent it is inconsistent with the federal law,the preemption provision will be narrowly construed.id.at,d.state law will be preempted only to the extent compliance with state law precludes compliance with federal law.ibid.
the court noted that t his narrow interpretation of the term inconsistent for purposes of express preemption is also reflected in the position taken by the secretary in an informal opinion on the meaning of the term inconsistent as used in respa.in informal opinion of the department of housing and urban development,issued on january,the secretary takes the position that,there is no inconsistency between respa and state law unless compliance with one statute would result in violation of the other.informal opinion states that,a party,having a duty under respa,must be in violation of the state statute if the party complies with respa and vice versa before a finding of inconsistency can be made.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
the court went on to observe that the language in respa and regulation x providing that state law shall not be deemed inconsistent with federal law if it provides more protection to consumers makes it clear that congress intended that consumers should receive maximum protection not only in the form of federal legislation but also in the form of state laws.congress did not intend any preemption of state laws to occur if those laws resulted in more protections for the consumer as long as the state law did not interfere with the operation of the federal law and it was possible to comply with both the state and federal laws.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d.
based on its analysis,the court held that respa and regulation x do not expressly preempt state law causes of action for violation of their provisions.washington mutual superior court,supra,th at,d.the trial court thus properly allowed the action to proceed on the ucl and other state law causes of action.ibid.
washington mutual does not cite washington mutual superior court,supra,th,d or the preemption provisions of respa and regulation x in its discussion of preemption.it now claims that plaintiffs causes of action are preempted by the home owners loan act hola,et.

in analyzing whether,under section,plaintiffs causes of action are preempted by hola,we begin by observing that banking is an area traditionally regulated by the states.peatros bank of america cal th,d.bank regulation is an area which has been subject to dual control.ibid.we thus must focus on whether the particular state statute at issue is preempted by the applicable federal law.id.at,d.
in lopez world savings loan th,d,plaintiff brought a ucl action alleging a violation of civil code section,subdivision e.the statute at that time provided that the beneficiary of a mortgage or deed of trust could collect a fee of for furnishing a statement of obligation in connection with a secured transaction.lopez,supra,at,d.defendant charged the fee plus an additional or fax fee.id.at,d.plaintiff claimed this additional fee violated civil code section,subdivision e,and thus the ucl.defendant claimed that hola preempted state law as to the propriety of the fax fees.the trial court agreed and granted judgment on the pleadings,finding that section preempted state law as to fees.lopez,supra,at,d.
the appellate court found it clear that section was intended to preempt all state laws purporting to regulate any aspect of the lending operations of a federally chartered savings association.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d.the fee for furnishing a statement of obligation is part of the lending operations of a savings association.id.at,d.the court thus held that section preempted plaintiff cause of action under civil code section and the ucl.lopez,supra,at,d.
the court did note that the ucl remains available to remedy a myriad of potential unfair,unlawful and fraudulent practices engaged in by federally chartered savings and loan associations,so long as the practice is outside the scope of federal regulation.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d.to underscore the distinction between those practices which can be remedied by the ucl and those which can not,the court cited two recent cases addressing the issue.id.at,d.
lopez washington mut.bank,fa cir held that code of civil procedure section,which exempts social security and ssi benefits from any enforcement action,has been preempted by part,a regulation closely comparable to part.because the state statute imposes requirements governing checking accounts,it is preempted by the ots regulation which hereby occupies the entire field of federal savings associations regulations.lopez,at.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d.
the court contrasted the foregoing case with gibson world savings loan th,d,which held that section did not preempt a ucl action alleging the defendant charged borrowers more for replacement hazard insurance than was authorized by their trust deeds.the lopez court agreed with gibson that the duties of a contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations and to act reasonably to mitigate its damages in the event of a breach by the other party,not to misrepresent material facts,and to refrain from unfair or deceptive business practices gibson,at,d,upon which the claims in that case were based,are not requirements or prohibitions of the sort that section preempts id.at,d.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d.the court added that since the duties on which the ucl cause of action was based were general and not specifically directed toward federal savings associations in an attempt to regulate them,a ny effect they have on the lending activities of a federal savings association is incidental rather than material.ibid.
here,plaintiffs are not attempting to employ the ucl to enforce a state law purporting to regulate the lending activities of a federal savings association,as was the case in lopez washington mut.bank,fa,supra.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d.rather,they are using it to enforce federal law governing the operation of federal savings associations.cases addressing other federal preemption statutes suggest that use of the ucl is not preempted under these circumstances.as noted in washington mutual bank superior court,supra,th at page,d holding that a ucl cause of action is not preempted by respa and regulation x,private state causes of action are not inconsistent with the federal disclosure requirements,but rather are complementary to the federal requirements and in fact will promote full compliance with the disclosure law enacted by congress.we do not believe that allowing borrowers to sue for unlawful disclosures or omissions will interfere in any way with the operation of the federal law,and we find no conflict between respa and private state law causes of action.
the medical device amendments of prohibit states from imposing on a medical device any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.medtronic,lohr,supra,at.the supreme court held that,to the extent plaintiffs alleged injury resulting from the manufacturer violation of federal regulations,their state common law causes of action against the manufacturer were not preempted.medtronic,supra,at.it observed that a state law damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different requirement that is necessary under the statute rather,it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing requirements under federal law.ibid.
this court relied on medtronic in resolving preemption questions with respect to a medical device in armstrong optical radiation th,d.the case involved causes of action for negligence,strict liability and breach of warranty based on injuries plaintiff received from a medical device.id.at,d.this court concluded that plaintiff negligence cause of action was not preempted to the extent it was based on violation of federal requirements,plaintiff was not seeking to impose different or additional requirements on the manufacturer.id.at,d.
insofar as plaintiffs are using the ucl to enforce federal law as set forth in respa,they are not seeking to enforce state laws affecting the operations of federal savings associations.a.the ucl does not purport to regulate or otherwise affect a savings association credit activities ibid.but only provides a means of enforcing federal requirements.it thus is the type of state law not preempted by federal law.medtronic,lohr,supra,at.armstrong optical radiation,supra,th at,d.
moreover,we question whether hola and section even are applicable in the instant case.respa,ch,et is not part of hola,ch,et.see.that the two are separate suggests that real estate settlement practices are not part of a federal savings association lending practices and thus are not governed by hola.see people hull cal th,d,chapter headings may be considered in determining legislative intent in re carr th,d same.additionally,it is well established that a more recent and more specific statute controls over an earlier and more general statute.woods young cal d,david beverly hospital th,d.section,which interprets hola,thus would be inapplicable in determining whether state laws affecting settlement practices are preempted.rather,the preemption provisions of respa and regulation x would apply.
in addition,plaintiffs here are using the ucl to enforce general duties imposed on all businesses operating in california,the duties to refrain from fraudulent and unfair business practices.as noted above,usage of state laws in this manner is not preempted.lopez world savings loan,supra,th at,d accord,medtronic,lohr,supra,at.
in world savings loan th,d,this court addressed the question whether section preempted a cause of action under the california consumer credit reporting agencies act,et.it held that the cause of action was not preempted,in that the state statutes at issue are not lending regulations and they do not purport to govern the manner in which a federal savings association runs its business the california statutory scheme does not come into play until after a loan is made or credit otherwise extended,and it does not affect the manner in which the lender services or maintains the loan as a result,the california statutes are not inconsistent with the hola,supra,at,d.
likewise,the duties imposed under the ucl are not lending regulations and they do not purport to govern the manner in which a federal savings association runs its business.world savings loan,supra,th at,d.as division five of this court observed in holding ucl and fraud claims were not preempted by hola,actions for fraud are governed almost exclusively by state law,and do not raise issues of great federal interest.citation.there is no reason to suppose that congress intended to preempt common law tort claims,effectively granting savings associations immunity from such state law claims,and a number of courts have so held.citations.and the bank argument that,by permitting fraud and unfair trade practices suits,the state is regulating the bank conduct,is off the mark.plaintiff ability to sue the bank for fraud does not interfere with what the bank may do,that is,how it may conduct its operations it simply insists that the bank can not misrepresent how it operates,or employ fraudulent methods in its operations.put another way,the state can not dictate to the bank how it can or can not operate,but it can insist that,however the bank chooses to operate,it do so free from fraud and other deceptive business practices.fenning glenfed,th,d,fn.omitted accord,supra,at,d.
in summary,plaintiffs have stated a cause of action under the ucl based on fraudulent and unfair business practices.they also have stated a ucl cause of action for unlawful business practices based on violation of respa.these causes of action are not preempted by respa and regulation x or by hola and section.accordingly,the trial court erred in sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend as to the ucl causes of action.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d,jager county of alameda,supra,th at,d.
the clra was enacted to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.plaintiffs claim washington mutual conduct violates the clra,specifically civil code section,subdivision a and.this provides the following unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services are unlawful representing that a transaction confers,or involves rights,remedies,or obligations which it does not have or involve,or which are prohibited by law.inserting an unconscionable provision in the contract.
plaintiffs cite no authority or make no argument demonstrating that washington mutual actions were undertaken in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services,subd.a,italics added.rather,its actions were undertaken in transactions resulting in the sale of real property.the clra thus is inapplicable and plaintiffs have demonstrated no error in the trial court sustaining of defendants demurrer without leave to amend as to their clra cause of action.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d mansell board of administration th,d.
breach of contract 
a cause of action for breach of contract requires pleading of a contract,plaintiff performance or excuse for failure to perform,defendant breach and damage to plaintiff resulting therefrom.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.a written contract may be pleaded either by its out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by by its legal effect.in order to plead a contract by its legal effect,plaintiff must allege the substance of its relevant terms.this is more difficult,for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,comprehensiveness in statement,and avoidance of legal conclusions.
in their breach of contract cause of action,plaintiffs alleged that washington mutual requires its borrowers to pay the cost of automatic underwriting and wire transfers by disclosing on the settlement statement the purported costs of these fees.additionally,a s a condition to obtaining a loan,pursuant to the deed of trust supplied by washington mutual,washington mutual also requires its borrowers to pay a tax services fee.the deed of trust states that the lender may require borrower to pay a one time charge for a real estate tax verification reporting service used by lender in connection with this loan.washington mutual breached its contract because instead of charging plaintiffs for underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services,washington mutual charged plaintiffs amounts in excess of those services.
plaintiffs have still failed to identify the contract and contractual provision under which washington mutual required them to pay underwriting and wire transfer costs.with regard to the fee for tax services,plaintiffs identify the deed of trust as the contract and set forth verbatim the term requiring them to pay the fee.
as plaintiffs point out,o rdinarily,all applicable laws in existence when an agreement is made,which laws the parties are presumed to know and to have had in mind,necessarily enter into the contract and form a part of it,without any stipulation to that effect,as if they were expressly referred to and incorporated.citation.citations.city of torrance workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.the deed of trust thus required that any tax services fee washington mutual charged plaintiffs comport with respa.see ibid.plaintiffs alleged that the fee violated respa.they therefore stated a cause of action for breach of contract,and the trial court erred in sustaining washington mutual demurrer to that cause of action without leave to amend.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d,jager county of alameda,supra,th at,d.
common law causes of actionunjust enrichment 
plaintiffs common law causes of action were for unjust enrichment,breach of bailment agreement and conversion.there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment.rather,unjust enrichment is a basis for obtaining restitution based on or imposition of a constructive trust.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.although plaintiffs second amended complaint states that they are seeking imposition of a constructive trust,they do not explain,with citations to appropriate authority,how they have stated a cause of action therefore.consequently,plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that they have stated a cause of action for of a constructive trust.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d mansell board of administration,supra,th at,d.
a bailment is made by one giving to another,with his consent,the possession of personal property to keep for the benefit of the former,or of a third party,gebert yank d.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,personal property.plaintiffs allege in their breach of bailment cause of action that they delivered to washington mutual,and washington mutual agreed to hold for the benefit of plaintiffs,money to pay the cost of underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services.more specifically,they allege that washington mutual entered into a standard form loan contract with plaintiffs,in which plaintiffs agreed to pay washington mutual for the benefit of third parties money for the cost of tax services,and washington mutual agreed to pay over to these third party vendors the actual cost for these services and return the remainder to plaintiffs in breach of this agreement,washington mutual paid only a portion of the money to the third party vendors and kept a portion for itself.
in addition to the facts pleaded in the complaint,trial and appellate courts ruling on a demurrer also may properly take judicial notice of a party earlier pleadings and positions as well as established facts from both the same case and other cases.citations.the complaint should be read as containing the judicially noticeable facts,even when the pleading contains an express allegation to the contrary.citation.a plaintiff may not avoid a demurrer by pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradict the facts pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing facts which prove the pleaded facts false.citation.cantu resolution trust th,d,italics omitted see also,hendy losse cal d,d.
the trial court noted in sustaining defendants demurrer to plaintiffs first amended complaint that plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument that they had no express contractual statement requiring washington mutual to limit charges to costs,so they were relying on an allegedly implied requirement.elsewhere in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that the requirement that they pay underwriting and wire transfer fees arises from the statement,not the loan contract.the deed of trust provision that the lender may require borrower to pay a one time charge for a real estate tax verification reporting service used by lender in connection with this loan does not establish a bailment agreement between plaintiffs and washington mutual.plaintiffs mere allegation of a bailment agreement contrary to these judicially noticed facts is insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of bailment agreement and withstand defendants demurrer.cantu resolution trust,supra,th at,d.
conversion 
a cause of action for conversion requires allegations of plaintiff ownership or right to possession of property defendant wrongful act toward or disposition of the property,interfering with plaintiff possession and damage to plaintiff.burlesci petersen th,d.money can not be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is a specific,identifiable sum involved,such as where an agent accepts a sum of money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.fischer machado th,d.thus,in chazen centennial bank th,d,the plaintiffs stated a cause of action for conversion where the bank took funds from trust accounts to pay the trustee personal indebtedness.
here,however,as stated in connection with the breach of bailment cause of action,plaintiffs did not allege that defendants were holding their payments on behalf of another,in essence in trust for the third party vendors.plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that a cause of action for conversion may be based on an overcharge.consequently,they have failed to demonstrate that they have stated a cause of action for conversion.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d mansell board of administration,supra,th at,d.
the order of dismissal is reversed.the trial court is directed to vacate its order sustaining washington mutual demurrer without leave to amend and to enter a new order overruling the demurrer as to plaintiffs causes of action for violation of the ucl and breach of contract,and sustaining the demurrer as to the remainder of plaintiffs causes of action.plaintiffs are to recover costs on appeal.
i concur with the majority opinion insofar as it affirms some parts of the judgment of dismissal but otherwise dissent.
the trial court found that all of plaintiffs causes of action turn on the existence of an agreement requiring washington mutual to charge no more than the costs for underwriting,tax services,and wire transfers on residential mortgage loan closings.understandably,the trial court inquired when it sustained demurrers to plaintiffs earlier pleadings about the factual basis for this agreement.the answer washington mutual requires its borrowers to pay the cost of automatic underwriting and wire transfers by disclosing on the settlement statement the purported costs of these fees which,by their payment of these fees,plaintiffs agreed to pay i nstead of charging plaintiffs for underwriting,tax services and wire transfer services,washington mutual charged plaintiffs amounts in excess of those services,allegedly leading plaintiffs to believe they were paying for the actual cost of such services.notwithstanding the majority opinion alternative view,it is on this wobbly foundation that plaintiffs build their class action claims for violations of the unfair competition law,the consumers legal remedies act,breach of contract and conversion,alleging that washington mutual illegally charged unearned fees for these services.
the trial court ultimately concluded that plaintiffs allegations,however generously construed,did not establish an implied contract.printing charges for underwriting services,on statements,without more,does not create a requirement that washington mutual charge costs.the statements reflect what washington mutual charges customers for settlement services and not necessarily what washington mutual pays for those services.
because an implied contract arises from a mutual agreement and intent to promise that have not been expressed in words,the facts from which the promise is implied must be alleged.california emergency physicians medical group pacificare of california th,d.notwithstanding plaintiffs admissions in the trial court and on this appeal that their claims depend on the existence of an implied agreement,the majority opinion finds most of plaintiffs claims viable without regard to the existence of an implied or any agreement and holds that the allegations about the are sufficient to state a claim for fraudulent and unfair business practices and other statutory violations.in short,the allegations the trial court found insufficient to allege so much as an implied agreement are construed by my colleagues as sufficient to allege an intentional tort and a violation of public policy resulting in harm to consumers.typed.
the majority opinion is internally inconsistent.after stating that it does matter whether there was an implied agreement,my colleagues dismiss california history of abstention in cases involving matters of complex economic policy desert healthcare dist.pacificare fhp,th,d california grocers bank of america th,d wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d korens zukin d.as irrelevant in this case because the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is that washington mutual leads borrowers to believe it is charging them for the cost of certain services it provides,when in reality it is charging them substantially in excess of such costs.typed,how does this work how can it be that plaintiffs need did facts supporting an implied agreement to charge only the cost of certain services it provides but have nevertheless alleged facts showing that washington mutual led them to believe they would be charged only the cost of certain services it provides in my view,they have alleged either claim 
independent of the facts,i do not agree with the majority opinion analysis of the law.
washington mutual is a federal savings association,authorized and existing under federal law.et,the home owners loan act hola.as such,its regulation,both by statute and judicial fiat,is preempted by federal such matters as l fees and p rocessing charges.b,b fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d glendale fed.sav.loan ass fox.although there is an exception for state tort law,that area too is preempted if a statute or judicial ruling would have more than an incidental effect on a federal savings association lending practices.lopez world savings loan th,d an unfair business practice class action challenging a federal savings and loan association practice of charging a fee for transmission of a payoff demand statement,over and above the fee authorized by civil code section,is preempted by federal law washington mutual bank superior court th,d american bankers association lockyer d,haehl washington mut.bank,d,moskowitz washington mut.bank,fa.d.
in my view,this entire action is preempted by federal law.
i also disagree with the majority opinion interpretation of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,et.respa section b b does not prohibit the payment to any person of compensation for services
