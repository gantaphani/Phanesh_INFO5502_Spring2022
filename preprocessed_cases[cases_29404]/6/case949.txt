delta savings bank delta and young il kim kim appeal two of the district court orders granting a motion for partial summary judgment and a motion for summary judgment in favor of the united states.these rulings dispose of all issues and all parties.we affirm in part and reverse in part.because we affirm the district court on grounds that dispose entirely of the case,we need not remand for further proceedings.
this case is about a state licensed savings bank,delta,that fell under the scrutiny and eventually the control of various agencies of the united states.on september,several individuals of asian ancestry invested approximately million in delta and took over management of the institution.kim invested nearly and assumed the presidency of the bank.at the time he did so,the bank was already failing and under investigation by the office of thrift supervision ots.according to plaintiffs,the bank condition improved almost immediately,but the bank nonetheless came under increased scrutiny by the federal regulators.plaintiffs allege that the increased scrutiny was due to a conspiracy among two ots employees,defendants henry and jones,and a delta employee,miller,who once worked for ots.supposedly,these three were motivated by their racial bias against the asian ancestry of delta management.this is the central theory behind plaintiffs causes of action.delta requested that both the western regional director of the office of the inspector general and the california department of savings and loan investigate the ots.both agencies began investigations into the claims of discrimination.
on may,delta board of directors authorized any and all action necessary to file civil litigation against any and all parties including the ots,jones,miller and henry.on november,the ots served delta with notice that the resolution trust corporation rtc had been appointed conservator and kim was removed as president.despite an administrative review of this action favorable to kim,the ots issued a prohibition order which forever banned kim from working in the american banking industry.this action was appealed to this court,and the prohibition order was vacated.kim office of thrift supervision,cir.
kim,yun suk seo,and michael kim filed suit in the united states district court for the central district of california against the acting director of the ots.the case was assigned to district judge david kenyon.the suit sought removal of delta conservator on the basis that its appointment stemmed from the racial conspiracy among jones,henry and miller.
on april,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint and specifically found that the delta directors had standing to bring suit.subsequently,all parties stipulated to dismiss the suit to allow delta to perfect its claim under the federal tort claims act ftca and,if necessary,the action.

judge kenyon retired from the bench and the action was transferred to judge william matthew byrne.on october,judge byrne granted the defendant motion for partial summary judgment,holding that only the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,as successor to the rtc,had standing to pursue the claims against the ots on behalf of delta.this ruling dismissed all of delta claims brought by kim,in his capacity as a stockholder,officer,or director of delta.the parties that remained were one plaintiff,kim,in his individual capacity,and one defendant,the united states.the remaining cause of action was a tort claim under the ftca.
judge byrne granted defendant motion for summary judgment,holding that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claim because the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity.the district court subsequently denied kim motion to amend the judgment and this appeal was filed on september.

kim statutory standing to sue on behalf of delta under firrea 
on october,district court judge byrne granted the defendant motion for partial summary judgment,dismissing all claims brought by delta and those brought by kim,in his capacity as a stockholder,officer,or director of delta.kim claims brought in his individual capacity remained.
the rtc had been named the conservator and then the receiver of delta.the district court reasoned that the clear language of the financial institution reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea,et,transferred any rights that kim once may have had as a stockholder,officer,and director of delta to the rtc and then to the fdic.according to the district court,the rights transferred included the right to sue on behalf of delta.it reasoned that t he fdic position as receiver or conservator provides it with the exclusive right to file suit against those who injure the institution over which it exercises supervision.
under firrea,conservators and receivers shall by operation of law,succeed to i all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution.d a.it is hard to avoid the conclusion that d a i places the fdic in the shoes of the insolvent s l,except where some provision in the extensive framework of firrea provides otherwise.myers fdic,d.we have held that one of the rights transferred to the fdic as receiver is the right to sue on behalf of the institution.pareto fdic,cir congress has transferred everything it could to the fdic,and that includes a stockholder right,power,or privilege to demand corporate action or to sue directors or others when action is not forthcoming.
despite such unequivocal language,plaintiffs make a simple plea to logic the fdic should not have the final say on whether it is in delta best interests to sue the ots.the ots and the fdic are interrelated agencies with overlapping personnel,structures,and responsibilities,and thus,according to plaintiffs,the fdic faces a conflict of interests when it contemplates a suit against the ots.even though the fdic,as receiver,is supposed to represent the best interest of delta,the fdic may be unwilling to bring a lawsuit against the ots because of the close ties that bind the two agencies.we agree.
in first hartford.pension plan trust united states,the federal circuit adopted a conflict of interests exception to the firrea which is similar to the exception urged by plaintiffs in this case.a large shareholder of a bank,which had been seized and placed under the receivership of the fdic,brought suit against the united states alleging that the fdic had breached contracts and committed unlawful takings in handling the troubled bank.id.at.the lower court of federal held that the shareholder lacked standing because only the fdic,as receiver,had the authority to sue on the bank behalf.id.at citing fed.cl.the court of federal claims based its ruling,in part,on our court holding in pareto.at.
the federal circuit agreed that,as a general proposition,the fdic statutory receivership authority includes the right to control the prosecution of legal claims on behalf of the insured depository institution now in its receivership.first hartford,at.in ruling,however,that the lower court had erred,the federal circuit made an analogy between the lawsuit brought by the plaintiff and corporate derivative lawsuits.the point of a derivative lawsuit is to place in the hands of the individual shareholder a means to protect the interests of the corporation from the misfeasance and malfeasance of faithless directors and managers.id.quoting kamen kemper fin,d.
continuing the analogy to derivative lawsuits,the court focused on conflicts of interest.t he fdic was asked to decide on behalf of the depository institution in receivership whether it should sue the federal government based upon a breach of contract,which,if proven,was caused by the fdic itself.id.the court implied that,just as directors can fall prey to misfeasance and conflict s of interest,so too might the fdic suffer from a conflict of interest.id.without inferring any bad faith or improper motive on the part of the fdic the court held that because of the manifest conflict of interest presented,plaintiff had standing to sue derivatively.id.
we note that the federal circuit expressly limited its holding in first hartford.o ur holding is limited to the situation here in which a government contractor with a putative claim of breach by a federal agency is being operated by that very same federal agency,as is the case in the receivership context.id.emphasis added further saying that the holding was applicable only in a very narrow range of circumstances.
in the instant case,charges were brought against the ots while the bank was in receivership under the rtc which was succeeded by the fdic.we hold that the fact that this case involves separate federal agencies does not distinguish it from first hartford and we adopt the first hartford exception.based on the interrelatedness of these agencies,a manifest conflict of interest has arisen.these are interdependent entities with managerial and operational overlap and thus this lawsuit raises the same kind of conflict that was at issue in first hartford.the government responds that the fdic is independent from the ots and cites statutes and cases that supposedly attest to their independence from one another.we disagree.these are not two disengaged bodies on the opposite ends of an organizational chart these are closely related entities.the director of the ots is,by statute,a member of the board of directors of the fdic.a b.until the rtc ceased to exist,the director of the ots was also a member of the thrift depositor protection oversight board,which had oversight over the rtc.a a.an employee of the ots can simultaneously serve as a deputy or assistant to a member of the board of directors of the fdic,and in such cases,he or she is considered an employee of the fdic under title.f.the fdic and ots jointly publish regulations,issue reports,and conduct cooperative investigations.the ots and rtc even share a common genesis,both having been created in firrea.
furthermore,the two agencies play complementary roles in the process of bailing out failing thrifts.the ots examines and supervises thrift institutions and can declare a bank insolvent or place it under the control of a conservator or receiver to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations.d b.the ots may choose the fdic to be the conservator or receiver in such cases.see d e ii.given the nature and extent of the relationship between the fdic and the ots,we conclude that the fdic can not be expected to objectively pursue lawsuits against the ots,even when it is in the best interest of the failing bank to do so.the conflict of interest thus raised is significant and manifest.we do not suggest that the is faced with a disqualifying conflict every time a is asked to sue another federal agency it is the nature of the relationship that raises the conflict here.
none of the cases cited by the defendant contradict the rule in first hartford,cited supra,stands for the proposition that the fdic steps into the shoes and obtains the rights of the institution.at.the court specifically held that because california state law imputes the knowledge of corporate officers to their corporation,the fdic is treated no differently when it steps into the shoes of a failing bank the knowledge possessed by the former bank directors is imputed to the fdic.id.the strongest proposition that can be drawn from this holding is that the fdic can not escape the limitations that a state imposes on other corporations just because the language of firrea is expansive.in fact,in,the court explicitly noted that there might be exceptions to the absolute rule it put forth,where some provision in the extensive framework of firrea provides otherwise.id.at.
the defendant also points to pareto.in pareto,we spoke with clarity,holding that,congress has transferred everything it could to the fdic through firrea,and that includes a stockholder right,power,or privilege to demand corporate action or to sue directors or others when action is not forthcoming.at.in the very next sentence,however,we noted that exceptions to this absolute rule were justified if the result would otherwise be absurd or impracticable.id.in pareto,the result was not absurd or impracticable because the fdic was qualified to decide,on behalf of the former stockholders,whether the bank should sue the directors for breaching the duty of loyalty and for misrepresenting information.id.at.in the instant case,strict adherence to an absolute rule would be at least impracticable,and arguably absurd.the fdic was asked to demand a lawsuit,refuse this demand,and proceed derivatively with the lawsuit against one of its,sister agencies.this was one hat too many to be placed atop the head of the fdic.
we hold,following first hartford and consistent with and pareto,that a,conflict of interest exception to the commands of firrea warrants granting standing to kim as a representative of delta in this case.however,because we hold in part ii b that delta has no cause of action against the united states under the ftca,although we reverse the court finding of insufficient standing,we need not remand.
b.the federal tort claims act 
the federal tort claims act ftca acts as a waiver of the united states traditional sovereign immunity for certain torts committed by its employees.b.the united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.furthermore,the district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission,if a private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place.b.the district court determination of subject matter jurisdiction under the federal tort claims act ftca is reviewed de novo.brady united states,cir.cert.denied,d.
in their complaint,the plaintiffs ftca claim is based on the ots alleged violation of a federal civil rights statute.section provides a cause of action against parties who fail to prevent conspiracies to violate the civil rights of other people.specifically,any person who knows of a conspiracy to violate civil rights as defined by,and who has the power to prevent the rights violation but refuses or neglects to do so,is liable to the person injured.
plaintiffs suggest,without support,that an ftca claim can be brought for violations of federal statutes that provide private federal causes of action,even if there is no analogous state law.this is not so.the supreme court has addressed
