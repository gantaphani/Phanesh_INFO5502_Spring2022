b to obtain financial benefit for the employee or another person or entity.
however,if some or all of the insured loss results directly or indirectly from loans,that portion of the loss is not covered unless the employee was in collusion with one or more parties to the transactions and has received,in connection therewith,a financial benefit with a value of at least.
appellant.at.
gronlie was employed by bnc as a loan officer from may of until april of.she was promoted to the level of senior vice president and was awarded a lending authority of,which meant that she could approve up to that amount in a loan without seeking prior approval from a loan committee.
in the spring of,gronlie began to provide loans to james thomas harper tom harper,his company,top dog productions top dog,and various other entities connected with harper collectively,harper.tom harper and top dog distributed and managed motion simulators because bnc had little familiarity with that industry,in may of a loan committee member instructed gronlie to increase her due diligence before going ahead with two loan transactions,but otherwise approved them.subsequent transactions were also approved by the loan committee,including a line of credit.from until her termination,gronlie approved numerous loans and lines of credit for harper and harper customers.whether inadvertently or intentionally,top dog submitted false documents,including a false tax return,in support of the various loans.
in the summer of,gronlie husband and tom harper created a company called alamation,owned by each,for the purchase of a motion simulator.financing was arranged through a bank other than bnc,and gronlie personally guaranteed the loan.after her termination,gronlie and her husband bought out tom harper interest in alamation.
various of the harper loans and lines of credit were insufficiently secured and have not been repaid.after receiving proofs of loss from bnc on these transactions in,bancinsure paid bnc several installments totaling.a september,letter sent by bancinsure with a payment of states that bancinsure tenders the sum subject to a complete and full reservation of rights which shall be deemed continuing and mutual between bancinsure and bnc bancinsure shall not require execution of release or satisfaction by bnc at this time in recognition of the reservation of rights between the parties.

while the court was considering the claims under the bond,the united states department of the treasury office of the comptroller of the currency comptroller commenced administrative proceedings against gronlie seeking various debarments from the banking industry and ultimately brokered a settlement with her and others.the settlement,signed by gronlie on may,purports to resolve all claims between the comptroller,gronlie,her husband,alamation,bnc,and bancinsure.under the terms of the settlement,gronlie and her husband,individually and on behalf of alamation,agreed to pay in installments,secured by alamation assets and a personal guaranty from gronlie,to bnc bancinsure as restitution for the losses bnc suffered.bnc and bancinsure signed the settlement agreement in july of.
in august of,bancinsure moved the district court for a decision on its subrogation claim,asserting that it was entitled to step into the shoes of bnc under the terms of the bond and the doctrine of legal subrogation to the extent of its payment and that it should receive some of the funds remitted by gronlie in settlement.after further briefing and a hearing,the court issued an amended judgment on september,holding that bancinsure was entitled to subrogation rights and some of the settlement money.bnc appeals from that decision.
