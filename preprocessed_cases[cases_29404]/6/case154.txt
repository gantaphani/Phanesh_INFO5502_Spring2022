defendant bank of new york mellon trust company,bny mellon appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york engelmayer,declaring that the notice of special early redemption issued by plaintiff chesapeake energy corporation chesapeake on march,was timely and effective to redeem certain senior notes the notes at the special price of of the principal amount,plus interest accrued to the date of redemption.joint app x ja at,chesapeake energy bank of mellon trust.bny mellon brings this appeal in its capacity as indenture trustee for the benefit of the noteholders.
after an expedited bench trial,the district court adopted chesapeake argument,construing the ninth supplemental indenture the supplemental indenture,which governed the notes,as unambiguously authorizing chesapeake to redeem the notes at the special price by giving notice of redemption during the special early redemption period between november,and march,and redeeming the notes to days thereafter.bny mellon contends that the supplemental indenture authorized chesapeake to redeem the notes at the special price only if the redemption would be accomplished within the special early redemption period,no later than march,with notice of to days given during the special early redemption period.we agree with bny mellon.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand for consideration of chesapeake second claim for declaratory relief.
background 
factual background 
in february,chesapeake issued billion in senior notes due on march,bearing an interest rate of.the notes were issued under two indentures a base indenture,dated august,which applied to several series of notes,and the supplemental indenture,dated february,which specifically governed this series.ja at.
this dispute centers on the meaning of of the supplemental indenture,which governs chesapeake option to make a special early redemption of the notes.this section provides 
a the company chesapeake shall have no obligation to redeem,purchase or repay the notes pursuant to any mandatory redemption,sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of a holder thereof.
b at any time from and including november,to and including march,the special early redemption period,the company,at its option,may redeem the notes in whole or from time to time in part for a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed,plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption provided,however,that,immediately following any redemption of the notes in part and not in whole pursuant to this section b,at least million aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding.the company shall be permitted to exercise its option to redeem the notes pursuant to this section so long as it gives the notice of redemption pursuant to section of the base indenture during the special early redemption period.any redemption pursuant to this section b shall be conducted,to the extent applicable,pursuant to the provisions of sections through of the base indenture.
c at any time after march,to the maturity date,the company,at its option,may redeem the notes in whole or from time to time in part for an amount equal to the make whole price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption in accordance with the form of note.
ja at emphasis added.
section b of the base indenture,which provides 
a at least days but not more than days before a redemption date,chesapeake shall mail a notice of redemption by mail to each holder of securities to be redeemed at such holder registered address.
these provisions allowed chesapeake two elective options for early redemption.pursuant to b,chesapeake could elect early redemption of notes at the special price during the special early redemption period.pursuant to c,chesapeake could elect early redemption of notes after the special early redemption period at a substantially higher make whole price.
on february,days prior to the end of the special early redemption period,chesapeake announced that it planned to redeem the notes at the special price pursuant to b.later that day,however,a hedge fund,which had purchased a large amount of the notes,protested that the time allowed for notice of redemption at the special price had expired because redemption at the special price was permitted solely within the special early redemption period and no less than days following the giving of notice,which was no longer possible.
on february,bny mellon notified chesapeake that it would not participate in the proposed redemption.on february,bny mellon told chesapeake that if chesapeake issued a notice of redemption,bny mellon might deem the notice as having triggered redemption at the make whole price pursuant to c.chesapeake nonetheless issued a notice of special early redemption on march,calling for redemption at the special price on may.
b.the trial and the district court decision 
on march,chesapeake filed this action against bny mellon seeking declaratory judgment that its notice of special early redemption at the special price would be timely and effective if mailed by march.in the event the court ruled that the notice was not timely to effectuate early redemption at the special price,the complaint also sought a declaratory ruling that the notice would not trigger redemption at the make whole price.
the court held an expedited bench trial on april,with closing arguments on april.on may,only eight days later,and with the date noticed for redemption only one week away,the court issued a detailed page decision,and entered judgment thereon,ruling that b of the supplemental indenture was unambiguous in setting march,as the deadline for notice of redemption at the special price,and in allowing actual redemption to occur to days thereafter.chesapeake energy bank of mellon trust,d.the court further ruled that,even if the indenture provisions were deemed ambiguous,the extrinsic evidence convincingly establishes a meeting of the minds among the negotiating parties that these parties intended and agreed that march,would serve as the deadline for chesapeake to give notice of redemption.id.at 
bny mellon appeals,arguing that b authorized redemption at the special price only if accomplished no later than march,with notice given to days before,also during the special early redemption period.
discussion 
we conclude that the terms of unambiguously terminated chesapeake right to redeem the notes at the special price on march.notice of such redemption needed to be given no later than february,the notice given by chesapeake on march,of redemption to occur on may,was,therefore,untimely.

the district court adopted chesapeake argument.it read b special early redemption period as fixing the period during which chesapeake could begin the redemption process by providing notice,and not requiring actual redemption within that period.accordingly,it read the term may redeem,in the first sentence of b to mean may commence the redemption process by giving notice.chesapeake energy,d at.in the court view,this interpretation was required in order to avoid what the court perceived to be an irreconcilable conflict in the indenture terms.id.at.
because the first sentence of b provides that chesapeake may redeem the notes at the special price a t any time from and including november,to and including march,the court interpreted that sentence as guaranteeing chesapeake four full months in which it could effectuate the redemption.however,the second sentence of b incorporating by reference of the base indenture required chesapeake to give to days notice,which notice was required to be given during the same period.the notice obligation provided by the second sentence thus prevented chesapeake from redeeming during the first days of the specified special early redemption period.the effect of the second sentence was,thus,to allow three months during which chesapeake could effectuate the redemption.in the court view this created an irreconcilable conflict.id.the court explained,
under bny mellon reading of b,there is no period for doing anything,including for giving notice or for a redemption.rather,there is,implicitly,a period for a notice of redemption november,through february,and a separate,implicit period for redemption itself on such terms december,through march,
while the court observation that chesapeake did not have four months in which it could redeem was correct,we respectfully disagree that this created an irreconcilable conflict.chesapeake interpretation is flawed in several respects.
the supplemental indenture does not purport to give chesapeake four months in which to accomplish redemption at the special price,or four months in which to give notice of the redemption.nor does the indenture purport to give chesapeake the opportunity to redeem at any time between november,and march.the indenture was simply drafted using a so long as clause,in the nature of a proviso,which limited the scope of a prior provision.
it is true that the first sentence of b of the supplemental indenture,if it were written in isolation,would give chesapeake the right to redeem notes at the special price at any time from and including november,to and including march,defined as the special early redemption period.but that first sentence does not appear in isolation.the immediately following sentence makes clear that chesapeake right of redemption set forth in the first sentence is subjected to a limiting qualification.the second sentence states,chesapeake shall be permitted to exercise its option to redeem the notes pursuant to this section so long as it gives the notice of redemption pursuant to section of the base indenture during the special early redemption period.ja at emphasis added.
reading the first and second sentences together makes clear that chesapeake may exercise this right of early redemption only during the special early redemption period and only after giving the required notice of to days during the special early redemption period.ja at emphasis added.
when a proposition is followed by a clause beginning with so long as,the so long as clause typically serves as a proviso,introducing a condition that narrows the broader initial proposition.see,burrage united states,i f poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases,it is a cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise,so long as,without the incremental effect of the poison,he would have lived.the chicago manual of style ed.whenever a book or article,poem or lecture,database or drama comes into the world,it is automatically covered by copyright so long as it is fixed in some tangible form and embodies original expression.section b so long as clause is not in conflict with the first sentence it is a proviso,which limits the scope of chesapeake right.
the use of such a proviso in a contract can indeed narrow the scope of a contract term,but it does so in a manner dictated by the contractual text.as employed in the supplemental indenture,this common linguistic device was used to set forth the different components of a set of rights and obligations in separate sentences.the contractual text required reading these different sentences in tandem.when read in tandem,these sentences communicated a clearly defined right,contingent on the performance of clearly specified obligations.
if instead of describing the special early redemption process in two consecutive sentences,the indenture had stated in a single sentence,at any time during the special early redemption period from november,to march,chesapeake may redeem the notes at the special price,so long as it gives notice pursuant to section of the base indenture during the special early redemption period,what chesapeake calls an irreconcilable conflict would be equally present,and yet no one could fail to understand that both notice and redemption must occur during the special early redemption period.by spreading those provisions through two successive sentences,the indenture perhaps required more patience on the part of the reader,but it had the same unmistakable meaning.
a further flaw in chesapeake interpretation is that it introduces conflict and contradiction into the contractual text.this interpretation construes the words may redeem in the first sentence of b to mean may commence the redemption process by giving notice.chesapeake energy,d at.it attributes to the word redeem an unnatural meaning,substantially different from its normal meaning.additionally,it causes the word to carry different meanings in different iterations within the same contractual provision,indeed within the same sentence.
redeem in the verb form or redemption in its noun form refers to t he reacquisition of a security by the issuer.black law dictionary ed defining redemption as t he reacquisition of a security by the issuer barron dictionary of finance and investment terms ed defining redemption as repayment of a debt security or preferred stock issue,at or before maturity webster new international dictionary ed defining redeem as t o regain possession of by payment of a stipulated price to repurchase.chesapeake interpretation gives the term a very different meaning not t he reacquisition of a security by the issuer,but the giving of notice by the issuer that it would reacquire the security.
furthermore,chesapeake interpretation causes the term to mean different things in different instances of its appearance.redeem or redemption appears numerous times in,and six times within the affected first sentence of b.for the first and second appearances of the term in that sentence special early redemption period and chesapeake,at its option may redeem the notes chesapeake interpretation changes its meaning so that instead of referring to the act of redemption,it refers to the giving of notice of a future redemption.for this sentence to make sense,however,redeem needs to retain its normal meaning in other appearances within the sentence.unpaid interest to the date of redemption can not reasonably refer to the date of the notice.it necessarily refers to the date on which chesapeake pays the debt represented by the notes or otherwise reacquires them,as interest would continue to accrue so long as any part of the debt remains outstanding.likewise,it is clear that in requiring that million aggregate principal remain outstanding immediately following any redemption,the sentence refers to actual redemption,not the date the redemption is noticed.the word redemption in the phrase notice of redemption,which appears in the second sentence,necessarily refers to the reacquisition of the notes and not the giving of notice.finally,there would be no making sense of the provision requiring that notice be mailed to noteholders a t least days but not more than days before a redemption date,ja at,unless redemption carries its customary meaning.under chesapeake interpretation of the supplemental indenture,the indenture trustee,charged with the fiduciary duty to protect the rights of the noteholders,would be left to guess when the contractual term meant what it said,and when a different,artificial meaning was to be substituted 
the terms of the supplemental indenture had a definite and precise meaning.the contract made perfect sense with the term redeem carrying its normal meaning in each usage.the governing indenture unambiguously provided that,in order to exercise the right to early redemption at the special price,chesapeake was obliged,as the indenture trustee has correctly insisted,to effectuate the redemption within the specified special early redemption period upon notice of to days also given within that period.chesapeake option to make special early redemption at the special price could therefore be exercised only by effectuating redemption no later than march,upon notice given no later than february.the notice chesapeake gave on march,calling for redemption on may,was untimely and ineffective to redeem at the special price 
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for consideration of chesapeake second claim for declaratory judgment that the redemption notice given by chesapeake on march,should not be deemed to have noticed redemption at the make whole price.
both the district court and the majority have it the majority is correct that section b of the supplemental indenture can not be read to unambiguously support chesapeake position,and the district court is correct that it can not be read to unambiguously support bny mellon position.the text is ambiguous,and the case should be remanded to the district court to reevaluate the extrinsic evidence with due regard for the principles of unmanifested subjective intent and course of performance discussed below.in evaluating the extrinsic evidence in the alternative,the district court should have accorded less weight to the negotiations between chesapeake and its underwriter,and more weight to chesapeake statements.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
discussion 
a.the text is ambiguous 
the conflict between the first and second sentences of section b is not susceptible to any single unambiguous resolution.contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning,unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself,and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.revson cinque cinque,cir quoting hunt lifschultz fast freight,cir.ambiguous language is language that is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.id.quoting seiden assocs.anc holdings,cir.ambiguity is a question of law,and thus a district court decision as to whether a contract is ambiguous is reviewed de novo.ja apparel abboud,cir.while ambiguity is not found by counting noses,the simple fact that the judges of the court below and the majority all,it can safely be said,reasonably intelligent person s have arrived at opposite conclusions as to the meaning of the language suggests the presence of ambiguity.
two principles of interpretation push against the majority reading of the text.first,court s should read the integrated contract as a whole to ensure that undue emphasis is not placed upon particular words and phrases,and to safeguard against adopting an interpretation that would render any individual provision superfluous.law debenture trust of maverick tube,cir quoting bailey fish neave,int l multifoods commercial union ins,cir.this principle cautions against a reading of the second sentence of section b of the supplemental indenture as simply excising the november december period from the special early redemption period identified in the first sentence.admittedly,this is not a prototypical application of the canon against surplusage in the majority reading of the text both sentences continue to have meaning,and the special early redemption period continues to have some effect in defining the limits of both notice and redemption.yet insofar as the first sentence of section b says,in part,that chesapeake may redeem the notes between november and december,that portion has become entirely untrue under the majority reading.the complete nullification of this portion distinguishes section b from the examples of provisos offered by the majority,see supra at,where all portions of the sets identified in the first clause can be true under certain circumstances,so long as they meet the requirements of the proviso.here,under the majority reading,it is rendered misleading and unnecessary for the supplemental indenture ever to have identified november to december as part of the period in which chesapeake could redeem the notes.
second,for largely the same reasons just identified,the reading offered by bny mellon and adopted by the majority is structurally incoherent,even if it does follow the precise wording of section b new york courts have repeatedly emphasized that f orm should not prevail over substance and a sensible meaning of words should be sought.kass kass,quoting william atwater pan.as the district court points out,under bny mellon reading the special early redemption period not only ceases to be a redemption period,it ceases to be any meaningful period at all.see chesapeake energy,d at.the period in which the notes can be redeemed would span december,to march,while the period in which notice must be given would span from november,to february,the special early redemption period of november,to march,would cease to have independent meaning.even if this is the result suggested by a literal reading of the text,under new york law it can not be stated that such a bizarre outcome is unambiguously that intended by the parties.
the district court,recognizing the implausible result reached by a strictly literal reading of the text,arrived at an interpretation that restores coherence to the contested clause the phrase may redeem in the first sentence of section b becomes may give notice of redemption,and the special early redemption period becomes a single,period in which chesapeake may give notice of redemption.see chesapeake energy,d at.nevertheless,as found by the majority,the interpretation proffered by the district court is a bridge too far.the district court reading would require the word redeem to take on multiple meanings within the indentures,within section b,and even within the same sentence.while,as the district court notes,unusual constructions of a term can prevail where reasonable interpretation of the contract so requires,id.at,this principle does not extend so far as to allow two distinct constructions of a single term to coexist within the same contractual clause.cas.grace,cir,as amended,terms in a document,especially terms of art,normally have the same meaning throughout the document in the absence of a clear indication that different meanings were intended.
despite very thoughtful efforts by both the majority and the district court,the first and second sentences of section b can not be reconciled.where two contractual clauses conflict,the second circuit has found ambiguity where there is not a compelling reason to favor one over the other.see seiden,at we see two possible of which denigrates the plain meaning of the other in sum,because the interrelationship of the two provisions in the letter agreement is susceptible to several reasonable interpretations,the contract is ambiguous.it can not be definitely and precisely gleaned which reading was intended by the parties.collins harrison bode,cir the impossibility of sensibly reconciling the usage of the term monet throughout the contract with the definition set forth in the release clause leads to our conclusion that the settlement agreement is ambiguous.section b is therefore ambiguous due to the conflict between the two sentences,and the case should be remanded for reconsideration of the extrinsic evidence.see flli moretti cereal
