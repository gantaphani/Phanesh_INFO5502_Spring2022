this is a winstar breach of contract case.see united states winstar,d.the primary question on appeal is whether,under our decision in admiral financial united states,the thrift entities,franklin federal savings bank franklin federal and franklin financial group,franklin financial assumed the risk of regulatory change resulting from the enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea,stat.we refer to franklin federal and franklin financial together as franklin.a subsidiary question is whether there was a contractual or third party beneficiary relationship with the government that would confer standing on the shareholders of the thrift holding company,franklin financial hereinafter the seven shareholders.we conclude that admiral governs,and that the thrift entities assumed the risk of regulatory change.thus we do not reach the subsidiary question of shareholder standing.we accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of federal claims.
background 
morristown federal savings and loan association morristown was a federal mutual savings association,or thrift.franklin fed.sav.bank united states,franklin i.morristown was one of many thrifts that became undercapitalized when the combination of high interest rates and inflation in the late and early brought about a crisis in the thrift industry.winstar,at.by the end of morristown had a negative net worth of million.franklin i.at.
the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic was responsible for insuring thrift deposits and regulating federally insured thrifts.rather than allowing thrifts like morristown to fail,fslic encouraged ailing thrifts and healthy thrifts to merge in a series of supervisory mergers.the thrifts desired to use the purchase method of accounting,under which the newly created thrift could designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all acquired assets as an intangible asset called supervisory goodwill,and claim it as an asset for purposes of computing regulatory capital.the purchase method of accounting permit ted the acquiring entity to designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired as an intangible asset called goodwill goodwill recognized under the purchase method as the result of an supervisory merger was generally referred to as supervisory goodwill.winstar,at.the thrifts were often permitted to amortize this goodwill over an extended period of time.id.at.
under regulations,it was uncertain whether regulators would permit the use of this method for computation of regulatory capital.id.at.i t was not obvious that regulators would accept purchase accounting in determining compliance with regulatory criteria,and it was clearly prudent to get agreement on the matter.to assure that these acquisitions would comply with existing regulatory requirements,fslic often gave the newly created thrift express permission to use the purchase method of accounting and to count the supervisory goodwill toward its reserve capital requirements.id.at.in some cases the government regulatory forbearance was not reflected in a contract with the thrift and did not create government liability for a change in accounting treatment.see,d n bank united states.in others,the special accounting treatment was part of a contract between the thrift and the government.see,winstar,d fifth third bank of ohio united states.in such cases,the contract typically,but not always,imposed liability on the government if it subsequently adopted more restrictive regulations.see winstar,d fifth third,admiral.
in response to morristown financial problems,the federal home loan bank board bank board,which had authority to act on behalf of fslic,recommended by letter in december that morristown board of directors seek to merge with another thrift in a supervisory merger.morristown prepared a business plan in may,under which morristown would be acquired by franklin financial,a holding company formed by morristown board of directors.under the plan,fslic would permit the new thrift to count morristown supervisory goodwill as an intangible asset.on june,morristown submitted this plan with its application for supervisory conversion to the bank board.on november,the bank board formally issued a conditional approval letter to the board of directors of morristown and franklin financial.the approval letter conditioned the bank board approval of the transaction on franklin financial executing an agreement,called the dividend agreement and on the seven shareholders personally guaranteeing the million loan.in a section entitled supervisory forbearances,the approval letter provided that the secretary or an assistant secretary of the board is hereby directed and authorized to issue to the institution a letter concerning supervisory forbearances.at.a forbearance letter,which would become effective upon approval of the transaction,was issued on the same date as the approval letter.
on january,franklin financial and the bank board executed the dividend agreement.the signatories of the dividend agreement were franklin financial and fslic.the premise of the dividend agreement was that the government would take favorable action approving the acquisition.it stated that franklin financial agreement was in consideration of the fslic acting favorably on the application for approval of the transaction.at.the fslic favorable action with respect to the application included the fslic approval of franklin financial request for regulatory forbearance,as reflected in the forbearance letter.in the forbearance letter the bank board allowed franklin federal to treat the supervisory goodwill of morristown as an intangible asset,amortizable over years.
the dividend agreement also included section viii d,which provided that a ll references to regulations shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquiror obligation under this agreement.the key question on appeal is whether the successor regulation language in section viii d placed the risk of regulatory change on franklin.
the dividend agreement also prohibited franklin financial from accepting from franklin federal any dividend that would cause franklin federal regulatory capital to fall below the regulatory capital trigger,and provided that if franklin federal capital fell below the trigger for more than days,it would be subject to immediate seizure.the dividend agreement had an integration clause that stated that t his agreement,together with any understanding agreed to in writing by the parties,constitutes the entire agreement between the parties at.
the seven shareholders were not parties to the dividend agreement but were parties to two separate agreements with the bank board relating to the supervisory transaction.first,the shareholders and the bank board signed a shareholder agreement to service holding company debt,which obligated the shareholders to service the million debt in the event dividends paid from franklin federal to franklin financial,were insufficient.second,the shareholders,franklin financial and the bank board signed a capital infusion agreement,requiring the shareholders to provide additional capital if franklin capital fell below regulatory requirements within days after the conversion.
pursuant to the plan,on january,morristown converted from a mutual association to a stock company,changed its name to franklin federal,and issued million of common stock to franklin financial.in exchange for the stock,federal received a million cash infusion from franklin financial.to finance the purchase of franklin federal stock,franklin financial issued stock to its shareholders the seven shareholders for a total price of in cash.franklin financial borrowed the remaining million from a local commercial bank.this loan was secured personally by the seven shareholders,who planned to service the debt using dividends paid from franklin federal to franklin financial,and then from franklin financial to the seven shareholders.according to an independent auditor report issued on march,after the transaction franklin federal goodwill totaled.
eight months after the acquisition and the execution of the dividend agreement,congress enacted firrea,which limited the ability of thrift institutions to count supervisory goodwill towards their regulatory capital requirements winstar,at.under these new capital standards,franklin federal regulatory capital fell below the minimum capital requirement,and it became an insolvent thrift,subject to immediate seizure.because the dividend agreement prevented franklin federal from issuing dividends when its regulatory capital fell below minimum requirements,the seven shareholders allege that they were forced to service franklin financial million debt from their personal assets.in order to meet the new capital standards,franklin financial raised money through stock offerings to new shareholders.these offerings to outsiders diminished the seven shareholders ownership in franklin financial from to.franklin i.at.as a consequence,when the seven shareholders later exchanged their stock in franklin financial for stock of another company in a merger,they claimed that they received less than of the value of franklin financial.
in,franklin federal,franklin financial,and the seven shareholders filed suit in the court of federal claims,alleging that the passage of firrea resulted in the breach by the government of a contract incorporating a forbearance letter,which promis ed that franklin federal savings bank could treat supervisory goodwill as an asset,amortizable over years,for the purposes of satisfying regulatory capital requirements.franklin i.at.pertinent to this appeal,the government argued,first,that there was no contractual agreement with respect to goodwill and that the bank board lacked authority to enter into a binding goodwill contract as part of an unassisted acquisition,an acquisition that did not involve financial assistance from the government.id.at.second,the government argued that,even if there was a contract,it was not breached by the enactment of firrea because section viii d of the dividend agreement assigned the risk of regulatory change to the thrift entities.id.at.third,the government argued that the seven shareholders lacked standing because they were not direct parties to any of the core contractual documents and were not third party beneficiaries.
on summary judgment,the court of federal claims rejected the government argument that there was no contractual agreement and that the bank board officials lacked authority to enter into a goodwill contract in connection with an unassisted acquisition.it found that the dividend agreement was a binding contract,and,contrary to the government arguments,that the dividend agreement integration clause,section viii k,incorporated the forbearance letter and approval letter into that contract.franklin i.at.the court rejected the government argument that the dividend agreement assigned the risk of regulatory change to the thrift entities,finding that the specific language in the forbearance letter takes precedence over the more general successor regulation provision.of the dividend agreement.id.at.in the court view,the successor regulation language in section viii d permitted the government to change the level of regulatory capital,but not the method by which it was calculated.id.at.it found that the contract had been breached by the enactment of firrea,because firrea altered the method of calculation of regulatory capital.id.the court of federal claims decision was rendered before our recent decision in admiral financial united states,in which we held that a provision identical to section viii d assigned the risk of regulatory change to the thrift.
the court of federal claims found that the seven shareholders had standing to sue the government because they were parties to the goodwill contract.franklin i.at.although the seven shareholders were not signatories of the dividend agreement and were not recipients of the forbearance letter,they were nonetheless parties to the goodwill contract because the core documents imposed duties on them.in particular,the approval letter conditioned approval of the merger on the seven shareholders personally guaranteeing franklin financial million debt.hence,the government was liable not only to franklin federal and franklin financial but also to the individual shareholders.id.
following its liability decision,the trial court issued two opinions with respect to damages,the first on summary judgment before trial and the second after trial.franklin fed.sav.bank united states.franklin ii franklin fed.sav.bank united states.franklin iii.final judgment was entered on april,and awarded damages of to franklin financial,to franklin federal,and to the seven shareholders.franklin iii.at.
the government appeals,challenging the court of federal claims liability and standing determinations.the plaintiffs certain aspects of the trial court damages determinations.
discussion 
in order to prevail in a winstar case a plaintiff with standing must establish that a contract existed with the government whereby the government was contractually bound to recognize the supervisory goodwill and particular amortization periods.winstar united states,aff,d.on appeal,the government is prepared to assume that a contract existed,and argues that,if there was a contract,it placed the risk of regulatory change on the thrift entities rather than the government.despite the government concession,we must nonetheless determine the nature of the contract before determining its effect.
the mere issuance of the approval letter and the forbearance letter by the government did not,of course,create a contract between franklin and the government.in d n bank,the plaintiff similarly relied on a bank board resolution conditioning approval of the merger on submission of an analysis of the effect of the special accounting method.at.we rejected the argument that such regulatory approval created a contract.id.at see also first commerce united states,refusing to find a contract based on regulatory approval alone anderson united states,same.more recently we recognized that mere approval of a merger by fhlbb,acting solely in its regulatory capacity,does not create contractual obligations fifth third,at.
here it is particularly plain that the regulatory approvals did not themselves constitute a contract.throughout the period of negotiation it was clear that the parties contemplated that there would not be agreement absent the dividend agreement.the approval letter specifically was conditioned on execution of the dividend agreement.nor did the integration clause of the dividend agreement incorporate the regulatory approvals.the integration clause of the dividend agreement itself provided that the dividend agreement would supersede all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof save any understanding in writing by the parties.the approval letter and forbearance letter were not written agreements signed by the parties,and were not characterized as such in the dividend agreement they were not agreements in and of themselves but merely regulatory approvals that could only become enforceable by the mechanism of the dividend agreement.whatever oral agreements that might have been reached were expressly superseded by the dividend agreement.thus,while the dividend agreement created a contract between franklin and the government,contrary to the decision of the court of federal claims,the integration clause of the dividend agreement did not incorporate the approval and forbearance letters into the dividend agreement.
nonetheless we agree that the dividend agreement created a goodwill contract that obligated the government to comply with the forbearance letter authorization to amortize the value of any unidentifiable intangible assets resulting from accounting for the acquisition in accordance with the purchase method over a period not to exceed years by the straight line method for purposes of reporting to the board.at.there was a contract here between the government and franklin with respect to goodwill because the government in the dividend agreement clearly promised to issue the approval letter and forbearance letter and indeed had already done so conditionally in exchange for franklin undertakings in the dividend agreement.the dividend agreement identified itself as a contract made under and governed by federal law,stated that the acquiror was willing to enter into the agreement in order that the fslic would act favorably upon the application for approval of the acquisition,and provided that franklin financial agreement to maintain franklin federal regulatory capital was in consideration of the fslic acting favorably on the application for approval.at.
in the language of basic contract law,the dividend agreement reflected a exchange between the government and franklin financial.restatement second contracts except as stated in subsection,the formation of a contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.see also id.at a bargain is an agreement to exchange promises or to exchange a promise for a performance or to exchange performances.franklin financial promised to maintain the regulatory capital of franklin federal.in return,the government promised to act favorably upon franklin application.at.favorable action required the government to permit the acquisition to occur,and pursuant to the forbearance letter,to waive regulatory requirements.
we therefore conclude that the dividend agreement created a binding agreement with respect to the regulatory treatment of goodwill.
we turn then to the central that contract placed the risk of regulatory change on the government.
the supreme court addressed this question in winstar itself.in winstar,a primary focus of the various supreme court opinions was on the unmistakability is,whether the contracts should be presumed to promise only temporary forbearance until regulatory change occurred or forbearance.the plurality held that the unmistakability doctrine did not apply in actions seeking to recover monetary damages for breach of contract,and that there thus was no presumption that the contracts promised temporary forbearance only.winstar,at.the particular contracts were construed as promising forbearance.id.at.but,as we shall see,the plurality agreed that clear language in such contracts could limit the promise to temporary forbearance and shift the risk of regulatory change to the thrift.justice scalia concurrence urged that the unmistakability doctrine applied to such contracts,but that the agreements did not shift the risk of regulatory change to the thrifts.id.at.justice scalia indeed believed that a promise for temporary forbearance was illusory,and would render the contracts unenforceable.id.at.the dissent urged that the unmistakability doctrine applied and that the contracts should be construed as promising only temporary forbearance even without the clear language demanded by the plurality.id.at.
franklin urges that we treat justice scalia opinion as binding and hold that a contract for temporary regulatory forbearance is illusory.see pls.br.at quoting winstar,at.in our view justice scalia position,far from representing the majority view,itself is a minority view on this particular issue.
the plurality and the dissent agreed that the parties could have contracted only for temporary forbearance,but disagreed as to whether a clear statement was necessary.because the plurality required a clear statement to legitimate a temporary forbearance,its view is narrower than the dissent,which found binding temporary forbearance without the need for a clear statement.we must treat the narrower view as the holding of the court.see commonwealth edison united states,en banc marks united states,d.
the winstar plurality pointed to guaranty financial services,ryan,cir,as an example of a case in which the presumption in favor of forbearance was rebutted.winstar,at.there,guaranty financial services,and fslic entered into a written agreement entitled regulatory capital agreement,which incorporated by reference a forbearance letter.guaranty,at.the dividend agreement contained a risk shifting provision,section vi d,which stated 
all references to regulations of the board or the fslic used in this agreement shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquiror obligation under this agreement.
id.at.the eleventh circuit held that section vi d of the dividend agreement gave guaranty the right to treat supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital only for so long as statutes and regulations governing the area remained as they were when the agreement was signed.id.the court held that this provision unmistakably warn ed guaranty that its obligations under the contract may be increased by subsequent regulation.id.
consistent with and citing the winstar plurality view,we held in admiral that the same contract language that was at issue in guaranty placed the risk of regulatory change on the thrift.admiral,at.admiral is factually identical to guaranty.in,admiral financial corporation acquired a failing thrift,haven federal savings and loan,pursuant to a bank board resolution.admiral and the bank board executed a dividend agreement that bound admiral to maintain a certain level of capital in haven,and subjected admiral to default if haven capital level fell below the trigger for more than days.id.at.in connection with approval of the transaction,the bank board sent a forbearance letter permitting admiral to amortize goodwill over a year period.the dividend agreement in admiral contained a risk shifting provision identical to the dividend agreement here.id.
in admiral,we held that the dividend agreement clause placed the risk of regulatory change on the thrift.in other words,the provision in admiral,like section vi d in guaranty,overcame the presumption that the promises contained in the forbearance letter were absolute.in admiral,we explicitly rejected the court of federal claims interpretation of the relevant language that appeared both in the dividend agreement in admiral and that appears in the dividend agreement here.we found that the provision did not limit those changes to increasing or decreasing the level of capital that thrifts must maintain,as opposed to changing the accounting methods the bank board requires.admiral,at emphasis added.
in our later decision in hometown financial united states,we distinguished admiral and found that a dividend agreement did not shift the risk of regulatory change to the thrift.hometown,at.although the agreement in hometown contained a risk shifting provision identical to the dividend agreement in admiral,the hometown agreement contained additional language that specifically identified how the forbearances should be treated.id.at relying on this additional language,the court found that the plaintiffs did not assume the risk of regulatory change.the dividend agreement here lacks the additional language that distinguished hometown from admiral.
in fact,both parties here agree the contract language in admiral is identical in all material respects to the language of the contract before us.article viii d of the franklin dividend agreement provided 
all references to regulations of the board or the fslic used in this agreement shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquiror obligation under this agreement.
the clause in the admiral dividend agreement,article vi d,was identical.similarly,the language in the forbearance letters in the two cases was identical in all material respects.the may,letter in admiral provided,in pertinent part 
for purposes of reporting to the board,the value of any intangible assets resulting from the application of accounting in accounting for the purchase,may be amortized by haven for a period not to exceed years by the method.
admiral fin.united states.the forbearance letter to federal provided 
for purposes of reporting to the board,the value of any unidentifiable intangible assets resulting from accounting for the acquisition in accordance with the purchase method may be amortized by franklin federal savings bank over a period not to exceed years by the straight line method.
given the virtual identity in language,admiral would appear to govern.however,franklin urges that we need not follow admiral here.we conclude that the arguments for declining to follow admiral are not persuasive.
first,franklin argues that admiral is inconsistent with our en banc decision in winstar united states.in winstar,we rejected the government argument that the regulatory maintenance agreement in that case shifted the risk of regulatory change to the thrift.approval of the winstar merger was conditioned on winstar filing a net worth maintenance stipulation,which required winstar to maintain its net worth at a level consistent with that required by insurance regulations,as now or hereafter in effect see winstar,d at.the government argued that this agreement required winstar to abide by any changes in the law regarding regulatory capital.winstar,at.the court agreed that winstar was obligated to maintain its capital at levels set by the bank regulators,but found that this agreement did not eclipse the government promise that winstar could count supervisory goodwill towards maintaining whatever capital level the regulators set.id.in other words,the agreement required the to future regulatory did not shift the risk of regulatory change to winstar.admiral was different.section vi d of the admiral dividend agreement made it expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquiror obligation under this agreement.admiral,at.we held that this quite different language was sufficient to shift the risk of regulatory change.hence,admiral was entirely consistent with our en banc decision in winstar.
second,franklin,relying on justice scalia winstar concurrence,argues that the contract here must be construed not to place the risk of regulatory change on the thrift entities,because construing the contract to place the risk on the thrift entities would render the contract illusory.franklin asserts that no similar problem existed in admiral because there there was consideration not present in this case.franklin reliance on the winstar concurrence is misplaced,because as noted above,the plurality and the dissent rejected this view.under winstar,a promise for a regulatory waiver until regulatory change occurs is plainly sufficient consideration.further,both here and in admiral there is other government agreement to approve of the transaction.here as in admiral the agreements are not illusory.
finally,franklin argues that the admiral court did not consider the effect of additional language in the forbearance letter that appeared after the goodwill forbearance.the forbearance letter stated that it shall not be construed to constitute forbearance with respect to any regulatory or other requirements other than those specified in the forbearance letter at.franklin contends that the regulatory or other requirements that were waived should be construed to refer to both current and future regulatory requirements.franklin achieves this result by treating the forbearance letter as part of the dividend agreement,and subject to its definitions,and by relying on the dividend agreement statement that all references to regulations in this agreement shall include any successor regulations thereto at emphasis added.franklin thus argues that because the dividend agreement says regulations includes successor regulations,we must interpret regulatory requirements in the forbearance letter to include the future regulatory requirements.
the gist of franklin argument here is that admiral overlooked an argument that would have disposed of the issue of liability in favor of the thrift.franklin thus candidly asserts that admiral was wrongly decided and that we should reconsider it.
we are skeptical that admiral can or should be disregarded simply because it failed to discuss franklin new argument.in any event,we conclude that franklin new argument,apparently raised for the first time on appeal,is without merit.as we have discussed above,the dividend agreement and forbearance letter were not part of a single integrated document.while we construe the two together to ascertain the intent of the parties,there is no basis for assuming,as franklin asks us to do,that the precise definitions of the dividend agreement are applicable to the forbearance letter to treat the dividend agreement definition of the word regulation as applicable to the forbearance letter different terminology regulatory requirement is unwarranted,particularly since this would create a conflict between the two documents.this is not a situation,as in hometown,where additional language in the dividend agreement itself clearly contradicted section viii d.absent such a clear conflict within the dividend agreement itself,section viii d must govern.admiral held that language placed the risk of regulatory change on the thrift.
we conclude that here as in admiral the successor regulations clause of the dividend agreement placed the risk of regulatory change on the thrift entities.
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,we conclude that the dividend agreement shifted the risk of regulatory change to the thrift entities,and franklin can not recover for damages resulting from the changes in regulatory capital requirements wrought by the enactment of firrea.because we decide that franklin may not recover on the contract,we need not reach the issue of shareholder standing to enforce the alleged promise.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of federal claims.
the court today goes too far in its reliance on admiral financial united states,it relies on silence for authority and fails to consider the importance of the integration clause in this case,which was not present in admiral.because the contract between the government and franklin did not shift the risk of regulatory changes to franklin,and because admiral does not compel otherwise,i respectfully dissent.
in admiral,although not necessary for its affirmance of the united states court of federal claims,the court entertained the government alternative ground for affirmance,that article vi d of the contract between admiral and the government the successor regulations clause shifted the risk of future regulatory changes to admiral.admiral,at.admiral does not discuss the forbearance letter,or any integration clause in the dividend agreement that might have incorporated language from the forbearance letter into the dividend agreement.in fact,admiral is silent on the very issue for which the court today finds it dispositive,whether language in the forbearance letter issued to franklin was sufficient,by virtue of an integration clause in the dividend agreement,to prevent the successor regulations clause from shifting the risk of regulatory changes to franklin.the court summarizes franklin argument the gist of franklin argument here is that admiral overlooked an argument that would have disposed of the issue of liability in favor of the thrift.franklin thus candidly asserts that admiral was wrongly decided to the contrary,a different decision on the issue in admiral would not have affected the outcome of that case.in admiral the court of federal claims found that the government breached its agreement with admiral,but that admiral sustained no damages.id.this court affirmed,agreeing that admiral had sustained no damages,but further holding that the successor regulations clause of the dividend agreement shifted the risk of future regulatory changes to admiral.id.at.the court today places too much emphasis on admiral silence.
an opinion of this court is precedent only for those issues it discusses.see,cable television,am.cinema editors,when an issue is not argued or is ignored in a decision,such decision is not precedent to be followed in a subsequent case in which the issue arises.citing webste
