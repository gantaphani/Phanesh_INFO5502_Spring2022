this appeal requires us to interpret a gloss that the indiana courts have placed on their state statute of frauds an oral agreement that the statute of frauds would otherwise render unenforceable creates a binding contract if failing to enforce the agreement would produce an unjust and unconscionable injury and loss,brown branch.the issue arises from the plaintiffs supplemental claims,which are based on indiana law.the federal claim on which the district court jurisdiction was originally based,a claim based on the equal credit opportunity act,et,was resolved in the plaintiffs favor but gave them only modest relief.the appeal challenges the court dismissal under rule b of the supplemental claims.
classic cheesecake,a bakery company,managed to interest several hotels and casinos in las vegas in buying its products.to serve these new customers classic needed additional to establish a distribution center in las vegas,to hire employees to staff it,and to buy additional equipment.on july,principals of classic visited a local office of the defendant bank and made a pitch to a vice president named dowling for a loan that would be partially guaranteed by the small business administration and therefore would have to be approved by that agency.they emphasized to dowling that time was of the essence.
dowling asked them for tax returns,accounts receivable,and other documentation in support of the loan application,and having received the documents she orally assured classic principals according to classic that the loan would be approved,provided that student loans of one of the principals were paid condition on which the small business administration insisted because the loans had been financed in part by the federal government and were in default.on september dowling told classic that the loan was a go,and three days later one of classic principals asked dowling to request that letters from the student loan agencies confirming that the loans had been repaid be sent directly to dowling to speed up the confirmation process.so classic knew that dowling saying the loan was a go did not mean that the loan had been approved.but it seemed likely that it would be.
yet in an email to dowling on august,dowling superior at the bank had told her i am still declining this request classic request for a loan primarily based on the following and he mentioned excessive leverage,lack of an established earnings record,inadequate cash flow,undercapitalization,insufficient revenues,too much reliance on projections,and serious delinquencies and derogatory public record of guarantor referring to the principal who had defaulted on her student loans.he added that he had discussed the matter with the sba and the same as identified above prevailed.
although the email was a downer,it did not flatly turn down the loan request,and dowling must have expected that it would be approved,perhaps with modifications,what had she to gain from stringing classic along if she knew the loan would never be approved but she may have exaggerated her confidence in the loan eventual approval to prevent classic from shopping elsewhere,though the plaintiffs do not allege that.
not only did dowling not share the contents of the discouraging email with classic,but she continued to make verbal assurances that the loan would be approved.the plaintiffs must have been shocked when on october she told them that the loan had been turned down.as reasons she gave the concerns that her superior had expressed in the august email.classic claims that it and the other plaintiffs the company principals plus an affiliate lost more than million because of the bank breach of what classic deems an oral promise to make the loan.it claims that the breach delayed it from seeking loans elsewhere for a critical two and a half months and that as a result of the delay it and the other plaintiffs incurred in the aggregate a loss of more than million.we assume the loss consisted entirely of costs incurred in reliance on the loan being approved,although some of it undoubtedly consisted of consequential damages that could not be recovered in a suit for breach of contract consistently with the doctrine of hadley baxendale,exch,eng.that is true of the tax penalties that the plaintiffs had to pay because the loss allegedly due to the delay in obtaining a loan drained them of the cash they needed to pay their taxes,and it is even truer of the emotional distress they claim to have suffered as a result of the delay and ensuing financial loss.
the indiana statute of frauds requires that agreements to lend money be in writing.the oral agreement alleged by classic contained a promise by the bank on which classic relied whether reasonably is another question.but to allow the statute of frauds to be circumvented by basing a suit to enforce an oral promise on promissory estoppel rather than breach of contract would be a facile mode of avoidance indeed.someone who wanted to enforce an oral promise otherwise made unenforceable by the statute of frauds would need only to incur modest costs in purported reliance on the easy,if risky,to do,as a premise for seeking to enforce an oral promise that may not have been made or may have been misunderstood.
the plaintiffs also charge that dowling assurance that the loan was a go when she knew it had been at least tentatively rejected was fraudulent,and therefore tortious.courts resist efforts by a plaintiff to get around limitations imposed by contract law by recasting a breach as a tort a recent example is extra equipamentos e exportação ltda.case,cir.with specific reference to efforts to get around the statute of frauds,the indiana court of appeals has explained that the substance of an action,rather than its form,controls whether a particular statute has application in a particular lawsuit regardless of whether the present cause of action is labeled as a breach of contract,misrepresentation,fraud,deceit,or promissory estoppel,its substance is that of an action upon an agreement by a bank to loan money.therefore,the statute of frauds applies.ohio valley plastics,national city bank.so the plaintiffs are remitted to their remedies under the law of contracts,as they seem to concede,for their briefs do not argue that fraud is an independent ground for negating a defense based on the statute of frauds.
and so the question becomes whether the bank conduct could have been found to inflict an unjust and unconscionable injury and loss and so trump the bank defense based on the statute of frauds.to answer the question requires us to explore the provenance of a phrase at once vague what does unjust and unconscionable mean and redundant how does injury differ from loss.
the statute of frauds has long been controversial.the farnsworth treatise says that it has been the subject of constant erosion.allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,ed.the particular erosive process that culminates in the doctrine of unjust and unconscionable injury and loss else in an opinion by justice traynor,monarco lo greco,cal d,that allowed the statute of frauds to be circumvented by a claim of promissory estoppel.even before then,the statute of frauds could be circumvented by equitable estoppel,but that required a misrepresentation concerning the statute of frauds itself,as where one party assured the other that no writing was necessary,or promised not to plead the statute of frauds in the event of a lawsuit.farnsworth,supra.importantly,however,justice traynor limited the use of promissory estoppel to defeat the statute of frauds only if either an unconscionable injury or unjust enrichment would result from refusal to enforce an oral promise would a defense based on the statute of frauds be negated.at.
the monarco opinion,like so many of justice traynor innovations,caught on.farnsworth,supra.eventually it was picked the restatement second of contracts,which in section allows promissory estoppel to defeat the statute of frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the oral promise.this notably loose formulation has been influential too,farnsworth,supra,not in indiana.indiana courts have declined to embrace of the restatement,but have recognized the possibility of relief for injustice in limited circumstances,while defining it much more narrowly than in.babyback int l.
indiana formula is as follows 
in order to establish an estoppel to remove the case from the operation of the statute of frauds,the party must show that the other party refusal to carry out the terms of the agreement has resulted not merely in a denial of the rights which the agreement was intended to confer,but the infliction of an unjust and unconscionable injury and loss.
in other words,neither the benefit of the bargain itself,nor mere inconvenience,incidental expenses,short of a reliance injury so substantial and independent as to constitute an unjust and unconscionable injury and loss are sufficient to remove the claim from the operation of the statute of frauds.
quoting brown branch,supra,at,which in turn was quoting whiteco industries,kopani.
the formula itself unjust and unconscionable injury and loss does not tell us much,and it has not been further elaborated by the indiana courts.comparison with justice traynor formula either an unconscionable injury or unjust enrichment deepens the mystery.the traynor formula suggests two grounds for getting around the statute of frauds unjust gain to the promisor or unconscionable injury to the promisee.the former seems the solider ground but is omitted in the indiana formulation unless the unjust in unjust injury should be understood as shorthand for unjust that would imply,contrary to the second paragraph of the formulation in babyback,that the rule is inapplicable if there is no gain to the party pleading the statute of frauds.in both formulas,the word unconscionable is confusing rather than clarifying,since if it is meant to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability it would duplicate unjust enrichment in the traynor formula and contradict the second paragraph in the indiana formula.
we can at least set aside any issue of unjust enrichment in this case.the bank made no money in its dealings with classic and gained no other advantage all it gained was this lawsuit against it.and anyway,to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability classic would have to show that it had been taken advantage of because of its obvious ignorance or desperate circumstances,weaver american oil,and there is nothing like that here.the bank was not trying to drive a hard bargain with insisted on no unreasonable terms.and though a small business,classic is not a hapless consumer,poor tenant,or mom and pop grocery store.it wanted a bank loan not to stave off disaster but to finance an expansion of its business to take advantage of an exciting business opportunity.insistence on the repayment of the student loans that one of its principals had defaulted on yet was capable of repaying,as events showed was hardly unconscionable and anyway came from the small business administration rather than from the bank.all else aside,the doctrine of unconscionability is a defense to the enforcement of a contract,see,and the bank is not trying to enforce a contract it denies there was a contract.
we can get some help from the case law.in monarco,the fons et origo of the doctrine that the indiana courts call unjust and unconscionable injury and loss,there was both a big loss and unjust enrichment.when the plaintiff reached and wanted to leave home and make his own way in the world,his mother and stepfather promised him that if he stayed and worked on the family farm they would leave almost all their property which was in joint tenancy to him.he stayed,and worked hard,receiving in exchange only room and board and spending money.the farm prospered.but when the stepfather died years later,he left his half interest in the farm to his own grandson.at.the element of unjust enrichment lay in the fact that the plaintiff had worked the farm for slight compensation for years giving up among other things the opportunity to obtain an education beyond high school in the expectation that he would be well compensated when either his mother or his stepfather died.the farm had done well,in part no doubt because of the plaintiff undercompensated sweat equity.so the grandson was indeed unjustly enriched.the plaintiff having the rug pulled out from under him after working for years for slight remuneration faintly echoed laban fraud on his jacob.after promising the hand of his younger daughter,rachel,to jacob in marriage in return for seven years service to him,laban tricked work had enriched marrying laban elder daughter,leah,instead.jacob was compelled to serve laban for another seven years in order to be permitted to marry rachel.as in monarco,there was both unjust enrichment of the oral promisor and heavy loss to the more years of unpaid labor.
only two cases one a federal district court diversity case governed by indiana law have allowed a claim based on the indiana formula to survive a motion for summary judgment,though in neither case did the plaintiff ultimately prevail.in three other hardin,tincher greencastle federal savings bank,and tipton county farm bureau cooperative ass hoover,indiana courts allowed a statute of frauds defense to be overcome by simple,unadorned promissory estoppel,but the indiana supreme court disapproved those decisions in babyback.at.
in the diversity case,madison tool die,zf sachs automotive of america,wl,the defendant orally agreed to make the plaintiff its auto parts supplier.to induce the plaintiff to retool its facilities so that it could supply the parts,the defendant announced that it was not working with any other suppliers and would therefore need the plaintiff to begin production within days.so the plaintiff went out and bought a special machine for to produce the parts for the defendant.the plaintiff made test parts for the defendant with the new machine,but rather than ordering any parts the defendant assured the plaintiff for three years that it would begin ordering parts soon.yet it never did,and at the end of the period declared that it would not be using the plaintiff as a supplier after all.
in the other case,keating burton,the defendant orally agreed to hire the plaintiff as a employee with an option to purchase percent of the defendant company after three years of employment.in reliance on the agreement the plaintiff went to work for the defendant and claimed to have shut down his own company,which had been growing.the court eventually found that the plaintiff had not abandoned his business entirely.but for purposes of getting a fix on indiana law,all that matters is the evidence that was before the court when it decided not to grant summary judgment to the defendant.after the plaintiff had been working for the defendant company for a year and a half,the defendant so limited the plaintiff responsibilities that he quit.
these cases are not as dramatic as monarco or genesis and do not involve so far as appears substantial gain to the oral promisor.but there is a family resemblance,which helps us to understand the scope and operation of the indiana formula as elaborated in the second paragraph of the indented quotation from babyback and as paraphrased in spring hill developers,arthur,as follows the injury must be not only independent from the benefit of the bargain and resulting incidental expenses and inconvenience,but also so substantial as to constitute an unjust and unconscionable injury.the benefit of the bargain would be what the promisee hoped to gain from the promise,which in madison would have been the profit from selling auto parts to the defendant and in keating the percent share of the defendant company.the plaintiffs lost those expectancies of course,but they suffered other losses as cost of the machine in madison that the plaintiff would not have bought had it not been for the oral promise and in keating the plaintiff alleged loss of his company.and those losses were significant in relation to the plaintiffs net worth,satisfying the second part of the indiana formula.
but what these cases really show is the slipperiness of the indiana formula,as of the monarco formula as well.the benefit of the bargain is for the expected profit from performing
