the parties do not dispute that provident complied with the relevant provisions of the in accepting the and setting off the to credit the debt owed to provident by morningstar.regions argues that the p rovisions of article deal with allocation of risk and responsibility with regards to claims based on mistake and error and that n othing in article suggests that the drafters intended it to insulate a wrongdoer from liability in connection with funds transfers that were effectuated as intended.provident asserts that the text of article and the official commentary do not suggest that article is limited to claims based on mistake and errors.
article is silent with regard to claims based on the theory that the beneficiary bank accepted funds when it knew or should have known that the funds were fraudulently obtained.therefore,a provision of state law that requires a receiving or beneficiary bank to disgorge funds that it knew or should have known were obtained illegally when it accepted a wire transfer is not inconsistent with the goals or provisions of article.the supports this conclusion.article defines good faith as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.the also provides that e very contract or duty within the imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.id.furthermore,we are mindful that the supreme court has repeatedly held that i f possible,a court should avoid construing a statute in a way that produces absurd results.dewsnup timm,d.see also united states granderson,d refusing to apply a plain meaning interpretation of a sentencing proviso when such an interpretation leads to an absurd result.interpreting article in a manner that would allow a beneficiary bank to accept funds when it knows or should know that they were fraudulently obtained,would allow banks to use article as a shield for fraudulent activity.it could hardly have been the intent of the drafters to enable a party to succeed in engaging in fraudulent activity,so long as it complied with the provisions of article.
regions argues that it presented sufficient facts to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of fact in dispute regarding whether provident knew or should have known that the funds it received by morningstar were obtained by fraud.regions bases its state law claims on the fundamental principle of property law that no one can obtain title to stolen property,however
