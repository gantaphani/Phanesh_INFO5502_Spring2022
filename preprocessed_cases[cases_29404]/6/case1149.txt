this special motion to strike procedure implements subdivision b of the statute which states a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
when section was originally proposed,the attorney general expressed concern that it might impair the ability of state and local agencies to enforce certain consumer protection laws.city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment th,city of long beach.thereafter,the governor vetoed versions of the bill that failed to address this concern.see people health laboratories of north america,th,health labs.eventually,a provision was added to the proposed statute which recognized a prosecutorial exemption for enforcement actions to protect the consumer the public.with the addition of this express exemption,the statute was enacted in.ibid.this exemption is set forth in subdivision d,which states that section shall not apply to any enforcement action brought by a public prosecutor.
as originally enacted in,section contained no provision for an immediate appeal of orders made pursuant to that section.citation.orders made pursuant to section could be reviewed only as an appeal after judgment citations or by petition for an extraordinary writ in the legislature added former section,subdivision j,providing an appeal may be taken directly from an order granting or denying a special motion to strike under section.doe luster th,doe.the legislature found it necessary to enact former subdivision j because,without the ability to appeal,a slapp defendant will have to incur the cost of a lawsuit before having his or her right to free speech vindicated.citation.varian,supra,cal th at.this direct appeal provision is now set forth in subdivision i,which states that orders granting or denying a special motion to strike shall be appealable under section.and it is subdivision i on which defendants base their appeal 
the parties contentions 
the people contend that this appeal must be dismissed because the express language of subdivision d exempts this action from the direct appeal procedure set forth in subdivision i.according to the people,the phrase this section shall not apply in subdivision d means what it says that all of section,including subdivision i,does not apply to a prosecutor enforcement action.the people also contend that the legislature never intended for subdivision d findings to be subject to immediate appellate review.
defendants contend the trial court subdivision d order is made appealable by subdivision i.they argue that there is nothing unclear or ambiguous about subdivision i statutory language which explicitly authorizes their appeal from the order denying their special motion to strike.defendants also argue that the history of the statute reflects a legislative intent to create a right to immediately appeal any order granting or denying a special motion to strike.
discussion 
although each party invokes a different provision of the statute,their respective interpretations are mutually exclusive.to resolve this conflict,we apply settled rules of statutory construction.
when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.citations.the supreme court has emphasized that the words in a statute selected by the legislature must be given a commonsense meaning when it noted our first step in determining the legislature intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.citation.citation.further,our supreme court has noted,if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute citations.goldstein ralphs grocery th.
because this case requires us to interpret language from two subdivisions of the statute,we are particularly guided by the rule requiring us to consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.curle superior court cal th.
applying these rules leads to several conclusions.
first,subdivision b is the linchpin of the statute it authorizes the motion to strike procedure established by the legislature in order to protect acts in furtherance of the constitutional rights to free speech and petition.
second,subdivision d completely exempts public enforcement actions from the subdivision b motion to strike procedure.thus,for example,a subdivision d order does not require any judicial assessment of the nature of the defendant conduct or substantive evaluation of the merits of the plaintiff lawsuit.rather,as stated by our colleagues in division five,the remedy is unavailable to a defendant in an action brought by a public prosecutor.health labs,supra,th at.
third,the direct appeal right created by subdivision i unequivocally applies to an order granting or denying a special motion to strike pursuant to the procedures promulgated to implement subdivision b.
