providence hall associates pha appeals the district court dismissal of its lawsuit against wells fargo bank.pha contends that the district court erroneously gave res judicata effect to various sale orders issued during pha chapter bankruptcy.we conclude that the elements of res judicata are satisfied and therefore affirm.
pha is a limited partnership that,prior to its bankruptcy,owned a handful of properties in several states.it entered three transactions with wells fargo a million loan,a line of credit,and an agreement,whereby pha exchanged a fixed interest rate for a floating one based on the dollar london interbank offered rate libor.the loan and the line of credit contained a a default on either amounted to a default on were secured by deeds of trust,mortgages,and assignments of rent for certain pha real estate holdings.
pha subsequently defaulted on the loans and,as a result,filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy in march.shortly thereafter,wells fargo informed pha that an event of default took place under the agreement,triggering in termination damages.
wells fargo filed a proof of claim in the chapter case for nearly million.pha objected,filing an adversary complaint,which it later amended.in that amended complaint,pha alleged that wells fargo falsely represented that it would forbear collection of the principal balance of the line of credit,ultimately causing pha to default and enter bankruptcy.
meanwhile,the united states trustee had moved to convert the bankruptcy case to a chapter proceeding or dismiss it altogether based on pha failure to file monthly financial reports.wells fargo filed a memorandum in support of the motion,repeating the united states trustee allegations and contending that,among other inappropriate actions,pha principals used wells fargo cash collateral to pay distributions to themselves.after reviewing the arguments of the united states trustee and wells fargo,the bankruptcy court opted to appoint marc albert as a chapter trustee rather than dismiss the bankruptcy case or convert it into a chapter proceeding.
trustee albert took a number of steps to bring pha out of important here,obtaining court approval to sell two of the bankruptcy estate properties to satisfy the debts owed to wells fargo.in both of his sale motions under b,f,trustee albert requested that the proceeds minus certain expenses be distributed to wells fargo.additionally,both motions recognized pha obligations to wells fargo under the two loans and the agreement.see.the bankruptcy court granted the motions,noting in its orders that pha was in debt to wells fargo,and that the balance of the sale proceeds should be distributed to wells fargo.in the final sale order,the court explicitly stated that sale proceeds should be paid to wells fargo up to the amount of the wfb obligations,where wfb obligations was a defined term from trustee albert sale motion representing pha debts arising out of the two loans and the swap agreement.
around the time trustee albert moved to sell the bankruptcy estate properties in satisfaction of pha outstanding debts to wells fargo,he also consented to the dismissal without prejudice of pha adversary complaint.
by november,the proceeds of the sales had satisfied pha debts to wells fargo.consequently,victor equity holder and principal of a motion to dismiss the chapter proceeding,which the bankruptcy court granted with trustee albert consent.
more than a year later,pha filed suit in virginia state court,which wells fargo removed to federal court.along with repeating the claims made in the bankruptcy adversary complaint,pha alleged new theories of lender liability.relevant here,pha claimed that the transaction was a sham because the libor rate was illegally rigged and manipulated.appellant br.at see also.
wells fargo filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted on res judicata grounds,giving preclusive effect to the bankruptcy court sale orders.the court then denied pha motion for reconsideration.
this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court dismissal based on res judicata.brooks arthur,cir.
under the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.pueschel united states,cir quoting federated dep t stores,moitie,d.three elements must be satisfied for res judicata to apply.t here must be a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit and an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.id.at.along with these three formal elements of res judicata,two practical considerations should be taken into account.grausz englander,cir.first,we consider whether the party or its privy knew or should have known of its claims at the time of the first action.see id.at.second,we ask whether the court that ruled in the first suit was an effective forum to litigate the relevant claims.see id.at.
we address the three core res judicata requirements in turn,followed by the two practical considerations from grausz.
the district court recognized the first res judicata requirement that the sale orders are final orders on the merits as the clearest hurdle for wells fargo to overcome.nevertheless,the court determined that wells fargo prevailed,primarily relying on cases from the fifth,sixth,and seventh circuits,which concluded that bankruptcy sale orders were final orders on the merits.citing winget jp morgan chase bank,cir bank of lafayette baudoin in re baudoin,cir gekas pipin in re met l wood,cir 
while pha concedes that the sale orders are final,it presents a litany of arguments that they are not on the merits.appellant br.at.we are unconvinced,concluding as the district court did that the first prong of res judicata is satisfied.
we begin by turning to the cases from our sister circuits upon which the district court relied.we,too,find them persuasive and reject pha attempts to distinguish them.
in met l wood,the debtor in a chapter proceeding filed a motion to sell bankruptcy estate assets,which the court granted.at.while b requires that the seller of estate property give notice to creditors,some unsecured creditors did not receive notice.id.at.after the sale,the bankruptcy case was converted into a chapter proceeding,and a trustee was appointed.id.at.the trustee then investigated the circumstances surrounding the judicial sale and eventually decided that there had been skullduggery of two kinds.id.seeking to remedy said skullduggery on behalf of unsecured creditors,the trustee filed suit in federal district court against the,its owner,and others involved in the judicial sale,alleging various common law and statutory claims.id.at.
the seventh circuit concluded that the district court properly dismissed the trustee suit.id.at.the court explained that to the extent the trustee claims were derived from his representation of the unsecured creditors who had notice of the judicial sale,res judicata barred the trustee lawsuit from moving forward.id.at.but,to the extent the trustee claims were derived from unsecured creditors who had not received notice of the judicial sale,res judicata proved no bar because this subset of unsecured creditors were not parties to the sale proceeding.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that the trustee claims were otherwise barred because the sale proceeding was in rem,transfer ring property rights,and property rights are rights good against the world,not just against parties to a judgment or persons with notice of the proceeding.id.
in baudoin,the plaintiffs and their wholly owned company filed for chapter bankruptcy based on an inability to meet loan obligations to a particular creditor bank.at.the plaintiffs personal bankruptcies were consolidated,and a trustee was appointed.id.at.upon the trustee motion,two properties securing the plaintiffs debt were sold at auction,leading to the plaintiffs discharge from bankruptcy.id.three years later,the plaintiffs sued the creditor bank,alleging that it forced them and their company into bankruptcy.id.
the fifth circuit concluded that res judicata precluded the plaintiffs suit.id.at.in doing so,the court looked to,among other considerations,the important interest in the finality of judgments in a bankruptcy case.id.quoting hendrick avent,cir.specifically,the court explained that the goals of r estraining litigious plaintiffs from taking more than one bite of the apple,and ensuring that bite is to be taken as expeditiously and economically as possible were to be given great weight,particularly in light of spiraling litigation costs and docket congestion.see id.at quoting state bank trust,cir.
finally,in winget,the bankruptcy court ordered the sale of the chapter debtors assets,with the proceeds of the sale going to an outstanding balance on a credit agreement.at.winget,who owned the and guaranteed their debt,later sued various parties,asserting that those parties intentionally devalued the companies assets through conduct taking place before the bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.the sixth circuit held that winget claims were barred by res judicata.id.at.in concluding that the sale order was a final order on the merits,the court looked to baudoin and met l wood,as well as the policy of promoting finality that underpins res judicata.see id.at.
pha attempts to meaningfully distinguish these cases are unavailing.as for winget,pha argues that the sixth circuit held that the sale order was on the merits because winget objected though he withdrew this objection with the same lender liability claim that he later brought in the district court.appellant br.at citing winget,at id.at.but the passage of winget that pha cites does not relate to the question of whether a sale order is a final order on the merits.instead,the sixth circuit discussed winget objection to show that he was not unaware of all of the facts needed to bring the claims before the bankruptcy court at the time of th e proceeding.winget,at.accordingly,pha reliance on this factual distinction is misplaced.
with regard to baudoin,pha contends that it is distinguishable because the debtors never objected to the sale orders or the creditor claim in the bankruptcy court,unlike pha,which objected to wells fargo proof of claim.we fail to see how this helps pha.as the baudoin court explained,sale orders are final judgments on the merits for res judicata purposes,even though the order neither closes the bankruptcy case nor disposes of any claim.at quoting hendrick,at.it is irrelevant whether an objection was made.
as for met l wood,pha argues that the court did not hold that the trustee claims seeking damages against the seller and purchaser were barred by res judicata.reply br.at.this is arguably true because the trustee claims were derived in part from unsecured creditors who were not party to the sale proceeding,and therefore the court could not resolve the entire case on res judicata grounds.but,the seventh circuit subsequently treated the res judicata analysis in met lwood as a holding.see matrix iv,am.bank trust of,cir we held in met l wood that a bankruptcy trustee was barred from filing a rico suit against the debtor and others involved in a bankruptcy asset sale after the sale had been confirmed res judicata applied emphasis added.more importantly,because we of course are not bound by met l wood regardless of what it held,it is not particularly important to this court whether the passage in question was dictum.what matters is whether we find the seventh circuit analysis persuasive.here,we do.
pha also argues that met l wood is distinguishable because pha claims are unrelated to the sale proceedings themselves,while in met l wood,the trustee alleged fraud surrounding the sale.reply br.at.we grant that this is a distinction,but it is not a meaningful one.
to sell bankruptcy estate assets outside the ordinary course of business,the trustee of the estate or the must initiate the sale proceeding.see b,a.here,the trustee moved to sell property in satisfaction of specifically identified obligations arising out of pha transactions with wells fargo.the bankruptcy court approved these sales,finding them to be in the best interests of the estate,see also rose logan,no.rdb,wl,at,describing the standard for approving a sale of bankruptcy estate assets appellant br.at the standard for approving the sale is essentially a business judgment test,or whether it is in the best interests of the estate to sell the property.citing collier on bankruptcy f alan resnick henry sommer,ed.
the key questions thus arise if pha did not owe the amount that wells fargo claimed it was due,why would the bankruptcy estate to sell estate assets in full satisfaction of wells fargo claimed debt,and why would the bankruptcy court approve the sale the motions to sell in this case effectively conceded the validity of pha obligations to wells fargo,and the proceeds of the sales satisfied those obligations.it would make little sense after the sales were made,the debt settled,and the bankruptcy proceeding closed,to then allow pha to challenge in a new judicial proceeding the propriety of the transactions giving rise to its debt.to allow such a challenge would achieve little more than upending the purpose of res judicata promoting finality and judicial economy.montana united states,d see also winget,at baudoin,at.
furthermore,the preclusive effect of the bankruptcy court sale orders is consistent with the fundamental purpose of chapter bankruptcy rehabilitation of the debtor.phillips congelton,in re white mountain mining,cir quoting nlrb bildisco bildisco,d.to fulfill this objective,c entralization of disputes concerning a debtor legal obligations is especially critical because it allows reorganization to proceed efficiently,unimpeded by uncoordinated proceedings in other arenas.id.quoting shugrue air line pilots ass n,int l in re ionosphere clubs,cir.allowing piecemeal litigation as pha urges,after all the debts and dust of a bankruptcy have settled,would invite precisely the inefficient decentralized proceedings that chapter bankruptcy is designed to avoid.see id.
we conclude in accord with our sister circuits as well as the purpose of res judicata and chapter bankruptcy that the sale orders in this case are final orders on the merits.
pha presents a series of other arguments that we should break ranks with our sister circuits and hold that the sale orders fail to satisfy the first prong of res judicata.none are persuasive.
first,pha argues that because its adversary complaint was dismissed without prejudice,its present lawsuit is not precluded.the dismissal of the adversary complaint is not relevant to our analysis,as wells fargo does not contend that this dismissal gives rise to res judicata.instead,the sale orders are what preclude the claims now before the court.
second,pha contends that because a bankruptcy court sale order is an in rem proceeding,met l wood,at,it does not have a res judicata effect on in personam lender liability claims.in support,pha points to zack metal int l navigation,cir.zack metal,however,does not address res judicata.as wells fargo correctly points out,zack metal stands for the proposition that a party can not file an in personam action on or otherwise attempt to collect on an in rem judgment by means other than the specific property at issue in the in rem lawsuit.appellee br.at citing zack metal,at.
moreover,the circuit cases we discussed earlier belie the notion that the in rem nature of a sale order precludes the application of res judicata to transactionally related lender liability claims.a chapter sale order can give rise to res judicata because the estate trustee or the ample opportunity to assert a lender liability claim before selling off estate assets in satisfaction of debts.see charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed explaining that because bankruptcy proceedings are intended to resolve all claims in a single definitive proceeding,in personam claims that could have been raised during bankruptcy should be precluded.
third,pha maintains that county fuel equitable bank,cir,precludes the application of res judicata in this case.there,a creditor filed a proof of claim in a chapter proceedin
