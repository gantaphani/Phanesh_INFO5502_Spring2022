petitioner karin gully appeals from the determination of the national credit union administration board the board that she engaged in unsafe and unsound practices and that she breached her fiduciary duty as the manager of the waterside federal credit union wfcu,and is therefore unfit to be involved in the affairs of a credit union.see g a c.the board based this finding on gully failure to prevent the misuse of a wfcu corporate credit card by a wfcu board member and wit,her father.the board found that gully satisfied the criteria to sustain an order permanently barring her from participating in the affairs of an insured credit union.because of the unique circumstances of her case,however,it did not actually issue the prohibition order.
on appeal,gully contends that the board legal findings were arbitrary and capricious principally because the board employed the wrong standard in finding that she engaged in misconduct and was unfit.the board counters that gully lacks standing to appeal its decision principally because it never issued the prohibition order against her.the board further contends that,even if gully has standing,its findings should be affirmed.
we conclude that gully does have standing to challenge the board conclusions.we also find that the board conclusions were neither arbitrary nor capricious and were supported by substantial evidence.we therefore affirm the board decision.
background 
the facts are not in dispute.the wfcu is a credit union based in queens.it serves con edison employees and has over million in assets.gully was the assistant manager of the wfcu for ten years before taking over as manager in.gully family has a longstanding relationship with the wfcu.her father,reinhold wagner,housed the wfcu in the basement of their home for twenty years,and he was a wfcu board member from the until.wagner also served as manager of the wfcu after his retirement from con edison in.
even after he resigned his official position at the wfcu in,wagner remained the dominant figure at the wfcu as a paid consultant and board member.he set the agenda at the board meetings,maintained the general ledger,and paid all the wfcu bills.he was subject to virtually no oversight by any wfcu employee.wfcu personnel forwarded unopened bills to wagner and he simply requested a check from a wfcu teller in a given amount.with rare exception,no wfcu employee actually saw the specific charges on a bill.
unbeknownst to the other wfcu board members,wagner held a corporate american express card for the wfcu in his name.the card,of course,was available to wagner for business purposes only.as with the other bills,the american express statements were addressed to wagner and he was generally the only person to see the detailed charges on the bill.gully herself processed the majority of the checks for the american express bills.
in,wagner asked gully to pay the wfcu american express bill because he was at his vacation home in florida.when gully opened the bill,she noted what appeared to be personal charges by her father.she nonetheless paid the bill.she later spoke to her father about the charges and he explained that he had used the wfcu card only because he did not have his personal card with him.wagner told gully that he would reimburse the wfcu for his personal charges on that bill.
gully did not report her father unauthorized use of the american express card to the wfcu board,nor did she follow up to ensure that her father had reimbursed the wfcu.she did not monitor her father subsequent use of the card to see if he continued to make personal charges.had she done so,she would have discovered that wagner never reimbursed the wfcu for any of his personal charges.worse still,wagner continued to use the wfcu card for his personal charges.virtually every month,wagner charged his vacation expenses,restaurant meals,and building supplies for his florida home to the wfcu card.
a investigation by the national credit union administration ncua revealed that in the preceding six years wagner had put over in personal charges on the wfcu card.wagner did not contest these charges and reimbursed the wfcu over.he also consented to the entry of a prohibition order against him,banning him from participating in the affairs of any credit union.gully herself resigned her position when wagner misconduct came to light.
in,the ncua focused on gully and served her with a notice of charges stating that it would hold a hearing on whether she too should be subject to a prohibition order.gully denied all charges.an administrative law judge alj conducted an evidentiary hearing and issued a decision recommending that no prohibition order be entered against her.not surprisingly,the ncua filed exceptions with the board,contending that the alj legal and factual findings were erroneous in part.gully did not file any exceptions with the board.
the board concluded that during her stint as manager gully had engaged in unsafe and unsound practices and had breached her fiduciary duty to the wfcu.accordingly,the board found her unfit to be involved in the affairs of an insured credit union pursuant to g.specifically,the board held that after becoming aware of her father misuse of the wfcu credit card,gully had an obligation to ensure that he reimbursed the wfcu and that his personal use of the wfcu funds ceased.in the board view,this duty included,at the very least,reviewing future american express bills.by failing to take any of these steps,gully in effect,actively participated in her father misconduct.despite finding the criteria for a prohibition order satisfied,however,the board decided not to issue such an order because of the unique circumstances of gully case and the fact that she had eventually resigned from her position as manager of the wfcu 
gully then filed a petition for review in this court.the credit union,wfcu,which had already successfully defended one state court action brought by gully for indemnification of her legal fees,intervened to protect its ongoing interest in avoiding an indemnification action by gully.see bus.law a a person who has been successful,on the merits or otherwise,in the defense of a civil action shall be entitled to indemnification by the corporation as authorized by.
discussion 
on appeal,the board raises a threshold jurisdictional question whether gully has standing to bring this action in federal court.the board contends that gully does not have standing to challenge its conclusions because it did not actually issue a prohibition order against her.
article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies.const.art.iii.standing is an essential and unchanging part of article iii requirement.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing has three requirements.id.first and foremost,the party invoking federal jurisdiction must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,rather than conjectural or hypothetical.id.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the challenged conduct.id.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.internal quotations omitted.
the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.id.at.standing can not be inferred,but must affirmatively appear in the record.spencer kemna,d internal quotations omitted.
the administrative procedure act apa grants a person adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action the right to judicial review of that action.the supreme court has recognized that when a person challenges the legality of government action and that person is himself the object of the action at is the case here there is ordinarily little question that the action has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.lujan,at.
the board first contention is that gully fails to satisfy the injury requirement of standing.it argues that gully suffered no cognizable injury because it chose not to enter a prohibition order against her.the board also asserts that gully statutory basis for jurisdiction is lacking because its decision can not be characterized as an order under j.finally,despite acknowledging that reputational injury is sufficient to establish standing in some cases,the board posits that gully alleged reputational injury is too vague to constitute an injury in fact.each of these contentions lacks merit.
as a threshold matter,the board attempt to characterize its decision as something other than an order is unpersuasive.section j provides that any party subject to a disciplinary hearing under that section may obtain review of any order issued by the board.j emphasis added.while order itself is not defined in the statute,j does require the board to issue an order or orders after every hearing.therefore,despite the alleged lack of a document formally denominated as an order,we conclude that a decision of the board is subject to judicial review by a party who,like gully,is the subject of a disciplinary hearing.
apart from the semantic quibble,there is in fact one formally designated order in the record.the board fashioned its decision in gully case as an order.under the section of its decision entitled conclusion and order,the board stated 
it is hereby ordered,that the conduct of respondent katharina wagner gully,as manager of wfcu,was sufficient to sustain an order permanently prohibiting her from participating in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any insured credit union.
the board then proceeded to issue a second order,stating that it would not issue a formal prohibition order against gully.given the board repeated references to its decision as an order,its argument that the decision was not an appealable order is rejected.
equally unavailing is the board contention that gully suffered no cognizable injury because there is no prohibition order against her.contrary to the board belief,a prohibition order is not a sacred talisman that must always be present to establish an injury.the supreme court has long recognized that an injury to reputation will satisfy the injury element of standing.see,joint refugee comm.mcgrath.charitable organizations designated as communist by attorney general had standing to challenge their designations because of,inter alia,damage to the reputation of th e organizations in their respective communities meese keene,d potential distributor of foreign films had standing to challenge justice department characterization of films as political propaganda since it would affect his personal,political,and professional reputation and impair his ability to practice his profession accord united states accra pac,cir being put on a blacklist is treated as immediately redressible harm because it diminishes or eliminates the opportunity to practice one profession even if the list does not impose legal obligations.
several circuit courts have found reputational injury sufficient to establish injury in fact in cases quite similar to this case.for example,the circuit held that a district judge had standing to challenge a public reprimand he received from the judicial council of the fifth circuit for engaging in a pattern of abusive behavior.mcbryde comm.to review circuit council conduct and disability orders of the judicial conference of the united states,internal quotations omitted,cert.denied,d.the reprimand,which was published on the fifth circuit website,had no legal effect on the judge,but was,of course,a blight on his reputation.in concluding that the judge reputational injury established a cognizable injury in fact under meese keene,the circuit relied solely on the serious effect of the reprimand on the judge reputation.id.at.
it is that gully reputation will be blackened by the board finding of misconduct and unfitness.one need not be a sage to recognize that the board findings are a death knell for gully career in an industry dependent on security and reliability.southern mut.help ass califano,it is not difficult to imagine the inhospitable reception that would be given to future applications from an organization that has been accused of violating departmental regulations,misusing grant funds,and engaging in activities that create conflicts of interest.
the board also challenges the second standing requirement of article iii.it contends that any harm to gully reputation was caused,not by its legal conclusions of misconduct and unfitness,but by her own failure to prevent her father continued misuse of wfcu funds.this is simply too facile.it is the board determination,not gully reprehensible conduct,that has sullied her reputation in the credit union industry.without the board decision,gully would not have to shake the albatross of an official finding that she engaged in misconduct and is unfit to be involved in the affairs of a credit union.that is sufficient causation.
redressability 
finally,the board maintains that any reputational injury to gully can not be redressed by a favorable decision from this court.it is difficult to comprehend this argument.a finding that gully did not breach her fiduciary duty to the wfcu,did not engage in unsafe and unsound practices,and is fit to participate in the affairs of a credit union would remove the stain on gully professional record.this is sufficient to establish redressability.meese,at.
in sum,gully has satisfied all the standing requirements to challenge the board conclusions that she committed misconduct and was unfit to serve.
ii.the ncua board decision 
turning to the merits of gully appeal,the crux of her argument is that the board failed to apply the correct legal standard when it made its misconduct and unfitness determinations.more specifically,gully claims that scienter and culpability are essential to a finding of misconduct and unfitness under g.in light of the plain language of g,this contention is extravagant.
standard of review 
our review of the board decisions is governed by the apa.see j.under the apa,the board conclusions must be affirmed unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or unsupported by substantial evidence.a,e.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d internal quotations omitted.the task of the reviewing court under th e arbitrary and capricious standard is to determine whether the agency has considered the pertinent evidence,examined the relevant factors,and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action including whether there is a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.andrew lange,faa,cir internal quotations omitted.our review under these standards is narrow and particularly deferential.rail steering comm.surface transp,cir.
prohibition orders under the federal credit union act 
federal credit unions are governed by the federal credit union act fcua,and administered by a federal agency,the ncua,id.a.the ncua is managed by the board.id.the fcua authorizes the board to issue orders barring a credit union officer or employee from further participation in the affairs of a federally insured credit union.id.g.a prohibition order must be buttressed by a finding that a credit union official is guilty of misconduct that has an adverse effect on the credit union and evinces personal dishonesty or unfitness.id.the prohibition test.
the misconduct element is satisfied when it is found that a party has engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice,or committed or engaged in any act,omission,or practice which constitutes a breach of such party fiduciary duty.id.g a ii,iii.
the adverse effect element is established when,as a result of a party misconduct,a credit union has suffered or will probably suffer financial loss or other damage.id.g b i.
the final element of the prohibition test requires a finding that a party conduct involves personal dishonesty or demonstrates such party unfitness to serve as a director or officer of,or to otherwise participate in the conduct of the affairs of,an insured credit union.id.g c i,ii.
