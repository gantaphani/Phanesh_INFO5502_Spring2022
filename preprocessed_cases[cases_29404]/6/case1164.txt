facts and procedural history 
in december,b of a filed a complaint against roberts for breach of contract and common counts,based on roberts alleged default on her contractual obligation to repay the home equity loan.the complaint included an allegation that on or about june,b of a accepted the short sale proceeds in the sum of,for the release of its lien on the r eal p roperty only.attached to the complaint,and incorporated therein,was a copy of i the home equity loan agreement,ii the deed of trust,and iii the short sale agreement.in the short sale agreement,roberts expressly acknowledged and agreed that she was responsible to repay the unpaid balance of the home equity loan.
in may,b of a moved for summary judgment on its complaint.the supporting declaration by jason dunn,an assistant vice president of b of a,averred the factual basis for the home equity loan,the default thereof by roberts,and the amount that was due and owing under said loan.dunn declaration also asserted there was a short sale agreement which released the lien on the real property only.copies of the home equity loan,the deed of trust,and the short sale agreement were all attached to,and authenticated by,dunn declaration.as noted,the short sale agreement included roberts acknowledgment that after the short sale was completed,she would remain obligated to repay the balance of the home equity loan.with one exception that was subsequently corrected,these factual matters were set forth in the separate statement of undisputed material facts in support of b of a motion for summary judgment 
in august,roberts filed her opposition to the motion for summary judgment.roberts admitted to entering the home equity loan and defaulting on same,but she asserted that in light of the short sale in which b of a received a portion of the delinquent amount,b of a was barred from seeking a deficiency judgment against her based on code of civil procedure sections an antideficiency statute relating to short sales and the one form of action rule.she noted that the application form in connection with the short sale had disclosed that b of a may pursue a deficiency judgment unless prohibited by law.she argued that sections constituted such legal prohibitions.she also argued that b of a had unclean hands,since it took advantage of her financial plight when it consented to the short sale.
the trial court granted b of a motion for summary judgment.the trial court written order noted that b of a had set forth sufficient evidence to establish its breach of contract cause of action and that roberts had failed to show any triable issue of material fact.further,as to roberts assertion of statutory defenses,the trial court explained roberts has not shown that b of a cause of action is barred by sections,or prohibited by any other law.b of a participation in a short sale of its collateral in which b of a held a junior position and which resulted in payment to b of a of less than the amount due under roberts loan agreement does not bar b of a from pursuing this action to recover the deficiency.roberts has not provided evidence to show that b of a waived its right to recover a deficiency judgment by releasing its lien on the subject real property as part of the short sale.the formal order granting the summary judgment motion was filed october,including the amount due under the home equity loan of.judgment was entered based on the order granting the summary judgment motion.roberts timely appeal followed.

summary judgment is appropriate when all of the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.

roberts primarily argued below,as she does on appeal,that certain statutes precluded b of a from obtaining a deficiency judgment against her.in particular,she argued that a deficiency judgment was impermissible based on sections and.we now examine her claims that these statutes barred b of a from seeking a deficiency judgment in this case.we also briefly consider other defenses asserted by roberts.
roberts argues that the recent amendment of section,which took effect in july over two years after the short sale occurred in this case should be applied retroactively to cover her short sale.we disagree.
the original version of section provided that no deficiency judgment may be rendered against a homeowner under a note secured by a first deed of trust italics added if the holder of the first deed of trust consented in writing to a short sale and received the proceeds thereof.in that event,the short sale proceeds received by the holder of the first deed of trust would result in a discharge of the remaining indebtedness.stats,ch,west cal.sess.laws,vol.in july,section was amended to expand the antideficiency protection in the event of a short sale to any deed of trust,including junior lienholders,if the holder of said deed of trust consented to the short sale and received the proceeds of the sale as agreed.stats,ch,west cal.sess.laws,vol,eff.july.the amendment was enacted as urgent legislation,taking effect immediately,because the protection was deemed necessary to mitigate the impact of the ongoing foreclosure crisis and to encourage the approval of short sales as an alternative to foreclosure ibid.
as amended,section,subdivision a,now provides as follows no deficiency shall be owed or collected,and no deficiency judgment shall be requested or rendered for any deficiency upon a note secured solely by a deed of trust or mortgage for a dwelling of not more than four units,in any case in which the trustor or mortgagor sells the dwelling for a sale price less than the remaining amount of the indebtedness outstanding at the time of sale,in accordance with the written consent of the holder of the deed of trust or mortgage,provided that both of the following have occurred a title has been voluntarily transferred to a buyer by grant deed or by other document of conveyance that has been recorded in the county where all or part of the real property is located.b the proceeds of the sale have been tendered to the mortgagee,beneficiary,or the agent of the mortgagee or beneficiary,in accordance with the parties agreement.
the issue in the present appeal is whether the amendment to section was intended by the legislature to apply retroactively to short sales that were completed prior to the effective date of the amendment.as explained below,we conclude the legislature did not intend a retroactive application.
generally,statutes operate prospectively only.citations.mcclung employment development cal th,mcclung.t he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly for that reason,the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.citations.ibid.thus,statutes ordinarily are interpreted as operating prospectively in the absence of a clear indication of a contrary legislative intent.citations.in construing statutes,there is a presumption against retroactive application unless the legislature plainly has directed otherwise by means of express language of retroactivity or other sources that provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the legislature intended retroactive application.citations.ambiguous statutory language will not suffice to dispel the presumption against retroactivity rather a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed to be unambiguously prospective.citations.quarry doe i cal th,see also no part of this code is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.
we see nothing in the language of section to overcome the strong presumption against retroactive application.if anything,the wording of the statute indicates that its protections are directed toward future conduct,since it makes reference to transactions in which the trustor or mortgagor sells the dwelling for a sale price less than the remaining amount of the indebtedness,subd.a,italics added.additionally,in explaining the urgent need for the amendment,the legislature stated it was seeking to encourage the approval of short sales as an alternative to foreclosure,thereby indicating the amendment was directed toward future decision making by lenders and homeowners.stats,ch,west cal.sess.laws,vol.this interpretation is further confirmed by the legislative history.in its analysis of the proposed amendment known as bill,the assembly committee on the judiciary recited with approval the following comment by one of the bill proponents 
senate bill no.adds additional protections against sale deficiency liability to junior note holders seconds when those lenders approve a short sale.it is important to note that the short sale process remains voluntary on every participant part only lenders that actually agree to the sale will be affected,and sellers that can not put together an acceptable sale may still go to foreclosure and even bankruptcy.assem.com.on judiciary,com.on analysis of bill reg.sess.june.
in summary,not only do the language and history of the amendment fail to show any intent by the legislature to make the new provision retroactive,but to the contrary,every indication is that it was understood to be prospective only.
furthermore,the fairness rationale for the presumption against retroactive application of a statute is especially compelling here,where a past contractual transaction was agreed to under the law in effect at that time.it would be unfair to change the legal effect and consequences of that transaction retroactively.as noted by a federal district court addressing this very issue the practical effect of interpreting the statute as plaintiffs suggest would be to extinguish the rights to deficiency balances negotiated between parties prior to the enactment of section.espinoza bank of america,d,holding amendment to is not retroactive.for all of these reasons,we conclude that the amendment to section does not apply retroactively and,therefore,does not cover roberts short sale 
roberts contends that b of a was barred from pursuing a deficiency judgment against her based on section,the rule.she argues that under section,judicial foreclosure was the only form of action allowable for collecting on a debt secured by real estate,and inasmuch as b of a chose not to pursue a foreclosure action,it is barred from obtaining a deficiency judgment.b of a responds that in light of the agreed short sale,in which b of a consented to release its lien only and roberts agreed to remain personally liable on the loan,section was not applicable.we agree with b of 
we begin by reviewing the broader context and purpose of section.d uring the g reat d epression with its dearth of money and declining property values,a mortgagee was able to purchase the subject real property at a foreclosure sale at a depressed price far below its normal fair market value and thereafter to obtain a double recovery by holding the debtor for a large deficiency.citation.accordingly,california enacted an interrelated set of foreclosure and antideficiency statutes to protect debtors.citation.national enterprises,woods th.section is part of that statutory framework and it operates alongside antideficiency statutes such as section.walker community bank cal d.section provides,in part,as follows there can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real property or an estate for years therein,which action shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,subd.a.the one form of action is a foreclosure action shin superior court th,in which the creditor must first exhaust the security before seeking any monetary judgment for the deficiency security pacific national bank wozab cal d,security pacific.
