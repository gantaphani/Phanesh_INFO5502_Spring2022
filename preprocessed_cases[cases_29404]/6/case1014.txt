andreini is a california insurance broker who arranges insurance coverage for its clients and bills them for the premiums due on these policies.those payments are deposited in a client trust account,as required by california law.these client trust funds are then remitted to the insurance carriers as payment for andreini client insurance policies,less a commission for its brokerage services.pony express contracted with andreini for insurance brokerage services with respect to its workers compensation and cargo insurance needs.
from january through march of andreini sent pony express several invoices for premiums due on its workers compensation insurance polices.the various premiums invoiced were due to the insurance carriers by may,and june.the total amount of the invoices was.on may,andreini received from pony express a check for the full amount,which it deposited into its client trust account.the following day,andreini issued several checks from its client trust account to pony express insurance carriers in payment of the insurance premiums that were now either overdue or due in one week unbeknownst to andreini,pony express was in serious financial difficulty and its check was returned for insufficient funds.pony express had never before given andreini an insufficient funds check.on june,andreini the check,but it was again returned.
andreini executives contacted pony express about the returned check and the deficiency created in the client trust account when the check bounced.to erase the deficiency,pony express director of financial reporting immediately authorized a wire transfer of the full amount of the check directly into andreini client trust account.on june,the wire transfer was made.
two days later,june,pony express filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.as part of its bankruptcy petition,on may,pony express filed a complaint in the northern district of georgia bankruptcy court against andreini and other defendants not party to this appeal seeking to recover several payments,including the wire transfer,as avoidable preferences under.pony express claimed that,if avoidable under,the wire transfer could be recovered from andreini because andreini was the initial transferee of the avoidable preference under.pony express moved for summary judgment before the bankruptcy court,which granted the motion on july,concluding that the wire transfer was an avoidable preference and that andreini was the initial transferee.on appeal,the district court for the northern district of georgia affirmed.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.see in re optical,cir.federal rule of civil procedure governing summary judgment applies in an adversary bankruptcy proceeding.fed.under this familiar standard,the court must view the facts and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.loren sasser,cir.
under certain transfers of assets made by a bankrupt company in the days prior to filing a chapter petition can be declared avoidable preferences.see.the bankruptcy court found that the wire transfer to andreini client trust account two days before pony express filed for bankruptcy was an avoidable preference,a finding that is not challenged.however,under,an avoidable transfer of assets can only be recovered from certain parties,including the initial transferee.a.whether,as the bankruptcy court and district court concluded,andreini was the initial transferee of the wire transfer is in dispute.to resolve this issue,the pivotal question is whether andreini was a mere conduit for funds earmarked for payment of insurance premiums or whether a debt was created by andreini unintentional prepayment of insurance premiums such that it had legal control over funds transferred to satisfy the debt.the record indicates that the wire transfer was not repayment of a genuine debt but was intended simply as payment of insurance premiums and made to a trust account.
the term initial transferee is a term of art whose meaning in any given transaction is not always straightforward.see in re int l admin,cir.most circuit courts to have considered the issue,including the eleventh circuit,have adopted a control or conduit test to determine whether the recipient of an avoidable transfer of assets is the initial transferee.see see also bonded fin,european am.bank,cir in re columbia data,cir in re bullion reserve of,cir in re baker getty fin,cir in re coutee,cir in re first sec.mortgage,cir in re finley,kumble,wagner,heine,underberg,manley,myerson casey,cir.under this test,a recipient of an avoidable transfer is an initial transferee only if they exercise legal control over the assets received,such that they have the right to use the assets for their own purposes,and not if they merely served as a conduit for assets that were under the actual control of the or the real initial transferee.see nordberg societe generale in re chase sanborn,cir nordberg arab banking in re chase sanborn,cir bonded fin,at in re ogden,cir.
this test takes on special significance where the recipients of avoidable transfers are agents or fiduciaries of the,such as banks or,in this case,insurance brokers,who are to take only limited actions with respect to the funds received.see,societe generale,at finding that debtor bank was not an initial transferee ogden,at finding that an escrow agent was not an initial transferee bonded fin,at bank in re.state fair,finding that an insurance broker was not an initial transferee.often these fiduciaries or agents are not considered initial transferees because their legal control over the assets received is circumscribed by their legal duties to their clients.see societe generale,at contrasting,for the purposes of determining whether a bank was an initial transferee,a bank receipt of funds for the sole purpose of depositing them in a customer account with the receipt of funds earmarked for the payment of a debt owed to the bank ogden,at finding that an escrow agent was not an initial transferee where funds received were intended for a trust account bonded fin,at w e think the minimum requirement of status as a transferee is dominion over the money or other asset,the right to put the money to one own purposes.when a gives a check to b as agent for c,then c is the initial transferee the agent may be disregarded.state fair,at finding that an insurance broker who held a debtor assets in trust for payment to insurance companies was not an initial transferee.this can be true even where the transferred assets ultimately come under the agent or fiduciary full control through a subsequent transfer.see bonded fin,at finding that a bank became a mediate,but not initial,transferee only after the directed it to apply funds initially transferred to the debtor account toward repayment of a loan from the bank.
however,even entities that have special legal relationships with the can be initial transferees when they do,in fact,take legal control of an avoidable transfer for example when they receive assets directly from the as compensation for services or in payment of a genuine debt.see,arab banking,at finding that a bank was the initial transferee of funds transferred for the express purpose of paying off loan principal owed to the bank.in these situations,the fiduciary or agent does exercise legal control over the transferred assets beca
