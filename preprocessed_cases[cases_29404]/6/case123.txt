this case comes on before this court on appeal from a july,memorandum and order of the district court entering a judgment of acquittal for john moran and nora moran after their jury convictions for bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud under and.granting appellees.motions one year after the jury returned the verdicts,the court concluded that the evidence the government submitted in its was insufficient to sustain the convictions.the government challenges that determination on appeal,arguing that the district court erred in failing to consider the full trial record before granting the motions.the government contends that the evidence,viewed in its totality and with all reasonable inferences drawn in the government favor as the verdict winner,supported a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the morans each knowingly engaged and conspired to engage in a scheme to defraud a federally insured banking institution by actively concealing material information concerning their outside interests in boston development projects secured by two loans made by the institution.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the government and will reverse the judgment of the district court,reinstate the guilty verdicts,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
a brief summary of the salient facts follows,though we reserve making a more detailed exposition until we set forth our legal analysis.this appeal grows out of a superseding indictment charging the morans with bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with two loans the first american bank for savings first american,a federally insured institution,made in december to developers edgar puente and david boersner.puente and boersner needed financing for two renovation projects seeking to transform brownstone and apartment buildings on commonwealth avenue and in west rutland square in boston into condominiums.
john moran,who for many years on numerous occasions had represented first american as a conveyancing attorney,met with puente and boersner in october to discuss serving as their mortgage broker.puente and boersner hired john moran in that capacity under the moran holdings,agreeing to pay him a fee equal to of any loans he successfully procured for their projects.john moran subsequently arranged and attended a meeting with puente,boersner,and a loan officer at first american,edmund noke,which culminated in the parties agreeing that first american would extend two loans totaling million to puente and boersner in exchange for a profit interest in the development projects.the parties further agreed that john moran would act as the closing attorney for the bank on the loans.in a separate agreement,not involving noke,puente and boersner agreed to give john moran a profit interest in the projects to be held by the moran development group mdg trust,established by nora moran,its sole trustee,on december,
nora moran,who at all times relevant to this appeal was a broker and the wife of john moran,was on the board of directors of first american,having assumed the office on august,first american had adopted a code of professional ethics in requiring,inter alia,that an officer or director disclose any direct or indirect financial interest in a bank loan and disqualify him or herself from participating in the approval process for any such loan.this requirement was consistent with regulation o of the federal reserve board,which,pursuant to,requires interested directors to disclose fully any personal financial stake or that of their related entities in a given loan and prohibits them from participating directly or indirectly in any vote to extend such credit.the regulation also requires banks to keep records of insider loans to directors,officers,and their related interests and to report annually all insider loans to federal regulators.see and.
in november,the morans,noke,puente,boersner,and a representative of contractors funding corporation,a company specializing in construction inspection services,visited the commonwealth avenue and west rutland square project sites.john moran subsequently submitted formal,written proposals on behalf of puente and boersner seeking loans for the projects which,as opposed to recourse loans,insulate borrowers from personal liability for the amount of the loans.the proposals carried the name moran holdings and were signed by john moran,but did not mention his brokerage or profit arrangement with puente and boersner.
noke sent memoranda summarizing the loan proposals to first american executive committee in december,as all loans for amounts greater than required its approval.these memoranda did not mention john moran brokerage or profit arrangement with puente and boersner.the executive committee approved the loans on a recourse basis on december,and they closed on december and john moran represented the bank at the closings,charging for his services although he in fact collected only on the fee.he also received in mortgage brokerage fees from the proceeds of the loans.furthermore,john moran kept an additional in bank funds in his checking account,which should have been disbursed at the closings.
on january,the board of directors,with nora moran in attendance,met to consider an agenda which included a report of the executive committee activities for december.minutes from a december meeting of the executive committee show that two votes were taken,one approving loans totaling and another approving additional loans totaling with the loans included in the latter group.the executive committee report to the board,however,included details concerning only the vote on the loans.nevertheless,the government argued at trial and argues on this appeal that the board voted to approve the loans at the january meeting and that nora moran,rather than disqualifying herself because of her financial interest,voted in favor of the loans.notwithstanding their dispute over what happened at the board meeting on january,the parties agree that nora moran never disclosed to any employee,officer,or agent of first american her husband status as the mortgage broker for puente and boersner or his profit interest in their development projects.
following the closings,john moran did not file settlement statements with the bank,forms customarily signed by all the parties and submitted within days accounting for the use of the loan proceeds.moreover,he did not submit any records documenting his mortgage brokerage arrangement,his interest in the project,or his retention of the additional in bank funds.furthermore,he did not disclose that he used a portion of that money in april to pay off a loan that puente and boersner had secured from olympic international bank trust company where john moran served as a director as a down payment towards the purchase of the west rutland square property.
in,first american vice president and general counsel michael hanson reviewed the files on the projects because the loans were not performing satisfactorily and discovered that the settlement statements were missing.after he eventually obtained copies of the statements,hanson realized that signatures were absent from them and that balances were unaccounted for.he learned also that john moran had received mortgage brokerage fees from the loan proceeds.finally,hanson discovered that john moran had obtained a profit stake in the projects which he expected to satisfy by securing a penthouse apartment in one of the buildings.these understandably disturbing revelations caused hanson to contact the bank outside attorneys,the firm of warner stackpole,regarding the loans.
on may,warner stackpole attorneys stanley ragalevsky and samuel adams met with john moran and nora moran for approximately two hours.according to the memorandum regarding the meeting that ragalevsky and adams submitted to first american after the morans approved it,nora moran admitted that she had been aware of her husband brokerage and profit arrangement by the time the loans were approved.she also admitted that she never volunteered this information to anyone at the bank,believing that her husband had made the appropriate disclosures.john moran claimed that he had made full disclosure of his interest in the ventures to noke and had given up his interest in the properties.as a consequence of the disclosures in the memorandum and the facts revealed by the related investigation,nora moran was asked to resign her director position from the first american bancorp,the bank holding company to which she had moved from the bank proper.the board of directors of bancorp accepted her resignation on june.by october,first american failed and was closed by the fdic.
on july,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment against john and nora moran for bank fraud under,aiding and abetting bank fraud under,and conspiracy to commit bank fraud under specifically,counts two and three of the indictment charged that john moran as a closing attorney for first american and nora moran as a director of first american committed fraud when,though to do so,they failed to disclose their material profit interest in the projects when the million mortgage loans were issued.with respect to the conspiracy,count one of the indictment alleged a number of overt acts,including the formation of the mdg trust.the two substantive bank fraud counts corresponded to the two bank loans,and the conspiracy count covered conduct from october to june.the indictment also contained an unrelated fourth count of bank fraud against nora moran in connection with her alleged involvement with a loan made by first american to finance the purchase of a property located on marlborough street in boston.
the trial commenced on may.in its,which lasted days,the government presented evidence purporting to demonstrate that john moran fraudulently had exploited his position as the bank closing attorney with respect to the projects by failing to disclose his financial interest in them.in particular,the evidence showed that first american records,including noke memoranda to the executive committee,did not reflect any disclosure by john moran of his brokerage arrangement with puente and boersner or his profit interest in the properties.for example,the closing settlement statements,which notably john moran did not sign,indicated only that he received legal fees.further,the record did not contain any documentary evidence disclosing his status as mdg trust beneficiary.
significantly,noke testified in the government case that john moran did not inform him of his economic interest in the projects before the loans were submitted to the executive committee for approval.noke claimed that if he duly had been notified he would have prepared an insider transaction report for the bank no such report was introduced at trial.ragalevsky and adams testified that regardless of his possible disclosure to noke,john moran was required to notify upper level management in writing of his financial stake in the projects to satisfy his professional duty as the bank attorney no such written disclosure was introduced at trial.the government also elicited testimony from a number of other witnesses on the nature of the professional duties john moran owed to first american,as well as john moran own testimony from another trial acknowledging the ethical and legal duties of a fiduciary.
government witnesses described with respect to nora moran the duties a director owes to a bank,such as that of full and fair disclosure of any facts material to the bank interests.the government also introduced evidence demonstrating her involvement in the loans visiting the project sites and executing the mdg trust document and her failure to inform any bank official of her husband outside interests regarding the properties.further,the government attempted to show that nora moran voted to approve the loans at the january,board of directors meeting on the theory that it was routine practice for loans approved by the executive committee to be submitted to the board of directors for ratification or modification.
at the close of the government case,the morans made motions for judgments of acquittal under.the court granted nora moran motion with respect to count four but denied the motions as to the remaining counts.in the defense case,john moran testified to having made full and timely disclosure of his outside pecuniary interest in the bank loans to noke.john moran also testified that in november,he had engaged in a similar transaction in which he functioned as the closing attorney for first american and nevertheless received a finder fee from the borrower.he claimed that he had disclosed this earlier conflict of interest to william collins,the bank loan officer on the november loan.
on,john moran indicated that he had sent a check for to his wife via her real estate company on january,the very day of the board of directors meeting at issue in this case.john moran did not indicate on the check what the payment represented,though it was his common practice to do so.the government sought to demonstrate that the morans routinely commingled their business finances during the relevant time period.nora moran presented only one witness in her defense,an economics expert who discussed the general banking and real estate climate during the relevant time period.the government called william collins as its rebuttal witness.he testified that he had no recollection of the november loan about which john moran testified or of any disclosure john moran made as to his finder fee.
at the close of all the evidence,the morans again moved for judgments of acquittal.the court reserved its ruling and charged the jury which,on july,returned guilty verdicts on the three remaining counts against the morans.thereafter,the morans filed motions under.c seeking judgments of acquittal.the district court received memoranda and draft transcripts from all parties and on july,on the basis of the submissions issued the decision and order from which the government appeals,entering a judgment of acquittal on all counts for want of evidentiary support.the court made its ruling considering only the evidence introduced on the government direct case rather than on the full trial record,citing to.b,which mandates that a court revisiting a reserved motion for judgment of acquittal may consider only evidence introduced as of the time that the court reserved ruling on the motion.
the court concluded that noke testimony and the absence of bank records documenting john moran timely disclosure of his brokerage and profit arrangement could not sustain john moran convictions on the substantive bank fraud counts as the defense successfully had demonstrated defects in noke memory and work performance and in first american practices.the court further concluded that the government failed to show that nora moran participated in any vote on or otherwise facilitated the approval of the loans and that the evidence therefore was insufficient to sustain the verdicts convicting her of substantive bank fraud.the court did not consider an aiding and abetting theory of liability.finally,the court concluded that the government failure to prove the underlying substantive offenses was fatal to the conspiracy convictions of both morans.the government timely filed a notice of appeal on august.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final judgment of the district court pursuant to and and the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
standard and scope of review 
we review rule determinations de novo.united states carroll,cir.at both the trial and appellate level,a court must determine whether,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states,cir.under this formulation,a court considers all the evidence,direct and circumstantial,and resolves all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the verdict.carroll,at.thus,we do not weigh the credibility of the witnesses or assess whether the prosecution succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant innocence.united states,cir internal quotation indication omitted.accordingly,as long as the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record,it must stand.united states ortiz,cir.
we deal initially with the procedural issue attributable to the district court anchoring its analysis in the record as it existed at the end of the government.in this regard we hold that our review should encompass the record of the entire trial rather than being confined only to the direct evidence presented by the government.b permits a court to reserve deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal until after a jury renders its verdict if the court chooses to do so,when revisiting the motion it may consider only the record as it stood at the time it reserved its ruling 
the district court,however,denied rather than reserved its ruling on the morans initial rule motions with respect to counts one through three at the close of the government case.the morans then introduced evidence,and the government introduced additional evidence in rebuttal.at the close of trial,the morans again made rule motions on which the court did reserve its ruling,allowing it to act substantively on the motions after the jury returned its verdict.at that point the court could not act on the original motions for acquittal adjudicated after the government and thus was required to consider the full record when acting on the morans second motions for acquittal.
we are satisfied that simply by labeling its rule ruling as a reconsideration and reversal of its earlier rule ruling,the court could not relate back the time when it reserved its ruling on the motions made at the end of all the evidence to the point at which it denied the first motions for acquittal.after all,if it could do so it effectively would circumvent the explicit requirement in rule b that if a court reserves decision,it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.moreover,if the court could deny a motion for acquittal at the end of the government and then grant it on reconsideration,as a practical matter there would be no distinction between denying a motion for acquittal or reserving a ruling on it for either way the court subsequently could grant the motion on a static record.
bank fraud charges against john moran counts two and three 
to prove bank fraud under,the government must show that the defendants engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money by means of materially false statements or misrepresentations from a federally insured financial institution and,did so knowingly.united states kenrick,cir.en banc,cert.denied,d we have defined intent to defraud as an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.id.in general,ascertaining whether a scheme is fraudulent is measured in a particular case by determining whether the scheme demonstrated a departure from fundamental honesty,moral uprightness,or fair play and candid dealings in the general life of the community.united states brandon,cir quoting united states goldblatt,cir.we look to the entire circumstances of the defendants conduct and any inferences drawn therefrom as an indication of their intent.see id.at.furthermore,the bank need not be the immediate victim of the fraudulent scheme and need not have suffered actual loss so long as the requisite intent is established and the bank was exposed to a risk of loss.see united states barrett,cir see also united states,cir the government need not prove actual loss as a result of the scheme.we also note that each distinct execution of a scheme to defraud constitutes a separate indictable offense,for instance where,as here,the government charges that multiple and separate loans were obtained to finance multiple and separate real estate transactions.brandon,at.
considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict,we conclude that a jury well could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that john moran knowingly executed a scheme to defraud first american.as its closing attorney on the loans,he had a duty to represent its interests which,at the absolute nadir of potential discharge,required him to inform the bank that as the mortgage broker he stood to reap of any successfully borrowed amounts.see,united states de la mata,cir bank officials owe a fiduciary duty to the bank and its depositors,which obligates the avoidance of fraud,bad faith,usurpation of corporate opportunities,and united states silvano,cir.likewise,he was required to disclose his divergent profit stake in the projects that the loans financed there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that john moran was aware of his professional responsibilities but did not meet them.
noke,the loan officer who represented the bank in the transactions,testified that he did not recall john moran making any disclosures concerning his financial arrangement with puente and boersner.his lack of recollection is notable for two reasons circumstances where the bank closing attorney also functioned as a mortgage broker for and with the bank clients in the same transaction were rare,and the jury reasonably could have balanced this unusual circumstance against the fact that nothing about the loans stood out in noke mind insider arrangements of this nature typically triggered greater scrutiny and generated special paperwork.accordingly,the absence of bank records documenting john moran outside arrangements was another factor that the jury could take into account in concluding that he had concealed the details of his relationship with puente and boersner moreover,in contrast the government introduced insider loan records from june showing that elizabeth finnegan,a trustee of first american,disclosed her financial interest as a principal in american healthways,nightingale before a vote was taken to consider increasing the company line of credit.
the morans,particularly john moran,mounted three principal lines of attack against the government theory many of the bank records from the relevant time period were in disarray or missing noke testimony was undermined to the extent that he could not recall significant details about the transactions or participants in question and by the fact that nearly years had passed from the time that the loans were closed john moran testified that he had made the appropriate disclosures.the last fact is critical.though a criminal defendant by right may opt to testify,see rock arkansas,d,he does so at his or her own peril.see,united states dunnigan,d.
the government discredited john moran testimony that he had disclosed his finder fee from the november loan for which he also represented first american at closing by calling in rebuttal the loan officer involved who,like noke,did not recall john moran making any disclosure of a conflict of interest.that testimony,coupled with the unique vantage of the jury to assess john moran demeanor and make key credibility determinations concerning his veracity and attention to detail as measured against the lack of independent corroboration for his testimony,permitted the jury,on balance,to disbelieve john moran on the one hand and credit noke on the other irrespective of any gaps or arguable inconsistencies in noke testimony.see,united states romero,cir appellate court does not secondguess the jury decision to credit testimony which contains an inconsistency because it would usurp the jury role to reject its decision to believe or disbelieve a witness because of such inconsistencies 
inasmuch as a jury could conclude that john moran failed to disclose his broker relationship with puente and boersner and his interest in their projects,the record supports a conclusion that john moran refrained from making the disclosures knowingly,affirmatively,and with a clear motive to secure a financial windfall at the bank potential expense.as an attorney for first american,john moran was positioned uniquely to expedite the process by which puente and boersner could obtain financing for their development projects,for instance by bypassing conventional bureaucratic impediments to arrange critical meetings with bank loan officials and inspections of the properties.at the same time,as an experienced real estate attorney,john moran was well aware that disclosure of his dual,conflicting relationship with the loan principals and of his direct interest in the profits generated by their development projects could jeopardize his stake in the venture in fact,the considerable extent to which john moran stood to benefit from the loans in broker fees and of further probative of his motive to conceal facts that were potentially with respect to approval of the loans.
support for a conclusion that john moran deliberately and deceptively concealed material information is supplied also by the active steps he took to eliminate a paper trail connecting himself to the loans and thereby avert inquiry from bank officials.specifically,john moran recruited his wife to function as the only on the mdg trust which,being a massachusetts business trust,does not disclose as a matter of public record the identity of its beneficiaries.thus,john moran was not linked clearly to the entity.when puente and boersner created the boston commonwealth trust and the rutland square trust to collect the loan proceeds and take title to their properties,at john moran behest they designated mdg as a beneficiary.however,there were no signatures of anyone purporting to represent mdg on the documents setting up the two trusts.consequently,when a letter from an attorney for puente and boersner disclosed to first american that mdg was one of three beneficiaries of the trust that was taking title to the commonwealth avenue property,john moran was insulated because the bank did not have information linking him to mdg.to further maintain his anonymity with respect to mdg,john moran did not submit the customary settlement statements or any records regarding the trustees or beneficiaries of the mdg trust.see,united states cauble,cir considering defendant disregard for the bank routine practices relevant to intent to defraud.
in sum,there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that john moran concealed his financial arrangements with puente and boersner not as the product of a good faith,honest oversight but rather pursuant to an affirmative endeavor calculated to defraud first american.as the evidence supports the conclusion that john moran conduct rose to the level of a knowing scheme or artifice to defraud,the bank fraud convictions returned against him must be reinstated.
bank fraud charges against nora moran counts two and three 
we recognize that the government bank fraud case against nora moran was not as strong as that against john moran.in this regard it is not clear that at the january,meeting of first american board of directors,nora moran participated in a dispositive vote on the loans.though the government advanced a theory that a vote was taken to ratify the loans,it appears that the board as a mere formality a summary report of loans the executive committee had approved in december.moreover,it is not clear that the board of directors at that time had the power to reject the executive committee loan decisions.
nevertheless,the district court erred for two independent reasons when it granted nora moran a judgment of acquittal on counts two and three.to begin with,without regard for what transpired on january,a rational trier of fact could have found that nora moran,who admitted to ragalevsky and adams that she was aware of her husband outside dealings and arrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of the transactions at issue,chose not to disclose the conflicts to the appropriate bank officials in her capacity as bank director because she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to her husband and by extension to her should the loans be approved and feared that a disclosure would undermine the approval process.
moreover,there was significant evidence tending to establish nora moran knowing,active participation in the fraudulent scheme nora moran accompanied her husband,puente,boersner,noke,and a construction inspector to visit the project sites in november before the loan applications were submitted as proposals or approved a mere two days before the executive committee approved the loans,she signed the papers establishing the mdg trust which functioned as a repository for the interest in the profits generated by the development projects john moran secretary,elizabeth longo,ordinarily served as a trustee for his real estate transactions,suggesting that such a break from routine likely would have sparked a modicum of inquiry from nora moran as to the purpose for the formation of mdg john and nora moran shared financial matters,including filing joint tax returns and transferring funds between their separate business ventures and,nora moran was an astute real estate broker and bank director familiar with the affirmative duties of disclosure governing fiduciaries when confronted with bank transactions that affected them personally 
considered together,the foregoing facts justified a conclusion that nora moran knew of her husband stake in the outcome of the loans and understood that federal banking regulations,first american code of professional ethics,and her fiduciary status as a bank director required her to make the appropriate disclosures nevertheless she chose not to divulge the information to maintain the false impression that the loans were not tainted or suspect in any significant way.
we recognize,as emphasized by the district court,that nora moran conduct may not have directly induced first american to allocate the million in loans to puente and boersner or otherwise have influenced anyone involved in the lending process however,a finding that her conduct had such an impact was not required for a conviction of bank fraud in this case.see,kenrick,at actual reliance by the bank plainly ha s no place in the federal fraud statutes quoting neder united states,d.nor,as nora moran suggests is the case,could the evidence establish only that she breached nothing more than a fiduciary duty owed to first american which conduct,standing alone,purportedly can not constitute bank fraud as a matter of law rather,the evidence supported a conclusion that nora moran knowingly executed the scheme to defraud first american through her deceptive acts for example,signing the trust documents for the entity holding the profit interest and omissions deliberately concealing information that might have delayed or terminated the loan review process and therefore was a sufficient basis on which the jury could convict her for bank fraud.
alternatively,these facts make out the essential elements of aiding and abetting liability for bank fraud thus,even if nora moran did not execute or attempt to execute the scheme,there was sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that she willfully aided and abetted john moran fraud by associating herself with his venture and seeking by her actions to make it succeed.see see also united states,cir.furthermore,the evidence was sufficient on which to premise nora moran culpable state of mind for aiding and abetting liability to the extent that she consciously shared her husband knowledge of the underlying criminal scheme and intended to participate in it for the purpose of bringing about financial gain.
conspiracy charges against john and nora moran count one 
finally,we find that the government offered sufficient evidence to convict both morans of the conspiracy to commit bank fraud under.as we elaborated previously,the evidence supported a conclusion that the morans agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud first american for the common goal of personal pecuniary gain knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy,and took at least one affirmative overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.see,at.accordingly,the jury verdict on the conspiracy count must be reinstated 
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgments of acquittal,reinstate the convictions on counts one,two,and three,and remand the case to the distric
