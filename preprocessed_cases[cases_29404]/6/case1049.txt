plaintiff conseil alain aboudaram,caasa,a swiss corporation,sued jacques de groote,a belgian national,claiming that de groote failed to repay caasa for loans the corporation made to him under a pair of promissory notes.de groote asserted that it was he and not caasa who was owed money.he filed counterclaims alleging that caasa failed to pay him for consulting work he performed for the corporation.although a jury sided with caasa on both its claim and de groote counterclaims,the district court overturned the verdict as to the former.we affirm the district court decision in all respects.
caasa is a swiss corporation owned principally by alain aboudaram and his family.it offers financial advisory services to a range of commercial and governmental clients.de groote is a belgian national and resident of the district of columbia,who once served as an executive director at the world bank.aboudaram and de groote met in and for several years had a mutually profitable relationship.de groote parlayed his extensive contacts in government and international finance into business opportunities for aboudaram,who in return aided de groote by helping him meet his personal financial obligations.aboudaram most important assistance to de groote was to loan him money so that he could avoid defaulting on the mortgage on his georgetown townhouse.both parties agree that aboudaram extended those loans in his personal capacity,and that de groote continues to owe aboudaram for them.
during the,de groote also forged a relationship with aboudaram corporation,caasa.through it,de groote gained more than this lawsuit.two aspects of that relationship form the basis of the present dispute.
the first,which underlies caasa breach of contract claim,involves two promissory notes pursuant to which caasa loaned money to de groote.each note was identical to the other in all relevant respects,except for its date and principal sum.the first note was dated december,and stated a principal sum of the second was dated october,and stated a principal sum of.see.in both,de groote agreed to pay on demand to the order of conseil alain aboudaram caasa the principal sum or,if less,the aggregate principal amount of all advances made hereunder by the lender to the borrower including advances made prior to the date hereof,outstanding at the time of such demand,together with interest at a set rate.both notes defined caasa as the lender,and de groote and his wife,collectively,as the borrower.id.the notes were to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york.id.at.each note was secured by a deed of trust on de groote georgetown townhouse.
caasa alleges that de groote borrowed extensively under the two notes and that he failed to repay those borrowings.not aboudaram de groote for breach of contract on january.when the case went to trial in early,the two sides offered the jury fundamentally different views of their dealings under the notes.aboudaram testified that he and de groote understood the promissory notes to cover not only caasa corporate loans to de groote,but aboudaram personal loans as well.for his part,de groote testified that the promissory notes covered only loans that caasa made to him,and did not include aboudaram personal advances.if aboudaram was correct that the promissory notes held by caasa applied to aboudaram personal loans,then caasa stood to recover more than in unpaid principal and interest.see caasa de groote,mem.op.at june.by contrast,if de groote was correct,then caasa stood to recover nothing,as caasa had loaned de groote only about under its own name and de groote had repaid it all.see id.at.
the other relevant aspect of the parties relationship,which underlies de groote counterclaims,involves consulting work that de groote performed for caasa.among the transactions that de groote alleges he worked on was caasa representation of skodaexport,a czech company that sought advice on obtaining a contract from the world bank to construct an oil pipeline in india.de groote claims to have completed several tasks for caasa on behalf of skodaexport,among them exploring the status of the project within the world bank,determining how much money the bank had earmarked for it,identifying skodaexport potential competitors,and introducing aboudaram to the bank official in charge of the project.
the parties stipulated that caasa received nearly million for its work on behalf of skodaexport.see mem.op.at june.they disputed,however,the amount of compensation owed to de groote.according to de groote,he and aboudaram orally agreed that caasa would pay de groote of the fees caasa earned from skodaexport,which would amount to almost million.caasa denied that it had agreed to pay de groote for his skodaexport work on a percentage basis and instead insisted that it had already compensated him on terms for individual services rendered.the parties agree that caasa did pay de groote at least million.see appellant br.appellee br.
before the case was submitted to the jury,de groote moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a against caasa breach of contract claim,contending that the plain language of the promissory notes did not encompass loans made by aboudaram in his personal capacity.the court reserved judgment on the motion in order to permit thorough briefing of the issue.the jury then returned verdicts in favor of caasa on both its claim and de groote counterclaims.thereafter,pursuant to rule b,de groote renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law against caasa claim.this time,the district court granted de groote motion,holding that the unambiguous language of the promissory notes between caasa and de groote causes them to extend only to debts between those two parties,debts that have already been repaid.mem.op.at june,
caasa filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.see caasa de groote,mem.op.at.at the same time,de groote filed a motion to sanction caasa for discovery abuses under federal rule of civil procedure,which the district court also denied.see id.the court then entered judgment for caasa as to de groote counterclaims and for de groote on caasa claim on the promissory notes.id.both parties filed timely notices of appeal.we consider caasa challenge in part ii and de groote in part iii.
caasa maintains that the district court erred in granting de groote judgment as a matter of law against caasa claim for breach of the promissory notes.we review that ruling de novo and may affirm only if we find that no reasonable jury could have reached a verdict in the plaintiff favor.holbrook reno.
as the district court noted,u nder new york law,the initial interpretation of a contract is a matter of law for the court to decide.mem.op.at june,quoting alexander alexander,v.these certain underwriters at lloyd,cir.included in this initial interpretation is the threshold question of whether the terms of the contract are ambiguous.alexander,at see omni quartz,cvs,cir curry road k mart,cir.and where the language and the inferences to be drawn from it are unambiguous,a district court may construe a contract as a matter of law and grant judgment accordingly.alexander,at emphasis omitted quoting cable science rochdale,cir.
we agree with the district court that t he stubborn,unavoidable fact at the root of this dispute is that the promissory notes,on their faces,cover only advances made hereunder by the lender to the borrower,and unequivocally define caasa as the lender.mem.op.at june,quoting first.am.compl.exs.a,b.the wording of the promissory by caasa own corporate no room for anything but a single interpretation that caasa alone is the lender under the notes.indeed,even caasa litigation counsel conceded that the phrase advances made hereunder by the lender is not ambiguous,and can only be read as covering advances made by the corporation.see oral arg.tr.at see also trial tr.at.
to circumvent the acknowledged clarity of the contractual language,caasa maintains that the district court should have considered extrinsic evidence,including the parties behavior before and after executing the promissory notes.such e
