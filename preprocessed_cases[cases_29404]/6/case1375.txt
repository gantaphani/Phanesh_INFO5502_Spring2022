a debtor violates the texas penal code if he removes,conceals,or sells secured property with intent to appropriate it in this case,a jury found that sam martin owed to first valley bank of los fresnos,and he admits he sold a substantial part of the collateral and kept the money for himself.
yet martin claims the bank maliciously prosecuted him by complaining to the authorities,who indicted him but later dismissed the charges.a cameron county judge and jury agreed,awarding martin more than million.the court of appeals affirmed,but reduced the damages award to million 
as a matter of law,we find no evidence that the bank procured the charge on which martin was indicted.while the bank might have handled its collection efforts differently,there was no evidence it exceeded the parties loan agreements.no credit system in the world can last long if creditors are punished for lawfully demanding their money back.accordingly,we reverse 
in march,sam martin renewed his loan at the bank for the ninth time,agreeing to pay principal of plus interest,and pledging all his livestock as security.thereafter,martin took a ranching job in colorado,where as he admitted at trial,i had an address up there,but it was a ranch house out in the middle of a ranch of about acres up in the mountains.when the loan came due in september and the bank demanded payment,martin told his son to tell them i will be there during the christmas holidays and renegotiate the loan with them.
unwilling to wait,the bank accelerated the note without notice,as the security agreement provided it could do.when martin returned to the area and deposited a check in his account,the bank offset it against his outstanding loan,again as the loan documents provided it could do.
irate at the bank actions,martin informed a bank officer i going to leave the bank and you will not hear from me again until that money is put back into my account.true to his word,from that time forward martin refused to speak with anyone at the bank,or to pay anything to the bank.
but he did hire an attorney in new mexico to advise the bank where their cattle was.the attorney sent a letter to the bank identifying three ranches where head were located.but the ranches were huge and the cattle wild,so only twenty could be rounded up.the bank sold these for a head and credited martin note 
unable to contact martin or locate the other cattle,the bank complained to the it had every right to do.a deputy sheriff investigated,and could not locate martin or the cattle either.he testified that the three ranches martin identified covered more than square miles of rough country and contained skittish cattle belonging to many owners,so those belonging to a particular owner could not be identified except by scouring the whole area and corralling them all.the deputy testified that the bank never told him that twenty cattle had been found,sold,and credited to martin account.
the deputy presented the results of his investigation to the district attorney office.although his report and the bank officer supporting affidavit focused solely on the collateral cattle that could not be found,martin was indicted for selling or disposing of secured property in violation of the following penal statute 
a person who is a debtor under a security agreement,and who does not have a right to sell or dispose of the secured property or is required to account to the secured party for the proceeds of a permitted sale or disposition,commits an offense if the person sells or otherwise disposes of the secured property,or does not account to the secured party for the proceeds of a sale or other disposition as required,with intent to appropriate as defined in chapter the proceeds or value of the secured property.a person is presumed to have intended to appropriate proceeds if the person does not deliver the proceeds to the secured party or account to the secured party for the proceeds before the day after the day that the secured party makes a lawful demand for the proceeds or account 
when martin returned to the area in march,he was arrested and released on bond.the charges were dropped a few months later 
taking each element of the statute in turn,martin admitted at trial that he 
is a debtor on an overdue note and in his own words i will not pay that note 
signed a security agreement requiring prior notice to the bank before selling calves,and written consent from the bank before selling other cattle 
sold head of cattle in january without the bank written consent and 
kept most of the proceeds 
these admissions establish all the objective elements of the crime.when the objective elements of a crime reasonably appear to have been completed,a private citizen has no duty to inquire whether the suspect has some alibi or explanation before filing charges accordingly,as a matter of law martin can not establish the absence of probable cause,as he must do to prove malicious prosecution 
the court of appeals found to the contrary for three reasons.first,the court of appeals found the evidence of malicious prosecution legally sufficient because the bank reported it could not find any of martin cattle,when in fact it had found and sold twenty but this statement was immaterial to the indictment that ultimately was indicted for the cattle he sold,not for cattle the bank found and sold.a person who knowingly provides false information to the grand jury or a law enforcement official who has the discretion to decide whether to prosecute a criminal violation can not be said to have caused the prosecution if the information was immaterial to the decision to prosecute.there was no evidence the bank made any false statement about martin sale,the only crime for which he was indicted.because the prosecution was only for the cattle martin sold,any false statements regarding other cattle were immaterial to it.
second,the court of appeals found the bank could be liable for failing to disclose material facts,even if it made no false statements we have expressly held that fair disclosure is relevant to malice and causation,but ha s no bearing on probable cause.once a citizen has probable cause to report a crime,there can be no malicious prosecution,even if the subsequent report fails to fully disclose all relevant facts as martin admitted the objective elements of the crime,he could not prove the bank lacked probable cause by pointing to omissions from its report.
finally,the court of appeals held the bank waived its lien on the cattle martin sold because a director of the bank helped move them for the sale.while recognizing that a director is usually not an agent of a corporation the court of appeals nevertheless held the director had apparent authority because of the bank ostensible acquiescence to the director involvement with martin loan.
this is wrong on several levels.first,apparent authority must be based on the acts of the principal there was no proof that the bank authorized this director to do anything on martin loan the only proof offered was martin testimony that he was,i sure,consulted when they when the loan is made,it has to go before the board of directors,unless it a real small loan,and they have to approve it.aside from the fact that this is pure speculation,it asserts no act by the bank that clothed the individual directors with apparent authority to act on their own toward outsiders.when a corporation directors vote at a meeting,that does not authorize them to act unilaterally on the corporation behalf indeed,the former is precisely the opposite of the latter.
second,apparent authority is limited to the scope of responsibility that is apparently authorized requiring bank directors to approve a loan on a record vote does not authorize them to orally release the collateral or forgive the debt.if apparent authority could do that,in many cases it would be an apparent violation of federal law 
third,there is no evidence the director ever waived any of the bank rights expressly martin asserts only an implied waiver.waiver may be implied only if the surrounding facts clearly demonstrate it there can be no waiver if the actor says and does nothing inconsistent with its rights bankers have every reason to help a debtor sell collateral at a good price,as long as the bank gets paid.even if the actions alleged here were authorized by the bank,they might imply approval of the sale,but give no indication whatsoever that the bank did not care what happened to the money.as a matter of law,there is no indication in the director actions of an intent to waive the bank security interest in the proceeds of martin sale 
martin asserts there was no probable cause to believe his sale of the head of cattle violated the penal code for a reason besides the alleged waiver.he maintained throughout the trial that he pledged only head of cattle,and could not have intended to impair the bank collateral as he had more than cattle somewhere in south texas after the sale.but every security agreement he signed there were nine in all stated that all his cattle were pledged as collateral 
the collateral shall consist of all the following described property and owner rights,title and interest in such property whether now owned or hereafter acquired by owner and wheresoever located 
all livestock now owned or hereafter acquired by debtor,wherever located including but not limited to head of crossbreed cattle.emphasis in original.
martin admitted he knew this is what the loan documents said 
martin claimed there was an oral agreement the loan would be secured by only head of cattle,pointing for support to a notice of the security interest and a appraisal.it is elementary that none of these could alter or amend the bank security agreement.no discussions or appraisal could survive the security agreements the parties actually signed nor could the notice to third parties amend the loan documents between the first two if security documents in texas mean what they say and no credit system can survive if they do not,as a matter of law martin pledged all his livestock.
to sum up,nothing the bank reported or failed to report caused the indictment relating to martin cattle sale.the documents martin signed required him to pay the loan when it came due,and assemble the cattle at the bank request if he did not he makes no apology for failing to do either.as a matter of law,martin owes the bank,not the other way around.
for the forgoing reasons,we reverse the court of appeals judgment,and remand to the trial court for entry of judgment in favor of the bank in accordance with the jury finding regarding martin debt to the bank 
the court today decides that sam martin failed to prove that there was an absence of probable cause in his lawsuit for malicious prosecution against first valley bank of los fresnos.i join the court opinion.alternatively,first valley contended that negligent conduct is insufficient to state a claim for malicious prosecution intentional conduct is required.the court does not reach that issue.first valley also raises a waiver issue that needs to be settled.martin asserts that the bank failed to preserve error on the question of whether malicious prosecution may be predicated on negligent conduct or only on intentional conduct because the bank did not follow the technical requirements of rule of the texas rules of civil procedure in objecting to the charge.i write to address this waiver issue.
martin sued first valley for negligence and misrepresentation arising from its efforts to collect a loan from him.martin claims that first valley provided an investigator with false information which the investigator turned over to the district attorney office.the district attorney office convened a grand jury which indicted martin for the crime of hindering a secured creditor collection efforts.see.e.after being cleared of the criminal charge on an apparent technicality,martin filed a civil action against first valley claiming the bank did not disclose to the investigator all material information.the civil case proceeded to trial.
after plaintiff rested,the trial court heard first valley motions for directed verdict.first valley argued that martin petition only alleged negligence and,because under texas law malicious prosecution is an intentional tort,it was entitled to a directed verdict.after the hearing,martin sought leave to file a third amended original petition,which for the first time alleged malicious prosecution.the trial court allowed the trial amendment over the objection of first valley that the amendment added an intentional tort in the middle of trial when the case had been tried solely on negligence.later that same afternoon,first valley submitted its requested jury instructions and questions.first valley proposed charge,set forth below,instructed the jury that malicious prosecution required intentional conduct.
do you find that first valley bank procured the criminal prosecution of sam martin 
you are instructed that a person procures a criminal prosecution if his actions were enough to cause the prosecution and,but for his actions,the prosecution would not have occurred.a person does not procure a criminal prosecution when the decision whether to prosecute is left to the discretion of another,including a law enforcement official or the grand jury,unless the person provides information which he knows is false.a criminal prosecution may be procured by more than one person.indus.lieck.
emphasis added.first valley requested submission included blanks at the bottom of the page labeled refused and modified as follows.the trial judge checked modified as follows,placed brackets around first valley procurement instruction,and signed the request.
the trial court held a formal charge conference the next morning.during the charge conference first valley objected to the question on malicious prosecution on no evidence grounds but did not reiterate its position that the procurement instruction was an incorrect statement of the law.the trial court overruled first valley evidentiary objection and presented the court charge to the jury.the court defined malicious prosecution such that it could be satisfied by either inadvertence or intentional conduct.
procurement means a person procures a criminal prosecution if his actions were enough to cause the prosecution,and but for his actions the prosecution would not have occurred.a person does not procure a criminal prosecution when the decision whether to prosecute is left to the discretion of another,including a law enforcement official or the grand jury,unless the person fails to fully and fairly disclose all material information known to him or knowingly provides false information.a criminal prosecution may be procured by more than one person.
emphasis added.this charge tracks the pattern jury charge.see comm.on pattern jury charges,state bar of,texas pattern jury negligence intentional personal torts pjc.
first valley argues that the trial court definition of procurement misstates the law and that its complaint is preserved because its request was marked modified as follows and signed in substantial compliance with rule.see civ.martin,on the other hand,argues that first valley failed to comply with rule which,to preserve asserted error,requires the phrase modified as follows stating in what particular the judge has modified the same and given,and exception allowed to be included by the trial judge in his order modifying a proposed submission.see id.therefore,martin claims that error is waived.i believe that first valley preserved its complaint and that rule does not govern preservation of charge error in this case.rule applies.
texas rules of civil procedure through govern preservation of error in the jury charge.traditionally,the manner of preserving charge error too often created technical traps through procedures that elevated form over substance.through rule changes and opinions,we have endeavored to focus appellate review on substantive issues and simplify the procedures for error preservation.in,in state department of highways public transportation payne,the court took a significant step forward in this process by holding that in some cases a request can serve as an objection sufficient to preserve error in a jury charge.we explained that t here should be but one test for determining if
