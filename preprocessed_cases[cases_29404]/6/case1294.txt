background 
according to the statement by domestic stock corporation filed in the trial court,walt zacharias is the sole officer and director of elite an electrical contracting firm.he opened a checking account with wells in september,presenting documentation of his status as the sole corporate officer and stockholder.
in november,defendant zinnel opened two wells accounts in elite name with herself as the signatory.she had presented wells with the purported minutes of a shareholders meeting at which steve zinnel,her son,was the only person present that authorized her actions.she deposited a cashier check from north valley precision products for 
in february,zacharias contacted wells to contest defendant zinnel authority to open the two accounts.he told wells that he was the sole shareholder of elite,and steve zinnel did not have authority to act on elite behalf as a majority stockholder.in a letter on march,he directed wells to close the accounts because elite power company makes no claim to the funds in the accounts,elite power company hereby authorizes wells fargo bank to return the balance of the accounts to zinnel.
shortly thereafter,wells received a letter from derian eidson on behalf of her client,the majority stockholder in elite power,contesting the apparent decision of wells to place a hold on the funds in the accounts that defendant zinnel had opened.the attorney noted,there is a stockholder disagreement between the shareholders of elite power.however,wells fargo is not the trier of fact nor the unilateral holder of the funds.the letter directed wells to close the two accounts and mail cashier checks for the full balances payable to elite power,at the address of record on each account.
in its letter responding to attorney eidson,wells invoked its authority to freeze funds while investigating unauthorized activities on an account.although it had considered resorting to interpleader to resolve the claims of the elite factions,wells was now satisfied that zacharias had challenged only the authority of defendant zinnel to open the accounts in the name of elite,and was not making any claim personally or on behalf of elite to the funds themselves.therefore,wells would close the accounts and transfer the funds to defendant zinnel personal account an action no one had requested.however,because of an unrelated dispute between defendant zinnel and wells about an overdraft on a business account for which she was the sole signatory,wells would be placing a hold on part of the transferred funds.
wells then received a letter from ilene block on behalf of defendant zinnel contesting the hold on of the funds in defendant zinnel personal account for an overdraft in the account of a company for which she did not have any personal liability.attorney block demanded that wells allow defendant zinnel to withdraw the full amount of the funds from the closed elite account in the form of a cashier check payable to elite.in letters in april,attorney block directed wells to close all four of her client accounts and make the balances of three accounts payable in the form of cashier checks to defendant zinnel,with the proceeds of the fourth account to be payable in cash in a subsequent june letter,attorney block now with a law firm again criticized wells for placing funds that did not belong to defendant zinnel in her personal account and then putting a hold on these funds despite the disclaimer of zacharias to any interest in them in connection with an unrelated overdraft for which she was not liable.
in its response,wells claimed it could not release funds to defendant zinnel that she admitted did not belong to her.the letter did not explain why this rationale did not apply to the balance of the original funds above the frozen that happened to represent the unrelated overdraft liability.
on behalf of elite,attorney block law firm filed an arbitration complaint against wells in august pursuant to the arbitration agreement for the elite account that defendant zinnel had opened.it alleged that an overdraft occurred on a company account for which defendant zinnel provided accounting services but in which she had no personal interest.as a result of a dispute between the majority elite shareholder,alleged to be steve zinnel,and the minority elite shareholder,alleged to be zacharias,wells had closed the elite account.despite the disclaimer of zacharias of any claim to the funds and the direction from steve zinnel through counsel apparently attorney eidson to make the funds payable to elite,wells placed the funds in defendant zinnel personal account and then placed a hold on the account in an amount coinciding with the outstanding unrelated overdraft.as neither defendant zinnel nor the company owing the overdraft made any claim to the funds,elite demanded their return.
in september,attorney block law firm sent a letter to wells opposing any attempt at filing an interpleader complaint in response to the arbitration.the letter asserted that the dispute was solely between wells and elite,as neither defendant zinnel nor zacharias made any claim to the funds.the letter demanded immediate return of the funds to elite.
claiming to be subject to conflicting demands because there were two groups purporting to act on behalf of elite,wells then filed the present action immediately thereafter.it did not deposit the funds with the court on its own,subd.c,but moved for an order directing their deposit,discharging it from the action,and requesting about for the reimbursement of reasonable costs and legal fees.attorney block law firm responded with a letter confirming that neither of the zinnels claimed the funds,and asserting that it would be satisfactory to its client,elite,for wells to send a cashier check for the funds payable to defendant zinnel.
wells continued the hearing on its motion several times during settlement discussions.the proposed settlement,in which elite would dismiss its pending arbitration,steve zinnel would hold wells harmless,and wells would pay the funds to defendant zinnel,ultimately foundered despite agreement of all parties that the funds could be paid to defendant zinnel.attorney eidson reappeared on behalf of defendant zinnel,denied that she presently represented steve zinnel in any capacity,asserted that attorney block law firm was defendant zinnel former counsel but no longer represented any party,and filed an answer to the complaint along with an opposition to the pending motion in which she contested the appropriateness of interpleader because wells was not a disinterested holder and there were no competing claims to the funds,and thus wells also was not entitled to an award of costs and legal fees.the attorney representing zacharias in the settlement discussions filed an opposition to the motion on behalf of elite disclaiming any interest in the funds.steve zinnel sent a letter to wells disclaiming any interest in the funds for himself or elite or any objection to distribution of the funds to defendant zinnel.
the court gray,denied the motion in january.at the hearing,the court faulted wells for moving the original funds from one account to another and then putting a hold on part of th
