this appeal arises out of a suit by defaulting borrowers who seek to assign fault to the manner in which a creditor foreclosed on its collateral,in this instance a dollar home located on martha vineyard.for the following reasons,we reject the borrowers fusillade of challenges to the creditor conduct,except that we find that the creditor waived its rights to a deficiency judgment by failing to comply with a massachusetts statute that regulates the availability of actions for such judgments.
background 
we summarize the uncontested facts,reserving further discussion of the facts alleged in the complaint for the section on the motion to dismiss and further discussion of the evidentiary facts in the summary judgment record for the section on the motion for summary judgment.
on november,the plaintiffs,mark and jenny galvin,took out a loan to buy a property in tisbury,massachusetts,and executed a mortgage naming the mortgage electronic registration systems,mers as the mortgagee acting solely as a nominee for chevy chase bank,fsb and its successors and assigns.on the same day,mark galvin executed a promissory note in the amount of to chevy chase bank,fsb now known as capital one,for our purposes,capital one.in late,the galvins fell behind on their mortgage payments.on march,their loan servicer,specialized loan servicing sls,sent them a notice of default and notice of intent to foreclose.
at some point prior to august,bank as trustee relating to chevy chase funding,llc mortgage back certificates series bank came into physical possession of the note,which was indorsed from chevy chase bank,to bank,as trustee.in july,mers assigned the mortgage to bank.on october,this assignment was recorded in the town land records.
from december to november,employees of a company hired by sls entered onto the galvins property roughly once per month to perform inspections.in february and november,these individuals entered the house to inspect and winterize it.during the november interior inspection,they also changed the lock on the rear door.on september,the galvins sent sls a letter demanding that no one trespass on their property.on april,the galvins sent a demand letter to bank regarding these unreasonable inspections and any related fees,pursuant to chapter of the massachusetts general laws.
bank conducted a foreclosure sale of the property on november,four days after the galvins filed their complaint in this action.bank itself was the purchaser.
the galvins complaint contained six counts relevant to this appeal a claim against all defendants for a declaratory judgment that the foreclosure was invalid count i a claim against bank and mers for breach of contract count ii a claim against bank and mers for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing count iii a claim against bank for trespass count iv a claim against bank for a chapter violation count vi and a claim against all defendants for intentional negligent infliction of emotional distress count vii.bank filed an answer and asserted counterclaims for deficiency,unjust enrichment,and possession.
the district court disposed of the galvins complaint in three separate rulings.in the first ruling,the district court granted the defendants partial motion to dismiss several counts under federal rule of civil procedure b.in the second ruling,it granted summary judgment to bank on its counterclaim for possession.the district court entered a separate judgment the first judgment on this counterclaim for possession pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in the third ruling,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the galvins remaining claims and to bank on its counterclaim for deficiency the second judgment between the ruling on the partial motion to dismiss and the ruling on the counterclaim for possession,the district court granted in part bank motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoin ed and prevent ed the short term occupancies of fourteen parties who had entered into leases with the galvins to occupy their home during the summer of.
ii.discussion 
we review the motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment rulings de novo,see gorski dep t of,cir,and the grant of the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,see waldron george weston bakeries,cir.the parties agree that we apply massachusetts substantive law.see wilson hsbc mortg,cir.
appellate jurisdiction 
although neither party raised this issue,we have an independent obligation to confirm our jurisdiction to hear this dispute.me.med.ctr.burwell,cir.the district court had jurisdiction over this case under based on diversity of citizenship.the only arguable basis for our jurisdiction over these appeals is,which grants this court jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.see also,cir.noting that i n the ordinary course,our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from final decisions of the district courts quoting.thus,we must determine whether the second judgment entered by the district court was a final decision.when dealing with a civil judgment like this one,a final decision is one that disposes of all claims against all parties.me.med,at quoting bos.prop.exch.transfer iantosca,cir.there are three defendants in this action bank,mers,and capital one.we pause to consider whether the second judgment was a final decision as to capital one.
the record is somewhat ambiguous on this point.all three defendants were named in the original complaint filed in state court.in the notice of removal,bank and mers noted that capital one had not provided consent to removal because,as far as the state court docket showed,the plaintiffs had not served it with process.after the case was removed to federal court,capital one never filed an appearance.the district court noted this fact in its ruling on the partial motion to dismiss.following that ruling,the parties filed a joint statement pursuant to local rule d,in which they stated that according to the court docket,it does not appear that defendant capital one,capital one bank,chevy chase bank,fsb capital one has yet been served with the complaint.the district court subsequently ordered that amended pleadings joinder of parties would be due by,but that date passed without action or comment.
two counts in the complaint named capital one as a defendant the declaratory judgment count count i and the intentional infliction of emotional distress count count vii.the district court disposed of these counts at different times.it dismissed the declaratory judgment count in its entirety when ruling on the partial motion to dismiss.it dismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress count as to mers only in the same ruling.the district court later allowed bank motion for summary judgment as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress count and instructed the clerk of court to close the case.
we conclude that the court disposed of both claims against capital one.the ruling dismissing the declaratory judgment count was not limited to the two defendants who had appeared.the ruling on bank motion for summary judgment is a closer question.however,in granting that motion and ordering the clerk to close the case,the district court effectively granted summary judgment to capital one on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against it.between that ruling and the ruling on the partial motion to dismiss,the district court held that the factual basis for the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against capital one was insufficient as a matter of law neither party contended otherwise in the district court or on appeal.the district court order and its instruction to the clerk to close the case therefore constituted a final decision.see mohawk,carpenter,a final decisio n is typically one by which a district court disassociates itself from a case.alteration in original quoting swint chambers cty.comm n,having concluded that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we proceed to the merits.
motion to dismiss 
the galvins challenge the district court dismissal of the counts for declaratory judgment,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent infliction of emotional distress as to mers,and intentional infliction of emotional distress as to mers.we review these decisions under the usual rule b standard.setting aside any statements that are merely conclusory,we construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the party to determine if there exists a plausible claim upon which relief may be granted.woods wells fargo bank,cir.
declaratory judgment of invalid foreclosure all defendants 
on appeal,the galvins advance two arguments as to why the foreclosure on their property was invalid.first,they argue that bank lacked standing to foreclose because it did not own both the note and the mortgage at the time of foreclosure.second,they argue that bank could not exercise the statutory power of sale because it had failed to adhere strictly to the terms of the mortgage,in particular paragraph.
under massachusetts law,the note and the mortgage are separate legal instruments and,under the common law,they can travel separately.see eaton fed.mortg.ass n.however,where a note has been assigned but there is no written assignment of the mortgage underlying the note the holder of the mortgage holds the mortgage in trust for the purchaser of the note,who has an equitable right to obtain an assignment of the mortgage.bank ass ibanez,citing barnes boardman.
the note and mortgage may be transferred using different legal mechanisms.the note may be transferred by indorsement and delivery.eaton,at.the massachusetts appeals court has applied the provisions of the uniform commercial code ucc to the transfer of a mortgage note.see first bank of cape cod adams hoosac sav.bank.app.eaton,at reserving borrower argument based on the ucc,but noting that the court perceive d nothing in the ucc inconsistent with its view that in order to effect a valid foreclosure,a mortgagee must either hold the note or act on behalf of the note holder.by contrast,the mortgage is an interest in land,which for our purposes can only be transferred by written assignment.see.laws ch,ibanez,at.although assignments may be recorded,a valid assignment of a mortgage gives the holder of that mortgage the statutory power to sell after a default regardless whether the assignment has been recorded.ibanez,at.
in this case,as in many others,the mortgage names mers as the mortgagee acting solely as a nominee for the lender and the lender successors and assigns.
mers is mortgagee of record for mortgage loans registered on its system,which tracks servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in those loans w hen the beneficial interest in a loan is sold,the note is transferred by indorsement and delivery between the parties,and the new ownership interest is reflected in the mers system.mers remains the mortgagee of record so long as the note is sold to another mers member no aspect of such a transaction is publicly recorded.
eaton,at.although mers holds mortgages as a nominee,mers has the authority to assign the mortgage without authorization from the holder of the note.sullivan kondaur capital.app,denied.
massachusetts is a nonjudicial foreclosure state,so banks generally foreclose by exercising the statutory power of sale.see.laws ch.laws ch,pinti emigrant mortg.in order to exercise this statutory power of sale,the bank must satisfy a number of requirements.two of these requirements are relevant here.first,the foreclosing bank must hold both the note and the mortgage in order to have standing to sell the property at a foreclosure sale.see eaton,at,ibanez,at citing.laws ch.laws ch.if it does not,the foreclosure is void.see galiastro mortg.registration,eaton,at ibanez,at second,the foreclosing bank must strictly comply with the default notice provisions in paragraph of the mortgage.pinti,at.again,failure to do so renders the foreclosure void.id.at 
when borrowers challenge an entity standing to foreclose,they often assert defects in the chain of mortgage assignments that ends with that entity.under massachusetts law,the borrowers themselves have standing to press such challenges to the validity of a mortgage assignment when a defect renders the assignment void,but not when it renders the assignment merely voidable by one of the parties to the assignment.see bank of mellon wain.app.sullivan,at see also culhane aurora loan servs.of,cir.
whether bank was holder of the note and mortgage 
the galvins argue that they adequately pled that bank lacked standing to foreclose because it did not hold both the note and the mortgage at the time of the foreclosure sale.they pled a number of different bases for this argument,but advance just three on appeal the initial mortgage and all subsequent assignments of the mortgage were invalid because paragraph of the mortgage did not allow it to be held and assigned separately from the note mers could not hold the mortgage or assign the interest in the mortgage because doing so violated its internal rules of membership,and therefore the assignment to bank was invalid and bank does not hold the note because it was indorsed to bank as trustee without specifying the trust.the district court ruled that these allegations could not establish that bank lacked standing to foreclose as a matter of law.we agree.
the galvins first argument points to paragraph of the mortgage,which states that t he note or a partial interest in the note together with this security instrument can be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower.the galvins contend that this language restricted the bank ability to transfer the note without the mortgage.on two prior occasions,however,we have rejected this reading of materially identical language in similar mortgages.see mills bank,na,cir.culhane,at.this court noted in culhane that the role paragraph appears to serve is to allow the bank to sell the note without telling the borrower,not to place restrictions on the bank ability to transfer the note.at.
even if we were not bound by this precedent,we would reach the same conclusion.the most the galvins can show is that this isolated section of paragraph is ambiguous,but whatever ambiguity may exist vanishes when one reads the contract as a whole.as in mills and culhane,from the very beginning of this loan,the note and mortgage were held by different parties.the mortgage indicates as much.under massachusetts law,contract language is not ambiguous when one of the two possible readings conflicts with other provisions of the contract.see starr fordham,a n interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.quoting restatement second of contracts a am.law inst.
the galvins second argument based on mers rules of membership fares little better.the galvins alleged that mers violated its internal rules of membership by holding and then assigning their mortgage because chevy chase bank,fsb,and the series trust are not mers members.therefore,they claim,the assignment of the mortgage to bank as trustee was void.the district court ruled that a failure by mers to adhere to its internal rules of membership might make the assignment voidable by a mers member but does not make it void.thus,under wain,the galvins lack standing to challenge the assignment.see wain,at a mortgagor standing i s limited to claims that a defect in the assignment rendered it void,not merely voidable.
the district court was correct.this court has already noted that,under massachusetts law,a similar type of infirmity makes a contract voidable,not void.see wilson hsbc mortg,cir.w hen a corporate officer acts beyond the scope of his authority,his acts in excess of his authority,although voidable by the corporation,legally could be ratified and adopted by it.alteration omitted quoting comm r of banks tremont tr.under massachusetts law,as long as the assignor is the record holder of the mortgage at the time of the assignment,as mers was here,an assignment that complies with the statute governing mortgage assignments.laws ch,can not be shown to be void.wain,at see also wilson,at an assignment binding on the assignor is not,by definition,void.although in the district court the galvins initially challenged whether section had been satisfied,they later abandoned that contention and have not argued it on appeal.under wain and wilson,this proves fatal to their argument that the assignment is void because the galvins allegations establish,at most,that mers assignment of the mortgage was voidable by a mers member,the galvins have failed to demonstrate that they have standing to challenge the assignment.see wain,at sullivan,at see also culhane,at.
finally,the galvins third argument fails in light of the ucc.they argue that if the original note in bank possession is indorsed to bank as trustee,then this indorsement is insufficient to grant holder status to the foreclosing entity,which is bank as trustee relating to chevy chase funding,llc mortgage back certificates series.the ucc defines special indorsement in a way that includes this indorsement to bank as trustee and states that the principles in chapter,section apply to special indorsements.see.laws ch,a.under those principles,
t he person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person,whether or not authorized,signing as,or in the name or behalf of,the issuer of the instrument.the instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person.
id.a.the galvins have not alleged that the signer of the indorsement,an assistant vice president of chevy chase bank,fsb,did not intend to indorse the note to bank as trustee relating to chevy chase funding,llc mortgage back certificates series.they have thus failed to state a claim that this indorsement was inadequate.
whether the default notice complied with paragraph 
the galvins also argue that the march,notice of default failed to comply with paragraph of the mortgage,and,therefore,the foreclosure was void.see pinti,at.but see id.at applying the newly announced rule prospectively only murphy,at.they alleged in their complaint that the notice failed to comply with paragraph in five ways it failed to identify the lender or owner of the note it falsely stated sls was the creditor it was not from the lender it stated the total amount due without breaking it down and the servicer who sent the notice,sls,did not send the galvins a breakdown of an alleged in fees or other information about the loan upon request.
we consider only the last of these arguments,as it is the only one the galvins briefed on appeal.this court does not permit parties to incorporate by reference arguments they made in memoranda filed in the district court.see sleeper farms agway,cir.t his court will only consider arguments made before this court everything else is deemed forfeited.this rule that a party appealing a decision must explain to us why the decision is wrong,rather than merely pointing to what it said before the decision was even issued,applies with particular force where one of the arguments the party attempts to incorporate by reference involves an unsettled question of law 
that leaves the galvins briefed argument that there was a violation of paragraph because sls failed,on request,to provide them with a breakdown of more than in fees and costs assessed to their loan account as well as proof of who owned their loan.this argument can not succeed,since paragraph does not require either the lender or the servicer to respond to such a request 
breach of contract bank and mers 
the galvins alleged in their complaint that bank and mers breached the mortgage contract by failing to comply with the terms of the mers mortgage including but not limited to complying with applicable law as defined in the mortgage and the requirements of paragraph s and before defaulting.in the section of their brief addressing the breach of contract claim,they do not offer any additional argument as to how paragraphs and were breached,so this allegation does not succeed for the reasons stated above.the allegation that the defendants failed to comply with applicable law does not specify the law with which the defendants allegedly failed to comply or how they failed to comply with it.such an allegation is too vague and conclusory to state a claim for which relief can be granted.see freeman town of hudson,cir.in order to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must include enough detail to provide a defendant with fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.quoting ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing bank and mers 
the district court dismissed the count for violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.on appeal,the galvins argue that the district court treated this claim as premised only on bank failure to consider them for a loan modification,when in fact their complaint listed a number of additional bases,including trespassing,unlawful lockouts,violations of both the mortgage and applicable law,assessments of unreasonable fees,costs,and expenses,and violations of chapter.their brief does not,however,go on to make any developed argument about how these other acts constituted violations of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.it cites no cases or legal authority and makes no attempt to explain how these other acts would have the effect of destroying or injuring the ir right to receive the fruits of the contract.weiler portfolioscope,citation omitted.this conclusory assertion in the guise of an argument is waived.see ryan royal ins.of,cir.it is settled in this circuit that issues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some developed argumentation,are deemed to have been abandoned.
negligent infliction of emotional distress all defendants 
the galvins challenge the dismissal of their negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against all defendants.however,they do not argue that the district court erred in dismissing their negligence count or otherwise argue that they pled negligence adequately.negligence is an element of negligent infliction of emotional distress under massachusetts law.see rodriguez cambridge hous.thus,the galvins have abandoned an argument that was essential to maintaining this claim.
intentional infliction of emotional distress mers 
the galvins argue that their intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against mers should not have been dismissed because mers took extreme and outrageous actions by not following its own rules of membership when dealing with their mortgage.
to make out a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress,the plaintiffs were required to show that the defendant intended,knew,or should have known that his conduct would cause emotional distress that the conduct was extreme and outrageous that the conduct caused emotional distress and that the emotional distress was severe.
polay mcmahon.the standard for making a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is very high.id.quoting doyle hasbro,cir.there is no liability even if the defendant acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal,with malice,or with a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort.id.citations omitted.not even an inten t to inflict emotional distress is sufficient.id.citation omitted.conduct qualifies as extreme and outrageous only if it go es beyond all possible bounds of decency,and is regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.a judge may grant a motion to dismiss where the conduct alleged in the complaint does not rise to this level.id.at alterations in original citations omitted quoting roman trs.of tufts.on its face,mers alleged sloppiness in dotting i and crossing t under its own rules of membership by allegedly acting as nominee mortgagee for a does not meet this standard as a matter of law.
preliminary injunction 
the galvins argue that the district court abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.their argument,however,is premised in part on a misunderstanding of the effect of that injunction.they argue at length that the district court should not have ordered them to transfer any rental payments they had received for their property to bank.the docket reveals,though,that the preliminary injunction did no such thing.
their second argument,that the district court should not have enjoined them from renting out the property in the future,is now moot.the district court granted bank motion for summary judgment as to possession,and the galvins subsequently agreed to vacate the property.the galvins do not challenge the grant of summary judgment in favor of bank on its possession counterclaim and we have affirmed the dismissal of the declaratory judgment count above.the galvins do not argue that they have a right to rent out the property in the present circumstances,where they are no longer in possession and the foreclosure sale has not been ruled void.these developments moot this aspect of the appeal.see cmm cable,ocean coast,cir.it has been common ground throughout the last century that an appeal,although live when taken,may be rendered moot by subsequent developments.
motion for summary judgment 
the galvins challenge the summary judgment rulings in favor of the defendants on the galvins claims for trespass,violation of chapter,and intentional infliction of emotional distress as to bank and capital one,and on bank counterclaim for deficiency.as usual,the court reviews these decisions de novo,drawing all inferences in favor of the galvins as the parties.see frangos bank of,cir.
trespass bank 
the galvins complaint alleged that bank and its agents trespassed on their property by going onto it multiple times between december and november,despite the galvins request that they not do so,and by locking them out of the property on two occasions when they entered the house and changed the locks.on summary judgment,the district court ruled that the mortgage permitted the bank and its agents to engage in these activities and that therefore they had not committed a trespass.after considering the summary judgment record,we affirm.
the mortgage contains two provisions that bear on this dispute.the relevant portion of paragraph reads 
lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the property.if it has reasonable cause,lender may inspect the interior of the improvements on the property.lender shall give borrower notice at the time of or prior to such an interior inspection specifying such reasonable cause.
the relevant portion of paragraph reads 
if borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this security instrument then lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect lender interest in the property and rights under this security instrument,including protecting assessing the value of the property,and securing repairing the property.securing the property includes,but is not limited to,entering the property to make repairs,change locks,replace or board up doors and windows,drain water from pipes,eliminate building or other code violations or dangerous conditions,and have utilities turned on or off.any amounts disbursed by lender under this section shall become additional debt of borrower secured by this security instrument.
the galvins agree that if these paragraphs permitted bank to take the actions it took,then their claim for trespass can not succeed.they also do not contest that all of the challenged actions occurred after the default on the mortgage,and that therefore the fail ure to perform condition in paragraph was satisfied.they argue,however,that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether bank entries were reasonable or appropriate,and thus permitted by the mortgage,and that the district court should not have determined that the entries were reasonable as a matter of law.if the entries were not reasonable,they were not permitted by the mortgage,and thus constituted trespass.see new england box c r constr,to support an action of trespass it is necessary to prove the actual possession of the plaintiff,and an illegal entry by the defendant.alteration in original citation omitted.a jury might find the inspections unreasonable,say the galvins,because of their frequency,the occasional occupancy of the house,the lack of written notice,and the changing of the locks.
we disagree.to begin,inspections occurred less than once per month.the record shows that over the course of months between december and november,inspections occurred.of the inspections,were or inspections,conducted without entering the house from through,the galvins occupied the property only in the late spring through early fall.ten of the inspections occurred after november and before march in to and two occurred during that period of,when the galvins were unlikely to be home.that leaves fourteen inspections during the remaining months in the period.
inspections of this frequency were reasonable as a matter of law.the house was a substantial asset,having been purchased for over million.it was unoccupied much of the year.during the time the inspections were conducted,the owners had been in default for between two and five years.the galvins did not present any evidence tending to show that the bank acted unreasonably in performing exterior inspections in these circumstances.for instance,they offered no evidence to show that this periodic diligence was out of keeping with industry norms or that it was performed in an unreasonable manner.
a reasonable jury also could not find that the galvins occupancy,the lack of written notice,or the changing of the locks rendered the inspections unreasonable in these circumstances.the mortgage does not require the mortgagee to rely on the defaulting owners assertions that the house remains in good condition.indeed,it explicitly grants the mortgagee additional rights to enter onto the property after a default.the mortgage also imposes no duty on the bank to give written notice of an upcoming inspection.as to the locks,the evidence indicates that the inspectors entered the house and changed the locks on two occasions on february,and on november,when they entered the house to weatherize it.during the november inspection,the inspectors replaced the lock on the rear door.the record does not indicate which lock the inspectors replaced during the february inspection,but sls policy is to replace the lock on the side or back door.the galvins offer no evidence that this policy was not followed entering a seasonally occupied house to weatherize it before or during the winter when the owners are not home is unambiguously permitted by paragraph,which allowed the bank to enter the property to make repairs and change locks as part of its broader power to do whatever was reasonable or appropriate to protect its interest in the property,including securing repairing the property.making one such entry per winter,the february entry for the winter of and the november entry for the winter of,is reasonable as a matter of law.
the galvins argue that the assessment of reasonableness is nevertheless always a question for the jury,not a question of law.massachusetts law in a closely analogous context is not so absolute.when a contract does not specify a time for performance,the law implies a contract term providing for performance in a reasonable period of time.what amount of time is reasonable is often a jury question,but it becomes a question of law at the extremes.see flagship cruises,new england merchs.bank of,cir.the reasonableness of a period of time except as to extremes would seem to be a classic issue for the trier of fact.cataldo zuckerman.app.quoting flagship cruises see also marcus boston edison,on undisputed facts what is a reasonable time is a question of law.safety ins.app.same town of middleborough middleborough gas dep t.app.same plymouth port,smith.app.imputing a reasonable time term into an exclusive brokerage contract and determining that four years was not a reasonable time as a matter of law.
we think that flagship cruises states the correct rule in this context as well and conclude that this case falls into the extremes.even reading the record in the light most favorable to the galvins,we conclude that no reasonable jury could deem the inspection activity to exceed the express license granted by the mortgage.thus,the galvins trespass claim fails as a matter of law.
finally,the galvins have not cited any authority for the proposition that after the foreclosure sale,when the bank owned the property,its agents could still commit a trespass.the case and statute they do cite are inapposite.see in re prichard plaza assocs,bankr.addressing whether foreclosing bank had the right to collect rents while out of possession.laws ch,until default in the performance or observance of the condition of a mortgage of real estate,the mortgagor may hold and enjoy the mortgaged premises.this argument is therefore waived.see ryan,at.
chapter violation bank 
the district court granted summary judgment on the galvins chapter claim against bank because it was derivative of the trespass claim,the grant of summary judgment on which we have affirmed.the galvins argue on appeal that their chapter claim also rested independently on the allegation that bank assessed unreasonable fees for the inspections,and that the district court failed to address that aspect of the claim.
the galvins are correct that the portion of their complaint pleading a violation of chapter incorporated their april,demand letter,which mentioned fees for any unreasonable inspections and demanded damages.however,in their opposition to bank motion for summary judgment,the galvins did not point to any evidence that such fees had been assessed.likewise,on appeal,the galvins have not pointed to any evidence demonstrating that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether they were charged unreasonable fees for any inspections the documents to which they do point list charges assessed to the galvins account on november,two days after the foreclosure sale.the amounts of these charges do not match up with the evidence of the cost of the inspections.the galvins have provided no reason for a jury to believe that these charges were assessed for unreasonable inspections rather than legitimate expenses arising from the foreclosure sale.
by contrast,bank has pointed to evidence that it only charged the galvins account for a single inspection for winterizing the house and changing the lock on the rear door in november.bank has argued that this interior inspection,and the associated fee,was reasonable,but that nevertheless it is not seeking this as part of the deficiency judgment.
the fact that bank is not seeking the would not prevent the plaintiffs from recovering under chapter.see auto flat car crushers,hanover ins,to the extent that a plaintiff already has received compensation for its underlying loss prior to the resolution of its chapter claim,such compensation has been treated as an offset against any damages ultimately awarded,rather than as a bar to recovery.therefore,reaching the merits of the claim,we conclude that the single fee charged for inspection and weatherization of the property was not an unreasonable fee as a matter of law,as the inspection itself was reasonable and the assessment of fees for such an inspection is explicitly allowed by paragraph of the mortgage.we need not decide whether it would have been reasonable for the bank to assess more than one such fee in a period.accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the galvins chapter claim.
intentional infliction of emotional distress bank and capital one 
reading the record in the light most favorable to the galvins,as a matter of law none of bank activities meet the high standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress.entering the house twice to winterize it while the galvins were not there does not go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and it is not regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.roman,at citation omitted.neither is performing an exterior visual inspection of the premises less than once per month.as we have already discussed,the mortgage permitted these activities.
the district court did not separately address the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against capital one when it granted summary judgment.however,the galvins do not argue on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to capital one on this count.thus,they have waived any argument that the district court should not have granted summary judgment in favor of capital one.
bank counterclaim for deficiency 
the district court ruled that the galvins were obligated to pay the deficiency,and that bank had followed massachusetts law governing notices of intention to foreclose and seek a deficiency.laws ch,by sending the galvins a notice of its intent to foreclose and to seek a deficiency judgment in october.the galvins argue that bank has not shown that it complied with section because that statute also requires that a foreclosing entity sign and swear to an affidavit confirming the mailing of the notice within thirty days of the foreclosure sale.bank argues that it was not required to create this affidavit because the galvins actually received the notice or,at least,have not claimed otherwise.we conclude that the plain language of section requires reversal.
this issue turns on a question of statutory interpretation.section contains both a notice requirement and an affidavit requirement to be satisfied by a foreclosing mortgagee who might wish to receive a deficiency.the notice requirement specifies that a notice of intent to foreclose and a warning in a specified form must be mailed in a particular manner no less than days before the foreclosure sale to the person against whom the deficiency will be sought.the affidavit requirement is as follows 
no action for a deficiency shall be brought by the holder of a mortgage note or other obligation secured by mortgage of real estate after a foreclosure sale by him unless a notice in writing of the mortgagee intention to foreclose the mortgage has been mailed and an affidavit has been signed and sworn to,within thirty days after the foreclosure sale,of the mailing of such notice.s uch an affidavit made within the time specified shall be prima facie evidence in such action of the mailing of such notice.
id.although no massachusetts appellate court has definitively interpreted the affidavit requirement of this statute,the massachusetts appeals court opinions that have interpreted the statute notice requirement have uniformly held that the statute is to be interpreted strictly.see,carmel credit union bondeson.app.courts interpret a statute in accordance with its plain words.they may not add words to a statute that the legislature did not put there.citation omitted.in rejecting an argument that actual notice is sufficient to satisfy the notice provision of the statute,the appeals court has observed that t he statutory language of section is more than ordinarily prescriptive,and that c ompliance with the statute is not burdensome,since s ection goes so far as to set out texts of a form of notice and form of affidavit of notice that will satisfy the statute requirements.framingham sav.bank turk.app.see also bead portfolio,llc follayttar.app.holding that actual notice would not be adequate to comply with notice provision since the written notice was sent to the wrong address and substantially deviated from the statutory form carmel credit union,at approving turk and follayttar.the appeals court recently reaffirmed this strict construction of the statute in an unpublished decision.see bank of new england bp nantucket llc,table,wl,at.app.may,the defendants argue,understandably,that the requirements of section are meant to protect mortgagors and are to be strictly construed.
we see no reason to anticipate that massachusetts highest court would interpret the mandatory language of the affidavit requirement any less straightforwardly.bank can bring n o action for a deficiency unless an affidavit has been signed and sworn to,within thirty days after the foreclosure sale,of the mailing of the required notice.because bank admittedly signed and swore no such affidavit within that time period,its claim for a deficiency must fail.
to avoid this conclusion,bank points to a different statute.laws ch,which governs another affidavit requirement related to the statutory power of sale.in federal national mortgage association hendricks,the sjc relied upon longstanding precedent,see,gleason,burns thayer,field gooding,to state that a deficient section affidavit does not void a foreclosure sale or the right to possession and may be cured by extrinsic evidence that the power of sale was exercised properly and the foreclosure was valid.hendricks,at.instead,the failure to have a section affidavit merely deprives the foreclosing party of a tool that would be sufficient to prove its prima facie case.id.at.bank argues that we should therefore adopt an analogous conclusion,that the section affidavit is just a tool to make bank proof easier.and there is indeed a district court opinion seemingly accepting such an argument.see santander bank,ass sturgis,wl,at.
we do not agree that the interpretation of section controls the interpretation of section.section is itself entirely silent concerning the ramifications of not sending a section notice.at the time of hendricks,it read 
the person selling,or the attorney duly authorized by a writing or the legal guardian or conservator of such person,shall,after the sale,cause a copy of the notice and his affidavit,fully and particularly stating his acts,or the acts of his principal or ward,to be recorded in the registry of deeds for the county or district where the land lies 
laws ch.the fact that the sjc fashioned a remedy in the face of legislative silence offers no reason to think that it would fashion an analogous remedy in the face of an express legislative mandate that n o action for a deficiency shall be brought.laws ch.we conclude,instead,that n o action for a deficiency shall be brought.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the entry of judgment in favor of bank on its deficiency claim in the amount of.we otherwise reject the appeal and affirm the challenged rulings of the district court each party shall bear its own costs.
the galvins complaint alleges that bank does not,and never has had,have sic physical possession of the original note,and that t he location of the original note is unknown and it is denied that any party lawfully acting on behalf of bank currently holds the note on bank behalf in compliance with applicable law.the galvins abandoned this contention at oral argument.
bank does not dispute on appeal that sls acted as its agent,or that the entries of the company hired by sls to perform inspections can be attributed both to sls and to bank.
bank,as trustee relating to chevy chase funding,llc mortgage back certificates series,mers,and capital one.
the galvins filed notices of appeal as to both the first and second judgments.those appeals have been consolidated in this court.
the first judgment the separate judgment on bank counterclaim for possession was indisputably a final judgment,as it was entered under rule b.see spiegel trs.of,cir.rule b permits the entry of judgment,and thus an appeal,on fewer than all the claims in a action.
we express no opinion as to whether the district court had personal jurisdiction over capital one.see fed.civ.c,e.civ.d e,cir.
we do not consider the different question as to whether there was also a judgment set out in a separate document entered on the docket in compliance with federal rule of civil procedure.parties can waive that requirement.see sewer auth.constructora lluch,cir.such a waiver occurred here,where the plaintiffs filed the notice of appeal and neither party raised the issue before this court.see de rodríguez,cir.finding waiver where district court order clearly indicated that it intended to dispose of the case finally and defendant did not object to appeal.
because of the large number of counts,the variations in the defendants for each count,and the fact that some of the counts were disposed of in part in the ruling on the motion to dismiss and in part in the ruling on the motion for summary judgment,we identify the relevant defendants for each count in a parenthetical included in the section headings.
the requirement that the mortgagee also hold the note or act on behalf of the noteholder applies only to foreclosures for which notices of sale were given after the eaton opinion and to the parties in that case.at.that ruling was extended to any parties who had raised the issue addressed in eaton and whose cases were pending on appeal on the date of the decision.galiastro,at.the notice of sale in this case was sent on october,so eaton applies.
by its terms,pinti only applied to the parties before the court and mortgage foreclosure sales of properties for which the notice of default required by paragraph wa s sent after the date of th e opinion,july.pinti,at.this rule was later extended to cases in which the issue was preserved and appeal was pending at the time pinti was decided.aurora loan,llc murphy.app.murphy contained dicta stating that the rule would not extend to cases pending in the trial court at time of pinti.id.because we affirm the district court conclusion that there was no violation of paragraph on the grounds asserted by the galvins,see infra section.b,we need not decide whether to accept this dicta as a correct statement of massachusetts law.
the galvins argument that wells fargo bank,anderson.app.implicitly reversed wain and undercut wilson relies on a misreading of the opinion.anderson merely held that section binds only the entity making and recording the assignment,if such action has been made in compliance with its provisions.the statute does not bind any other party that has standing to contest the validity of the assignment.id.at.this holding is consistent with wain and wilson,which held that compliance with section means that an assignment is not void.those opinions left open the possibility that such an assignment may be voidable by a party with standing.indeed,later in anderson,the court stated that very rule and cited wain approvingly.id.at.
the argument that the failure of the note holder itself to send the default notice violates paragraph raises two questions as to which the district of massachusetts is currently split.first,judges in the district court have reached different conclusions as to whether a default notice that is not from the note holder violates paragraph.compare paiva bank of,supp,holding that the holder of the note must send the default notice to comply with paragraph,with anderson nationstar,llc,supp,holding that the assignee of the mortgage may send the default notice under paragraph,and hmc assets,llc conley,wl,at,applying anderson to default notice sent by servicer.second,judges in the district court have reached different conclusions as to whether the pinti rule may apply retroactively in a situation,like this one,where the borrower raised an argument in the district court about the bank compliance with paragraph prior to the supreme judicial court sjc opinion in pinti and the property had been sold to the foreclosing entity itself at the foreclosure sale.compare paiva,supp.at applying pinti retroactively in this situation,with carver bank of mellon,wl,at,applying pinti prospectively in same situation,and klevisha providentfunding assocs,supp,applying pinti prospectively in similar situation.
that paragraph reads in relevant part lender shall give notice to borrower prior to acceleration following borrower breach of any covenant or agreement in this security instrument but not prior to acceleration under section unless applicable law provides otherwise.the notice shall specify a the default b the action required to cure the default c a date,not less than days from the date the notice is given to borrower,by which the default must be cured and d that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this security instrument and sale of the property.the notice shall further inform borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a c
