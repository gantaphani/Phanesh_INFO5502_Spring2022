in this appeal,we consider whether the limitation on lender charges for mortgages with interest rates of more than found in section a of the illinois interest act ilcs a west is enforceable or is preempted by a prohibition on such caps in the federal depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of.in separate foreclosure actions brought by the plaintiff creditors,the defendant homeowners filed counterclaims and affirmative defenses that included allegations the creditors had violated the illinois interest act ilcs et west.the circuit court of cook county dismissed the homeowners counterclaims and affirmative defenses,but the appellate court reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings.this court allowed the creditors joint petition for leave to appeal.we now reverse the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
in separate actions,the creditors filed for foreclosure against a number of homeowners who were behind in their home mortgage payments.the homeowners each filed counterclaims and affirmative defenses that included an allegation that the creditors had violated the illinois interest act act by imposing fees in excess of on loans with interest rates of greater than ilcs a f west.the circuit court of cook county dismissed those counterclaims,ruling the interest act claims were preempted by the federal depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of didmca,and,in some cases,by the federal alternative mortgage transaction parity act of parity act c.the cases were later consolidated,and the homeowners filed an interlocutory appeal.
the appellate court reversed and remanded,relying in part on its prior decision in fidelity financial services,hicks,d.d.in hicks,the court considered the interaction between the interest act and didmca and,specifically,whether section a of the act is preempted by section of didmca.the hicks court concluded the loan at issue did not fall within the scope of didmca because the loan was not a mortgage and it was not clear whether the trust deed underlying the loan constituted a first lien.hicks,d at.in addition,the hicks court held that the limit in section a of the act was not implicitly repealed when the legislature amended section,thus permitting any rate or amount of interest or compensation for loans secured by a real estate mortgage.hicks,d at.the appellate court here declined to follow conflicting federal authority in currie diamond mortgage of illinois,cir,holding that section of didmca preempted section a.the appellate court reasoned that it was not bound to follow federal precedent,but it was obliged to give deferential weight to hicks.d at.
in addition,the appellate court chose not to address the creditors argument that hicks was wrongly decided,finding that dispositive changes had occurred since the issuance of that decision.d at.the appellate court noted that after hicks was decided in,the legislature enacted public act to amend section a of the act.after factually distinguishing the contrary decisions in village of park forest wojciechowski,and city of chicago gordon,d,the court deemed davis city of chicago,instructive,although it was not directly on point.d at.the appellate court noted that didmca specifically allowed states to adopt subsequent limitations on discount points and overcome the preemption provision.in light of this provision,the court concluded the changes to section a,while not directly altering the relevant portion of the interest act,could be seen as an attempt to resolve the conflict between currie and hicks.d at.thus,the court concluded the reenactment of section a satisfied the override provision in section b of didmca and the homeowners interest act claims were improperly dismissed as preempted by didmca.d at.
finally,the appellate court rejected the creditors argument that provisions in the parity act governing alternative mortgage transactions preempted some of the homeowners claims,as well as another issue not before this court.d at.we granted the creditors leave to appeal see a,and the state of illinois intervened as an appellee see ilcs west.we also allowed several entities supporting either the creditors or the homeowners leave to file amicus curiae briefs.see.
ii.analysis 
in,congress passed didmca to ease the severity of the mortgage credit crunches and to provide financial institutions,particularly those with large mortgage portfolios,with the ability to offer higher interest rates on savings deposits,at,reprinted in.as congress observed,
i n addition to the adverse effects of usury ceilings on credit availability,mortgage rate ceilings must be removed if savings and loan institutions are to begin to pay market rates of interest on savings deposits.without enhancing the ability of institutions to achieve market rates on both sides of their balance sheets,the stability and continued viability of our nation financial system would not be assured.thus,federal preemption of state usury ceilings would not only promote national home financing objectives but would provide the resources with which savers could be paid more interest on their savings accounts,at,reprinted in.
with that underlying intent,congress enacted section of didmca,stating 
a applicability to loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance applicability to deposit,account,or obligation 
the provisions of the constitution or the laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest,discount points,finance charges,or other charges which may be charged,taken,received,or reserved shall not apply to any loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance which is 
a secured by a first lien on residential real property,
b made after march,and 
c described in section b of the national housing act b,
b applicability to loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance made in any state after april,
except as provided in paragraph,the provisions of subsection a of this section shall not apply to any loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance made in any state after the date on or after april,and before april,on which such state adopts a law or certifies that the voters of such state have voted in favor of any provision,constitutional or otherwise,which states explicitly and by its terms that such state does not want the provisions of subsection a of this section to apply with respect to loans,mortgages,credit sales,and advances made in such state.
at any time after march,any state may adopt a provision of law placing limitations on discount points or such other charges on any loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance described in subsection a of this section.
thus,the relevant portion of didmca preempted every existing state limitation on the rate or amount of interest,discount points,finance charges,or other charges applicable to any loan or mortgage hereinafter,mortgage unless a state chose to override the preemption by one of the methods specified in subsections b and b.b,b.
to under subsection b,by april,a state was required to adopt a law,or to certify a vote favoring a provision,expressly stating its decision to.b.to under subsection b,a state could adopt a law after march,limiting the relevant points or charges on affected mortgages.b.
b.the chronology 
this appeal involves the interrelationship of a number of illinois legislative and federal congressional provisions as they have changed since.to provide a backdrop for our analysis,we present a brief chronology of the relevant provisions and changes.
the illinois legislature enacts limitations on points and fees in section a of the interest act.preexisting section continues to impose interest rates limits.
congress enacts didmca,preempting statutory limits on lender fees,including those in section 
the illinois legislature amends section of the interest act by removing all limitations on residential mortgage interest rates and lender compensation.
the illinois legislature amends section a of the interest act to remove two fee categories from the types of charges governed in that section and in section of the interest act.
the homeowners each entered into the mortgage transactions underlying this appeal after.at the most basic level,the creditors claim that the homeowners interest act counterclaims and affirmative defenses were properly dismissed because they were preempted by section of didmca and because illinois has not of preemption under either of the two methods specified in didmca.the homeowners maintain that the appellate court properly reversed the dismissal order because the limitations on points and fees in section a are not preempted by section of didmca.
implicit repeal of section a of the interest act 
the creditors contend in part that illinois preexisting limitation on points and charges in section a of the act was implicitly repealed by legislative amendments to section in and.we note that this interlocutory appeal is from the appellate court reversal of the trial court dismissal of the homeowners affirmative defenses and counterclaims pursuant to sections and of the code of civil procedure ilcs,west.the proper standard of review of the dismissal orders in this case is de novo.feltmeier feltmeier.we begin our analysis by examining both the language of section a and the evolution of the language currently found in section.
in relevant part,section a states 
where there is a charge in addition to the stated rate of interest payable directly or indirectly by the borrower and imposed directly or indirectly by the lender as a consideration for the loan,or for or in connection with the loan of money,whether denominated points,service charge,discount,commission,or otherwise,the rate of interest shall be calculated in the following manner 
the percentage of the principal amount of the loan represented by all of such charges shall first be computed,which in the case of a loan with an interest rate in excess of per annum secured by residential real estate,shall not exceed of such principal amount.said percentage shall then be divided by the number of years and fractions thereof of the period of the loan according to its stated maturity.the percentage thus obtained shall then be added to the percentage of the stated annual rate of interest.emphases added.ilcs a west.
thus,on its face section a limits the designated charges cumulatively,points or charges to for residential mortgage loans with annual interest rates exceeding.ilcs a west.
until,section did not permit lenders to charge,contract for,and receive any rate or amount of interest or compensation with respect to mortgage loans,ch,now ilcs west.in,the legislature added subparagraph l to section,making the existing language applicable to l oans secured by a mortgage on residential real estate.emphasis in original.pub.act,eff.september,amending,ch.section was again amended in,removing the word residential from subparagraph l,thereby legalizing the receipt of any rate or amount of interest or compensation on any real estate mortgage.see pub.act,eff.august,ch,moved from,ch.this portion of section has not been changed since the amendment.see ilcs l west.
the creditors contend that by permitting any rate or amount of interest or compensation to be charged on any real estate mortgage,the legislature and amendments implicitly repealed section a limitation on points chargeable in connection with mortgage loans bearing interest rates above.
repeal by implication is generally disfavored,and we will presume legislation was intended to be consistent with existing law.lily lake road defenders county of mchenry.therefore,this court will apply that principle only when a subsequent statute terms and operation can not be reconciled with those of an earlier statute.when the two statutes can not be harmonized,the subsequent statute will be deemed to have repealed the earlier by implication because we can not presume the legislature intentionally enacted contradictory laws.lily lake,at.here,relying on the reasoning of the seventh circuit court of appeals in currie diamond mortgage of illinois,cir,the creditors assert the language in section a and amended section is irreconcilable,and thus section a was implicitly repealed by the amendments to section.
in currie,the plaintiff homeowner claimed in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois that the defendant creditor violated section a of the act by imposing charges of approximately of the principal of the loan on a home mortgage with a yearly interest rate of.the bankruptcy court granted the creditor motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,citing both the preemption of section a by section of didmca and the implicit repeal of section a by amendments to section enacted in.the district court affirmed solely on the basis of federal preemption.currie,at.
the court of appeals found that illinois amended section in to enhance the availability of money for home financing.the court determined that both this purpose and the plain language of that section,permitting lenders to impose any interest rate and other compensation,were in conflict with section a express ceiling on interest and points and could not be reconciled.currie,at.the court noted that the inclusion of points in the calculation of the effective interest rate under section a demonstrated that points are a type of compensation and thus could not be restricted under amended section.currie,at.after discussing the doctrine of repeal by implication and acknowledging that it is strongly disfavored,the court held that section a limitation on charges was repealed by implication by the amendment of section.currie,at.the court believed the legislature failure to repeal expressly section a must have been an oversight.currie,at.
the seventh circuit reaffirmed the currie court finding of repeal by implication in reiser residential funding,cir.in its analysis,the reiser court refrained from conducting an reexamination of currie,believing it is best to stick with one assessment until the state supreme court,which alone can end the guessing game,does so.emphasis in original.reiser,at.we are now availed of an opportunity to end the guessing game on the issue of implicit repeal.
for their part,the homeowners dismiss the currie rationale as faulty,maintaining that the appellate court in fidelity financial services,hicks,d,correctly held that section a was not implicitly repealed.we note that while hicks addressed the issue of repeal by implication,it did not consider the effect of didmca on section a because it involved a second mortgage and thus was outside the scope of the federal statute.
the creditor in hicks relied on the currie decision.the hicks court ultimately rejected currie as federal dicta not binding on the courts of this state.hicks,d at.rather,the hicks court presume d that section a was valid because it remained on the books years after it was purportedly repealed.hicks,d at.notably,the court also believed section could be reasonably reconciled with section a,precluding a finding of implicit repeal under our limited application of that doctrine.hicks,d at.to reconcile the two provisions,the court read section,entitled general interest rate as removing restrictions only on lenders ability to pass their actual cost of money along to borrowers.the court interpreted section a,addressing charges for or in connection with the loan of money,as applying only to ancillary charges not dictated by the cost of the commodity,but imposed by lenders in connection with loans.emphasis in original.hicks,d at,quoting,ch.thus,the court reasoned,the two statutes were not irreconcilable because they concerned different types of charges.hicks,d at.
in construing a statute,the most fundamental rule is to give effect to the legislature intent,and the best evidence of that intent is the statutory language.that language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.courts may not properly construe a statute by altering its language in a way that constitutes a change in the plain meaning of the words actually adopted by the legislature.if the statutory language is clear,we must give effect to its plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to other construction aids.king first capital financial services,quoting in re marriage of beyer,d.
here,the language of amended section is clear and unambiguous it is lawful to charge,contract for,and receive any rate or amount of interest or compensation with respect to l oans secured by a mortgage on real estate.ilcs l west.by refusing to restrict either the interest or compensation available to lenders with respect to mortgage loans,the legislature evinced its intent to permit a broad category of charges to be imposed in connection with secured real estate loans.
similarly,on its face the plain language of section a limits to a broad category of noninterest charges that may be imposed by lenders in conjunction with high interest rate mortgage loans.the restrictions apply to all charges imposed as a consideration for the loan,or for or in connection with the loan of money.ilcs a west.
we can find no functional distinction between the noninterest compensation in section and the noninterest charges in section a.the plain meaning of compensation includes payment for value received or service rendered remuneration.webster third new international dictionary.see also black law dictionary ed defining compensation as r emuneration and other benefits received in return for services rendered,salary or wages.the plain meaning of a charge is the price demanded for a thing or service.webster third new international dictionary.see also black law dictionary ed defining a charge as the p rice,cost,or expense.the two terms appear to be the same type of payment viewed from different perspectives.compensation represents the perspective,while charges expresses the same money from the perspective of the.thus,section permits lenders to impose unlimited noninterest costs on all mortgage loans ilcs l west,while section a restricts the same broad category of costs to when the loan interest rate exceeds ilcs a west.by the terms of their plain language,the two sections are irreconcilably inconsistent.
the hicks court interpretation of the two sections requires us to read unsupported limitations into the statutory language and is overruled.the plain words of the provisions do not restrict section compensation to lenders actual cost of money or section a charges to ancillary charges not dictated by the cost of the commodity,as the hicks court concluded.see hicks,d at.the hicks decision is also at odds with the legislature intention to amend section to remove the artificial limits on the interest and other compensation lenders may receive for mortgage loans,thereby allowing market forces to prevail.see,house proceedings,may,at statements of representative mcbroom,senate proceedings,june,at statements of senator rock.laws,governor message,at.
the homeowners,however,argue the hicks decision is consistent with applying market forces to the mortgage market.they contend hicks interpretation of section does not limit a lender overall revenue potential because even though section a limits noninterest charges to on high interest loans,it does not regulate interest rates themselves,allowing lenders to obtain any desired overall rate of return.this argument is specious because it ignores a vital difference between mandatory charges that are payable at the beginning of a loan and interest that is payable only until the loan is paid off.under section a,lenders are only guaranteed charges of a maximum of,and their receipt of an additional unregulated return from interest payments is dependent on conditions outside their control,the refinancing or early payment of the loan balance.for this reason,there is a significant practical difference between section bar on any lender interest and compensation restrictions and section a ceiling on charges despite its allowance for unlimited interest.the two sections represent vastly differing approaches to regulating lender revenue and are inherently inconsistent.thus,we agree with the seventh circuit court of appeals in currie and reiser that the amendments to section implicitly repealed section a limitation on noninterest charges lenders may impose on residential mortgage loans.
nonetheless,the homeowners claim that our legislature recently affirmed the continuing viability of section a by passing the high risk home loan act,effective january,loan act ilcs et west.this act defines mortgage loans as high risk if their annual percentage rates or loan fees exceed certain triggers.if a loan is deemed high risk,financed fees are capped at.ilcs west.the loan act also contains an interest act savings clause to the extent this act conflicts with any other illinois state financial regulation laws,except the interest act,this act is superior and supersedes those laws for the purposes of regulating high risk home loans in illinois.emphasis added.ilcs west.we are not persuaded by this argument.
both the interest and the loan act concern other aspects of the home mortgage market,and the savings clause applies broadly to all provisions of the loan act,whether they concern fee caps or not.the homeowners cite no evidence that the savings clause was specifically intended to permit the interest act ceiling on charges for high interest loans to continue in effect.indeed,if that portion of the interest act is implicitly repealed,there is no conflict with any loan act provision,and that act will apply to all home loans falling within its scope.in short,the adoption of the loan act does not demonstrate the continued viability of the interest act provision at issue here as the homeowners claim.thus,we hold the portion of section a of the interest act restricting applicable charges to when the mortgage loan rate exceeded was implicitly repealed by the amendment of section in.
applicability of didmca preemption 
the intervenor state of illinois argues the creditors did not meet their burden of overcoming the presumption against preemption in this case by establishing that the term first lien as used in section of the act includes refinancing mortgages as well as mortgages.the state initially contends that when didmca was enacted in,a first mortgage generally was viewed as one obtained to purchase a home,while a mortgage for which accumulated equity served as security a home equity loan was called a second mortgage,regardless of priority of position.emphasis in original.a cursory review of the authority cited for this proposition reveals the error in the state argument.in its citation,the state notes parenthetically that the cited article declares t raditional home equity loans are sometimes called second mortgages,although legally they may involve a first lien.emphasis added.see canner,luckett durkin,home equity lending,fed.res.bull,may.thus,the cited article expressly recognizes that refinanced mortgage loans may constitute first liens,the term used to define loans and mortgages that fall within the scope of section of didmca.see a stating the provisions of the constitution or the laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest,discount points,finance charges,or other charges which may be charged,taken,received,or reserved shall not apply to any loan,mortgage,credit sale,or advance which is a secured by a first lien on residential real property emphasis added.
next,the state cites the michigan court of appeals decision in mitchell trustees of united states mutual real estate investment trust,in support of its contention that the inclusion in section of refinanced mortgage loans as first liens does not further congress intent to promote home purchases.in its brief,the state asserts that one of congress purposes in enacting didmca recognized by the mitchell court was stimulation of the market.while that is true,congress also expressed another purpose to provide financial institutions,particularly those with large mortgage portfolios,with the ability to offer higher interest rates on savings deposits,at,reprinted in.this purpose is consistent with the incorporation of refinancing mortgage loans in the ambit of section.we reject the state argument to the contrary as unsupported.under the plain meaning of the term first lien,both and refinancing mortgages meeting the statutory requirements are covered by section.see black law dictionary ed defining first lien as a lien that takes priority over all other charges or encumbrances on the same propert
