the,lehman capital appeals from the superior court september,order dismissing with prejudice a complaint lehman filed as a sanction for lehman discovery violations.lehman filed its complaint against the administrator of a decedent estate seeking a sum of over due under a reverse mortgage that the decedent had executed.because of various perceived discovery violations,the trial judge entered an order dismissing lehman complaint with prejudice.lehman argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by dismissing the complaint because the record does not support a finding that lehman willfully or consciously disregarded any order relating to discovery.we agree that the trial judge abused his discretion.absent a willful and conscious disregard by lehman of its discovery obligations,the remedy of dismissal with prejudice was too extreme.accordingly,we vacate the trial judge order in part,reverse,and remand with instructions to enter a more appropriate sanction commensurate with the facts of record.
hester monroe owned property located at seabury avenue in milford,delaware.on march,monroe executed a reverse mortgage to international mortgage corporation for.thereafter,international mortgage assigned the mortgage to wendover financial services,which in turn,assigned the mortgage to the appellant,lehman capital.wendover,however,continued to service the mortgage.
under the mortgage,wendover remitted to monroe scheduled monthly payments of from april,until her death on march.upon monroe death,the lender obligations to remit monthly payments ended and the sum then secured by the mortgage became due and payable for reasons not reflected in the record,no one informed wendover or lehman of monroe death until august.consequently,monroe estate continued to receive the monthly payments from april until august.
on august,the sussex county register of wills granted sudler lofland,the defendant below and appellee here,letters of administration for monroe estate.lofland was the funeral director who handled monroe burial and services after her death,and was also a creditor of her estate.at some point after he was granted the letters of administration,lofland became aware of the reverse mortgage encumbering monroe property.lofland retained counsel to represent the estate.on october,lofland counsel sent a letter to lehman capital,informing lehman that he was representing lofland and that the estate may have to sell the realty to pay estate debt.counsel also requested the mortgage balance and a history of payments by monroe and a history of advances to her under the mortgage since march,lehman did not respond to lofland counsel letter.instead,on november,lehman filed a foreclosure action against lofland in the sussex county superior court seeking to recover the principal amount of together with interest after september.
lehman trial counsel improperly served lofland with the complaint on december.because he had been improperly served,lofland did not answer the complaint within the twenty days required by the superior court rules lofland counsel,apparently having no knowledge of lehman complaint,did,however,send a letter to lehman counsel on february.in that letter,lofland counsel calculated that the outstanding amount of the mortgage due was,questioned about charges for line of credit and repair set asides,informed lehman counsel that the estate was negotiating with potential purchasers of monroe property,and,importantly,informed lehman counsel that lofland was willing to pay in full satisfaction of the mortgage balance.the record does not reflect whether lehman trial counsel responded to that letter.
having received no answer to his improperly served complaint,lehman trial counsel filed a direction for entry of judgment with a supporting affidavit on march.the total amount of the default judgment entered was 
after obtaining the default judgment on march,presumably lehman trial counsel sent a letter on his firm letterhead to lofland at monroe address on march.the letter advised that the amount to payoff the account was inexplicably about less than the amount of the default judgment,informed lofland that that payoff amount was valid through april,and directed lofland to make his check payable to wendover and to mail it to lehman trial counsel office.the record does not disclose whether lofland responded to this letter.
on april,after apparently becoming aware that he had improperly served lofland with the complaint,lehman trial counsel moved to vacate the default judgment entered on march,noting that t he personal representative in this matter was not properly served.the next day,the trial judge entered an order vacating the default judgment.
lehman trial counsel properly served lofland with a complaint on may.lofland timely answered the complaint ten days later,and contested what appears to be about of the amount allegedly due under the mortgage on june,lofland filed and served his first set of interrogatories,a request for production of documents,and a request for admissions.thereafter,on july,the parties attended a scheduling conference with a superior court commissioner.on july,the commissioner entered an order setting forth the following relevant dates 
all discovery shall be completed by november.
dispositive motions shall be filed by november,with responses filed by november.
the pretrial stipulation is due no later than noon on december.
a pretrial conference is scheduled for january.
a one day trial is scheduled to commence on january,at the superior court in georgetown,delaware.
on august,lofland filed an offer of judgment for echoing the offer made in his counsel february,letter to lehman.lehman did not accept that offer of judgment.the record does not reflect whether counsel for the parties conferred between august,and august,about lofland outstanding discovery requests,but on august,lofland attorney sent a letter to lehman attorney that supports the inference that they had not conferred 
on june,i served upon you requests for admissions,interrogatories and requests for production.to date,i have not received an answer to any of this discovery.under the rules,the requests for admissions have now been deemed admitted.with those admissions,it is our position that any attempts to collect on repair set asides or lines of credit have been waived.the only remaining question is the balance due on the mortgage.
it is my intent to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the basis of the admissions to limit the amount due solely to the mortgage i also intend to file a motion to compel the answers to the other discovery.i would hope that would not be necessary.i will withhold filing until september,in anticipation that i will receive the information 
lofland counsel apparently decided to give lehman trial counsel even more time to respond to the outstanding discovery requests,because he did not file a motion to compel on september.about two weeks later,on september,dana federspiel,a litigation specialist at wendover,sent documents responsive to lofland discovery requests,as an attachment to an email,to a secretary at lehman trial counsel office.in its entirety the email read i am still waiting on a response from fnma for fee approval in the meantime i am sending you the docs required to respond.please do not take any action prior to fee approval as i am not sure how fnma will respond to fee request.dana.lehman trial counsel secretary never forwarded this email or the documents to lehman trial counsel,nor was trial counsel aware that his secretary had received them.
as of october,lehman trial counsel had neither responded to any of lofland discovery requests nor to lofland counsel letter of august.accordingly,on that date,lofland counsel filed a motion for partial summary judgment requesting that the court deem certain of lofland requests for admissions admitted and that the amount due lehman be limited to principal and interest.on october,lofland counsel filed a motion to compel.on november,lehman trial counsel made an effort to respond to the interrogatories and requests for document production.he indicated that dana federspiel was the person at wendover with knowledge of the allegations in the complaint,but did not mention federspiel at any other point in his answers to the interrogatories he also attached a copy of the mortgage,the note,and the multistate home mortgage loan agreement that applied.lehman trial counsel did not,however,include the responsive payment history that federspiel had provided in her september,email,apparently because he was not aware that that information had been forwarded to his office by email attachment.
two days later,on november,the trial judge held a contested hearing on lofland outstanding motions at which both lehman and lofland counsel appeared.at the beginning of the hearing,the trial judge asked lehman trial counsel if he had filed discovery responses after lofland counsel filed his motion to compel.lehman trial counsel represented that he had and apologized to the court,noting that it been like pulling teeth to find someone in lehman organization that provided me with information,and i still really do have a contact.i am still working on that.i have one person who is sic finally sent me an.i have not had a chance to contact her directly by phone.regarding the motion to compel the trial judge stated i going to give you two more weeks.i understand your difficulties,but ultimately,your client has to make this a priority and deal with it or not deal with it.they are the plaintiffs.they do want to pay attention to it so be it.
lehman trial counsel conceded that the requested admissions in lofland request for admissions were deemed admitted but contested the motion for summary judgment.the trial judge ultimately ordered that the requested admissions were deemed admitted,declined to address the motion for summary judgment,and ordered that lehman provide responsive a payoff statement detailing how the sums were disbursed under the reverse mortgage as they related to the corporate advance by november.on the day of the hearing,the trial judge entered orders to effectuate his rulings.
on january,the trial judge held the pretrial conference per the scheduling order of july,and confirmed the trial date for january.for reasons not disclosed in the record,the parties failed to file their pretrial stipulation by december,as the scheduling order required.instead,they filed the pretrial stipulation on january.the pretrial stipulation did not specifically indicate that there were any outstanding discovery issues.it did,however,in the brief statement of the defense provide 
answer defendant admits that monroe signed the mortgage and the estate owes the principal and some interest.however,the exact amount of principal is unknown because the plaintiff has refused to provide a payoff and formal accounting of the mortgage despite numerous requests by the defendant.therefore,the defense contends that the amount due under the mortgage should be the amount of principal and interest due on the date of the first request by the defendant dated october.emphasis in original.
the pretrial stipulation also provided that only one legal issue remained for trial,specifically,whether interest continues to accrue on the principal due under the mortgage after the defendant made formal demand for payoff and accounting and the plaintiff refused to provide the requested information.
on january,the trial judge sua sponte continued the trial until may,and scheduled the second pretrial conference for april.the trial judge did not change any of the other dates from the original july,scheduling order,including the original november,discovery date.
the parties filed a second pretrial stipulation virtually identical in content to the first on march.the second pretrial stipulation included the same paragraph quoted above under the heading brief statement of the defense,the same issue of law to be litigated,and,again,did not specifically indicate that there were any outstanding discovery issues.as scheduled,on april,the trial judge held the second pretrial conference.the record reflects that the trial judge noted that there were no problems and trial was to proceed as scheduled.the trial judge also apparently intended that his clerk check on the monday prior to trial for scheduling lehman witness travel arrangements.
on may,two days before the rescheduled trial,lofland filed a motion in limine,seeking to exclude evidence based on lehman admissions,failure to identify the witnesses it intended to call at trial,and failure to provide the requested history and accounting of payments.lehman responded to the motion on may,arguing that it should be allowed to introduce evidence to support its claims contrary to the request for admissions that the trial judge had deemed admitted because the admissions were matters of public record,that it had identified its witness,dana federspiel,in its november,answers to the defendant interrogatories,that travel arrangements have been made for that witness,and that lofland has been informed through counsel that there is no payment history as such on a reverse mortgage.the trial judge did not address these motions because,on may,he again continued the trial,this time until june,apparently because federspiel had not made timely travel arrangements,contrary to lehman counsel representation in his response to lofland motion in limine.
about three weeks later,on may,well after the november,discovery date set forth in the july,scheduling order,lofland counsel noticed federspiel deposition for june.lehman trial counsel did not became aware of the notice of deposition until june,because he had been injured on may,and was out of the office for a little over a week thereafter.after lehman trial counsel learned of the notice of deposition,on june,he called lehman and learned that while federspeil was no longer an employee tony hummell would be available to testify in federspiel place.on june,lehman counsel appeared for the scheduled deposition without a witness,but advised lofland counsel that he intended to call hummell to testify in federspiel place.lehman counsel did not,at that point,produce or offer to produce the payout history.he did,however,offer to make hummell available for a deposition the following week.lofland counsel did not accept this offer,but instead renewed his motion in limine that same day.
on june,lofland received the information demanded in discovery and ordered by the trial judge,including updated versions of the documents federspiel sent to lehman counsel via email on september.lofland filed a motion for sanctions on june,on the following day,lofland apparently received the attachment to federspiel email as well as the email itself before beginning the trial on june,the trial judge heard lofland motion in limine and motion for sanctions.the arguments focused on federspiel september,email and whether that email directly instructed lehman trial counsel not to produce the attached responsive discovery to lofland.the following relevant exchanges occurred 
the court lehman trial counsel,did you ever get any response from your client as to when you could release these documents 
lehman trial counsel no 
the court never 
lehman trial counsel no.
the court they were asking you to do anything,they were going to some other party for approval and if they got approval or disapproval or something else,then they were going to tell you you could comply with the court order i do see where you did anything wrong,lehman trial counsel.they told you not to do anything.maybe they should have complied to their costs.maybe you should have come back to the case,but i issued an order.your client was aware of that order.your client made a conscious decision not to abide by the court order.
the court the difficulty in this case was effecting that calculation of the numbers.the defendant filed requests for that.the plaintiff did not comply.i ordered that the plaintiff comply and plaintiff may have imade a conscious decision not to comply and then the thing sat for nine month sic and here we are.this case had been in this court for the better part of two years and the plaintiff compliance with the rules of the court,the discovery rules,and the court orders have been unacceptable.this goes back several weeks ago on the eve of trial.the plaintiff witness decided she was not even coming to trial and pushed it back a couple weeks.i probably should have dismissed the case then,but how my order was not complied with is just unacceptable.i am not going to tolerate it.i going to dismiss the plaintiff complaint with prejudice.i will access sic costs against the plaintiff.i will access sic attorney fees incurred by the defendant against the plaintiff.
the plaintiff,you certainly have the right to take an appeal of any decision to the supreme court.you can explain to the supreme court why you willingly and consciously disregarded the court very clear order to produce what was a critical piece of information in this case.that is a harsh result.i making this decision knowingly,but i simply not going to tolerate woeful sic refusal to comply with an order of the court.thank you.
on september,the trial judge entered a written order giving effect to his bench ruling.the order dismissed lehman complaint with prejudice,ordered lehman mortgage satisfied of record,assessed costs against lehman,and granted lofland demand for attorney fees in the amount of.the trial judge articulated three reasons for granting this relief 
lehman failed to follow the rules of court regarding discovery,willfully refused to comply with the court order directing lehman to provide lofland certain financial information which was at the center of the dispute between the parties,and failed to abide by the scheduling order regarding the trial date resulting in the trial having to be rescheduled the day before the trial because the plaintiff witness did not make arrangements to travel to delaware for the trial.
lehman appeals from that september,order.
discussion 
lehman argues on appeal that the trial judge abused his discretion by imposing the sanction of dismissal of the complaint with prejudice for the discovery violations,absent a showing in the record that lehman had acted in conscious or willful disregard of a court order.because a trial judge has broad discretion to impose discovery sanctions we will not disturb a trial judge decision regarding sanctions imposed for discovery violations absent an abuse of discretion.although we may not substitute our own notions of what is right for those of the trial judge,the trial judge decision to impose sanctions must be just and reasonable.
under superior court civil rule b c,the trial judge has the authority to dismiss an action when the complaining party fails to comply with discovery.the trial judge also has authority to enter a default judgment under that same rule generally,the standards for testing the propriety of either a dismissal or a default judgment are the same we have held that entering judgment against a party as a sanction for discovery violations is an extreme remedy and generally requires some element of willfulness or conscious disregard of a court order before the trial judge can impose such a severe sanction therefore,where other less punitive sanctions are available a default judgment or a dismissal with prejudice is the ultimate sanction for discovery violations and should be used sparingly.furthermore,although as a general rule a party is burdened with its attorney errors,this rule is inappropriate in th e instance where there is nothing to show willfulness or conscious disregard of the orders by plaintiff except the conduct of the lawyers.accordingly,the extreme remedy of dismissal with prejudice is too punitive when counsel,not plaintiff,bears much if not all responsibility for failure to comply with the superior court orders.
it appears that lehman did not comply with the rules of discovery and the trial judge order.that warrants the imposition of sanctions.but the dismissal with prejudice of a complaint for plus interest,in response to which the defendant made an offer of judgment in the amount of,is too severe a sanction.much of the noncompliance in this case can be attributed to lehman trial attorney inept intraoffice communications.there is nothing in the record to support a finding that lehman itself willfully or consciously disregarded the court rules or order.lehman did furnish the responsive documents to its trial attorney beyond the time period provided in the discovery rules,but did so well before lofland attorney filed the motion that resulted in the court order compelling a response within fourteen days and deeming the requested admissions to have been made.
on september,the date that lehman trial counsel secretary received the email with the discovery responses attached allegedly limiting lehman trial counsel ability to respond,the trial judge had not yet entered his order compelling discovery.at some point before the trial judge granted lofland motion to compel on november,lehman and its trial counsel must have agreed to a fee arrangement,because lehman trial counsel appeared at the hearing for the motion to compel and thereafter continued to represent lehman.lehman counsel also partly responded to the discovery requests on november,which is further evidence that lehman and its trial counsel had worked out their fee arrangement leaving lehman with no basis to believe that its trial counsel had not forwarded the information that lehman believed to be responsive to the outstanding discovery.
lehman september,email to its trial counsel specifically said please do not take any action prior to fee approval that language was not an outright prohibition on delivering the discovery responses.after fee approval,and before and after the november,court order,lehman trial counsel was free to deliver those materials,and had his secretary timely informed him of the email,he no doubt would have done so.although lehman trial counsel may have had difficulty communicating with a specific person at lehman,the fact remains that on september,federspiel sent documents responsive to lofland discovery requests to lehman trial counsel secretary.in lehman trial counsel own words,the problem was that the initial went to a clerk in my office,not to me.had it come to me,i would not be standing here now.i would have immediately delivered it to the opposing counsel.these facts are not even remotely consistent with a finding that lehman willfully or consciously refused to comply with its discovery obligations.
lehman trial counsel negative response to the trial judge question did you ever get any response from your client as to when you could release these documents is a red herring.first,lehman trial counsel represented that he would have delivered the email to lofland had he known of it,despite federpiel alleged instruction not to do so until the fee arrangement was finalized.second,and more importantly,federspiel email is not an outright prohibition against counsel producing the discovery responses until counsel first received her or someone else from lehman affirmative consent to do so.as we read the record,once the parties finalized their fee agreement,lehman trial counsel could,would,and should have sent the responsive discovery documents to lofland counsel,had his office staff informed him that they had been received.lehman trial counsel should have had in place intraoffice communications adequate to ensure that he would be informed of federspiel email.
we find nothing in the record to suggest that lehman itself willfully or consciously disregarded a court order.in his bench ruling,even the trial judge acknowledged as much i ordered that the plaintiff comply and plaintiff may have made a conscious decision not to comply while lehman may have made a willful and conscious decision to disregard the trial judge order,the record does not support a finding that it in fact did so.once lehman delivered the materials to its trial attorney in september and finalized the fee arrangement sometime between september and november of,it had no reason to believe that its trial attorney had not responded to lofland discovery requests.moreover,simply missing the initial discovery deadline and having a witness fail to appear for trial under unexplained circumstances,again,on the facts of this case do not warrant dismis
