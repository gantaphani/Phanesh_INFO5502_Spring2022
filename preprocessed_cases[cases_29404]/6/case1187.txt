introduction 
summit bank the bank sued its former employee robert rogers rogers for posting allegedly defamatory messages on a section of the internet web site craigslist entitled rants and raves.the bank alleged that rogers,under the guise of anonymity,made false and libelous statements about the bank operations,the integrity of its chief executive officer ceo and founder,the safety of depositors funds and made false statements about audits and regulatory actions.rogers moved to strike the bank complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section california statute,on the ground that the suit was brought for the illegitimate purpose of chilling rogers right to speak freely about the bank rogers appeal is from the trial court order denying his motion to strike after finding the statements made were not protected speech within the meaning of the law,subd.b,and the bank had shown a probability of success on the merits of its defamation claim.
we conclude that the trial court erred in both findings.in so holding,we reject the bank threshold argument that rogers was precluded from using the law to strike the bank action because rogers underlying conduct was illegal as a matter of law and thus falls outside protected speech and petition rights.flatley mauro cal th,flatley.specifically,the bank claims rogers posts on craigslist were illegal under financial code section,which imposes criminal liability when an untrue statement or rumor is made that is directly or by inference derogatory to a bank financial condition.we find that,even if rogers speech violated the statute,it can not be deemed illegal as a matter of law because financial code section is an impermissible restriction on speech protected by federal and state constitutional free speech guarantees.flatley,supra,cal th at,cal,art.i.therefore,the statute applies to the bank defamation action against rogers.
we further find that rogers met his burden of showing that the bank defamation action arose from an act in furtherance of his constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.because the bank failed to satisfy its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits,rogers motion should have been granted.consequently,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
the bank,which describes itself as a community bank headquartered in oakland,california,commenced this action on august,by filing a complaint against unknown doe defendants among other things,the complaint alleged a cause of action for defamation,contending that b eginning in about may,and continuing at various times thereafter doe defendants published false statements about the bank with the intent to defame the bank good name and reputation.the bank eventually learned rogers identity as the person who published the alleged defamatory statements after the court granted the bank request to serve a subpoena on craigslist.rogers was formerly employed by the bank as its and chief credit administrator from september until september,when he resigned.
the operative complaint for our purposes is the bank second amended complaint sac filed against rogers on october.the sac alleges a single cause of action for defamation based on internet posts in the rants and raves section of craigslist starting in or about may and ending about july.each post was retained for public view for seven days,after which the posts were automatically deleted by craigslist.while it is claimed rogers posted derogatory comments in a period,the bank contended a t least five of rogers posts included defamatory statements.the alleged defamatory posts read as follows 
the june,post being a stockholder of this screwed up bank,this year there was no dividend paid.the bitch ceo that runs this bank thinks that the bank is her personel sic bank to do with it as she pleases.time to replace her and her worthless son.
the june,post whats sic up at this problem bank.the ceo provides a sic executive position to her worthless,lazy fat ass son steve nelson.this should not be allowed.move your account now.
the july,post the fdic and the california department of financial institutions are looking at summit bank.this is the third time in less than one year.this is not a good thing,move your accounts asap.
the july,post i had banked at summit banks sic hayward office.service was poor and summit bank closed this office.whats sic up with that.all the customer sic were left high and dry.this is a piss poor bank.i would suggest that anyone that banks at summit bank leave before they close.
the second july,post move your accounts now before its sic too late.
although the posted messages were anonymous,with the poster being identified by a pseudonym,rogers admitted that he posted each of these messages.however,it was rogers position that he had the right under the first amendment to express these opinions,especially in the context in which he expressed them,where it was clear that these his opinions and not facts.
on july,rogers filed an motion under section to strike the bank complaint.rogers asserted that the bank complaint fell within the ambit of the statute because the messages he posted on craigslist were acts in furtherance of his constitutionally protected right to free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.he additionally claimed that the bank could not establish a probability of prevailing on its defamation action because the bulk of the posts constituted rogers opinions,and the facts that were set forth in the posts were true.
in its opposition,the bank argued that the posted statements constituted unprotected speech because making false claims against a bank is criminal.in making this argument,the bank invoked former financial code section,reenacted verbatim and renumbered as financial code section which imposes criminal liability when an untrue statement or rumor is made which is directly or by inference derogatory to a bank financial condition.additionally,the bank claimed that rogers craigslist posts did not concern an issue of public interest.the bank also asserted that it would prevail on its claim for defamation.
on september,after hearing argument,the trial court denied rogers motion to strike the bank complaint.in its written order,the trial court determined rogers has not sustained his burden to show that the conduct falls within the provisions of section,subdivision b because the conduct did not arise from an act in furtherance of any protected constitutional activity,and the bank has demonstrated that it has established a probability that it will prevail on the claim.this appeal followed 
discussiona.standard of review 
a process is followed in determining the outcome of a special motion to strike pursuant to section.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b citations.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.citation.thomas quintero th.
where a defendant brings a special motion to strike based on a claim that the plaintiff action arises from activity in furtherance of the defendant exercise of protected speech or petition rights,but the supposedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law,the defendant is precluded from using the statute to strike the plaintiff action.flatley,supra,cal th at.if a factual dispute exists about the lawfulness of the defendant conduct,it can not be resolved within the first prong,but must be raised by the plaintiff in connection with the plaintiff burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits the second prong.ibid.

b.the bank has failed to establish that rogers speech was illegal as a matter of law 
the bank has vigorously and consistently claimed throughout this litigation that rogers can not invoke protection because his posts on craigslist fall within an exception to the statute for speech that is illegal as a matter of law.see flatley,supra,cal th at.specifically,the bank has argued that its claim against rogers for defamation is based on conduct by rogers which constitutes a violation of financial code section currently financial code section and thus is outside the protective umbrella of an special motion to strike procedure,because it is based on alleged criminal activity.
financial code section provides any person who willfully and knowingly makes,circulates,or transmits to another or others,any statement or rumor,written,printed,or by word of mouth,which is untrue in fact and is directly or by inference derogatory to the financial condition or affects the solvency or financial standing of any bank doing business in this state,or who knowingly counsels,aids,procures,or induces another to start,transmit,or circulate any such statement or rumor,is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars,or by imprisonment for not more than one year,or both.
although the general language used in financial code section has been the law in california since stats,ch,there are no reported cases interpreting this provision.the bank has provided us with historical information indicating that the genesis of section was a model statute drafted by the american bankers association the association in to punish persons who maliciously make or circulate derogatory statements or stories affecting the standing and credit of banking institutions a kind of evil to which banks are peculiarly subject,and which often causes great injury not only to the bank or banks affected but to the general public.apparently,over a century ago,the association lobbied congress and state legislatures to make the dissemination of untrue statements and rumors about the financial condition of commercial banks a criminal offense after several bank runs were ignited or exacerbated by published statements that occurred during the bank panic of.see mathewson,from confidential supervision to market discipline the role of disclosure in the regulation of commercial banks.consequently,a bill was introduced into the first session of the congress,which read in pertinent part as follows that any person who shall make,circulate,or transmit to another or others any statement,untrue in fact,derogatory to the financial condition or affecting the solvency or financial standing of any national bank in the united states,or who shall counsel,aid,procure or induce another to start,transmit,or circulate any such statement or rumor shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine,sess.while the association lobbying efforts proved to be unsuccessful at the federal level,numerous state legislatures,including california,adopted the proposed law,either in its recommended form or with modifications.mathewson,supra,at.
the statute adopted by california is substantially analogous to the legislation proposed,but not adopted,by congress in.it prohibits not only untrue statements,but also untrue rumor s that are directly or by inference derogatory to the financial condition or affects the solvency or financial standing of any bank.it also punishes anyone who knowingly counsels,aids,procures,or induces another to circulate such statements or rumors.ibid.while the bank seizes on this language to claim that rogers posts on craigslist were illegal as a matter of law,this allegation alone is not enough to preclude rogers from using the statute to strike the bank action.as this court has recently observed,c onduct that would otherwise come within the scope of the statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical.citations.an exception to the use of section applies only if a defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law.citation.cabral martins th.
certainly rogers does not concede that he has committed any illegal acts.to the contrary,he has consistently maintained that the bank lawsuit is meritless as a matter of law because it is undisputed that the verifiable facts stated in the posts are true,and the other statements in the posts are as a matter of law opinions as opposed to verifiable facts.therefore,we must determine whether rogers is a defendant whose assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition flatley,supra,cal th at.the charge of illegality necessarily implicates the subordinate issue of whether the law relied upon to assert that the speech was illegal as a matter of law,in this case financial code section,could be constitutionally imposed to criminalize rogers speech.
even if the bank is correct that at least one of rogers posted comments violates financial code section,we conclude that this statute can not provide the foundation for an argument that rogers conduct is not protected under section.as we will explain,when analyzed under modern constitutional jurisprudence,the broad provisions of financial code section,on their face,impermissibly sweep within their proscriptions speech that can not be criminally punished.flatley,supra,cal th at.
in addressing whether his conduct violated financial code section,rogers did not discuss any of the constitutional questions implicated by the language of the statute.therefore,we asked for supplemental briefing on this issue.in our questions to the parties,we summarized what we believe to be some of the more problematic aspects of financial code section,which will be discussed in detail later in this opinion.
in their supplemental briefing,the bank and amicus curiae,the california bankers association,perceiving our obvious concern about the constitutionality of the statute,retreated from their previous litigation stance,urging this court to exercise judicial,and to resolve this appeal without addressing the constitutionality of financial code section the bank asks us to skip any analysis and proceed directly to prong two an analysis of whether the bank has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its defamation claim.its entreaty is supported by a citation to the supreme court recent decision in oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th.that case arose in the context of an alleged attorney conflict of interest and professional misconduct.because the defendant alleged misconduct related directly to matters involving legal ethics and the practice of law,the court chose to proceed directly to an analysis of whether the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing on its claims relying on its inherent,primary authority over the practice of law.citation.id.at.however,in so doing,our high court emphasized that generally,courts are to proceed in analyzing both prongs of motions in order.ibid.
importantly here,given our conclusion that rogers conduct is protected activity under section,subdivision e see discussion in part,infra,and that the bank has failed to establish a probability of success on the merits of its defamation claim see discussion in part,infra,we can not avoid deciding the enforceability of financial code section,the only remaining contention that would defeat rogers motion,and allow for an affirmance of the trial court decision to let the defamation case against rogers proceed.
moreover,rather than seize the opportunity to concede prong one,the bank has steadfastly clung to its assertion that rogers conduct is not protected speech because it is illegal as a matter of law.under all of these circumstances,we can not shirk our judicial responsibility to address concerns about the statute deterrent effect on legitimate expression,especially when the constitutional defects in financial code section are directly pertinent to the resolution of this appeal,facially apparent,and the constitutional question raises important public policy issues state bd.of education honig th,considering constitutional question raised for the first time at oral argument.we turn to those constitutional deficiencies now 
financial codes ection is facially unconstitutional because it does not include a malice element 
we begin our analysis by noting that modern defamation jurisprudence,both civil and criminal,begins with two landmark opinions decided in by the united states supreme court,establishing stringent new constitutional standards for criminal libel statutes,such as financial code section.first,the court held in new york times sullivan new york times,that public officials suing for civil defamation had to prove that the alleged defamatory statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.id.at.the court reasoned that because erroneous statement s are inevitable in free debate,the malice requirement is essential to ensure that the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need to survive id.at.next,the court in garrison louisiana garrison held that,when it came to speech about public officials,in order to establish the offense of criminal libel,the prosecution must prove that the statement in question was false and that the statement was published with actual malice.that is,the defendant published the statement with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.id.at.
following our high court pronouncements in new york times and garrison,one court surmised that a strong argument may be made that there remains little constitutional vitality to criminal libel laws.tollett united states cir,fn.omitted tollett.bearing out this observation,numerous criminal libel statutes have been held facially invalid for not incorporating truth as an absolute defense,for failing to require demonstration of actual malice,and for failing to include any statutory language limiting the application of the present penal statute to private libel where malice is not required.id.at see,parmelee state helfrich,collecting cases mangual.rotger sabat cir,tollett,supra,at commonwealth armao,eberle municipal court d,ivey state so d,gottschalk state alaska,fitts kolb,state utah,see generally,validity of criminal defamation statutes.
financial code section is unconstitutional on its face for the same reason similar statutes have been found to be unconstitutional it does not contain a clear requirement of actual malice or any statutory language limiting its reach to those banks which are not considered public figures.see,hufstedler,kaus,ettinger superior court th,discussing whether the bank in that case was a public or private figure for purposes of libel action.instead,the language of the statute allows for criminal punishment of persons making statements untrue in fact which are willfully and knowingly made without a clear requirement that the prosecutor prove defendant knowledge of falsity or recklessness with regards to falsity see new york times,supra,at the state rule of law is not saved by its allowance of the defense of truth see also garrison,supra,at e ven where the utterance is false,the great principles of the constitution which secure freedom of expression in this area preclude attaching adverse consequences to any except the knowing or reckless falsehood.
exacerbating this infirmity,the statute criminalizes the circulation of untrue rumors.a rumor is commonly defined to be g eneral talk or hearsay,not based on definite knowledge.oxford english dictionary as of may.by its very nature,one who transmits or circulates a rumor,as opposed to one who starts a rumor,does not know if the information transmitted is true.thus,financial code section not only fails to include a malice element required by modern defamation law,but it also criminally punishes a person who passes on a rumor ultimately determined to be factually groundless.the absence of any requirement that the person making the statement either know that is false or,at a minimum,acted with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity,is a fundamental constitutional defect in section.
financial codes ection is facially unconstitutional because it is vague 
we further conclude that financial code section is constitutionally defective on its face because of its vagueness.as we discuss below,section is a prohibition on speech that bases criminal liability on such undefined,vague concepts such as transmit ting to another or others,any statement or rumor which is untrue in fact and which is directly or by inference derogatory to the financial condition of a bank or affects the solvency or financial standing of any bank.italics added.the statute also criminally penalizes a person who knowingly counsels,aids,procures,or induces another to start,transmit,or circulate any such statement or rumor italics added.
the use of these broad and amorphous terms in financial code section raises numerous constitutional questions,including whether the statute provides those subject to its penalties with fair notice of what type of speech may violate the statute provides adequate guidance to the numerous state officials who will be charged with interpreting and enforcing it and draws within its ambit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech.see generally grayned city of rockford.the threat of criminal penalties,up to a fine one year imprisonment,amplifies jurisprudential concern for the vagueness of the statute.winters new york,winters requiring higher standards of certainty for statutes imposing criminal sanctions rather than civil penalties.
a statute is fatally vague only when it exposes a potential actor to some risk or detriment without giving him fair warning of the nature of the proscribed conduct.citation.rowan post office.persons of common intelligence can not be required to guess at the meaning of the enactment.winters,supra,at,fn.omitted.the most important factor in evaluating the clarity of an enactment is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,hoffman estates.thus,t he general test of vagueness applies with particular force in review of laws dealing with speech.hynes mayor of oradell,hynes.stricter standards are required where a statute has a potentially inhibiting effect on speech,because the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser.citations,quoting smith california.
our supreme court decision in people mirmirani cal d,provides an example of applying the void for vagueness doctrine in california.in that case,the court struck down a statute criminalizing threats aimed at achieving social or political goals as unconstitutionally vague.id.at.the court concluded the phrase social or political goals had no established legal meaning,and failed to provide clear lines by which citizens,law enforcement officials,judges and juries can understand what is prohibited and what is not.id.at.
similarly,many of the provisions of financial code section at issue in this case are undefined in the law and uncertain.when is a statement by inference derogatory to the financial condition of a bank how would a person know if their statement had the potential to affect the solvency or financial standing of any bank as the mirmirani court implored,surely,due process requires that criminal statutes provide more guidance to the citizens.this is particularly true when the statutes impinge upon first amendment protections.people mirmirami,supra,cal d at.
we can not accept the bank position,echoed by amicus california bankers association,that because of the growing number of insolvent banks,we should be especially solicitous of preventing statements derogatory to,or that affect the solvency or financial standing of,a bank.rather,it is precisely because of the current financial climate that we believe the public should be given broad latitude to express a wide range of viewpoints on matters relating to the operation and solvency of our financial institutions.that debate not only contributes ultimately to a proper understanding of the role and function of financial institutions in our society,but also furthers the search for solutions leading to the strengthening of the banking sector,and therefore,to our economy as a whole.therefore,the public interest in the dissemination of this type of information is legitimate and substantial.
where a statute imposes a direct restriction on protected first amendment activity,and where the defect in the statute is that the means chosen to accomplish the state objectives are too imprecise,so that in all its applications the statute creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech,the statute is properly subject to facial attack.citations.secretary of state of munson,fn.omitted secretary of state.because of its vague wording,journalists,politicians,and members of the general public who question the financial strength and stability of our banking system or even suggest that a bank is financially unstable,as well as any person who aids in the making or circulation of such statements,can only guess as to whether their communications will subject them to criminal liability under financial code section.consequently,persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at whether their views on the banking system in general or,as in rogers case,their frustration with a particular bank will be considered an untrue statement or rumor which would directly or by inference be deemed derogatory to a bank financial condition or whether the content of their communication will be found to affect the solvency or financial standing of any bank,connally general const.
in our view,the most insidious aspect of financial code section is that because individuals can not possibly know whether expressing their views about a financial institution will subject them to liability under the statute,as a practical matter,the safest course will be to forego expressing any opinion whatsoever about banks and financial institutions in order to avoid the personal and economic impact of a criminal conviction.see reno american civil liberties union.in such a case,the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser.citations.hynes,supra,at.
financial codes ection is unconstitutionally overbroad 
because ambiguous statutory terminology causes citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked,the vagueness of a statutory enactment affects our overbreadth analysis as well.baggett bullitt,hoffman estates,supra,at,fn.the overbreadth doctrine exists out of concern that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may deter or chill constitutionally protected when the overbroad statute imposes criminal sanctions.citations.virginia hicks.
as the bank and amicus emphasize,the united states supreme court has consistently reiterated that false statements of fact receive no constitutional protection.see,be k constr.nlrb,f alse statements are not immunized by the first amendment right to freedom of speech bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,same hustler magazine falwell,false statements of fact are particularly valueless however,a statute should be declared facially overbroad and unconstitutional if the statute punishes a substantial amount of protected free speech,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick oklahoma.
in our case,financial code section has not been so carefully drawn or authoritatively construed to punish only deliberate false statements of fact.instead,it includes within its ambit a great variety of conduct under a general and indefinite characterization,and leaving to the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion in its application.cantwell connecticut,see,tollett,supra,at statute punishing libelous,scurrilous,defamatory,or threatening statements,written on outside of envelope or postcard,stricken as unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.therefore,financial code section is unconstitutionally overbroad because it brushes constitutionally protected speech within its reach and thereby creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech citation.secretary of state,supra,at people.hsu th,hsu.
financial codes ection is a content based regulation on speech 
generally,the first amendment does not countenance governmental control over the content of messages expressed by private individuals.citations.turner broadcasting system,fcc,turner.therefore,courts apply the most exacting scrutiny to regulations that suppress,disadvantage,or impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content.citations.id.at.a regulation is presumptively invalid city of paul,minnesota,best friends animal society macerich westside pavilion property llc th,and is subject to strict scrutiny review.hsu,supra,th at.it must be demonstrated that the regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.walker kiousis th,walker sebago,city of alameda d,sebago.laws of this sort pose the inherent risk that the government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal,but to suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion.turner,supra,at.also,a regulation on speech raises the specter that the government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.citation.davenport washington ed.
as a general rule,laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based.citations.turner,supra,at.the united states supreme court has cited an example of a constitutionally suspect regulation that has particular significance to the case before us.the court pointed out that while the government may proscribe libel it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the government,supra,at,original italics.in this case,because financial code section punishes only derogatory speech about the financial condition of banks,it is a regulation of speech.
the bank,joined by amicus,argues that financial code section is not directed at the content of the speech but,instead,is directed at the secondary effects of the speech,preventing a bank run,which subjects section to a lesser level of scrutiny.see renton playtime theatres.however,a law that proscribes speech to prevent certain reactions from the listener is a law targeting the content of the speech rather than its secondary effects boos barry,and is a regulation subject to the highest level of scrutiny.see walker,supra,th at hsu,supra,th at sebago,inc,supra,d at.
financial code section is designed to prevent the listener from having a particular reaction to the speech,withdrawing their money from the criticized financial institution,and is therefore a proscription.see united states playboy entertainment group.but instead of being narrowly tailored to achieve a legitimate state interest,the defect in the statute is that the means chosen to accomplish the state objectives are too imprecise,so that in all its applications the statute creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech secretary of state,supra,at.given our previous findings that financial code section is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,the words of the statute simply leave no room for a narrowing construction.airport comm rs jews for jesus.because this restriction on speech is not narrowly tailored to achieve its goals,it is facially unconstitutional for this additional reason 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the bank has not presented uncontroverted and conclusive evidence establishing that anything rogers posted on craigslist was illegal as a matter of law under financial code section.instead,we find section can not be reconciled with modern constitutional requirements.it is a criminal libel statute without a malice requirement,which is designed to prohibit speech based on its content.it fails to give persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is forbidden.it sets no discernible limits on what types of speech can be criminalized,and,allowing such free range,it lends itself to arbitrary enforcement.of greatest concern,it has the potential to inhibit persons from engaging in constitutionally protected speech about the financial soundness of our banking system by threatening those who express themselves with a less than optimistic view on this topic with criminal sanctions.therefore,we conclude that rogers communications on craigslist do not fall within the very narrow and extreme circumstances required by flatley to exclude otherwise protected speech from the reach of the statute.see flatley,supra,cal th at.
c.the bank lawsuit against rogers arises from acts in furtherance of rogers constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue 
a claim is subject to the statute if it arises from one of the four categories of protected activity set forth in section,subdivision e.nygard,uusi kerttula th.one of these categories is section,subdivision e,which describes an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue as including any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.italics added.
as to the question of whether the alleged defamatory statements were made in a place open to the public or a public forum,an internet message board,such as rants and raves is essentially a computerized version of a cork and pin board weber,defining cyberlibel a first amendment limit for libel suits against individuals arising from computer bulletin board speech case res.after logging in to an internet bulletin board,a person may post messages,respond to messages already posted,or simply read the discussions without posting any messages.id.at.without doubt,internet message boards are places open to the public or a public forum for purposes of section.barrett rosenthal cal th,fn.th,web sites accessible to the public are public forums wilbanks wolk th,wilbanks web site is public forum ampex cargle cal.app th,ampex same computerxpress,jackson th,computerxpress financial web site is public forum.
this being so,the first prong analysis then shifts to whether rogers posts were in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.the bank claims rogers false statements about its financial standing did not concern a matter of public interest which could qualify for protection under the statute because these statements were a matter of interest to only rogers himself and a very small audience.
section does not define public interest,but its preamble states that its provisions shall be construed broadly to safeguard the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.public forum comment criticizing,or even periodically praising,the performance of public corporations have been found protected by the statute.as this division has noted,courts have held that internet postings about corporate activity constitute an issue of public importance upon considering the following pertinent factors whether the company is publicly traded the number of investors and whether the company has promoted itself by means of numerous press releases.citations.ampex,supra,th at accord,computerxpress,supra,th at.
with these factors in mind,rogers adduced evidence that the bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of summit bancshares,a publicly traded company with approximately shareholders.the bank has actively promoted itself on the internet as a,financially stable bank that is a community partner,as opposed to just another business enterprise.it publishes its annual report and letter to shareholders as part of its promotional efforts highlighting its financial stability,performance and management.the bank chairman and chief executive officer,shirley nelson,has been the subject of media attention and was publicly acclaimed as one of the most powerful women in banking by banker magazine in its october issue.by disseminating this information to the general public,the bank itself must believe the public is interested in its activities.see,integrated healthcare holdings,fitzgibbons th,no difficulty placing the financial survival of four hospitals within the county into the category of widespread public interest original italics.
moreover,we believe the broader topic addressed in rogers posts questioning the bank financial stability and its management decisions concerned an issue of public interest within the meaning of section,subdivision e.indeed,in the wake of the economic downturn,which ushered in widespread skepticism in the underlying financial strength of our country financial institutions,there has been a profound public interest in the financial world,and a heightened interest in private banks.see holman,a flawed solution the difficulties of mandating a leverage ratio in the united states march,while the causes of the recent financial crisis have been debated extensively,the conclusion that excessive leverage by financial institutions contributed to the crisis has garnered widespread support.in light of the recent financial meltdown of some of our country largest and most trusted financial institutions,the financial stability of our banking system is a legitimate object of constitutionally protected public commentary,discussion,criticism,and opinion.greenbelt pub.bresler.
for these reasons,we reject the bank characterization of rogers posts as merely the musings of a disgruntled former employee about private matters which are of no interest to anyone but the participants.the fact that rogers posts drew numerous comments,including comments vehemently disagreeing with rogers,suggests that the broad topic of the financial stability of our banking system,and the narrow topic of the bank and its personnel and activities,are matters of public discourse and are of considerable public interest.
therefore,considering the exceedingly expansive interpretation of the phrase issue of public interest,and in light of the statute mandate that we construe the law broadly so as to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,subd.a,we conclude rogers satisfied his burden of showing that the statements at issue here were protected under section,subdivision e.thomas quintero,supra,th at.
d.the bank has failed to establish a probability of prevailing on its claim for defamation 
having determined that the bank claims against rogers arise from activity protected by section,and that rogers communications do not fall within the exception for illegal activity,we now proceed to determining whether the bank has carried its burden of establishing that it will probably prevail on its cause of action for defamation,subd.b.

to determine whether a statement is actionable fact or nonactionable opinion,we apply a totality of the circumstances test pursuant to which we consider both the language of the statement itself and the context in which it is made.mcgarry,supra,th at.on the issue of context,our supreme court has explained w here potentially defamatory statements are published in a setting in which the audience may anticipate efforts by the parties to persuade others to their positions by use of epithets,fiery rhetoric or hyperbole,language which generally might be considered as statements of fact may well assume the character of statements of opinion.gregory mcdonnell douglas cal d.
initially,we point out that because rogers alleged defamatory statements appeared in a section of the craigslist web site entitled rants and raves,the reader of the statements should be predisposed to view them with a certain amount of skepticism,and with an understanding that they will likely present viewpoints rather than assertions of provable facts a ny reader familiar with the culture of most electronic bulletin boards would know that board culture encourages discussion participants to play fast and loose with facts indeed,the very fact that most of the posters remain anonymous,or pseudonymous,is a cue to discount their statements accordingly.lidsky,silencing john doe defamation discourse in cyberspace,duke,see also comment,cybersmear or cyber slapp analyzing defamation suits against online john does as strategic lawsuits against public participation seattle,posters on message boards often make outrageous claims and m ost visitors are completely aware of the unreliable nature of these posts.

the main components of rogers posts covered the following general topics the bank did pay dividends in the bitch ceo who runs the bank thinks that the bank is her personel sic bank to do with as she pleases the ceo should not be allowed to provide an executive position to her worthless,lazy fat ass son depositors should move their accounts immediately,before its sic too late the bank is screwed up,piss poor,and a problem bank the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the california department of financial institutions have look ed at summit bank three times in less than one year and that is not a good thing service was poor at the bank hayward branch and the bank closed it after the hayward branch was closed,the customers were left high and dry and the bank depositors should leave before they close.
despite the bank invitation to do so,the law does not require rogers to justify the literal truth of every word of the allegedly defamatory content,nor must we parse each word written by rogers to determine its truthfulness.it is sufficient if the defendant proves true the substance of the charge,irrespective of slight inaccuracy in the details,so long as the imputation is substantially true so as to justify the gist or sting of the remark.citation.smith,supra,th at.where an imputation is substantially true so as to justify the gist or sting of the remark,the truth defense is established.hughes hughes th.
here,there is evidence that the verifiable facts in rogers posts were basically true.the bank in fact paid no dividend in.regulators did in fact look at the bank on multiple dates in.the bank,in fact,closed its hayward branch in march and did so because it was unprofitable.in the bank letter to our shareholders in,it represents that proved to be the most critical,challenging and uncertain year most of us have ever imagined.it is unequivocally clear that this year has been the worst for us the letter acknowledges that while our profits decreased dramatically,the bank ended the year without being in the red,unlike a lot of other banks.at least one web site which tracked and rated the bank financial health,rated the bank as among the weakest banks and thrifts in the with a d for financial strength.the web site claimed that institutions with a d rating or lower were vulnerable to future financial difficulties or even failure 
nevertheless,the bank claims rogers posts contain several statements,that when considered closely,might imply or state assertions of fact that are simply not true.for example,the bank points to rogers statement that the ceo thinks that the bank is her personel sic bank to do with it as she pleases.the bank contends this statement is defamatory because it can reasonably be construed as implying one or more falsehoods about the ceo for example,that the ceo was misappropriating money and those actions caused the bank not to distribute dividends the bank also points to rogers post characterizing it as a problem bank.the bank proffered a declaration from a banking expert stating that a problem bank is a term of art in the banking industry and is defined as a financial institution with a camels composite rating of or.the expert declaration continues,that rogers use of the term problem bank carries with it the implication that it will likely fail in the near future and be placed into fdic receivership.thus,the bank argues that this statement is demonstrably false because the bank was never,and is currently not,considered a problem bank as defined above.the bank also claims that rogers post falsely represented that rogers was a customer at the bank hayward branch and that when it closed a ll the customer sic were left high and dry.the bank points out that rogers was never a customer of this branch and claims that his high and dry statement implied that the customers lost their money something that was not true.
determining whether a particular communication is actionable can be difficult,and what constitutes a statement of fact in one context may be treated as a statement of opinion in another,in light of the nature and content of the communication taken as a whole.gregory mcdonnell douglas,supra,cal d at.to decide whether a statement is fact or opinion,a court must put itself in the place of an average reader and determine the natural and probable effect of the statement,considering both the language and the context.citation.computerxpress,supra,th at.this means that rogers statements must be viewed from the perspective of the average reader of an internet site such as craigslist rants and raves,not the bank or a banking expert who might view them as conveying some special meaning.while the bank is clearly sensitive to the words used by rogers and believe they conveyed a meaning beyond that conveyed to average readers,the fact that some person might,with extra sensitive perception,understand such a meaning can not compel this court
