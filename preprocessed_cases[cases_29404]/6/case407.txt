the doctrine of derivative jurisdiction requires that a federal court jurisdiction over a removed case mirror the jurisdiction that the state court had over the action prior to removal.in this appeal,the district court applied the doctrine and dismissed a removed claim against federal agency defendants because the state court did not possess jurisdiction over those defendants.derivative jurisdiction has been frequently criticized and congress has eliminated the doctrine for cases removed under,the general removal statute.this abrogation,however,did not extend to cases removed under other provisions.thus,our precedent,in accord with the statutory removal scheme,dictates the application of the doctrine in cases removed under the removal statute.no authority exists for creating an exception to the doctrine that would apply in this case.furthermore,application of derivative jurisdiction in this case does not violate the equal protection or due process clauses of the constitution.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claim.
the facts of this appeal are straightforward.city national bank of west virginia issued a series of three loans to john and stacey palmer.city national alleges that the loans were made in reliance upon the guarantee of the farm service agency fsa of the department of agriculture usda.after city national issued the loans,the palmers became delinquent with their payments,and the fsa did not make payment on the loans.city national then foreclosed on the palmers farm.thereafter,the palmers brought suit in the circuit court of kanawha county,west virginia,against city national,alleging,inter alia,fraud and breach of contract.city national moved for leave to file a complaint against the fsa and usda the federal defendants.the motion was granted,and city national served a complaint upon the federal defendants,alleging that the fsa failed to honor the loan guarantees and seeking indemnity and contribution.
pursuant to a,the federal defendants filed a notice of removal,based on their status as federal agencies.after removal to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia,the federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and to remand the remaining claims to state court.the federal defendants argued that in cases removed under a the doctrine of derivative jurisdiction applied and the district court jurisdiction was identical to the state court jurisdiction prior to removal.because the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity to contract and tort suits in state court,the state court lacked jurisdiction over the federal defendants.thus,the federal defendants argued,the district court also lacked jurisdiction.relying on the doctrine,the district granted the motion to dismiss,holding that the state court did not have jurisdiction over the claim and thus the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim as well.the district court remanded the remaining claims.this appeal followed.
whether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise,this court has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the merits of an appeal.see hyman city of gastonia,cir.d prohibits this court from exercising appellate jurisdiction over an order remanding a removed case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.see c,d thermtron,hermansdorfer,d,overruled on other grounds by quackenbush allstate ins,d.in this case,because both the stated reason and the only plausible legal explanation for the remand order was the district court lack of jurisdiction over the case following the dismissal of the federal defendants,the remand was made pursuant to c.see powerex reliant energy,d.as such,this case falls within the ambit of the d bar on appellate review.several cases,however,provide for limited exceptions to the reach of d.nordan blackwater sec.consulting,llc in re blackwater,cir.the exception fashioned by city of waco fidelity guaranty,allows for limited review of collateral issues,even if the remand order itself is insulated from review under d.see,in re blackwater,at.
in waco,a defendant removed a state case on the grounds of diversity.at.following removal,the district court determined that the defendant had not been impleaded properly,and dismissed the claim.id.at.the dismissal destroyed diversity jurisdiction and,accordingly,the district court remanded the remaining claims to state court.id.at.viewing the district court decree as embodying three separate orders,the supreme court held that the city of waco could appeal from the order dismissing the claim.id.the court noted that the remand itself could not be appealed,but that in logic and in fact the decree of dismissal preceded that of remand and was made by the district court while it had control of the cause.id.furthermore,if the dismissal were not appealable,it would be conclusive upon the city of waco.id.this court restricts the applicability of the waco exception to purportedly reviewable orders that have a preclusive effect upon the parties in subsequent proceedings and are severable,both logically and factually,from the remand order itself.in re blackwater,at.
after oral argument in this case,the supreme court issued its opinion in powerex,d,clarifying the scope of the waco exception.accordingly,we must consider powerex to decide whether we continue to possess appellate jurisdiction in this matter before considering the merits of city national appeal.hyman,at concluding after oral argument that court lacked appellate jurisdiction.
powerex concerned a suit by various plaintiffs in state court against certain energy companies,alleging that the companies conspired to fix prices in violation of california law.see.at.in turn,the energy defendants filed crossclaims for indemnity against,among others,two federal government agencies,a canadian governmental entity bc hydro,and powerex,a wholly owned subsidiary of bc hydro.id.the removed to federal court,with the federal agencies relying on a and bc hydro and powerex relying on d and their status as foreign states under the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,b.id.
the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that powerex was not a foreign state and that the against the agencies and bc hydro were barred by sovereign immunity.id.the district court concluded that the federal agencies were immune from suit in state court bc hydro enjoyed sovereign immunity under the fsia and powerex did not qualify as a foreign state under the fsia.id.at.the district court then remanded the entire case to state court.id.at.the federal agencies and powerex appealed.the former argued that the district court should have dismissed them outright because of sovereign immunity.powerex argued that it was a foreign state under the fsia and thus entitled to remove.the plaintiffs argued that d barred both appeals.the ninth circuit rejected the invocation of d,concluding that the provision did not bar it from reaching issues of law decided by the district court prior to remand.id.
after concluding that d applies to remands for lack of jurisdiction even where the removal itself was proper,and that the remand of the district court was based on a lack of jurisdiction,the supreme court noted that the ninth circuit relied upon the waco exception in rejecting the application of d.id.at.the court held that waco does not permit an appeal when there is no order separate from the unreviewable remand order.id.the court continued,noting that powerex can point to no district court order,separate from the remand,to which it objects and to which the issue of its foreign sovereign status is material.id.in conclusion,powerex invocation of waco amounts to a request for one of two impermissible outcomes an advisory opinion as to its fsia status that will not affect any order of the district court,or a reversal of the remand order.id.after concluding that no other exception to d existed,the court vacated the relevant portion of the ninth circuit judgment and remanded with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.id.at.
our most recent discussion of the waco doctrine made clear that the purportedly reviewable order must have a conclusive effect upon the parties substantive rights.in re blackwater,at.we require that the challenged order have a preclusive effect in subsequent proceedings to satisfy the conclusiveness requirement.id.in addition,the reviewable decision must be able to be disaggregated from the remand order itself.id.thus,logical and factual severability,along with conclusiveness,are central requirements of waco exception to.id.
the requirements set forth in in re blackwater governing the applicability of the waco exception conform to powerex recent pronouncement.both requirements ensure that the appealed order is a truly separate order from the remand order and that any action taken by this court on appeal does not affect the remand order.the conclusiveness requirement guarantees that any purportedly appealable decision is a binding decision on the merits,and not a mere finding of the district court that may be relitigated in the state court upon remand.see,id.at t he district court finding that complete preemption did not create federal removal jurisdiction will have no preclusive effect on a subsequent defense of federal preemption.similarly,by requiring logical and factual severability,the disaggregation requirement mandates that any purportedly reviewable decision made by the district court was actually prior to the remand order and was a legally discrete conclusion.the severability requirement ensures that the appealable decision was truly distinct from the remand decision and not merely a subsidiary legal step on the way to the district court determination that the case was not properly removed.nutter monongahela power,cir quotation marks omitted.if a decision of the district court meets both requirements of in re blackwater,the decision is truly a separate order from that of the remand and thus reviewable under our precedent and powerex.
the conclusion that the in re blackwater requirements satisfy powerex is supported by justice scalia discussion of the waco exception in his dissent in osborn haley,d.osborn concerned the question of whether d barred appeal of a district court refusal to substitute the united states as a defendant in a removed action brought against a federal employee under the westfall act,resulting in a remand of the action to state court.at.the majority viewed the westfall act certification and substitution regime as directly conflicting with d,and thus framed the issue as choosing between two rule s.id.at.because the certification and substitution process was t for act cases,the majority concluded that congress intended it to take precedence over d.id.
in dissent,justice scalia did not view the westfall act as conflicting with d and analyzed whether the district court refusal to substitute the united states as a defendant fell within the waco exception to d.see id.at scalia,dissenting.justice scalia concluded 
t here is a crucial distinction between waco and osborn in waco,reversal of the dismissal would not have subverted the remand.there was no question that the suit would proceed in state court regardless of whether the diverse party was rightfully or wrongfully dismissed.nowhere did the waco court so much as hint that the district court might need to reexamine its remand order to the contrary,it was clear that the remand would occur,no matter what in other words,the remand order and the dismissal order were truly separate orders we could dismissal order without affecting the remand or its impact on the case.
id.citation omitted quoting waco,at.justice scalia noted that if the appeals court substituted the united states as defendant,but did not vacate the remand order as per d,the case would return to state court styled as osborn united states and would be immediately dismissed because federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over ftca actions.id.thus,justice scalia concluded,unlike in waco,the district court decision on a preliminary,westfall act inextricably intertwined with the remand order.since that is so,there is no jurisdiction to review either determination.id.at.
the conclusiveness and disaggregation requirements of in re blackwater accord with justice scalia persuasive discussion of when a purportedly reviewable order is truly separate from a remand order.a district court decision that has a preclusive effect on the parties and that is logically and factually separable from the remand order is a decision that can be reviewed by this court without affecting the remand order.reversal of an independently binding decision,separated from the remand order logically and factually,would not undermine the remand order itself.in sum,the in re blackwater requirements are sufficient to ensure that this court reviews only decisions that are separate orders from unreviewable remand orders in keeping with the holding of powerex.
thus,in order to determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction over city national appeal,we must decide whether the district court application of derivative jurisdiction and its subsequent dismissal of the united states meet the in re blackwater requirements.the first requirement is that the purportedly reviewable order have a conclusive effect upon the parties substantive rights.in re blackwater,at.we have interpreted this conclusiveness requirement to mean that the challenged order must have a preclusive effect in subsequent proceedings.id.in this case,city national challenges an order dismissing the federal defendants from the case entirely.the dismissal can not be revisited by the state court on remand,because the federal defendants are no longer parties to the action and were not subject to the remand order.nutter,at concluding that district court jurisdictional findings incident to remand could be relitigated in state court and thus the findings were not conclusive upon the parties.as in waco,if the dismissal is not reversed,it is conclusive upon city national.at.
in addition to conclusiveness,in re blackwater requires that a purportedly reviewable decision be logically and factually severable from the remand order.at.this requirement is satisfied in the instant case.to begin,the decision on derivative jurisdiction necessarily preceded the remand,because the dismissal of the federal defendants was the very action that deprived the court of jurisdiction and necessitated the remand.see,beauclerc lakes condo.ass city of jacksonville,cir where the remand is a consequence of the dismissal of claims creating federal jurisdiction,that dismissal is reviewable on appeal.furthermore,the dismissal is logically separable from the remand order.the issue of the application of derivative jurisdiction is wholly separate from the reason for the remand.although the remand was necessitated by the dismissal that resulted from the application of the doctrine,the legal basis of the of not depend on the district court interpretation of derivative jurisdiction.in other words,the application of derivative jurisdiction was not a subsidiary legal step to the district court determination that the case had to be remanded.in re blackwater,at nutter,at.the federal defendants properly removed the case under a because they were federal officers.only after the district court dismissed the claims against the federal defendants did it analyze whether a remand was necessitated because of a lack of jurisdiction.accordingly,the decision from which city national appeals was legally distinct from the remand order.
were we to reverse the dismissal of the federal defendants,the remand order would not be subverted.the remand order did not include the federal defendants,and the proceedings between the palmers as plaintiffs and city national as defendant will proceed regardless of any action we take on this appeal.thus,as in waco,the suit will proceed in state court regardless of whether the federal defendants were correctly dismissed.see osborn.at scalia,dissenting.by contrast,in powerex,powerex was a party to the remand order.if the district court decision on powerex foreign sovereign status were reversed,any appellate cour
