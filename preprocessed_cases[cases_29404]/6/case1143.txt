this is an action for wrongful foreclosure.the homeowner,monica sciarratta,alleges that as a result of a void assignment of her promissory note and deed of trust,the entity that conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure sale on her home had no interest in either the underlying debt or the subject property.in yvanova new century mortgage cal th yvanova,the california supreme court held that in a case such as this where a homeowner alleges a nonjudicial foreclosure sale was wrongful because of a void assignment the homeowner has standing to sue for wrongful foreclosure.id.at.however,yvanova did not address any of the substantive elements of the wrongful foreclosure tort id.at,and in particular did not address prejudice as an element of wrongful foreclosure.id.at,fn.
this case presents the question of prejudice left open in yvanova where a homeowner alleges foreclosure by one with no right to do so,do such allegations alone establish the requisite prejudice or harm necessary to state a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure or instead,to adequately plead prejudice,does the have to allege the wrongful foreclosure interfered with his or her ability to pay on the debt,or lead to a foreclosure that would not have otherwise occurred 
although yvanova did not address this precise issue,the policy considerations that drove the standing analysis in yvanova compel a similar result here.as the supreme court stated in yvanova,it would be an odd result indeed were a court to conclude a homeowner had no recourse where anyone,even a stranger to the debt,had declared a default and ordered a trustee sale.yvanova,supra,cal th at.
accordingly,we conclude that a homeowner who has been foreclosed on by one with no right to do so by those facts alone sustains prejudice or harm sufficient to constitute a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure.when a forecloses,a homeowner is harmed by losing her home to an entity with no legal right to take it.therefore under those circumstances,the void assignment is the proximate cause of actual injury and all that is required to be alleged to satisfy the element of prejudice or harm in a wrongful foreclosure cause of action.
the opposite rule,urged by defendants in this case,would allow an entity to foreclose with impunity on homes that were worth less than the amount of the debt,even if there were no legal justification whatsoever for the foreclosure.the potential consequences of wrongfully evicting homeowners are too severe to allow such a result.see miles deutsche bank national trust th,miles.
on the issue of standing,the supreme court stated,banks are neither private attorneys general nor bounty hunters,armed with a roving commission to seek out defaulting homeowners and take away their homes in satisfaction of some other bank deed of trust.yvanova,supra,cal th at.yvanova holding on standing would be undermined unless the same considerations applied in determining what prejudice must be alleged to constitute a wrongful foreclosure cause of action.ibid.therefore,we reverse the judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court erroneously sustained a demurrer to sciarratta first amended complaint without leave to amend,and remand for further proceedings.

sciarratta district court action 
on november,the day before the scheduled trustee sale sciarratta filed a count complaint against chase,deutsche bank,and crc in united states district court.the complaint states in part,this is an action to quiet title against parties who have wrongfully foreclosed upon residential real property of the plaintiff,but who in reality have no standing whatsoever to exercise any rights under the subject deed of trust that encumbers plaintiff realty.
the record provided by the parties does not inform us about any other aspects of this litigation except that in may the district court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice in favor of the defendants.
sciarratta state court action 
in february sciarratta filed a state court complaint for wrongful foreclosure,quiet title,and cancellation of instruments against bank national association as trustee successor in interest to bank of america,deutsche bank,and crc collectively,defendants.
sciarratta complaint alleges the foreclosure is wrongful in that the trustee that held the sale was not the proper trustee at the time of the sale and therefore the sale of the subject property is void as a matter of law or in the alternative the party that held the sale and acquired the subject property by way of a supposed credit bid was not the holder of the subject note and was not the beneficiary of the subject deed of trust and could not have submitted a credit bid.sciarratta original complaint did not allege particularized prejudice from the fact that bank of america rather than deutsche bank foreclosed.
defendants demurred to the complaint on the grounds the action was barred by the res judicata effect of the district court judgment of dismissal in sciarratta previous action,and sciarratta had not alleged the essential element of prejudice.the court overruled this demurrer.
after certain defaults were set aside that are not relevant to any issues in this appeal,defendants answered the complaint,and later sciarratta dismissed deutsche bank without prejudice.
motion for judgment on the pleadings 
in may defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,primarily asserting that sciarratta wrongful foreclosure claim fails as a matter of law because she did not and can not allege prejudice.defendants asserted,plaintiff alleges that the foreclosure sale was invalid because crc foreclosed on behalf of bank of america instead of deutsche bank,who plaintiff argues was the correct beneficiary.prejudice is an essential element of a wrongful foreclosure claim 
sciarratta opposed the motion for judgment on the pleadings on both procedural and substantive grounds.procedurally,she argued the motion was barred by code of civil procedure section,subdivision g,which provides that a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made after a demurrer has previously been overruled,provided that there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the ruling on the demurrer.sciarratta asserted there had been no such material change in law,and therefore the judgment on the pleadings was improper because the court had previously overruled a demurrer brought on the same grounds.substantively,sciarratta argued prejudice is not an element of wrongful foreclosure where,as she had alleged,the foreclosure sale is void 
the court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings,with leave to amend,on the grounds that p laintiff must adequately allege the element of prejudice.
first amended complaint 
in august sciarratta filed a first amended complaint for wrongful foreclosure,quiet title,and cancellation of instruments.in addition to facts alleged in the original complaint,sciarratta attempted to allege prejudice,that she had suffered damages from the wrongful foreclosure,stating 
plaintiff need not allege prejudice in this case because the claims made by plaintiff show that the parties that held the sale,bank of america and crc had no right to do so.regardless,as a result of the foreclosure sale of the subject property by bank of america and crc,plaintiff has suffered prejudice plaintiff has been prejudiced by the sale of the subject property by bank of america,an entity that has no right to hold a sale,because she was deprived of any right to prevent foreclosure,in that bank of america has no reason to work with plaintiff as mandated by california law before holding a foreclosure sale and no interest in providing plaintiff with information mandated by the california homeowners bill of rights before a foreclosure.as a result,plaintiff has been deprived of her substantial rights related to the prevention of a foreclosure to her prejudice.
demurrer to the first amended complaint 
defendants demurred to the first amended complaint on the grounds,among others,that sciarratta had failed to adequately allege the essential element of prejudice.unlike their demurrer to sciarratta original complaint,in this demurrer defendants did not argue the action was barred by res judicata 
at the hearing,sciarratta counsel stated,the facts are very clear and very simple.deutsche bank was the owner of this loan according to the public record at the time of this sale.and deutsche bank did not hold this sale.there was no dispute about that.bank of america did.citing glaski bank of america th glaski,sciarratta lawyer stated,prejudice is not an element in this particular circumstance.the reason that is the case is because we have a sale by someone,without question,sic had no right to hold a sale.
the court asked sciarratta attorney,a re there facts that can be pled that have not been pled now that would make me reconsider the no leave to amend after sciarratta attorney stated,i do think there are any new facts,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently entered a judgment dismissing her first amended complaint with prejudice.

ii.a homeowner who has been foreclosed on by one purporting to exercise rights under a void assignment suffers sufficient prejudice to state a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure 
wrongful foreclosure 
a wrongful foreclosure is a common law tort claim.it is an equitable action to set aside a foreclosure sale,or an action for damages resulting from the sale,on the basis that the foreclosure was improper.see miles,supra,th at.the elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action are t he trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal,fraudulent,or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust the party attacking the sale usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor was prejudiced or harmed and in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale,the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.id.at.m ere technical violations of the foreclosure process will not give rise to a tort claim the foreclosure must have been entirely unauthorized on the facts of the case.id.at.a ll proximately caused damages may be recovered.id.at.
o nly the entity currently entitled to enforce a debt may foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing that debt yvanova,supra,cal th at.it is no mere procedural nicety,from a contractual point of view,to insist that only those with authority to foreclose on a borrower be permitted to do so.id.at.
here,implicitly invoking these principles,sciarratta alleges that the entity entitled to enforce the debt was deutsche bank,but the entity that foreclosed was bank of america.specifically,she alleges that in april deutsche bank became the owner of her promissory note and trust deed by assignment from chase.sciarratta alleges that the subsequent purported assignments of the note and trust deed by chase to bank of america in november and again in december were void because chase had previously assigned the note and trust deed to deutsche bank.thus,sciarratta alleges bank of america had no right to foreclose because it never became a beneficiary of her deed of trust.
based on these allegations,which are supported by the judicially noticeable recorded documents,sciarratta alleges the november nonjudicial foreclosure was held by an entity other than the owner of the subject note and holder of the subject deed of t rust,bank of america,whom sic had no right to hold said sale or submit a credit bid thereon and as a result the sale is void and of no effect.in more colloquial terms,sciarratta appellate brief asserts,there is no question that as of the date of the sale bank of america had no right to hold a foreclosure sale of the subject property as the owner of the note and deed of trust was deutsche bank as of april.
sciarratta alleges a void assignment 
a void contract is without legal effect.yvanova,supra,cal th at.a voidable transaction,in contrast,is one where one or more parties have the power,by a manifestation of election to do so,to avoid the legal relations created by the contract,or by ratification of the contract to extinguish the power of avoidance.id.at.
yvanova holds that a borrower has legal authority standing to claim a nonjudicial foreclosure was wrongful because an assignment by which the foreclosing party purportedly took a beneficial interest in the deed of trust was not merely voidable but void,depriving the foreclosing party of any legitimate authority to order a trustee sale.yvanova,supra,cal th at.
here,sciarratta first amended complaint alleges that in november,when chase purported to assign sciarratta promissory note and deed of trust to bank of america,chase had nothing to assign,having previously in april assigned the promissory notes and deed of trust to deutsche bank.the documents properly subject to judicial notice are consistent with these allegations.on april,chase executed a document entitled assignment of deed of trust where it hereby grants assigns and transfers to deutsche bank all beneficial interest under that certain deed of trust executed by monica sciarratta t ogether with the note or notes therein described approximately six months later,on november,chase purported to assign the same trust deed and promissory notes to bank of america.
chase,having assigned all beneficial interest in sciarratta notes and deed of trust to deutsche bank in april,could not assign again the same interests to bank of america in november.see california bank trust piedmont operating partnership th,once a claim has been assigned,unless a contrary intention is shown,the assignment vests in the assignee the assigned contract or chose and all rights and remedies incidental thereto.
thus,assuming sciarratta allegations are true,as we must on review of the demurrer,the assignment to bank of america is void,and not merely voidable.yvanova,supra,cal th at glaski,supra,th at assignment void,not voidable,where entity invoking the power of sale was not the holder of the deed of trust see culhane aurora loan services of nebraska cir,culhane a mortgage assignment is void,not merely voidable,where the assignor had nothing to assign or no interest to assign wilson hsbc mortgage services,cir,wilson.as the supreme court in yvanova explained a homeowner has standing to challenge that assignment as void because success on the merits would prove the purported assignee is not,in fact,the mortgagee and therefore lacks any right to foreclose on the mortgage.yvanova,supra,cal th at.
defendants arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.citing hertz niobrara farms d,defendants contend the recording of an assignment to deutsche bank does not actually transfer an interest in property it merely serves as notice that a transfer has occurred.however,hertz is materially distinguishable because it involves a notice of substitution of trustee,not an assignment of the deed of trust and promissory notes.it is in the context of a notice substituting a trustee that the court states such documents grant no interest in real property.their main objective is notice id.at.
defendants also contend the c orrective a ssignment recorded in december demonstrated that beneficial interest had been assigned to bank of america,not deutsche bank.however,defendants cite no authority suggesting that as a matter of law,the c orrective a ssignment recorded in december has any relevant legal effect on the nonjudicial foreclosure occurring one month prior,in november.
defendants also argue that the c orrective a ssignment shows that a t most chase made procedural errors on the documents regarding the identity of the beneficiary,and that chase later corrected these errors.however,this is an appeal from a judgment of dismissal after a demurrer was sustained,where we are required to assume the truth of the facts plaintiff has alleged.defendants can not hijack sciarratta first amended complaint,delete allegations not to their liking,insert other contrary allegations such as this one about a mere procedural error,and contend the resulting pleading they have cobbled together fails to state a cause of action.sciarratta alleges that at the time of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale,deutsche bank was the assignee and bank of america was not.the judicially noticeable documents do not contradict these allegations.
defendants also contend that sciarratta complaint admits that deutsche bank was not the assignee and never held a beneficial interest in the deed of trust.however,the allegation defendants highlight is not contained in sciarratta cause of action for wrongful foreclosure,but rather in her cause of action to quiet title.in any event,an allegation that deutsche bank never held a legal or equitable interest in the property is not necessarily inconsistent with an allegation that bank of america also did not.
in sum,we hold that sciarratta has alleged the nonjudicial foreclosure was wrongful because an assignment by which the foreclosing party,bank of america,purportedly took a beneficial interest in the deed of trust was void.therefore,under yvanova,sciarratta has standing to assert such a claim 
sciarratta has adequately alleged prejudice for wrongful foreclosure 
sciarratta contends prejudice or harm,beyond the allegedly wrongful foreclosure itself,should not be required to be alleged in order to state a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure where,as here,it is alleged the foreclosing beneficiary interest is void.we agree.
a homeowner experiences prejudice or harm when an entity with no interest in the debt forecloses.when a forecloses,a homeowner is harmed because he or she has lost her home to an entity with no legal right to take it.if not for the void assignment,the incorrect entity would not have pursued a wrongful foreclosure.therefore,the void assignment is the of the homeowner injury and all he or she is required to allege on the element of prejudice.the critical issue is not the plaintiff ability to pay,but rather whether the defendant conduct resulted in the plaintiff harm,a foreclosure that was wrongful because it was initiated by a person or entity having no legal right to do so holding void title.as the supreme court stated in yvanova,the bank or other entity that ordered the foreclosure would not have done so absent the allegedly void assignment.thus,t he identified harm the foreclosure can be traced directly to the foreclosing entity exercise of the authority purportedly delegated by the assignment.yvanova,supra,cal th at.
there are also strong policy reasons favoring this approach.a contrary rule would lead to a legally untenable situation,that anyone can foreclose on a homeowner because someone has the right to foreclose.and since lenders can avoid the court system entirely through nonjudicial foreclosures,there would be no court oversight whatsoever.miles,supra,th at.moreover,giving homeowners who have the most at stake and the most to lose the ability to challenge improper loan assignments as being absolutely void will provide a proper incentive to lending institutions to employ due diligence to properly document assignments and confirm who currently holds a loan.the consequences of wrongfully evicting someone from their home are too severe to be left unchecked.ibid.
cases cited by defendants that reach a contrary result did not have the benefit of the supreme court decision in yvanova and as a result incorrectly and exclusively focus on the plaintiff ability to have avoided any foreclosure.for example,in fontenot wells fargo bank,th fontenot disapproved on other grounds standing in yvanova,supra,cal th at page,footnote,the court found that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from an allegedly improper transfer of her debt because the plaintiff conceded she was in default,did not allege the transfer interfered with her ability to pay her debt,and did not allege the original lender would have refrained from foreclosure.fontenot,supra,at.
similarly,in herrera federal national mortgage th herrera,disapproved on other grounds standing in yvanova,supra,cal th at page,footnote,the court found that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate prejudice where they had defaulted on their loan and could not cure the default.herrera,supra,th at.
thus,fontenot and herrera interpret prejudice narrowly to mean the plaintiff must demonstrate that she could have avoided foreclosure.these cases are inconsistent with the policies underlying the standing rule in yvanova the borrower owes money not to the world at large but to a particular person or institution,and only the person or institution entitled to payment may enforce the debt by foreclosing on the security.yvanova,supra,cal th at.fontenot and herrera also ignore the f
