background 
timmerman began her career in at bank predecessor company,bank western,as a teller.by,timmerman had attained the position of retail market manager,a position in which she was responsible for managing with chad royle several bank branches and supervising the branch managers at those locations.in,trish johnson became the northern colorado district manager to whom timmerman reported.that same year,during the course of a restructuring at bank,the position of retail market manager,timmerman position,was.as a result of the changes,both timmerman and her male were demoted to the position of branch manager.
timmerman continued in the position of branch manager until april,when her employment with bank was terminated.at the time of her termination,timmerman was years old.as part of corporate security,bank runs quarterly checks on fee reversals in its employees accounts and automatically generates a report for fee reversals in excess of.according to bank,it fired timmerman because,during the review period from november to january,she refunded overdraft charges,totaling,to two coworkers accounts in violation of company policy.timmerman does not dispute that she made the refunds,but claims instead that she was not aware the refunds were made in contravention of company policy,that she was only looking out for the financial interests of her,and that she did not think the refunds cost bank any money.
shortly after her termination,timmerman brought suit against bank,alleging sex and age discrimination in violation of title vii and the adea.during the course of discovery,timmerman admitted that,as branch manager,she had inherited an internal party fund account and had partially funded that account using bank fees,including coin counting and notary fees.in deposition testimony,timmerman also revealed that,subsequent to her termination,she removed dollars from the party fund and deposited it into a personal account at another bank.shortly after these admissions,bank sought and was granted leave to assert state law counterclaims against timmerman for civil theft,conversion,unjust enrichment,conspiracy,aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent misrepresentation.in response to bank counterclaims,timmerman sought and was granted leave to amend her complaint to add claims for retaliation under title vii and the adea,abuse of process,and conspiracy to violate her civil rights in violation of.
bank next moved for summary judgment as to all of timmerman claims along with its own claim against timmerman for civil theft.the district court granted bank motion as to each of timmerman federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over both parties remaining state law claims.in so doing,the district court imposed a limit on the length of both parties summary judgment briefs.on appeal,timmerman argues that the district court abused its discretion in limiting the length of the parties summary judgment briefs to twenty pages that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to bank on her sex and age discrimination claims because she brought forth sufficient evidence to demonstrate that bank asserted legitimate reason for her termination is pretextual that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to bank on her title vii and adea retaliation claims and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to bank on her claims.
discussion 
i.the district court limit on summary judgment briefs 
timmerman contends that the district court committed reversible error when it denied her request to submit a response brief to bank motion for summary judgment that exceeded the district court limit.timmerman maintains that the limitation,as applied to this particular case,prevented a full or even adequate recitation of the facts and legal arguments necessary to effectively combat the summary judgment motion.aplt.br.at.the district court refusal to allow timmerman additional pages of briefing is best characterized as a supervision of litigation decision,which we review for an abuse of discretion.see pierce underwood,d see also pippin burlington res.oil gas,cir.
when there is no federal rule pertaining to a particular subject or issue,federal judges may regulate the practice of law in their courts in any manner consistent with federal law,rules adopted under and,and local rules of the district.b.here,timmerman does not argue that the district court limitation is on its face inconsistent with federal law.moreover,no federal rule,including,dictates the number of pages to be permitted litigants in a response brief to a summary judgment motion.and the local rules of the district of colorado are similarly silent regarding page limitations on such briefs.see.civ.timmerman primary complaint about the district court page limitation is that she was unable to present further and more detailed information regarding her claims,and that it led to the dismissal of her case due to insufficient evidence or argument.aplt.br.at.
the only specific evidence that timmerman claims she would have been able to present to the district court in the absence of its page limitation is evidence that bank knew of the party fund,that timmerman had inherited the fund from a predecessor,and that the party fund was funded through various sources.see aplt.br.at.a review of timmerman amended response to bank motion for summary judgment,which fully complied with the district court page limitation,reveals that timmerman indeed presented all of this evidence to the district court,albeit in a footnote,and we presume it was considered.see aplt.app.at.moreover,the district court limitation also applied to bank summary judgment briefs,and therefore,timmerman was given twenty pages of briefing in order to respond to twenty pages of argument.
to be sure,one value implicit in.is that each party to a summary judgment motion,both moving and,be given an adequate opportunity to present argument and evidence supporting its respective position.see.f anderson liberty lobby,d.we can imagine a case where a page limitation even one set at twenty pages would be an abuse of discretion,and so district courts should remain flexible in the application of such a limitation.nonetheless,timmerman has not demonstrated that the district court limitation,in this case,rises to the level of an abuse of discretion.
ii.summary judgment as to timmerman federal claims 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.hackworth progressive cas.ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
title vii and adea sex and age discrimination claims 
timmerman alleges that she was terminated from her branch manager position at bank because she is a woman over forty years of age.she claims that her manager,trish johnson,preferred younger men in the position of branch manager and that bank proffered legitimate reason for her termination is merely pretext for johnson animus against females over the age of forty.bank,in turn,argues that timmerman has failed to bring forth sufficient evidence that its proffered nondiscriminatory reason for her firing is pretextual.the district court agreed with bank.
timmerman asserts both a sex discrimination claim pursuant to title vii and an age discrimination claim pursuant to the adea.title vii,among other things,makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual on account of that individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.the adea,on the other hand,broadly prohibits arbitrary discrimination in the workplace based on age.lorillard pons,d citing a.
where,as here,an employee sex or age discrimination claim relies exclusively on circumstantial,rather than direct,evidence,we apply the scheme of mcdonnell douglas green,d.see garrison gambro,cir invoking the mcdonnell douglas scheme where the plaintiff had asserted both a title vii sex discrimination claim and an adea age discrimination claim.that scheme first allocates the burden of production to the employee to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.if the employee is successful in doing so,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.id.the employer articulation of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action causes the presumption of discrimination attendant to the prima facie showing of discrimination to simply drop out of the picture.mary honor ctr.hicks,d.the employee then has the full burden to show that the employer discriminated on the basis of sex or age.bryant farmers ins,cir.the employee may do so by showing that the proffered reason is a pretext for illegal discrimination ingels thiokol,cir,abrogated on other grounds by martinez potter,cir.

here,bank does not dispute that timmerman has established a prima facie case of sex and age discrimination.timmerman,for her part,does not dispute that bank has come forth with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for her she reversed overdraft fees on two fellow employees accounts in the amount of.the sex and age discrimination claims,then,hinge upon a showing of pretext.timmerman asserts that the following evidence demonstrates the pretextual nature of bank proffered nondiscriminatory reason for her firing within two years of becoming district manager,johnson,replaced every single older female branch manager with a young man,aplt.br.at bank failed to apply its progressive discipline policy in timmerman case johnson treated timmerman more harshly than other employees who violated the same policy and there were disturbing procedural irregularities surrounding timmerman termination,aplt.br.at.
we note at the outset,however,that there exists fairly strong evidence in the record that johnson did not make the final decision to terminate timmerman.rather,it appears that steve lovas,the president of the region in which timmerman branch was located,made the final termination decision,and linda sincoff,an employee in human resources,made the recommendation that she be fired.see aplt.app.at.because there is no evidence that johnson actually caused timmerman termination,nor that lovas was merely a rubber stamp for johnson alleged prejudice,timmerman claims against bank necessarily fail.see campbell gambro healthcare,cir.nonetheless,there is deposition testimony from timmerman indicating that johnson informed her she was being terminated,see aplt.app.at,and bank,in its brief on appeal,admits that johnson terminated timmerman employment,aplee.br.at.as a result,and in an abundance of caution,our analysis proceeds as if johnson did indeed terminate timmerman.
johnson replacing female branch managers over the age of forty with younger men 
as previously mentioned,in,bank underwent a reorganization,at which time johnson became the northern colorado district manager in charge of six northern colorado bank branches.moreover,timmerman,who prior to the reorganization was a retail market manager a position higher than a branch manager,was demoted to branch manager.whereas five of the six branches under johnson control were managed by females over forty years of age prior to the reorganization after the reorganization only one of the six.timmerman loveland,colorado managed by a female over forty.despite the fact that timmerman was given a branch manager position,she argues that johnson replacement of older female branch managers with younger males during the reorganization demonstrates that the proffered reason for her firing is pretext for johnson alleged animus against older females.
it is uniformly recognized that statistical data showing an employer pattern of conduct toward a protected class can create an inference that an employer discriminated against individual members of the class.fallis,cir.on the other hand,s tatistics taken in isolation are generally not probative of discrimination,jones unisys,cir,and statistical evidence on its own will rarely suffice to show pretext,ortiz norton,cir.at the very least,in order to create an inference of pretext,a plaintiff statistical evidence must focus on eliminating nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparate treatment by showing disparate treatment between comparable individuals.fallis,at.
johnson failure to rehire other older female branch managers two years prior does not suffice to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason given for timmerman termination was false.in order for an employer former adverse employment actions to have any probative effect on an employee ability to demonstrate pretext as to subsequent adverse employment actions,there must be some logical nexus between the former and subsequent actions.coletti cudd pressure control,cir allowing the testimony of other employees as to an alleged pattern and practice of discrimination only where the plaintiff show s the circumstances involving the other employees are such that their statements can logically or reasonably be tied to the decision to terminate the plaintiff internal modifications omitted cone longmont united hosp.ass n,cir.when we say that statistical evidence must compare employees that are similarly situated,we ordinarily mean that the situation of the employees in the protected class must have been comparable to the situation of the employees in the class who were allegedly treated more favorably.see cone,at.nonetheless,we think it a matter of common sense that the probative value of statistical evidence will also vary depending upon the degree of difference between the situations of the protected employees within the statistical data set and the employee seeking to utilize that data.the fact that a plaintiff is required to demonstrate pretext does not grant a jury license to all prior hiring,firing and disciplinary decisions no matter how attenuated they might be from the challenged action.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.our role is to prevent unlawful hiring practices,not to act as a super personnel department that second guesses employers business judgments.
timmerman circumstances are not remotely comparable to what occurred when johnson did not rehire the female branch managers.to begin,timmerman was not among the group of incumbent branch managers that had to reapply for their positions.see aplt.app.instead,timmerman and chad royle,a male retail market manager,were both simply assigned branches to manage in fact,timmerman admits that a nyone that was in my position or the sales manager position sort of got to choose what branches they wanted to be in.aplt.app.at.
also,despite johnson alleged animus,timmerman survived the reorganization.two years later she was terminated for disciplinary reasons.thus,there is a logical disconnect between the situation of the incumbent female branch managers and timmerman firing.had timmerman brought a charge of discrimination arising out of her demotion during the reorganization,then statistical evidence that a large percentage of female branch managers over the age of forty were not rehired during the same time period would surely have been probative of pretext.on the other hand,the same statistical evidence is not probative in this lawsuit where the alleged discriminatory animus in the decision to entirely different adverse employment two years after the protected employees within the statistical data set were not rehired and under completely different circumstances see baylie fed.reserve bank,cir in individual discrimination cases,studies of probabilities are less helpful.leblanc great am.ins,cir a company overall employment statistics will have little direct bearing on the specific intentions of the employer when dismissing a particular individual.given the large disparity in circumstances,we doubt the evidence regarding the failure to rehire the incumbent female branch managers meets the relevance standard of.but even if it does,no rational trier of fact could infer pretext from it in timmerman case.see anderson,at.
finally,the evidence does not support timmerman argument that johnson failure to rehire more incumbent female branch managers was discriminatory in the first place.during the august reorganization at bank,the position of branch manager was sales and service manager,a position which focused primarily on operations and service.the new branch manager position,was heavily focused on sales.apparently,as a result,the incumbent branch managers automatically became sales and service managers and were given the option of applying for a branch manager position if they so desired.
the problem for timmerman is that the evidence in the record demonstrates that only one of the incumbent branch managers connie harding applied for the new branch manager position harding was interviewed for a branch manager position,but johnson determined she was not the candidate because she did not have a strong sales background aplt.app.at.timmerman has offered no evidence that this reason was pretextual.nor is there evidence tending to show that any of the incumbent branch managers,other than harding,even applied for a new branch manager position.although timmerman contends in her affidavit that johnson discouraged mcdowell from applying,no supporting facts based on personal knowledge are included.additionally,timmerman assessment of the applicants relative qualifications is based on her subjective and limited knowledge of the respective applicants and applicant pools.and she has not shown an overwhelming disparity in the qualifications of those who were and were not hired as branch managers.see bullington united air lines,cir,abrogated on other grounds by passenger morgan,d w e emphasize that an employer does not violate title vii by choosing between equally qualified candidates,so long as the decision is not based on unlawful criteria the disparity in qualifications must be overwhelming to be evidence of pretext.finally,the evidence indicates that more men applied for the open branch manager positions than did women,and thus the chance that those positions would be filled with men was naturally greater.in short,timmerman has not eliminated the very distinct possibility that johnson replaced every female branch manager with a young man not out of discriminatory animus,but because the female branch managers either did not apply for the new branch manager position or were not as qualified as a competing younger male.
it also appears that timmerman is attempting to use johnson prior treatment of the female branch managers when compared with the hiring decisions of another district manager in a contiguous wyoming district to show that some general disdain for females over forty years of age tainted johnson decision to terminate her.admittedly,we have previously held that evidence of discrimination in employment decisions affecting other workers could support an inference that the decision makers harbored a bias against the protected class which might have affected other decisions,including the decisions adverse to the plaintiff.ortiz,at.this does not mean,however,that evidence as to the prior mistreatment of employees in a protected class necessarily gives rise to an inference that all subsequent employment decisions adversely affecting that protected class or someone in it,no matter how unrelated,are also tainted with bias.rather,some nexus between th e circumstantial evidence of general bias and the decision to terminate is required.english.dep t of,cir.this generally requires the plaintiff to show that the alleged general discriminatory animus on the part of the employer played a direct role in the adverse employment decision in the plaintiff case.see also id.at lucero,concurring.in the instant case,timmerman has brought forth no evidence that might arguably show a nexus between johnson alleged general bias against older females assuming she even had one and her firing of timmerman for the reversal of overdraft fees.thus,timmerman proffered evidence regarding johnson hiring of younger males to run five of the six northern colorado branches does not demonstrate pretext.
although timmerman argues otherwise,our prior decision in greene safeway stores,cir does not dictate a different conclusion.to begin,greene is not a case about pretext.the issue we confronted in greene was whether the district court erred in taking the case away from the jury by granting judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiff case.id.at.our task,therefore,was to determine whether greene had succeeded in establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination under the mcdonnell douglas scheme or,in the alternative,whether he had met his evidentiary burden directly,by presenting direct or circumstantial evidence that age was a determining factor in his discharge.id.at.because greene had succeeded in presenting sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case directly,we did not answer the question of whether he had also established a prima facie case under the mcdonnell douglas scheme timmerman,on the other hand,relies exclusively on the mcdonnell douglas framework,not on direct evidence of discrimination,and thus any value greene might have to her case is strictly through analogy.
unfortunately for timmerman,greene is hardly analogous to the instant case.in greene,each and every one of the adverse employment actions on which the plaintiff relied had occurred within twelve months of the adverse employment action that the plaintiff suffered.see id.at.thus,the temporal proximity that is lacking in this case was obviously present in greene.there was also a stronger indication in greene that the other employees had been adversely affected by the same discrimination that greene claimed to have suffered all retired,resigned,or were fired within a short period of time.see id.at.here,the incumbent branch managers merely had their titles changed and were offered the opportunity to apply for the new branch manager position and only one took advantage of that opportunity.it is a stretch to say that these adverse employment actions if that is even an accurate characterization of them fall into the same category as timmerman termination two years later for refunding overdraft fees on coworkers accounts.finally,in greene,there was additional evidence of,the statements of safeway which a jury could infer discriminatory animus.as will be discussed further below,there is no similar evidence of discriminatory animus in this case.consequently,greene is of no assistance to timmerman in her quest to avoid summary judgment.
bank failure to utilize its progressive discipline policy 
timmerman next maintains that bank failure to utilize its policy of progressive discipline in her case demonstrates pretext.it is that pretext can be shown by evidence that the defendant acted contrary to a written company policy prescribing the action to be taken by the defendant under the circumstances.kendrick penske transp,cir.
as an initial matter,it is abundantly clear that bank policies,at the time of timmerman firing,forbade a branch manager from refunding fees on branch employees accounts without approval from higher powers.bank employee handbook stated 
employees are not allowed to process or approve transactions relating to the accounts of personal acquaintances specifically,this includes,but is not limited to,refunding,reversing or waiving fees there may be other specific restrictions pertaining to transactions on the accounts of.
aplt.app.at.and both bank code of ethics and business conduct and its manager guide to the code of ethics contained the same,or a very similar,provision.see aplt.app.at.moreover,any ambiguity regarding the ability of a branch manager to unilaterally approve fee reversals on her employees accounts was resolved when in december lovas sent a memorandum to all employees reiterating bank policy on fee reversals and explaining that there may be times when employees have legitimate requests to have fees refunded or waived.however,in order to avoid conflicts or misunderstandings,all such requests must go through a district manager,market president or myself.aplt.app.at.lastly,numerous other branch managers indicated that they were aware and understood that all fee reversals on coworkers accounts required at least district manager approval see aplt.app.at.as a result,bank could reasonably believe that timmerman had violated company policy.see pastran,cir t he pertinent question in determining pretext is not whether the employer was right to think the employee engaged in misconduct,but whether that belief was genuine.
whether,given bank reasonable belief that timmerman had violated company policy,its decision to immediately terminate her is evidence of pretext constitutes an entirely distinct question.it is one that timmerman requests we answer in the affirmative because she claims that bank failed to follow a mandatory progressive discipline policy when it fired her.the fallacy in timmerman argument is that bank,at the time of her termination,had no policy requiring progressive discipline where employees were discovered to have refunded fees on coworkers accounts.instead,bank policy made it crystal clear that termination could result from improper fee reversals timmerman even admits that the decision of what kind of discipline should be imposed was up to the discretion of the supervisor.aplt.br.at.timmerman focuses on the fact that termination was not mandatory,but that assertion,while factually correct,is inapposite.what matters is not whether termination was mandatory,but whether progressive discipline for employees violating the fee reversal policy was mandatory.because progressive discipline was entirely discretionary in such cases,and bank,therefore,did not ignore any established company policy in its choice of sanction,the failure to implement progressive discipline is not evidence of pretext.
we offer one last observation with respect to bank failure to utilize progressive discipline as evidence of pretext.the district court noted that i t may well be true that defendant decision was intemperate and unfair but that s uch considerations are not within the purview of title vii or the adea.timmerman,wl,at.we agree,and note that the issue is not whether the decision to terminate timmerman was wise,fair or correct,but whether bank reasonably believed at the time of the termination that timmerman had violated company policy,and acted in good faith upon that belief.young dillon,cir.neither title vii nor the adea prohibits an employer from making hasty decisions that appear harsh what they forbid are decisions made with discriminatory animus.see flasher,cir.
bank more favorable treatment of other employees 
timmerman asserts that bank disparate treatment of her in comparison to other bank employees caught reversing fees on coworkers accounts also establishes pretext.a plaintiff seeking to show pretext often does so by providing evidence that he was treated differently from other employees who violated work rules of comparable seriousness.kendrick,at.similarly situated employees are those who deal with the same supervisor and are subject to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline.aramburu boeing,cir.also,a difference in treatment between two employees by the same supervisor does not automatically give rise to a title vii or adea claim 
sometimes apparently irrational differences in treatment between different employees that can not be explained on the basis of clearly articulated company policies may be explained by the fact that the discipline was administered by different supervisors,or that the events occurred at different times when the company attitudes toward certain infractions were different,or that the individualized circumstances surrounding the infractions offered some mitigation for the infractions less severely punished,or even that the less severely sanctioned employee may be more valuable to the company for nondiscriminatory reasons than is the other employee.other times,no rational explanation for the differential treatment between the plaintiff and the comparison employees may be offered other than the inevitability that human relationships can not be structured with mathematical precision,and even that explanation does not compel the conclusion that the defendant was acting with a secret,illegal discriminatory motive.
flasher,at internal citations and footnote omitted.hence,it is up to the plaintiff to establish not only that differential treatment occurred,but also to rule out nondiscriminatory explanations for the differential treatment.see id.
timmerman points first to the disparate treatment of shaunna stewart,a branch manager in wyoming,as evidence of pretext.according to timmerman,stewart reversed overdraft charges on her own account on two separate occasions but was given only a written warning.timmerman and stewart,however,are not similarly situated because stewart did not report to johnson see kendrick,at different supervisors will inevitably react differently to employee subordination.there is also no evidence that the number and amount of stewart reversals were comparable to the reversals for that timmerman performed.accordingly,the fact that stewart only received a written warning is of no relevance.
timmerman also states that a greeley,colorado branch employee refunded fees on her own account but was not terminated.timmerman has presented no evidence,however,to show that this employee was a branch manager,was under the supervision of johnson at the time of the incident,was not also a female over forty years of age,or refunded an amount of fees comparable to the timmerman refunded.
finally,timmerman argues that pretext is established by the fact that,shortly after her termination,jeff jiron,a male branch manager under the supervision of johnson,refunded a coworker fee and received no discipline at all.while this evidence comes closest to the type needed to show pretext,it nonetheless falls short.first,as the district court noted,timmerman has provided no information that johnson,or anyone else at bank,was even aware that jiron had reversed a coworker fee.this lack of knowledge,and not discriminatory animus,therefore,explains the disparate treatment.also,even assuming knowledge on the part of johnson,timmerman has failed to show that the amount of jiron fee reversal was comparable to the in fees timmerman refunded.this is crucial because in order to infer that the disparate treatment of two similarly situated employees was tinged with discriminatory animus,the two employees violations of company policy must be of comparable seriousness.see id.at explaining that the failure to terminate similar situated employees for violations of work rules did not show pretext because the employees did not violate work rules of comparable seriousness to plaintiff.because timmerman has not shown such to be the case,johnson alleged disparate treatment of jiron is insufficient for timmerman to survive summary judgment on the issue of pretext.
the disturbing procedural irregularities 
lastly,timmerman argues that there existed disturbing procedural irregularities surrounding her termination and that this is evidence of pretext.we have previously held that disturbing procedural irregularities surrounding an adverse employment action may demonstrate that an employer proffered nondiscriminatory business reason is pretextual.see simms,at.the procedural irregularities about which timmerman complains are a gap between the time johnson first contacted timmerman about the fee reversals and the time timmerman was terminated,and the omission of any mention of the fee reversal issue in an employee performance appraisal timmerman underwent just a month prior to her termination.but neither of these things are evidence of pretext because neither can,objectively,be described as a disturbing procedural irregularity.timmerman has pointed to no bank policy which required either immediate termination or that a fee reversal issue be included in an employee performance appraisal.rather,the evidence indicates that johnson waited before taking any action in order to confirm that the fee reversals occurred,to verify that timmerman was responsible for them,and to consider termination versus a final written warning.aplee.at.simply put,timmerman has not shown that there were disturbing procedural irregularities surrounding her termination.thus,the district court properly granted summary judgment to bank on timmerman sex and age discrimination claims.
title vii and adea retaliation claims 
along with her sex and age discrimination claims,timmerman brought title vii and adea retaliation claims as a result of bank filing of counterclaims against her in this litigation.bank filed state law counterclaims for civil theft,conversion,unjust enrichment,civil conspiracy,aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent misrepresentation.these claims all arose out of timmerman alleged use of coin counting and notary fees to partially fund an internal party fund account from which,at the time of her termination,she withdrew.timmerman contends that the only reason bank filed its counterclaims was in retaliation for her filing of sex and age discrimination claims against it.the district court granted summary judgment to bank on timmerman retaliation claims,reasoning that the filing of counterclaims is not an adverse employment action and timmerman had not shown that bank decision to file its counterclaims was causally connected to timmerman protected activity.see timmerman,wl,at.we agree with the district court that summary judgment for bank on timmerman retaliation claims is appropriate,although for a different reason.
both title vii and the adea forbid employers from retaliating against an employee when that employee takes action in opposition to a discriminatory practice.see a d.in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,an employee must show that she engaged in protected activity she suffered an adverse employment action and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.duncan,dep t of safety,cir.similar to a discrimination claim,once the employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.ferguson constr,cir.if such a reason is successfully articulated,the employee must then demonstrate that the employer proffered reason for the adverse action is pretextual.id.
there is no doubt that timmerman has satisfied the first prong of a prima facie case of engaged in the protected activity of filing a lawsuit against bank for alleged sex and age discrimination.the parties disagree,however,on whether the counterclaims filed against timmerman constitute an adverse employment action and whether there is a causal connection between timmerman filing of sex and age discrimination claims and bank allegedly retaliatory counterclaims.
timmerman is correct that following the supreme court recent decision in burlington northern santa fe railway white,d,the applicable standard for whether an adverse employment action has occurred is whether the employer actions would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant.id.at.in other words,the employer actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.while it is certainly an interesting question whether the filing of counterclaims in response to discrimination claims brought by a former employee constitutes an adverse employment action,that question,along with the disputed causation issue,need not be decided in this case.even assuming,arguendo,that timmerman has established a prima facie case of retaliation,bank has come forward with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for filing its counterclaims,and timmerman has failed to demonstrate that bank reason is pretextual.
bank explains that it decided to bring its counterclaims against timmerman only after she admitted,during deposition testimony,that she partially funded an internal bank party fund account using coin counting and notary fees,that she knew the money did not belong to her personally,and that she withdrew a portion of the money from the party fund after she was fired and deposited it in her own account at another bank.aplt.app.at.we think that the potential diversion and withdrawal of bank funds is a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer to file counterclaims against that employee in an attempt to retrieve what was alleged and here admitted to have been taken.
given bank legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for filing its counterclaims,the burden shifts to timmerman to show that the proffered reason is merely pretext for a retaliatory adverse employment action.this timmerman has not done.most importantly,timmerman has not shown,nor does she even seem to argue,that bank counterclaims are devoid of merit.bill johnson,d the filing and prosecution of a lawsuit may not be enjoined even if it would not have been commenced but for the plaintiff desire to retaliate against the defendant for exercising his or her rights.as indicated above,based on timmerman admissions during deposition testimony,bank state law counterclaims against timmerman had a factual basis.
in her attempt to show that bank counterclaims were purely retaliatory,timmerman primarily relies on the fact that bank did not file its counterclaims against her until nine months after her original sex and age filed.timmerman claims that bank was aware that she had taken the party account funds as far back as september,but did nothing about it until nine months after the september filing of her discrimination claims.while timmerman is correct that there is some evidence indicating that,in september,several bank employees,including corporate security,became aware of the sources of the internal party fund along with timmerman withdrawal of funds upon her departure,this evidence,standing alone,is not enough to show pretext.even assuming that bank was aware,in,that timmerman may have taken bank funds,it did not have timmerman admission until her deposition was taken in april.in sum,timmerman has not shown that bank proffered nondiscriminatory reason for filing its state law counterclaims was pretextual,and thus the district court correctly granted summary judgment to bank.
conspiracy claim against bank 
timmerman final federal claim is that bank engaged in conspiratorial acts with its outside counsel to interfere with her civil rights in violation of.a claim under arises when
