the united states appeals from the decision of the court of federal claims awarding hometown financial,and continental financial holdings,collectively hometown for breach of contract.because there is a contract between the plaintiffs and the government,because the contract does not shift the risk of regulatory change to the plaintiffs,and because the government can not demonstrate clear error in the trial court conclusion that there was no prior material breach on the part of the plaintiffs,we affirm.
this is a case.see united states winstar,d.the judgment and underlying findings and decisions from which the united states appeals can be found in three court of federal claims opinions.see hometown,united states,fed.cl.hometown iii hometown,united states,fed.cl.hometown ii hometown,united states,fed.cl.hometown i.as set forth in more detail in hometown i,the transaction at issue involved the voluntary supervisory conversion of hometown federal savings and loan into hometown federal savings bank.see fed.cl.at.the conversion was based on two business plans,which generally called for the formation of a holding company and interim thrift,which would merge with the savings and loan to leave a single surviving institution controlled by the investors.id.the plans contained a list of regulatory forbearances,which the investors requested from regulators before agreeing to provide the required capital.in particular,the investors sought to use the goodwill created by the conversion to meet regulatory capital requirements.id.
the federal home loan bank board fhlbb approved the conversion on june.see fhlbb resolution.approval was made contingent on the execution by the holding company of a regulatory capital maintenance agreement rcma and the execution by the holding company major shareholder continental financial of a regulatory capital agreement rcmda.id.the documents were executed,and the conversion completed.
the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,stat.firrea,was passed on august.consequently,as reflected in an office of thrift supervision report of examination as a result of the new firrea legislation,all forbearances have been eliminated,and the institution now fails all three capital requirements.see hometown fsb ots report of examination,january,emphasis added.thus,due to the passage of firrea,the office of thrift supervision deemed hometown federal savings bank insolvent.id.when hometown the plaintiffs refused to infuse more capital to meet the capital requirements,hometown federal savings bank was placed in receivership.fed.cl.at.
hometown sued and,relevant to this appeal,asserted that by the passage of firrea,the elimination of forbearances,and the seizure of hometown federal savings bank,the government was liable for damages under a theory of breach of contract.
in hometown i,addressing for partial summary judgment on liability,the court of federal claims held that a contract was formed between the plaintiffs and the government.id.at.the court determined that the plaintiffs fulfilled promise to infuse into the converted institution was made in exchange for the forbearances and the treatment of goodwill offered by the fhlbb.id.the court found that hometown had not,like the plaintiffs in guaranty financial services,ryan,cir,contractually assumed the risk of the effect of regulatory change.fed.cl.at.rather,the court held that by contract the parties had for a period reserved to the government the risk of regulatory change affecting goodwill and forbearances.id.observing that firrea was passed within the period and unquestionably took away those forbearances and the promised use of goodwill,the court concluded that the government had breached the agreement.id.at.
in hometown ii,the court of federal claims addressed the government summary judgment motion with respect to hometown damages claims.the court denied the government motion as it related to restitution damages,determining that restitution in the amount of was appropriate because that amount reflected the benefit conferred by hometown on the government.fed.cl.at.the court granted the government motion as it related to expectancy damages,or lost profits,because such damages arose from an injury to the corporation and not to the shareholders directly.id.at.
after conducting a trial,the court of federal claims held in hometown iii that hometown had not materially breached its contract with the government,and accordingly,the government was not absolved from liability for its breach.fed.cl.at.
the government appeals,and we review a decision of the court of federal claims pursuant to a.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant.see anderson united states.we otherwise review conclusions of law of the court of federal claims de novo,while reviewing findings of fact made by the court of federal claims for clear error.see glendale fed.bank,fsb united states.
the first issue we must decide is whether a contract came into existence between the government and the plaintiffs.the existence of a contract is a mixed question of law and fact.see anderson,at.to prove the existence of a contract with the government,a plaintiff must prove four basic elements mutuality of intent to contract offer and acceptance consideration and a government representative having actual authority to bind the united states.see cal.fed.bank,fsb united states.
in this case,the government challenges the findings of the court of federal claims concerning elements and.in particular,the government contends that no contract was formed because government regulators had no authority to make a promise to hometown concerning the treatment of goodwill,and,alternatively,because the parties did not have the shared intent to contract for the treatment of goodwill.hometown disagrees,asserting that authority existed for the government to make a promise concerning the treatment of goodwill,and that there is ample objective evidence that the parties did have a shared intent concerning the treatment of goodwill.we discern no reversible error in the decision of the court of federal claims,and therefore agree with hometown.
as we previously set forth in california federal,government regulators,and in terms of this case,particularly the fhlbb and federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic,have authority to bargain for and enter into contracts in which the government promises the favorable regulatory treatment of goodwill in exchange for the assumption of the net liabilities of a failing thrift 
we have already answered the question of whether the fhlbb and the fslic have the authority to enter into contracts like these in the affirmative.winstar united states,winstar ii since its inception,the fslic has had the authority under c to make contracts.id.further,both the fslic and its supervisory agency,the fhlbb,have had the authority both to extend assistance to acquirers of insolvent thrifts,f a repealed,and to set minimum capital limits on a basis,t repealed.
cal,at internal quotes omitted.
this holding was recently reaffirmed following a government challenge that it was erroneous in light of our decision in schism united states,en banc.see cal.fed.bank united states.in reevaluating and rejecting for a second time the government argument that the fhlbb did not have authority to enter contracts regarding treatment of goodwill that were binding on the government,we relied on the supreme court analysis in winstar,which,as set forth at at,states 
there is no question that the bank board and fslic had ample statutory authority to do what the court of federal claims and the federal circuit found they did do,that is,promise to permit respondents to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward regulatory capital and to pay respondents damages if that performance became impossible.
the remainder of our analysis of the winstar opinion makes unequivocally clear that we are bound by the holding that the fhlbb had statutory authority to enter into contracts involving the treatment of regulatory capital and that congress specifically acknowledged the fhlbb authority to permit thrifts to count goodwill toward capital requirements.id.at.
the government would distinguish the california federal decisions from the case at bar because in its view,the authority for the contracts in california federal flowed not from c,which,again according to the government,merely generally empowers the fhlbb to enter contracts,but from a more specific subsection of the statute,namely,f.in the government view,section c is statutorily insufficient to support actual authority for an fhlbb promise of favorable accounting treatment of goodwill.this contention was disposed of in our recent decision in home savings of america,fsb united states.in home savings,as in california federal,we analyzed the supreme court winstar opinion,holding that the supreme court necessarily relied on the general grant of authority under section c,and not the authority granted in section f as authorization for two of the three transactions in winstar,at.thus,the authority of section c is sufficient.in any event,because we are bound to follow our own precedent as set forth by prior panels,see fort howard paper,mother restaurant,mama pizza,accord south united states,en banc,we reject the government argument that the fhlbb had no authority to enter into a contract with the plaintiffs regarding the regulatory treatment of goodwill.
the government contends that even if authority to contract exists,the trial court erroneously concluded that the government intended a contract with terms addressing the treatment of goodwill.as postured,the government argument appears more directed to interpretation than formation.however,to the extent the government is arguing a failure of formation due to a lack of objective evidence of the government intent because no promise regarding goodwill was ever made to plaintiffs,we disagree.
whether a exchange occurred depends on the surrounding factual circumstances.see cal,at.in this case,the government has shown no error in the holding of the court of federal claims that the correspondence,memoranda,forbearance letters,and regulatory maintenance and dividend agreements gave rise to a contract which included provisions addressing goodwill.we note in particular four documents as evidence of the government intent to contract for the treatment of goodwill,fhlbb resolution,the rcma,the rcmda,and the forbearance letter of december.
fhlbb resolution,dated june,makes approval conditional on,inter alia,the execution of the rcma,and provides that the regulatory capital maintenance and dividend condition shall be deemed met if the acquiror signs the attached rcmda.at.both the rcma and the rcmda were executed on june,by the plaintiffs and the supervisory agent for the fslic.both agreements extensively discuss the treatment of regulatory capital,and both agreements also contain the following language 
regulatory capital requirement means the institution regulatory capital requirement at a given time computed in accordance with b,or any successor regulation thereto,except that during the period following consummation of the acquisition of the institution,the regulatory capital requirement of the institution shall take into account forbearances granted by the fhlbb by letter dated december,and those granted by the principal supervisory agent of the federal home loan bank of indianapolis by letter dated april.
section.at and.these sections of the agreements reference forbearances granted by an fhlbb letter dated december.the december,letter issued in connection with the transaction,states that for purposes of reporting to the bank board,the value of any intangible asset resulting from the application of accounting may be amortized by hometown federal over a period of years by the method.
on balance,these documents,together with the other documents,facts,and circumstances relied on by the court of federal claims separate this case from d n bank united states,on which the government heavily relies.in d n bank,we noted the complete absence of any documentary proof that the parties mutually intended to lock in by contract any provision for amortization of goodwill.at.in this case,there is abundant documentary proof of mutual intent for such a contract provision.
even assuming a contract was formed,argues the government,the contract reflects that the parties intended to place the risk of regulatory change squarely on hometown.this presents a question of contract interpretation,a question of law that we review de novo.see cienega gardens united states.
in its winstar opinion,the supreme court explained that in like contracts the parties had the power to promise to insure against the risk of loss associated with regulatory change.at.in this regard,the court noted with approval the example set in an eleventh circuit opinion on the issue 
to be sure,each side could have eliminated any serious contest about the correctness of their interpretive positions by using clearer language.see,guaranty financial services,ryan,finding,based on very different contract language,that the government had expressly reserved the right to change the capital requirements without any responsibility to the acquiring thrift.
the similarity in contract language between the present case and guaranty,as well as our opinion in admiral financial united states,underlie the government contention that the parties shifted the risk of regulatory change to hometown.
like the present case,the transactions in both admiral and guaranty involved the rescue of failing thrifts with the infusion of capital from investors.also like the present case,the transactions involved rcmdas,see admiral,at guaranty,at.the agreements all contain a provision that states 
all references to regulations of the board or the fslic used in this agreement shall include any successor regulation thereto,it being expressly understood that subsequent amendments to such regulations may be made and that such amendments may increase or decrease the acquirors obligation under this agreement.
admiral,at citing clause vi d,miscellaneous provisions guaranty,at citing article vi d emphasis removed.clause v d,miscellaneous provisions.
the agreements in admiral,guaranty,and the present case are not,however,identical.the admiral agreement contained a section of definitions containing a clause,which states 
regulatory capital requirement means the institution regulatory capital requirement at a given time computed in accordance with,or any successor regulation thereto.
see admiral fin.united states,appeal,at,decided at admiral.
article i e of the guaranty rcmda states as follows 
regulatory capital requirement means the institution regulatory capital requirement at a given time computed in accordance with b,or any successor regulation thereto.
see guaranty,at.as set forth in the eleventh circuit opinion,the asterisk directs the reader to a note that reads,see exhibit a,fhlbb forbearance letter,dated december.id.
as noted above,the rcma and rcmda of the present case also contain a definitions section,which states 
regulatory capital requirement means the institution regulatory capital requirement at a given time computed in accordance with b,or any successor regulation thereto,except that during the period following consummation of the acquisition of the institution,the regulatory capital requirement of the institution shall take into account forbearances granted by the fhlbb by letter dated december,and those granted by the principal supervisory agent of the federal home loan bank of indianapolis by letter dated april.
at and emphasis added.the forbearance letter of december,contains five forbearances,at least two of which appear to be relevant here.the first forbearance states 
t he fslic will forbear,for a period of five years following consummation of the acquisition,from exercising its authority,under section of the insurance regulations for any failure of hometown federal to meet the net worth requirement of section arising solely from inter alia,assets attributable to the savings and loan.
at.the fifth forbearance is very similar to the third forbearance of guaranty,see supra note.it states
