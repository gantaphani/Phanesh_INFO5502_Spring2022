doggerel aside,the issue presented in this case is whether the statute of limitations period set forth in a applies to claims for refunds made by those who have mistakenly filed a return and paid tax when they were not actually required to file a tax return.and as the beatles probably would have guessed,the lamentable answer is yes.
wachovia bank is the trustee for the george nunamann trust,which was created in.since,when it was reformed in order to meet the requirements of c,the trust has qualified as a charitable remainder trust that is exempt from federal income tax.having qualified for that status,the trust has not been obligated since to file a fiduciary income tax return or to pay income tax,but only to file an information return.unfortunately,wachovia failed to recognize the trust tax exempt status after its reformation,and filed income tax returns for and continued to pay taxes out of the trust for the through tax years.
having belatedly realized its mistake,on may,wachovia filed with the irs amended forms requesting a refund of the taxes inadvertently paid on behalf of the trust for the and tax years.in a letter dated august,the irs denied those refund claims,which totaled.the denial letter explained that the claims for a refund as to those tax years were barred by the statute of limitations set forth in a.soon after,wachovia filed this lawsuit in the district court seeking the amount it had paid by mistake for the and tax years.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the government contended that wachovia suit was because it had not filed an administrative claim for a refund within the time limits established by a.wachovia did not dispute that it had filed its claims for refunds after the time limit had expired.instead,wachovia contended that did not apply to its refund claims because it was never required to file a tax return for the trust to begin with.wachovia position was that only the general statute of limitations,outside the tax code,the one set forth in a,applied to its refund claim.the district court found merit in wachovia position,and concluded that the limitations period in applies only to taxpayers who are required to file tax returns.based on that reasoning,it granted wachovia motion for summary judgment.the government appeals.
section a,titled limitations on credit or refund,sets forth the limitations period for tax refund claims 
period of limitation on filing for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by this title in respect of which tax the taxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later,or if no return was filed by the taxpayer,within years from the time the tax was paid.claim for the credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by this title which is required to be paid by means of a stamp shall be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the tax was paid.
a tax payment may constitute an overpayment even when no tax liability exists.the tax code provides 
rule where no tax amount paid as tax shall not be considered not to constitute an overpayment solely by reason of the fact that there was no tax liability in respect of which such amount was paid.
c emphasis added.the double negative in that provision means that even if one never owed tax in the first place but paid tax anyway,the mistaken payment constitutes an overpayment.see id.the sensible idea,somewhat obscured in the tax code speak of that provision,is that because anything is more than nothing,any payment is an overpayment when no payment was due.
a district court has jurisdiction to entertain civil actions against the government for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.a.the section of the tax code which governs civil actions for a refund,a,states that before a taxpayer can file suit against the government to recover tax that he alleges the irs has in any manner wrongfully collected,he must duly file an administrative claim for refund according to the provisions of law in that regard and in accordance with the relevant regulations.a.if the requirements of a are not met,a court has no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claim for refund.see id.
a general statute of limitations outside of the tax code,titled time for commencing action against united states,applies to suits against the federal government and provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.this case requires us to interpret those statutes.
wachovia position here,as in the district court,is that the general limitations period applies but the a limitations period does not.that has to be its position,because wachovia concedes that the claims for refund it filed with the irs for the and tax years came more than three years after it had filed the returns for those years and also more than two years after it had paid taxes for them.if a applies,wachovia loses.
wachovia argument against the application of a is simple.it focuses on these thirteen words of the statutory language in respect of which tax the taxpayer is required to file a return.a.wachovia contends that the plain meaning of that language is that a applies only to taxpayers who are required to file a return,and that the reference in that language to the taxpayer means to the specific refund claimant only,not taxpayers generically.if that argument is correct,wachovia wins because everyone agrees the trust was not required to file a tax return.
the government position is that a should not be read in isolation but instead in conjunction with and also with a treasury regulation,a,which relates to a.that regulation provides 
a in the case of any tax other than a tax payable by stamp 
if a return is filed,a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment must be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the return was filed or within years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later.
if no return is filed,the claim for credit or refund of an overpayment must be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the tax was paid.
b in the case of any tax payable by means of a stamp,a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of such tax must be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the tax was paid.
a a b emphasis added.
the government contends that a and a cover the universe of claims for refunds and divide that universe into two categories.the first category of refund claims is defined in the opening sentence of a,as well as by subsection a of the regulation,and it includes any tax that is payable by return instead of stamp.the second category is defined by the second sentence of a,as well as by subsection b of the regulation,and it includes any tax that is payable by stamp instead of return.no taxes fall through the cracks of a and the regulation,because every tax is payable either by return or stamp.under this reading no tax refunds are governed by the code general statute of limitations contained in.in other words,either a tax is payable by stamp or it is not,and if it is not,a claim for refund of an overpayment must be made within three years from the time the return was filed.see a.
if the government reading of a and the regulation is correct,then wachovia loses.it loses because the statute of limitations contained in a applies to its effort to secure an income tax refund,and wachovia waited more than three years to begin that effort.
the government attacks wachovia reliance on the taxpayer language in a by asserting that the phrase refers to the taxpayer generally,generically,and specifically.although the government does not put it this way,its argument is that the taxpayer is to taxpayer as the citizen is to citizen.when we say that the citizen has certain rights and respon
