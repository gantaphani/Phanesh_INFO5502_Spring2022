the government appeals several decisions of the united states court of federal claims granting summary judgment in favor of american savings bank,keystone holdings,keystone holdings partners,new american capital,new american capital holdings,and new american holdings,collectively plaintiffs.we affirm as to liability and,and remand as to damages.
background 
the present case is related to the winstar line of cases and relevant general background facts are detailed in united states winstar,d.in,the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic assumed responsibility for the liabilities of the failed thrift american savings and loan association of stockton,california old american.am.sav.bank,united states,american savings ii.at the time,old american was the largest failed thrift in the united states and it was estimated that it would cost the fslic more than billion to liquidate it.id.the federal home loan bank board fhlbb and the fslic agreed to a plan with investor robert bass and his associates the bass investors wherein old american was divided into two operating thrift called american savings bank,new american and a liquidating thrift called new west federal savings and loan association new west.id.this division left new american with a surplus of liabilities over assets of approximately billion,and new west with a surplus of assets over liabilities of approximately billion.id.in order to facilitate the transaction,new west issued an billion note guaranteed by the fslic to new american the fslic note.id.keystone holdings partners,the partnership,formed by the bass investors,used several keystone holdings,keystone,new american capital,na capital,new american capital holdings,na capital holdings,and new american holdings,na holdings to acquire old american.id.
as part of the agreement,the fslic received stock warrants the warrants,which essentially gave it a thirty percent ownership interest in new american.id.at.new american received assistance from the fslic pursuant to an assistance agreement.id.the assistance agreement incorporated two regulatory note forbearance and the warrant forbearance which reduced the amount of regulatory capital new american needed to remain in regulatory capital compliance.id.at.the note forbearance essentially provided that new american would not have to support the billion fslic note with capital to meet regulatory capital requirements.id.the warrant forbearance provided that the value of the warrants could be counted towards regulatory capital for certain purposes id.
on august,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,stat.as a result of the enactment of firrea,new american could no longer rely upon the note forbearance and warrant forbearance for regulatory capital purposes.american savings ii.at.on december,plaintiffs filed suit against the government in the united states court of federal claims.
the united states court of federal claims issued four published opinions in this matter.in the first opinion,the trial court denied the government motion to compel liability discovery.am.sav.bank,united states.in the second opinion,the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to liability and denied the government for summary judgment as to liability.am.sav.bank,united states,american savings i.in the third opinion,the trial court and plaintiffs and the government respective motions for summary judgment as to damages and partial restitution.american savings ii.at.in the fourth opinion,the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to damages and partial restitution offset calculations,awarding plaintiffs.am.sav.bank,united states,american savings iii.
the government appeals the trial court ruling as to liability,its award of damages and the offset calculation relating to the note forbearance,and its award of partial restitution and the offset calculation relating to the warrant forbearance.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
in the present case,the trial court decided both liability and damages on summary judgment.we review a trial court decisions on summary judgment and conclusions of law without deference.comtrol,united states.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
on appeal,the government argues that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs summary judgment motions as to liability,as to the damages and offset calculation relating to the note forbearance,and as to the partial restitution and offset calculation relating to the warrant forbearance.we take each issue in turn.
the dispute as to liability centers on section of the assistance agreement titled tax benefits.within the tax benefits section,there is a subsection entitled effect of material change of law.assistance agreement i.the effect of material change of law subsection provides a way for keystone holdings to modify its obligation to pay a minimum of million in tax benefit payments to the fslic if there is a qualifying material change in the law.a material change of law is defined in the assistance agreement as follows 
a change in tax or law after the effective date,including,without limitation,a change in the closing agreement,the forbearance letter,any federal,state or local statute,court decision,regulation,ruling or other administrative practice or order,or any lapse or reinterpretation of existing law a change of law,which prevents parent company group from utilizing,or makes it impracticable for the parent company group to utilize,the items of tax deduction elimination from the computation of adjusted hypothetical federal income tax liability 
id.h.after the enactment of firrea,plaintiffs invoked the material change of law provision of the assistance agreement.american savings i.at.thereafter,the parties agreed to a settlement agreement limiting plaintiffs tax benefit payment obligations.id.
as it did before the trial court,the government argues on appeal that the elimination of the warrant forbearance and note forbearance as a result of the passage of firrea was not a breach of the assistance agreement.according to the government,the parties anticipated and allocated the risk of a change of law by agreeing to a contractual remedy in the material change of law provision of the assistance agreement.the government submits that the inclusion of the forbearance letter in the material change of law provision precludes plaintiffs from claiming any remedy for elimination of the forbearances other than that provided in the tax benefits section.in short,the government argues that the material change of law provision is a general risk allocation provision precluding any additional recovery.plaintiffs disagree,arguing that the material change of law provision is not a general risk allocation provision rather,they argue that its scope is limited to the issue of plaintiffs obligation to make tax benefit payments to the fslic.
the trial court noted that plaintiffs presented one of the strongest prima facie demonstrations of the existence of a contract.am.sav.bank.at.considering the relevant language of the assistance agreement,it determined that the material change of law provision was intended to reduce plaintiffs affirmative obligation to make payments to the fslic in the event that a material change in law made it more difficult to achieve earnings which the losses could shelter.american savings i.at.in reaching this determination,it relied on the fact that the material change of law provision is located in the tax benefits section of the assistance agreement and that the definition and explanation of a material change of law are each expressly confined to the tax benefits section of the assistance agreement.id.it further noted that under the government interpretation of the assistance agreement,the government could seize the thrift and the only relief available to plaintiffs would be that they would not have to pay a minimum of million in tax benefit payments to the government.id.at.the trial court concluded that the material change of law provision does not operate to preclude a claim for damages,thus finding the government liable for breach of contract as a result of the enactment of firrea.id.at.in light of the language of the material change of law provision,its location in the tax benefits section,and its definitions,we agree with the trial court that it is not a general risk allocation provision barring further recovery.
despite the clear scope of the material change of law provision based on the language of the contract,the government argues that the trial court interpretation of the assistance agreement is in conflict with the parties negotiating history and with the parties conduct after the enactment of firrea.as to the parties negotiating history,we are not persuaded by the government argument that the addition of the forbearance letter to the definition of a material change of law demonstrates that the material change of law provision was intended to be a general risk allocation provision.regarding this issue,the trial court determined that plaintiffs did not abandon their belief that the forbearances were contractually enforceable by adding the forbearance letter to the definition of material change of law rather,p laintiffs wanted to insure that they could invoke the provisions of,and reduce their obligations under,the tax benefit provision even if the government challenged the contractual status of the forbearances.id.at.in addition,the parties conduct after the enactment of firrea supports,rather than contradicts,the trial court interpretation of the assistance agreement.for example,the settlement agreement between the parties after the enactment of firrea provides 
there are a number of disputes which exist between the parties with respect to the transaction related documents.this settlement agreement relates solely to the dispute over whether or not a general or stockton material change of law has occurred as set forth in the material change of law notices.
id.at quoting the settlement agreement.as the trial court found,this language supports a finding that the material change of law provision does not prevent plaintiffs from litigating other disputes regarding the transaction related documents,such as the current suit.see id.at.
in sum,we agree with the trial court that the material change of law provision of the assistance agreement does not preclude plaintiffs claims relating to the elimination of the note forbearance and warrant forbearance.accordingly,we affirm the trial court ruling as to liability.id.at.
note forbearance damages and offset 
as previously discussed,new west issued the fslic note to new american to facilitate the transaction.at the time of the transaction,fslic regulations required new american to maintain three percent of its total liabilities as regulatory capital.american savings ii.at.thus,to meet regulatory capital requirements relating to the billion fslic note,new american was required to maintain million in capital.id.the fslic agreed to provide new american with the note forbearance,eliminating the need for new american to support the billion fslic note with capital to maintain regulatory capital compliance.id.the enactment of firrea,however,voided the note forbearance,resulting in new american having to support the fslic note with real capital to maintain regulatory capital compliance.id.new american,however,did not raise additional capital to meet regulatory capital requirements rather,it used a portion of its capital to maintain regulatory capital compliance.id.at.the american savings ii trial court determined that the million used to meet regulatory capital requirements was greatly restricted,and could not be leveraged as plaintiffs would have been entitled to do,but for the breach.american savings iii.at describing the trial court findings in american savings ii.the trial court granted plaintiffs summary judgment motion as to the note forbearance damages and offset,awarding damages of the cost of capital to plaintiffs minus benefits gained from real assets as opposed to government forbearances.id.at.
on appeal,the government argues that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs summary judgment motions as to the damages and offset calculation relating to the note forbearance.with regard to this issue,the government makes a number of arguments,including that plaintiffs would have incurred the same capital costs even absent the breach and that the trial court analysis of the note forbearance damages claim does not support the award granted.plaintiffs arguments in response include that the elimination of the note forbearance greatly restricted their use of certain capital after the elimination of the note forbearance and that the government induced plaintiffs to accept a lower rate on the fslic note by promising to provide the note forbearance.
the trial court,accepting plaintiffs arguments,analogized the costs plaintiffs paid to capital providers to situations where the government must pay a contractor rental costs for an item,such as equipment,if the government fails to provide the item after it induces the contractor to accept a lower contract price despite promising to provide the item.see american savings ii.at.the trial court accepted plaintiffs contention that the government induced them to accept a lower interest rate on the fslic note by promising that plaintiffs would not have to support the fslic note with regulatory capital.id.at.accepting plaintiffs proposed methodology,it awarded plaintiffs the actual costs paid to capital providers,in the form of interest and dividend payments,for the assets used to meet regulatory capital requirements,less the benefit that they obtained from the restricted use of these assets after the enactment of firrea.id.at.the trial court found that the actual costs plaintiffs paid to capital providers to maintain regulatory compliance after the elimination of the note forbearance totaled.american savings iii.at.
plaintiffs submit that several prior decisions by this court,including home savings of america united states,support the trial court award of plaintiffs capital costs resulting from the breach of the note forbearance.in home savings,this court affirmed an award for the full amount of replacement capital raised by a thrift to replace supervisory goodwill that was eliminated as a result of the enactment of firrea.id.at.the trial court calculated the damages as the difference between what it cost the thrift to raise that tangible capital and the benefit the thrift derived from possessing that capital instead of an equal amount of supervisory goodwill.id.at.this court stated that the court of federal claims properly noted that capital is not costless its cost is the required rate of return on various terms of financing.id.at.
the government argues that home savings is different from the present case because,the capital raisings were caused by the breach in home savings.plaintiffs use of capital raised prior to the enactment of firrea,however,does not leave them without a remedy for the actual costs paid to capital providers in the form of interest and dividend payments for the capital necessary to remain in regulatory capital compliance after the enactment of firrea eliminated the note forbearance.the elimination of the note forbearance caused plaintiffs to use real capital as opposed to regulatory forbearances to support the fslic note.additionally,while plaintiffs were not required to raise additional capital because of the breach,they were required to maintain their inventory capital to satisfy the higher capital requirement when the note forbearance was no longer available.absent the breach,this capital would have been available to plaintiffs for other profitable uses or for repayment to investors to avoid the ongoing costs of maintaining the capital.thus,the breach required plaintiffs to pay the cost of maintaining capital.based on the unique circumstances of this case in the winstar context,we affirm the trial court award of the actual costs plaintiffs paid to capital providers to maintain regulatory capital compliance as a result of the elimination of the note forbearance by the enactment of firrea.american savings ii.at.
having determined that plaintiffs are entitled to recover the actual costs paid to capital providers to maintain regulatory capital compliance as a result of the elimination of the note forbearance,the trial court next determined whether it should offset the damages award by benefits gained by plaintiffs.the benefits gained from real assets may be referred to as the offset.see american savings iii.at.the offset was determined by estimating the benefit to new american of the real assets used to meet regulatory capital requirements.id.because it was impossible to trace the million used to meet regulatory capital requirements to particular assets,the trial court use d an approximation.id.as an approximation,the trial court applied the historic,actual rate of interest the government paid plaintiffs on the fslic note.id.applying this interest rate,the trial court determined the offset amount to be.id.
the government argues that the trial court calculation of the note forbearance offset is flawed and that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment.in particular,the government contends that it was error for the trial court to disregard two expert affidavits on summary judgment.in american savings iii,regarding the note forbearance offset,the trial court found two affidavits presented by the government unpersuasive.id.at.on appeal,however,the government does not point to the substance of these affidavits to demonstrate disputed issues of material fact.indeed,the government did not even include copies of these affidavits in the joint appendix.in these circumstances,we can not conclude that the trial court erred in calculating the note forbearance offset on summary judgment.
in sum,we agree that the offset calculation methodology applied by the trial court was proper,which is consistent with the offset calculation methodology affirmed by this court in home savings,at.accordingly,we affirm the note forbearance offset calculated by the trial court and we affirm the damages award of relating to the note forbearance.american savings iii.at.
warrant forbearance remedy 
finally,the government argues that the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs summary judgment motion as to the award of partial restitution and the offset calculation relating to the warrant forbearance.the government makes a number of arguments as to this issue,including that the trial court erred in finding the contract divisible and that the election doctrine precludes plaintiffs from claiming partial restitution as a remedy.plaintiffs arguments in response include that the trial court properly found a divisible contract and that their continued performance after breach was not an election of remedies.
in,new american was acquired by washington mutual.american savings ii.at.after the sale,the government accepted washington mutual stock in return for the warrants.id.the government subsequently sold the stock for million,net of sales costs.id.plaintiffs then filed the present suit seeking to recover the benefit that the government received for the warrants under a restitution theory based on firrea elimination of the warrant forbearance.
plaintiffs do not seek restitution as to the contract as a whole by unwinding the entire transaction rather,they seek restitution as to only a portion of the contract by attempting to unwind only that portion of the contract,while seeking damages as to the remainder of the contract.while the court of federal claims in this case acknowledged that r estitution is generally awarded with respect to the contract as a whole,it provided that a claim for partial restitution may be awarded in some cases as to a portion of a contract if it is found to be meaningfully divisible.id.at.
as the court of federal claims recognized,there is a presumption that when parties enter into a contract,each and every term and condition is in consideration of all the others,unless otherwise stated.stone forest,united states,see also caroline hunt trust estate united states,same.the trial court found that plaintiffs had the burden to show a quid pro quo exchange of the warrant for the million in regulatory capital as well as the value of the deposit base.american savings ii.at.the trial court correctly noted that the parties clearly intended the value of the warrants to count as regulatory capital.id.the trial court also noted that plaintiffs stated repeatedly during negotiations that the warrants would be revocable if the fslic failed to perform its assistance obligations.id.at.after finding that the forbearances were part of the assistance obligations,it held that the warrant and the warrant forbearance were linked as part of this transaction,and can be unwound from the acquisition transaction as a whole as a matter of law.id.accordingly,it determined that plaintiffs are legally entitled to pursue a claim for partial restitution.id.the trial court then calculated the partial restitution remedy as the amount the government ultimately received for the warrants million offset by the amount plaintiffs benefited million deposit premium plus the change in the value of that premium during the eight year period from the execution of the deal to the sale of the warrants later determined to total.id.at american savings iii.at.
we hold that plaintiffs did not show that the contract was divisible,and the court of federal claims erred in awarding partial restitution for this breach.because we find that the trial court improperly divided the contract and that the trial court award of partial restitution was improper on that basis,we do not reach the government argument as to whether the election doctrine,as discussed in old stone united states,would bar restitution as to the portion of the contract unwound by the trial court.
we consider the language of a contract and the intent of the parties in determining whether a contract is divisible.see stone forest,at considering contract language and the intent of the parties in finding that a contract was not divisible see also.exch.bank united states,considering contract language to determine the purpose of the contract in reaching the conclusion that a contract was not divisible accord in re payless cashways,cir the primary inquiry when determining if a contract is divisible is the intent of the parties.the intent can be surmised by examining the language that the parties used and the subject matter of the agreement.citations omitted.plaintiffs submit that several provisions of the assistance agreement support the divisible remedy awarded by the trial court.plaintiffs do not,however,point to any provision of the assistance agreement specifically providing for divisibility of the portion of the contract unwound by the trial warrants in exchange for the warrant forbearance and the value of the deposit base.instead,plaintiffs rely on more general,b,and of the assistance do not specifically address the divisible remedy sought by plaintiffs in the present case.plaintiffs submit that these provisions demonstrate an agreement by the parties to accept remedies that take account of the parties purpose and intent,subject to the guiding principle that the quantum of each remedy should correspond to the magnitude of the loss.appellees br.
