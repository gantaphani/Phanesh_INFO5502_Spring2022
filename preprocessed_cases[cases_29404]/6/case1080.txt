background 
this case involves systems for processing credit card transactions over the internet and for addressing security concerns not present in direct retail transactions.in the early days of internet commerce,merchants recognized that one key to the success of internet sales would be the ability to provide customers with assurances of security in the processing of financial transactions over the internet using credit cards,bank accounts,and other means of electronic payment.responding to that need,the industry investigated encryption techniques and architectures to protect sensitive data.one such effort is reflected in a working document entitled internet keyed payments protocol the ikp reference,published by the internet engineering task force and ibm.that document sets forth standards on how payments may be accomplished efficiently,reliably,and securely.at.the ikp reference explains that its goal was to enable secure electronic payments while utilizing the existing financial infrastructure for payment authorization and clearance.the intent is to avoid completely,or at least minimize,changes to the existing financial infrastructure outside the internet.id.to that end,the ikp reference suggests two standard models,or protocols 
in the first protocol,the customer selects one or more items to purchase from the merchant website the customer sends credit card information to the merchant the merchant sends the credit card information and amount of the purchase to the merchant bank the merchant bank seeks authorization for the purchase from the issuing bank over the existing banking network and the merchant bank notifies the merchant but not the customer of transaction approval.see id.at flow diagram appellant br.at.
in the second protocol,the customer selects one or more items to purchase on the merchant website the customer sends an authorization request,along with its credit card information and the amount of the purchase,to the merchant bank the merchant bank seeks authorization from the issuing bank over the existing banking network the merchant bank notifies the customer of transaction approval and the customer sends the authorization response to the merchant.see at,appellant br.at.
unsatisfied with the early approaches taken by others,mark ogram,an inventor and patent attorney,set out to create a new payment model to remedy what he perceived as two deficiencies in the prior art protocols the fact that the customer had to send confidential information over the internet to an unknown merchant and the fact that credit card issuers imposed onerous financial requirements on merchants.appellant br.at.ogram idea was to add a fifth entity,a payment processing or financial processing entity,to supplement the conventional model with four entities the customer,merchant,merchant bank,and issuing bank.according to ogram,the new financial processing entity would receive credit card account information and an amount to be charged from the customer when the customer placed the order seek authorization from the card issuer over the existing banking network and notify both the customer and the merchant of authorization.id.
on february,ogram filed a patent application directed to a payment model utilizing a financial processing entity.he formed nmi shortly thereafter to implement the model as a business for processing credit card transactions over the internet.ogram patent application resulted in the and patents,both of which are assigned to nmi.claim of the patent is illustrative of the invention claimed 
a financial transaction system comprising 
a a first bank computer containing financial data therein,said financial data including customer account numbers and available credit data,said first bank computer including means for generating an authorization indicia in response to queries containing a customer account number and amount 
b a merchant computer containing promotional data 
c a customer computer being linked with said merchant computer and receiving said promotional data and,
d a financial processing computer remote from said merchant computer and having means for 
receiving customer account data and amount data from said customer computer,
querying said first bank computer with said customer account data and said amount data,
receiving an authorization indicia from said first bank computer,
communicating a transaction indicia to said customer computer,and,
communicating the transaction indicia to said merchant computer.
according to their abstracts,the and patents relate to a n automated payment system particularly suited for purchases over a distributed computer network such as the internet.
in,nmi filed suit for infringement of the and patents against a number of parties alleged to compete in the internet credit card processing field,including verisign,and eprocessing network collectively,verisign.following a claim construction hearing,the district court construed a number of terms in dispute.net moneyin,verisign,wl,claim construction decision.as part of its construction of the claim terms,the district court invalidated claims,and of the patent and claim of the patent,which contain limitations in format,as lacking corresponding structure and thus indefinite under.
following construction of the claims,the district court entertained two motions for summary judgment that are relevant to this appeal.first,verisign moved for summary judgment that it did not induce infringement of nmi patents.in response to that motion,nmi moved for leave to amend its complaint to add a claim for inducement of infringement.the district court granted verisign motion for summary judgment and denied nmi motion for leave to amend.net moneyin,verisign.june,amendment decision.second,verisign moved for summary judgment of invalidity,arguing that the ikp reference anticipated claim of the patent under a.the district court granted verisign motion.net moneyin,verisign.july,summary judgment decision.the district court then entered final judgment in favor of verisign.

indefiniteness 
the district court concluded that claims,and of the patent and claim of the patent were indefinite under,and thus invalid.because each of these patents raises different issues,we address them separately.
the patent 
claim of the patent recites a financial transaction system comprising,among other things,a first bank computer containing financial data therein,said financial data including customer account numbers and available credit data,said first bank computer including means for generating an authorization indicia in response to queries containing a customer account number and amount emphasis added the district court construed the generating means element in claim as a element.the parties agreed that the function of the claimed means was generating an authorization indicia in response to queries containing a customer account number and amount.the district court found,however,that the specification failed to disclose any corresponding structure to perform the claimed function.accordingly,it deemed the claim invalid under.
nmi argues that the generating means element is not a element under because the claim itself discloses sufficient structure which performs the function of generating an authorization indicia in response to queries containing a customer account number and amount.appellant br.at emphasis omitted.alternatively,nmi contends that if the generating means claim element is properly construed as a element,then the specification recites sufficient structure to make the claim definite.verisign counters that the district court correctly concluded both that the claim does not recite sufficient structure to rebut the presumption and that the specification contains insufficient structure to perform the claimed function.
section,paragraph,of title provides that 
an element of a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure,material,or acts in support thereof,and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
a claim element that contains the word means and recites a function is presumed to be drafted in format under.envirco clestra cleanroom.the presumption is rebutted,however,if the claim itself recites sufficient structure to perform the claimed function.see also sage,devon,w here a claim recites a function,but then goes on to elaborate sufficient structure,material,or acts within the claim itself to perform entirely the recited function,the claim is not in format.
we first address nmi contention that the presumption triggered by the presence of the word means in claim is rebutted by the recitation of sufficient structure for performing entirely the recited function of generating an authorization indicia.nmi contends that the language,first bank computer containing financial data therein,said financial data including customer account numbers and available credit data,said first bank computer generating an authorization indicia in response to queries containing a customer account number and amount,is sufficient structure to rebut the presumption.nmi argues that an ordinary artisan would understand the bank computer to be a commonly known structure for generating authorization indicia in response to queries containing a custom account number and amount.appellant br.at.verisign responds that the claim does not recite sufficient structure to rebut the presumption because of the wide variety of types and classes of computers in existence,each being configurable in a variety of different ways using many different programming languages.appellees br.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we agree with verisign that the recitation in claim of the bank computer is not sufficient to rebut the presumption.the bank computer is not linked in the claim as the means for generating an authorization indicia.rather,the bank computer is recited as including those means.nmi argument that the first bank computer constitutes sufficient structure would require the first bank computer to include a first bank computer,which is both redundant and illogical.because the claimed generating means is a subset of the bank computer,there must be a recitation of structure that is a component of the bank computer to rebut the presumption.the claim contains no such recitation.as a result,the district court correctly concluded that the presumption of treatment had not been overcome.
having concluded that the generating means recited in claim is drafted in format,we turn to whether the specification includes a disclosure of structure sufficient to accomplish the recited function.nmi argues that the specification does disclose a bank computer and this court precedents do not require a description of the internal structure of the bank computer.appellant br.at emphasis omitted see also id.at here,claim a itself states that the bank computer contains financial data including customer account numbers and available credit data.a person skilled in the art would know that such a computer would be programmed to compare account data and amount data to those data structures and generate an authorization indicia if credit were available.verisign counters that the district court correctly determined that the patent specification fails to disclose the structure corresponding to what,in the claimed first bank computer,performs the claimed generating function.appellees br.at internal quotation marks omitted.
a patent applicant who employs language must set forth in the specification an adequate disclosure showing what is meant by that language.if an applicant fails to set forth an adequate disclosure,the applicant has in effect failed to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required by the second paragraph of section.in re donaldson,en banc.to avoid purely functional claiming in cases involving inventions,we have consistently required that the structure disclosed in the specification be more than simply a general purpose computer or microprocessor.aristocrat techs.austl.pty int l game.because general purpose computers can be programmed to perform very different tasks in very different ways,simply disclosing a computer as the structure designated to perform a particular function does not limit the scope of the claim to the corresponding structure,material,or acts that perform the function,as required by section paragraph.id.thus,in a claim in which the disclosed structure is a computer,or microprocessor,programmed to carry out an algorithm,the disclosed structure is not the general purpose computer,but rather the special purpose computer programmed to perform the disclosed algorithm.id.quoting wms gaming,int l game.consequently,a claim element for which the only disclosed structure is a general purpose computer is invalid if the specification fails to disclose an algorithm for performing the claimed function.see id.at.
there is no dispute in this case that the specification fails to disclose an algorithm by which a general purpose bank computer generat es an authorization indicia.as a result,the district court correctly concluded that claims,and are indefinite under.we therefore affirm that part of the judgment.
the patent 
claim of the patent recites a financial transaction system comprising,among other things,a financial processing computer having automatic means responsive to the order for receiving customer account data and amount data from the customer computer and the merchant computer.the parties do not dispute the district court construction of this claim element as a element.the parties do dispute,however,the nature of the function.the district court construed the function as the financial processing computer receives both the customer account data and amount data from both the customer computer and the merchant computer.claim construction decision at.nmi argues that the district court construction of the function is erroneous.according to nmi,the ordinary meaning of the claim language requires that the function be construed more broadly i n response to an order,the financial processing computer receives customer account data from the customer computer,the merchant computer,or both and it also receives amount data from the customer computer,the merchant computer,or both.appellant br.at.verisign counters that the district court correctly construed the function according to the ordinary meaning of the claim language.
the language of the function at issue was construed by the district court as specifying that both the amount data and the account data must come from both the customer computer and the merchant computer.that construction comports with and is fully supported by the language of the claim itself.nmi argues that the function is subject to a different construction,which would permit the amount data and the account data to come from the merchant computer,the customer computer,or both.the problem with nmi proffered construction,however,is that it is different from,and broader in scope than,the construction it asserted in the district court.see at arguing to the district court that the meaning of this element is the financial processing computer receives the customer account data from the customer computer and the amount data from the merchant computer via the customer computer.this is not merely a new argument in support of a previously presented construction,but instead is a new and more expansive construction,which may not properly be asserted on appeal.see interactive gift express,compuserve.because nmi new construction is not proper on appeal,and because we see no basis on which to overturn the district court construction,that construction is affirmed.
nmi concedes that under the district court construction,no structure is disclosed in the specification to perform the claimed function.appellant br.at.as a result,the claim is indefinite under.see donaldson,at.consequently,we affirm the district court determination that claim of the patent is invalid.
anticipation 
claim of the patent recites an internet payment system comprising five links 
a a first link between a customer computer and a vending computer for communicating promotional information from said vending computer to said customer computer 
a second link,initiated by said customer computer,between said customer computer and a payment processing computer,remote from said vending computer,for communicating credit card information and amount from said customer computer to said payment processing computer 
a third link,initiated by said payment processing computer with a credit card server computer for communicating said credit card information and said amount from said payment processing computer to said credit card server computer,and for communicating,in response,an authorization indicia from said credit card server computer to said payment processing computer 
d a fourth link between said payment processing computer and said customer computer for communicating a transactional indicia 
e a fifth link between the payment processing computer and said vending computer for communicating said transactional indicia.
the district court,after finding all five of these links in the ikp reference,albeit in two separate disclosed examples,concluded that claim was anticipated under a and therefore invalid.specifically,the district court concluded 
all of the limitations of claim can be found within the ikp reference.a simple combination would produce the system described in claim of the patent.that no specific example within ikp contains all five links does not preclude a finding of anticipation.
summary judgment decision at.nmi contends that the district court combination of two disclosed examples in order to find all elements of the claim was erroneous verisign responds that the district court did not improperly rearrange the links in the ikp reference,but rather merely relied on various express teachings from a single document that together completely disclose the five claimed links.appellees br.at.under verisign theory,this was sufficient to establish anticipation,because all that is required is that the four corners of a single,prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention.id.at quoting xerox.we disagree with verisign,and take this opportunity to clarify what a reference must show in order to anticipate a claimed invention.
section a provides that an issued patent is invalid if the invention therein was described in a printed publication before the invention thereof by the applicant.section embodies the concept of a device or process has been previously invented and disclosed to the public,then it is not new,and therefore the claimed invention is anticipated by the prior invention.as we have stated numerous times language on which verisign relies,in order to demonstrate anticipation,the proponent must show that the four corners of a single,prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention.xerox,at quoting advanced display,kent state.this statement embodies the requirement in section that the anticipating invention be described in a printed publication,and is,of course,unimpeachable.but it does not tell the whole story.because the hallmark of anticipation is prior invention,the prior art order to anticipate under not only disclose all elements of the claim within the four corners of the document,but must also disclose those elements arranged as in the claim.connell sears,roebuck,
the meaning of the expression arranged as in the claim is readily understood in relation to claims drawn to things such as ingredients mixed in some claimed order.in such instances,a reference that discloses all of the claimed ingredients,but not in the order claimed,would not anticipate,because the reference would be missing any disclosure of the limitations of the claimed invention arranged as in the claim.but the arranged as in the claim requirement is not limited to such a narrow set of order of limitations claims.rather,our precedent informs that the arranged as in the claim requirement applies to all claims and refers to the need for an anticipatory reference to show all of the limitations of the claims arranged or combined in the same way as recited in the claims,not merely in a particular order.the test is thus more accurately understood to mean arranged or combined in the same way as in the claim.
for example,in lindemann maschinenfabrik gmbh american hoist derrick,we reviewed a district court determination that a patent directed to a hydraulic scrap shearing machine was anticipated by a prior patent directed to a method for shearing spent nuclear fuel bundles.because the district court had treated the claims as mere catalogs of separate parts,in disregard of the relationships set forth in the claims and that give the claims their meaning,we reversed.id.at.although the prior art reference could be said to contain all of the elements of the claimed invention,it did not anticipate under because it disclose d an entirely different device,composed of parts distinct from those of the claimed invention,and operating in a different way to process different material differently.id.at.the reference thus was deficient because it did not disclose the elements of the claimed invention arranged as in the claim as required by.id.
in ecolochem,southern california edison,we reviewed a district court decision that a prior art reference directed to saving energy by catalytic reduction of oxygen in feedwater anticipated a claim reciting the use of hydrazine with a mixed resin bed to deoxygenate water.in finding that the reference anticipated the claim,the district court considered a figure and accompanying text,which taught the use of hydrogen with a mixed bed to deoxygenate water,in conjunction with a separate passage discussing deoxygenating water with,among other things,hydrazine.id.at.we reversed.after determining that the relevant figure and accompanying text described only the use of hydrogen to deoxygenate water,we concluded that the reference could not anticipate the claimed invention because there was no link between that figure and the general discussion of hydrazine as a deoxygenating agent.id.in other words,we concluded that although the reference taught all elements of the claim,it did not contain a discussion suggesting or linking hydrazine with the mixed bed in the figure,and thus did not show the invention arranged as in the claim.
