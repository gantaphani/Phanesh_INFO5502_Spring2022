in today case more procedurally complicated than substantively complex,a district judge issued an order requiring chartis insurance company to advance defense costs to former directors and officers of westernbank of puerto rico,who find themselves in the of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,for easy reading chartis appeals.and after confirming our jurisdiction,we affirm.
how the case got here 
westernbank run as one of puerto rico leading banks came to an end in the late when local regulators ordered it closed and appointed a federal regulator the fdic receiver.jumping in with gusto,the fdic investigated what had gone on there.and it did not like what it found.certain bank directors and officers had breached their fiduciary duty by jeopardizing the bank financial soundness,the fdic claimed in a letter sent to among others the directors and officers and their insurer,chartis.concluding that these breaches had caused more than million in losses to the bank,the fdic demanded that the directors and officers pay that amount.
without missing a beat,the directors and officers notified chartis of the fdic claim.and,naturally,they asked chartis to confirm coverage under a directors and officers policy issued by chartis to westernbank owner,w holding company.known in the insurance world as a d o policy,this particular policy declares in capital letters that chartis must advance defense costs,excess of the applicable retention,pursuant to the terms herein prior to the final disposition of a claim.the policy advancement provision emphasis ours repeats further on that chartis shall advance,excess of any applicable retention amount,covered defense costs.defense costs include reasonable and necessary fees,costs and expenses consented to by the insurer.the policy says,too,that chartis shall pay for certain loss es of an organization arising from a claim made against an insured person for any wrongful act of such insured person.loss es include defense costs.organization includes the named entity,which is w holding,plus its subsidiar ies,which include westernbank.and insured person s include directors and officers.
chartis denied coverage five months later,relying most pertinently on the policy insured versus insured exclusion.a standard proviso in d o policies,this exclusion says that chartis 
shall not be liable to make any payment for loss in connection with any claim made against an insured which is brought by,on behalf of or in the right of,an organization or any insured person other than an employee of an organization,in any respect and whether or not collusive.
claim,the policy adds,includes a written demand for money.insured means insured person or organization.and,again,the directors and officers come within the policy definition of insured person s,while w holding and westernbank fall within the policy definition of organization.also,the policy neither mentions the fdic nor bars coverage for suits by regulators like some policies do 
convinced that the fdic,a s receiver,had stepped squarely into westernbank shoes,chartis also wrote that any claims that the fdic had against the directors and officers of westernbank are on behalf of or in the right of westernbank.that triggered the exclusion,the fdic added,which meant no coverage.the directors and officers were not willing to take this lying down,however.together with w holding,they sued chartis in puerto rico superior court,seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage and saying that coverage includes all costs and expenses incurred in defending against the fdic.they also alleged that the fdic had asserted a claim against them on behalf of creditors and depositors.eventually,the fdic got involved in this suit,filing a complaint in intervention.that complaint accused the directors and officers of violating their fiduciary duties to westernbank,causing over million in damages to the bank.the complaint also stressed that the fdic had succeeded to all of the rights and assets of westernbank,including its rights and claims against its former officers and directors,and its rights,interests and claims in and to the policies against chartis under puerto rico statute.see declaring that a ny individual sustaining damages and losses may sue an insurance company directly without joining the named insured,provided the suit is pursued in puerto rico.
the fdic then promptly removed the entire case to federal court.see b b.it amended its complaint to bring more directors and officers as well as their spouses and conjugal partners into the case and to add cross claims against them,too.this pleading sounded a familiar theme that the fdic had sued in its capacity as westernbank receiver and that the directors and officers had breached their fiduciary duties,resulting in the bank loss of over million.but the fdic also estimated there that the bank closing could result in the federal fund losing over billion.
chartis fired back with a motion to dismiss all claims brought against it by the directors and officers and by the fdic.see.b.what matters for our purposes is that chartis asserted again that because the fdic was pursuing the directors and officers on behalf of or in the right of westernbank,there is no coverage under the exclusion and so their coverage claim should be jettisoned.the directors and officers opposed the dismissal motion,arguing at the risk of oversimplification that a clear majority of courts refuse to stretch the exclusion to include the fdic.
believing that there is at least a remote possibility of coverage,the directors and officers also moved the judge to order chartis to advance their defense costs this is not a preliminary injunction motion,they wrote in support of their motion.but they were quick to note that a they would be irreparably harmed if their motion failed,because many of them are elderly,unemployed,retired,and living on fixed incomes,and so can not shoulder the defense costs that b chartis duty to advance defense costs to them is plain as day and that c the public interest in making sure that insurers keep their commitments and that insureds get what they paid for can not be questioned.undaunted,chartis opposed the motion,insisting that the exclusion controls and bars coverage.and no coverage,the argument continued,means no obligation to advance defense costs because costs tied to an excluded claim are not covered defense costs.
the fdic chimed in,moving without opposition for leave to file a second amended complaint in intervention,see.a a motion the judge granted.as best we can tell,the big difference between the first and second amended complaints is the latter saying that the fdic,as receiver,
succeeded to all rights,claims,titles,powers,privileges,and assets of westernbank and its stockholders,members,account holders,depositors,officers,or directors of westernbank with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution,including the right to bring this action against the former officers and directors of westernbank.
as support for its claim,the fdic cited d a i.that provision one of many in the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,for now on says that the fdic shall,as receiver,and by operation of law,succeed to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution,and of any stockholder,member,accountholder,depositor,officer,or director of such institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution.
not surprisingly,the directors and officers and chartis responded by filing separate motions to dismiss the fdic second amended complaint.see.b.among other arguments,the directors and officers claimed that they had not acted in a grossly negligent fashion.chartis,on the other hand,raised the same argument as before.also not surprisingly,the fdic opposed the dismissal motions.and responding to chartis theory,the fdic said that overwhelming case authority establishes that this exclusion does not apply to entities like the fdic.
taking up the matter first,the judge granted the directors and officers motion in an electronic docket entry that said 
order granting motion for miscellaneous relief advance defense costs.pr law requires insurers to advance defense costs if there is even a remote possibility that a claim ultimately will be covered.this ruling is without prejudice of chartis eventually being entitled to repayment.
the judge denied chartis motion to reconsider that order,too.and he then denied all motions to dismiss the fdic second amended complaint.as for chartis dismissal motion the only one that matters somewhat here,because it touched on the issue,the judge said that the exclusion barred the fdic from suing on behalf of westernbank members,officers,and directors,plus also westernbank shareholders consisting only of w holding,a party to the case.but because the fdic also sued on behalf of account holders,depositors,and the fund,the judge concluded that the fdic claims fell outside the exclusion 
the parties frenetic motion practice continued,however.here is one example.the directors and officers later moved for sanctions against chartis,citing rule of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure a rule that authorizes the payment of a sum for attorneys fees if any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously.in their view,chartis position was nothing short of obstinate or frivolous.essentially crying gotcha,they spotlighted the position chartis took in a substantially similar case,bradford gibraltar ins,no.ark.there,chartis had no problem advancing defense costs to directors of a defunct company,despite an exclusion.what chartis did in bradford,they added,amounts to an admission that the fdic claims are covered and that the exclusion does not apply.and they sought attorneys fees from chartis as a penalty for its litigating the question here.chartis responded that its argument in the current case constitutes a reasoned position based on a novel issue that is reasonably debatable.chartis also claimed that the exclusion in bradford looks nothing like the one at issue here.so,chartis reasoned,no court could find its actions sanctionable.but the judge noted that there are cases nothing binding going both ways on whether the exclusion applies to situations like ours.and because some caselaw points to coverage,the judge found that chartis notion represented the height of obstinacy.consequently,he granted the directors and officers sanctions motion,awarding them the costs that they incurred in fighting for the advancement.
which brings us at last to chartis appeal of the order an appeal that pivots around two basic questions do we have jurisdiction to hear the parties and,if so,did the judge bungle the ruling we answer yes to the first question and no to the second,for the reasons we now explain.
our take on the case 
appealability 
the directors and officers think we have no authority over this matter because,they say,the edict is not an appealable order,given that there is no final judgment disposing of all claims against all parties.like chartis,we think the opposite is true.
normally,only final judgments are appealable.see morales feliciano rullán,cir citing.an exception exists,however,for orders granting injunctions.see a and the judge order certainly seems to fit the bill.for sure,the judge did not label his ruling an injunction perhaps because the directors and officers said that they were not asking for one but an order character does not depend on what the judge calls it no,its nature depends on its operative terms and effects,we recently said.see fryzel mortg.registration,cir souter,j.with this in mind,and knowing what makes an injunction an injunction,we see that the order here is aimed at a particular party chartis,is enforceable by contempt,and provides some of the relief costs that the directors and officers seek in the case.given these characteristics,the edict is an injunction,see,id.citing bogosian woloohojian realty,cir breyer,a mandatory preliminary injunction,actually,because it disturb s,rather than preserve s,the status quo by requiring advancements,see united steelworkers of,afl cio textron,cir breyer.and that means the order is immediately appealable regardless of finality.see,fryzel,at bogosian,at.
so,in other words,we have jurisdiction.to the merits,then.
the merits 
both sides bombard us with arguments.but before entering the fray,we pause to highlight some important legal principles.
injunction basics 
whether a mandatory preliminary injunction should issue typically depends on the exigencies of the situation,taking into account four familiar factors the moving party likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable harm absent an injunction,the balance of equities,and the impact if any of the injunction on the public interest.see,braintree,f d at.these factors are not all weighted equally,however.see,ross simons of warwick,baccarat,cir.truth be told,l ikelihood of success is the main bearing wall of this framework.accord corporate,harnett,cir.when it comes to the merits,chartis stakes everything on persuading us that the directors and officers are not likely to succeed on their coverage claim and so should not get cost advancements.given this development,we need not concern ourselves with the other elements of the test.see,corporate,at taking a similar tack in a similar situation ross simons of warwick,at ditto.
as for our standard of review,the federal reporter is chock full of cases saying how we scan decisions for abuse of discretion.see,diálogo santiago bauzá,cir langlois abington housing,cir ocean spray cranberries,pepsico,cir.but the standard depends on the issue under review,obviously.see,diálogo,at langlois,at ocean spray cranberries,at.for example,within this rubric,we review questions of fact for clear error,issues of law de novo,and judgment calls with deference.see,diálogo,at langlois,at ocean spray cranberries,at.of course,as the appealing party,chartis bears the burden of showing reversible error.see,ross simons of warwick,at gately massachusetts,cir.
cost advancement basics 
puerto rico law holds that an insurance company must advance defense costs if a complaint against an insured alleges claims that create even a remote possibility of coverage.see cuadrado rodríguez fernández rodríguez,no,wl,at tca,certified translation provided by the parties think about that for a second.not an actuality of coverage.not even a probability of coverage.no,a mere possibility of coverage will do regardless of how remote it may be.a pretty low standard,indeed.on top of that,courts must read the complaint allegations liberal ly when doing a check.see triple s mgmt.am.int l ins.of,nos,wl,at tca may,certified translation provided by the parties see also cuadrado rodríguez,wl,at.and the allegations need not be perfect,either,to trigger the insurer duty to advance defense costs.cuadrado rodríguez,wl,at.also,any doubt about an insurer advancement obligation must be resolved in the insured favor.see pagán caraballo silva delgado,offic.trans,see also cuadrado rodríguez,wl,at.seemingly what animates these rules is that the purpose of insurance policies is to provide protection for the insured.see triple s mgmt,wl,at emphasis in original see also cuadrado rodríguez,wl,at.
applying these basics 
looking at the issue through the prism of principles makes an already situation under puerto rico law friendlier still.at this stage,you see,the directors and officers need not show a certainty of a remote possibility of coverage.on the contrary,only a likelihood of a remote possibility of coverage is required.generally narragansett indian tribe guilbert,cir talking in terms of probability of success emphasis added.
chartis pins its reversal hopes on the strength of the following argument which is basically a reprise of its position in the district court.step one the policy only obliges chartis to advance the costs of defending against covered claims.step two the policy exclusion blocks coverage for claims brought on behalf of or in the right of westernbank.step three there would be no coverage if westernbank had sued its directors and officers like the fdic has,because that scenario would activate the exclusion.step four having slipped into westernbank shoes as its receiver,the fdic must be suing the directors and officers on behalf of or in the right of westernbank.step six add this all up and there is no remote possibility of a covered claim and thus no duty to advance defense costs.
chartis theory has a certain appeal,at least at first glance.but it is not persuasive,for the simplest of reasons it gives lip service and no more to the words remote possibility in the pertinent phrase remote possibility of coverage.and it ignores that the procedural posture of the case only requires a mere likelihood of a remote possibility of coverage to the duty.viewed in the proper light,the flaws in chartis thesis stand out in bold relief.
let zero in on step four of chartis argument that the fdic is only suing on behalf of or in the right of westernbank that it simply donned the bank wingtips,if you will.quoting from the fdic second amended complaint,chartis writes that the fdic alleges that it,as receiver of westernbank,seeks millions in damages caused by the gross negligence of the bank former directors and officers.but remember,the fdic did more than allege that it had succeeded to westernbank rights.it also alleged that it had succeeded to the rights of westernbank depositors and account holders rights that included the right to bring this action.and it alleged,too,that it was suing to recover money the fund had shelled out after the bank had shut down.eyeing that pleading liberally,see triple s mgmt,wl,at,while knowing also that pleading perfection is not required,see cuadrado rodríguez,wl,at,we think that these allegations make it likely possible even if only remotely so that the fdic is suing on these behalf.
relatedly,chartis argues a unique argument,to say the least that what role the fdic has assumed is set when it makes its first claim.and,chartis writes,the fdic did not say in its demand letter to the directors and officers that it is pursuing claims on behalf of or in the interest of westernbank depositors and account holders or the fdic insurance fund.but chartis cites no cases holding that the fdic must disclose its representative capacities and interests in any demand dispatch.ultimately,nothing chartis advances on this front shows there is no likelihood of even the remotest possibility that the fdic sued on behalf of.enough said on that.
ever persistent,both sides continue battling over the question,citing a corps of cases to support their competing positions on the effect an exclusion has in circumstances like the present.none binds us,however on that everyone agrees.
chartis,for example,musters decisions involving the fdic and bank directors and officers where,it says,courts did apply the exclusion the courts rationale,chartis tells us,is that the fdic stands in the failed bank stead,so that any claim is a claim on behalf of the bank,meaning the exclusion holds sway.
wait a minute,our directors and officers respond,in those cases unlike this one the fdic either did not sue any bank directors or officers or chose not to assert any claims on behalf of.and going on the offensive,they then march out cases that,they say,hold the exclusion inapplicable when the fdic acting as a defunct bank receiver sues as a creditor itself,on behalf of other creditors,or as a subrogee to the rights of the depositors a big part of what drove those decisions,they write,is that the fdic can do much more than jump into a failed bank boots,because the firrea invests the fdic with great power,giving it not only all the rights and privileges of the departed bank but also those of its depositors,creditors,and account holders among others,too.
not to be outdone,chartis snipes at the directors and officers cases.some are too conclusory to be helpful,chartis proclaims.others,it adds,involve policies containing exclusions significantly different from the one here.
what we have is a classic battle of dueling caselaw.but such a state of affairs hurts chartis.with no controlling authority on whether an exclusion applies to the fdic in a situation like ours with cases pointing in different directions and with our obligation to resolve any doubts in the insured favor,see pagán caraballo,offic.trans.at chartis suggestion that there is zero likelihood of a remote possibility of coverage falls flat.keep in mind and we can not stress this enough likelihood not certainty is the name of the game,and possibility not actuality or probability suffices,no matter how remote that possibility is.and that standard is met here.so the judge edict stands.but we add lest anyone be confused that having lost the skirmish,chartis may still win the coverage war at a succeeding trial on the merits.see narragansett indian tribe,at see also of texas camenisch,cautioning that one should not equate likelihood of success with success.
final words 
for the reasons cast above,we affirm the challenged order.also,we award the directors and officers their costs on appeal.see fed.a.
so ordered.
chartis is now known as aig insurance company.but we will continue to refer to chartis throughout this opinion,just like the parties do in their briefs.also,anyone interested in knowing the directors and officers names should check out our case caption.
the policy does discuss claims brought by governmental regulators in a securities claims exclusion but broadly speaking only in the context of claims arising from the purchase or sale,or offer or solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell,any security of the organization.contrastingly,chartis apparently sells a broad form which the judge judicially noticed that expressly excludes coverage for claims brought by or on behalf of any state or federal regulatory or administrative agency in its capacity as receiver,conservator,liquidator,securities holder or assignee of the bank depositors or creditors.again,that exclusion is not part of this policy.
helpfully,the parties agree that puerto rico remote possibility standard applies here.and we accept that concession.see,manganella evanston ins,cir kali seafood,howe,cir.
at oral argument chartis lawyer conceded that the reasons the judge gave for denying the dismissal motion help explain why he granted the motion.
the following excerpt from a should be enough to give the reader a flavor of that provision a t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts,or of the judges thereof,granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.
do not forget,though,how their motion played up the irreparable and increasing financial harm they face in defending themselves against the fdic.many are unemployed,elderly,and on fixed incomes,or so they wrote.and i t is uncertain,they added ominously,how they can come up with the cash to fend off the fdic if chartis is not ordered to advance the cost of their defense.also,they alleged that chartis had a clear duty to pay subject to recoupment if the judge later found no coverage.they alleged,too,that the public had an interest in ensuring insurers honor their contractual obligations and that insureds get the benefit of the insurance they purchased.these are things an injunction seeker would stress,as we will soon see.see,braintree,citigroup global,cir.
cuadrado rodríguez is a case.but the court looked to cases,too,in resolving the advancement issue.see id.discussing fernández royal indem.
see paul mercury ins.miller,cv,wl,hyde fid.deposit of,d hawley ins.fslic.evanston ins.fdic,cv,dist.lexis.a quick word about paul mercury insurance.chartis gave us that case by way of a motion for leave to cite supplemental authority.the directors and officers countered with a motion to strike.an order of the court construed the motion to supplement as a rule j letter and the motion to strike as a response.see fed.j.yet even so construed,that response still asks that we strike chartis filing.we deny that request.
