rodriguez answered the complaint and against oberhuber,union bank of california,and bank of the west.both banks demurred to rodriguez original and first amended,and the demurrers were sustained with leave to amend.rodriguez then filed his second amended,the operative pleading,alleging that oberhuber,who no longer works for rodriguez,had been employed as an office manager and paralegal for eight years,during which time she embarked on an egregious scheme to launch a business scam that made unauthorized use of rodriguez information,finances and reputation.to make matters worse,he alleged,union bank and bank of the west so negligently performed the required procedures related to business accounts as to aid and allow oberhuber to conduct her scheme of fraudulent and illegal activities.had the proper procedures been followed and implemented as required by industry standards and the banks themselves,said acts of unlawfulness might have been altogether avoided.
rodriguez alleged that he provides legal services related to family law,bankruptcy law,minor civil litigation and criminal defense,and has spent a significant amount of time developing his practice and maintaining his clients confidences.oberhuber,who had access to all of rodriguez files,including confidential information,breached her duty to rodriguez by misusing and misappropriating his confidential information,forging his signature,and collaborating with others to use rodriguez property for her own gain.
conversion and related torts.in ten causes of action against oberhuber but not the banks,rodriguez alleged among other things that oberhuber had forged rodriguez name to signature cards for accounts at both bank of the west and union bank,forged his name on numerous checks drawn on the account at bank of the west,withdrawn his money from the general account at union bank,and forged his name on numerous checks drawn on a trust account at union bank.rodriguez sought general and punitive damages from oberhuber who has not appeared in this action and is not a party to this appeal.
negligence.in his second cause of action,rodriguez alleged that both banks used his confidential information that they obtained improperly from oberhuber to open several bank accounts.he alleges that,as a matter of public policy,the banks owed a duty of due care to rodriguez as a putative customer,and that the banks breached this duty by facilitating the opening of bank accounts in rodriguez name without rodriguez presence,signature or consent,which made rodriguez an involuntary customer of the banks.the banks then went on to allow fraudulent checks to be drawn against said accounts,further cementing the relationship.copies of the forged signature cards,withdrawal slips,and checks are attached to and incorporated into the.rodriguez does not allege that he or his firm had an existing relationship with either bank.
negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.in his eighth cause of action against oberhuber and the banks,rodriguez alleges that the banks,t hrough their relationship and ongoing communications with oberhuber,knew or should have known of the business relationship between rodriguez and his clients,mara and ismael,and that the banks,as a matter of public policy,owed a duty of due care to rodriguez as a putative customer.the banks,as the operators of several fraudulently opened bank accounts,knew or should have known that their failure to act with reasonable care could significantly affect the financial relationship between rodriguez and his clients.the banks acted wrongfully and without reasonable care by not requiring proper identification and verification of an authorized signor in violation of industry standards.rodriguez does not allege that he or his firm had an existing relationship with the banks.
more specifically,rodriguez alleges that b anking industry standards are reflected in bank of the west own new accounts manual and dictate that new accounts opened should be subject to verification of identity and accuracy of the information being offered by the customer.for business accounts,each signer must present a valid form of identification.the identification should be inspected and the picture should be compared with the individual presenting the identification.the birth date on the identification should approximate the age of the presenter.further,at the opening of the new account,signatures provided on signature cards are to be compared with those on the primary identification provided to ensure that they are consistent.these industry standards are also reflected in union bank policy manual,according to which it is against bank policy to open accounts for persons who are not adequately identified or any person requesting to open an account for another individual,without the person signature and consent.further,the policy manual indicates that when opening personal or business accounts,valid and reliable identification must be received and owners and officers of businesses should be personally identified.
the banks demurrers to rodriguez second amended were sustained without leave to amend,and this appeal is from the judgment of dismissal thereafter entered in favor of the banks.
discussion 
in a series of related arguments,rodriguez contends the banks owed him a duty of care because he was the banks customer and that his pleading is sufficient to state causes of action against the banks for negligence and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.because we reject rodriguez claim that a duty was owed to him by the banks,it follows that no cause of action is alleged and that the demurrers were properly sustained without leave to amend.
