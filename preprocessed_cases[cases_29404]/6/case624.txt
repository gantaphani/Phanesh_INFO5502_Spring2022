james massey and dennis murray,former directors of conseco,sued appellee merrill lynch,claiming that merrill lynch committed fraud and breached its fiduciary duty by providing an intentionally misleading opinion to conseco board of directors the board pertaining to the financial soundness of conseco proposed acquisition of green tree financial corporation green tree.because the plaintiffs claims are solely derivative claims and can only be brought on behalf of the corporation conseco,we affirm the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs claims.
background 
during the time period pertinent to this lawsuit,conseco was a indiana corporation that sold,among other things,insurance,annuities,and other financial services.from through,massey and murray served as outside directors on conseco board and also served on conseco audit committee.the present lawsuit revolves around conseco purchase of green tree,a company whose main business focused on purchasing and servicing trailer home mortgages.in april,conseco retained defendant merrill lynch to provide an opinion pertaining to conseco proposed valuation of the green tree acquisition.the parties hotly dispute the scope and nature of merrill lynch opinion,but at the motion to dismiss stage we must credit the plaintiffs version of the events.
according to the plaintiffs,merrill lynch knew that its fairness opinion pertaining to conseco proposed valuation of green tree was essential to the green tree purchase,and that conseco board would rely upon it.on april,merrill lynch provided an opinion letter in which it stated that conseco proposed exchange ratio of stock which implicitly valued green tree in the approximate range of billion was fair from a financial point of view.the plaintiffs allege that on that same day,merrill lynch made an oral presentation to conseco board to induce conseco to complete the green tree acquisition.significantly,merrill lynch purported to completely and expertly examine the operations of green tree to determine the viability of its business model the value of its assets the availability of financial wherewithal to operate the business of green tree and other financial analyses.none of these purported analyses were included in the opinion letter provided by merrill lynch.the plaintiffs also allege,on information and belief,that there was an internal debate and serious doubts among merrill lynch personnel as to whether it could issue such a fairness opinion in light of the dismal underlying facts concerning the proposed green tree acquisition.according to the plaintiffs,these doubts were disregarded by merrill lynch in favor of securing a million fee,as well as ensuring future underwriting and investment banking opportunities.
the green tree acquisition turned out to be an unmitigated disaster for conseco.within two years of conseco purchase,green tree now renamed conseco finance had suffered catastrophic losses,losing over of its original valuation.in,conseco entered bankruptcy proceedings.according to the plaintiffs,the green tree acquisition was the pivotal event that precipitated conseco bankruptcy.
the plaintiffs claim they suffered damages because they purchased retained large amounts of conseco stock which has since become worthless based upon merrill lynch alleged misrepresentations.specifically,the plaintiffs purchased large amounts of stock through conseco stock purchase program the d o program,which allowed directors and officers of conseco to purchase large stock through personal loans provided by a bank.the bank loans were collateralized by the purchased conseco stock.but the banks were not financially foolish they required conseco to guarantee the loans and conseco generously did so,although it retained recourse to recover funds from the employee participants if it incurred a loss under the guarantee.in addition,conseco fronted the interest payments for the loans.thus,through the d o program,participants were able to purchase huge amounts of conseco stock with apparently no money upfront.
perhaps not surprisingly,conseco d o program was a financial disaster,at least for the company and the shareholders who participated in the d o program.see generally mitchell pacelle and joseph hallinan,dispute breaks out over conseco loans,wall,at.in total,conseco guaranteed approximately million in bank loans for conseco executives and directors to buy shares.but these numbers are deceiving although individuals participated in the program,the vast majority of the shares approximately million of the million shares acquired under the d o program were purchased by only fifteen individuals,the majority of whom were either directors or executives.as of,murray outstanding loan balance was approximately million and massey balance was approximately million.very little of the outstanding amount was repaid by directors and officers and,due to conseco guarantee,banks turned directly to conseco for repayment.during the bankruptcy reorganization,the new conseco acquired or subrogated the rights to collect on the outstanding loans provided to the plaintiffs,and now seeks repayment from the plaintiffs.
the present complaint is the plaintiffs third attempt to draft a viable complaint.the first two complaints were dismissed because the plaintiffs included either a party in bankruptcy conseco,which would have converted this case to an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court,or parties certain partners from pricewaterhousecoopers which defeated federal jurisdiction.the district court dismissed the present amended complaint with prejudice,holding that the plaintiffs claims were based solely on the diminution of conseco stock value and,as a result,their claims were derivative in,could be brought only on behalf of conseco itself and therefore could not support a direct action brought individually by the plaintiffs.they now appeal this decision.

the central issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring these claims as a direct action,or,put another way,whether their claims are solely derivative in nature and therefore belong or belonged to conseco or the bankruptcy trustee.we look to the state law of conseco incorporation indiana,in this case to determine whether the plaintiffs claims are derivative or direct.see boland engle,cir.indiana law adheres to the corporate law principle that shareholders of a corporation may not maintain actions at law in their own names to redress an injury to the corporation even if the value of their stock is impaired as a result of the injury.barth barth,citing moll cent.solar systems,knauf fiber glass,gmbh stein,fertilizer exchange bank of chicago,cir twohy first bank of chicago,cir see generally,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations.ed.that is,g enerally speaking,the stockholders of a corporation for the purposes of litigation growing out of the relations between the corporation and a third person,surrender their personal or individual entities to the corporation in which they are stockholders.scott anderson newspapers.as a result,when a corporation suffers injury,either from corporate insiders or,as in this case,from a third party,it is the corporate the individual retains the cause of action.id.as a result,any claims that belong to the corporation must be made derivatively,brought in the name and on behalf of a corporation,and any resulting recovery flows to the corporate coffers.
in contrast,a shareholder may bring a direct action,an action on behalf of an individual shareholder or a class of shareholders to vindicate rights that belong to shareholders.for instance,a shareholder can generally bring an action to enforce voting rights,compel dividends,prevent oppression or fraud against minority shareholders,inspect corporate books,or compel shareholder meetings.see,marcuccilli ken,in addition,indiana law allows a shareholder to bring a direct action when the shareholder has suffered a distinct personal injury that is different from the type experienced by the other shareholders.knauf,at sacks am.fletcher bank trust,buschmann prof l men ass n,cir.for instance,a shareholder may maintain a direct action against a third party who harmed a corporation if the shareholder had a separate contractual agreement with the third party or the corporation that exposed the shareholder to a unique harm,different than general diminution of share price,such as personal exposure on a loan guarantee.see,sacks,at buschmann,at.
determining when a shareholder has suffered a distinct and separate injury from that suffered by other shareholders is not without complication.as an initial matter,whenever a corporation is harmed by a third party,the shareholders are also harmed,albeit indirectly.corporate losses are investor losses as well,even though the losses may not be equal across the investors,but rather proportionate to the number or type of shares an investor holds.nonetheless,the rule is that a harm to a corporation that harms a shareholder only through a diminution in share price can not amount to a distinct and separate injury because all shareholders are essentially harmed in the same manner.see twohy,at cir under general principles of united states corporate law a stockholder of a corporation has no personal or individual right of action against third persons for damages that result indirectly to the stockholder because of an injury to the corporation.flynn merrick,cir.
there are sound policy considerations to support a firm distinction between direct and derivative actions.see generally barth,at detailing policy rationale for shareholder standing rule huffman.office of env.adjudication,same pfaffenberger brooks,same.for instance,prior to filing a derivative lawsuit,a plaintiff must typically surmount several procedural hurdles,including placing a formal demand upon the corporation board of directors,or,alternatively,establishing that such a demand would be futile.see generally in re guidant shareholders derivative litigation.the underlying rationale for these requirements is that corporate directors are presumed to have the best interests of a corporation in mind and therefore should have an initial opportunity to investigate the merits of a potential lawsuit and respond accordingly.see huffman,at.this demand requirement is not an empty formality the interests of a shareholder seeking to vindicate corporate rights may well diverge from the best interests of a corporation and,indeed,this is one of the principle justifications for distinguishing between direct and derivative actions.id.t here is a concern that the real party interests will not be taken into account if that party is not represented in the action.the shareholder and the corporation may have different interests and goals in litigation,and the shareholder could act in ways that harm the corporation,even if unintentionally.
in contrast,a direct action circumvents these predicate procedural requirements and,importantly,provides recovery directly to the plaintiff,rather than recovery filtered through the corporate coffers.see generally,principles of corporate governance analysis and recommendations,frank hadesman and frank,cir.as a result,disguising derivative actions as direct ones is a particularly appealing strategy to circumvent the recovery priorities of corporate creditors established in the bankruptcy code.see kagan edison.stores,cir noting that direct recovery improperly circumvents creditors in bankruptcy proceedings fertilizer,at same.but,irrespective of the bankruptcy context,allowing direct recovery when the action is properly a derivative one fails to protect corporate creditors because the proceeds avoid the legal ordering of creditors and investors.see kagan,at.recovery by the corporation ensures that all of the,trade creditors,employees and according to their contractual and statutory priorities.furthermore,allowing a derivative action to proceed as a direct one allows for the possibility of multitudinous litigation brought by shareholders and the corporation,with the corresponding risk of and.see huffman,at.thus,maintaining a clear distinction between direct and derivative actions keeps everything in its right place.
against this legal and policy backdrop,it is clear that the plaintiffs claims here are properly characterized as derivative in nature.on its face,the plaintiffs complaint alleges a derivative injury a third party merrill lynch allegedly caused harm to a corporate entity conseco,resulting in a diminution in the value of the corporation stock,which in turn caused the plaintiffs harm.although the plaintiffs add some wrinkles to this classic scenario which we address below,their allegations nonetheless fall squarely within the types of harm that affect all shareholders.put another way,generalized declines in a corporation share price based upon third party acts are harms to the corporation,and are therefore properly redressed solely through a derivative action brought on behalf of the corporation.see,kagan,at fertilizer,at.
the plaintiffs attempt to circumvent these fundamental corporate law principles by arguing that they are not ordinary shareholders and,moreover,have suffered an injury separate and distinct from other is,an injury that is not solely based upon a general decline in the value of conseco stock.the crux of the plaintiffs argument is that their participation in conseco d o program created a separate and distinct injury.specifically,they contend that they were damaged because,as participants in the d o program,they are now at risk of personal liability on loans for which they and conseco assumed responsibility.but the fact that the plaintiffs borrowed money to purchase stock with the interest charges fronted by conseco and are now on the hook to pay those personal debts does not alter the nature of their claims.the method by which a shareholder funds a stock transaction does not alter the fundamental nature of the injury,which remains the critical inquiry here.the injury experienced by the plaintiffs was the diminution in conseco share price.without the plunge in share prices,the plaintiffs would have no damages because the collateral on their loans,the conseco shares would have value.and although the plaintiffs around this fundamental problem in their briefs,the allegations in their complaint forthrightly acknowledge this plaintiffs were damaged by merrill lynch misrepresentations and omissions because they are exposed to potential liability on the d o loans because the stock which the loans were used to purchase became worthless as a result of the green tree purchase.at compl.at emphasis added.
the authority that the plaintiffs cite to support their position is inapposite.instead,these cases stand only for the proposition that a plaintiff may bring a direct action when the plaintiff has a separate contractual agreement that exposes the plaintiff to an injury that is distinct,personal from the injury suffered by other shareholders.for instance,in sacks,at,the plaintiff shareholder provided a personal guaranty to a corporate loan,purportedly under the assumption that a bank would continue funding the corporation.the bank did not continue funding,the guaranty was called upon,and the plaintiff brought both a derivative and direct action against the bank.id.the indiana supreme court held that the plaintiff could maintain a direct action because the personal guaranty arose from a breach of a duty owed specially to the stockholder separate and distinct from the duty owed to
