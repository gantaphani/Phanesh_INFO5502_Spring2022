we address here whether a licensed family day care home operator who allegedly suffered discrimination in applying for a home loan may state a legally cognizable claim for discrimination under the fair employment and housing act feha,government code section et the day care home operator claims,inter alia,that the lender action violated feha because it constituted intentional discrimination on the basis of the borrower source of income,and had the effect of discriminating against women and families with children.
plaintiff and appellant kim sisemore sisemore,the mother of a young child,is a licensed operator of a family day care home.she sought a mortgage loan from defendant and respondent master financial,master financial to facilitate her purchase of a san jose home.she was turned down master financial stated in writing that it does not lend on day care homes.shortly thereafter,plaintiff and appellant project sentinel,a nonprofit fair housing organization project sentinel,obtained written confirmation from master financial that it will not make loans with home day care if the home day care income is required to qualify.
sisemore brought suit against master financial and two of its employees project sentinel later joined in the suit as a plaintiff they contended,among other things,that master financial policies were in violation of feha.more specifically,plaintiffs asserted that master financial had intentionally discriminated on the basis of the source of income of the loan applicant in violation of section,subdivision e and was liable under feha because its lending policy had a disparate impact on sisemore and other family day care home operators in that it disproportionately excluded women and families with children,thereby violating sections,subdivision e,and,subdivision b.the demurrer to the second amended complaint complaint was sustained without leave to amend by the court below,and plaintiffs appeal from a judgment that we deem to have been entered on that order.see discussion,pt,post.
we consider on appeal whether a discrimination claim under feha applies only in the context as the court concluded below.we also consider whether plaintiffs disparate impact claim is viable,or,as master financial urges,is not maintainable because family day care home operators are not among a class of persons protected under feha.further,we evaluate the viability of sisemore claims of discrimination under the unruh civil rights act unruh act or act,et,of unlawful or unfair business practice under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et and of violating health and safety code section.we also consider whether project sentinel had standing to allege a feha claim.
we conclude after de novo review that the lower court properly sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the first cause of action for violation of health and safety code section.the court,however,erred when it sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for violation of the unruh act.further,the court should have overruled the demurrer to the feha third cause of action.plaintiffs have stated a claim for intentional discrimination under feha section,subdivision e can not be read so narrowly as to make it applicable only to tenants or potential tenants seeking rental housing.plaintiffs have further stated a feha claim for disparate impact discrimination.moreover,we hold that project sentinel alleged sufficient facts for standing to assert a feha claim.finally,we conclude that sisemore has stated a viable claim under the ucl second cause of action.accordingly,we will reverse.
factual background 
the following material this court accepts as true for purposes of evaluating the trial court ruling on demurrer searle wyndham,th,fn,d are alleged in the complaint 
sisemore is a licensed operator of a family day care home for or fewer children.the principal source of her income is from her operation of the family day care home.sisemore has custody and care of her daughter.
in june,she was renting the home out of which she operated her day care nikki caster,a loan processor,to assist in obtaining a loan to purchase a home.caster in turn contacted colleen brehm,a representative of master financial she explained sisemore financial circumstances to brehm,including the fact that sisemore was then renting a home and that the principal source of her income was the operation of a day care home.brehm informed caster that sisemore could qualify for a particular loan product that master financial offered.that product consisted of a loan secured by a first deed of trust at an interest rate starting at percent,and a loan secured by a second deed of trust at an interest rate starting at percent.brehm did not tell caster or sisemore that a term of the home loan prohibited sisemore from using her intended home as a family day care operation.
in august,sisemore located a home in san jose that she wanted to purchase she intended to reside in it with her daughter,and to operate a day care business.caster informed brehm about the property.brehm told caster that the interest rate on the first loan had increased to percent but that the terms were otherwise the same as previously discussed.based upon this understanding,sisemore submitted an offer to purchase the home that was accepted.during the escrow process,master financial sent a letter denying sisemore loan application,stating that it does not lend on day care homes.as a result of this denial,sisemore was required to seek and obtain an alternative home loan with less attractive rates and terms than the loans she had anticipated receiving from master financial.
in july,a female project sentinel employee,who posed as a licensed home day care operator a tester,contacted master financial to inquire about qualifying for a home loan.andy vargas,an area sales manager of master financial,advised her by that master financial will not make loans with home day care if the home day care income is required to qualify.
procedural background 
sisemore filed her original complaint on august,against master financial,vargas,and brehm.thereafter,sisemore,along with project sentinel,filed a first amended complaint.master financial filed a demurrer and motion to strike relative to the first amended complaint the court in large part sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
sisemore and project sentinel filed the complaint on or about march.master financial filed a demurrer and motion to strike.the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the first through fourth causes of action of the complaint sisemore and project sentinel filed separate timely appeals from the order 
discussion 
issues on appeal 
the following issues are presented in this appeal 
whether master financial alleged policies constituted a prohibition or restriction on the use or occupancy of property as a family day care home,such that sisemore stated a claim for a violation of health and safety code section.
whether sisemore stated a cause of action for violation of the unruh act.
whether plaintiffs stated a claim for intentional discrimination based upon source of income under feha et.
whether plaintiffs stated a claim for disparate impact discrimination under feha,because master financial policies had a disproportionate effect on women or families with children.
whether project sentinel alleged sufficient facts for standing to assert a feha claim.
whether sisemore stated a cause of action under the ucl bus.
ii.appealability 
we are confronted initially with whether the matter from which the appeals have been taken is properly appealable.although master financial here does not argue that plaintiffs separate appeals are defective because they challenge a nonappealable order,we can not overlook this potential procedural infirmity the existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal.a reviewing court must raise the issue on its own initiative whenever a doubt exists as to whether the trial court has entered a final judgment or other order or judgment made appealable by code of civil procedure section.citations.jennings marralle cal th,d.since this issue is central to our jurisdiction,we address it on our own motion.olson cory cal d,nguyen calhoun th,d.
the purported appeals taken by plaintiffs were from the order sustaining the demurrer.the record does not reflect the entry of a judgment or a dismissal on the demurrer order.an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is not appealable,and an appeal is proper only after entry of a dismissal on such an order.berri superior court cal d,hill city of long beach th,d.on occasion,however,appellate courts have reviewed such orders,based upon justifications such as the avoidance of delay,the interests of justice,and the apparent intent of the trial court to have a formal judgment filed.reyna city and county of san francisco d.and when the trial court has sustained a demurrer to all of the complaint causes of action,appellate courts may deem the order to incorporate a judgment of dismissal,since all that is left to make the order appealable is the formality of the entry of a dismissal order or judgment.thaler household finance th,d see also hinman department of personnel admin.d.appeal from order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend deemed proper to avoid delay and in furtherance of justice.
here,the order sustaining the demurrer to each of the four causes of action of the complaint without leave to amend effectively ended plaintiffs ability to proceed further with their case below.the only step left to make the order appealable was the formal entry of a dismissal order or judgment.we will accordingly deem the order on the demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal and will review the order.thaler household finance,supra,th at,d.

iv.claim under health and safety code section 
contentions of the parties 
sisemore alleges in the first cause of action of her complaint that master financial conduct in rejecting her loan application constituted a practice of discrimination against family day care home providers in violation of health and safety code section.specifically,master financial violated that statute when it refused to lend to her if she operated her family day care business in the home she was acquiring through the anticipated loan issued a written instrument publishing master financial stated policy of refusing to make home loans secured by a dwelling in which a licensed home day care is operated and discriminated against other loan applicants who were home day care operators.
sisemore urges that master financial conduct was a violation of subdivision b of health and safety code section because master financial letter refusing to make a loan to a family day care home constituted a written instrument forbid ding or restrict ing the mortgaging of real property for use or occupancy as a family day care home.she contends that the trial court erroneously held that no such claim was alleged because master financial written denial did not purport to restrict any real property from being used or occupied as a family day care home.bold omitted.
sisemore argues further that she stated a cause of action for a violation of health and safety code section,subdivision c.she urges that master financial denial of a loan was a restriction or prohibition on the acquisition,use,or occupancy of property for a family day care home for children,proscribed by health and safety code section,subdivision c.sisemore argues that the court below erred by concluding that master financial alleged conduct did not violate subdivision c because it did not impose restrictions on the purchase and use of real property.she argues further that the court erred when it found that s ubdivision s b and c do not require mortgage lenders to engage in the business of lending on day care homes.
master financial responds that the statute does not apply to the matters alleged by sisemore.specifically,health and safety code section concerns the invalidity of written instruments or restrictive covenants impairing the use of real property for the operation of family day care homes.since financial not allege the existence of such a written instrument or restrictive covenant,she failed to state a cause of action under the statute.
viability of first cause of action 
health and safety code section,subdivision b 
health and safety code section,subdivision b provides every provision in a written instrument entered into relating to real property which purports to forbid or restrict the conveyance,encumbrance,leasing,or mortgaging of the real property for use or occupancy as a family day care home for children,is void and every restriction or prohibition in any such written instrument as to the use or occupancy of the property as a family day care home for children is void.as noted,sisemore contends that master financial letter denying sisemore loan application constituted a written instrument restricting or prohibiting the mortgaging of sisemore property for use or occupancy as home day care,in violation of subdivision b of the statute.reduced to its most basic form,sisemore contention is that a rejection letter in which a mortgage lender refuses to make a loan where the security is intended to be used as a family day care home constitutes a written instrument.we reject that assertion.
in construing subdivision b of health and safety code section,we begin with the actual language of the statute,and if the text is clear as applied to a given case,and it does not fall into any of the exceptions,stop there.citations.jones construction superior court th,d.we thus commence by considering whether master financial rejection letter constituted a written instrument under the statute.health and safety code section,subdivision b does not define the term,and there have been no reported decisions discussing the meaning of written instrument in subdivision b.but in context,the type of written instrument addressed in subdivision b of the statute is one entered into relating to real property and which contains certain restrictions or prohibitions concerning the use of the property.
we are guided by the manner in which instrument is defined under the government code with reference to the recordation of documents instrument,as used in this chapter,means a written paper signed by a person or persons transferring the title to,or giving a lien on real property,or giving a right to a debt or duty,subd.a.and we note that a leading authority,in identifying a nonexclusive list of types of written instruments subject to recordation under section,subdivision a does not include a mortgage lender rejection letter as being a recordable instrument.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.
as defined in legal dictionaries,the term is not susceptible of the meaning ascribed to it by sisemore.see,black law dict.ed,instrument.a written legal document that defines rights,duties,entitlements,or liabilities,such as a contract,will,promissory note,or share certificate.nor are common definitions of instrument supportive of sisemore position.see,webster third new internat.dict,cols.instrument a legal document as a deed,will,bond,lease,agreement,mortgage,note,power of attorney,ticket on carrier,bill of lading,insurance policy,warrant,writ evidencing legal rights or duties esp.of one party to another collegiate dict.ed,instrument a formal legal document as a deed,bond,or agreement 
sisemore asserts that barrett dawson th,d barrett supports a broad construction of the statute and the conclusion that master financial rejection letter constituted a written instrument.the chief issue in barrett was whether a amendment to health and safety code section formerly codified as was intended to make restrictive covenants that limited family day care homes in residential areas void irrespective of whether the covenants predated the original enactment of the statute in.significantly,the case concerned a written instrument namely,a restrictive covenant contained in a document recorded when the neighborhood was developed in.barrett,supra,at,d.barrett simply does not support the conclusion that a mortgage lender letter rejecting a borrower based upon the anticipated use of the security as a family day care home constitutes a written instrument under health and safety code section,subdivision b.
words used in a statute or constitutional provision should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citations.lungren deukmejian cal d.in this instance,we can not reasonably construe master financial letter rejecting a mortgage loan based upon the nature of sisemore anticipated use of the security to be a written instrument under subdivision b of health and safety code section.
health and safety code section,subdivision c 
health and safety code section,subdivision c provides except as provided in subdivision d concerning family home day care operated in rented or leased property,every restriction or prohibition entered into,whether by way of covenant,condition upon use or occupancy,or upon transfer of title to real property,which restricts or prohibits directly,or indirectly limits,the acquisition,use,or occupancy of such property for a family day care home for children is void.sisemore of her claim under health and safety code section,subdivision b that master financial violated subdivision c because it restricted or prohibited sisemore from using the property she intended to acquire as a family day care home.she argues that subdivision c affords broad protection against practices that directly or indirectly limit,inter alia,the use of property for family day care,including master financial practice here.
we first reject master financial argument that no claim under subdivision c was stated because its rejection letter did not constitute a written instrument.while,as we have observed,this contention has merit under subdivision b of health and safety code section,nowhere is the term written instrument found in subdivision c.there is no reason to import the requirement of a written instrument specified in subdivision b into the practices proscribed under subdivision c.
sisemore posits correctly that the scope of health and safety code section,subdivision c is broader than subdivision b,in that the former subdivision does not require a written instrument as its subject.by its terms,subdivision c embraces every restriction or prohibition entered into,irrespective of whether it is part of a written instrument.were we to interpret subdivision c as suggested by master apply only to restrictions or prohibitions found in a written instrument,the proscriptions in subdivision b would be rendered unnecessary and surplusage.bowland municipal court cal d,rejecting interpretation of statute that would render other existing provisions unnecessary.
but we do not believe that health and safety code section,subdivision c encompasses the type of conduct here,a mortgage lender rejection letter.the statute addresses restrictions or prohibitions entered into,thereby implying an arrangement more formal and binding than simply a lender stated policy regarding mortgage loans.see black law,supra,enter.to become a party to.the express intent of the legislature in enacting health and safety code section was that family day care homes for children should be situated in normal residential surroundings so as to give children the home environment which is conducive to healthy and safe development.health,subd.a.the legislature declared this policy to be of statewide concern with the purpose of occupying the field to the exclusion of municipal zoning,building and fire codes and regulations governing the use or occupancy of family day care homes for children,and to prohibit any restrictions relating to the use of residences for family day care homes for children except as provided by this chapter,par.and the court in barrett,supra,th at pages,d,identified the scope of the statute as declaring void any restrictive covenants that limited family day care homes in residential neighborhoods.see also note,family homes local barriers demonstrate needed change santa clara,only recently have a few progressive states,such as california citing health,specifically prohibited the application of deed restrictions or other written instruments respecting real property,to homes.fn.omitted.
we reject sisemore construction of health and safety code section,subdivision c,namely,that the statute applies because master financial entered into a rejection letter that restricted or prohibited the use to which security for a proposed loan could be made.the mortgage lending policy contained in that letter did not constitute a restriction or prohibition entered into,whether by way of covenant,condition upon use or occupancy,or upon transfer of title to real property,which restricts or prohibits directly,or indirectly limits,the acquisition,use,or occupancy of such property for a family day care home health,subd.c.
the first cause of action,therefore,failed to state a claim for relief as there is no reasonable probability that the complaint could have been amended to state a claim under health and safety code section,the trial court properly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to that claim.williams housing authority of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
unruh civil rights act claim 
background and contentions of the parties 
sisemore alleges in the fourth cause of action of the complaint that master financial conduct was in violation of the unruh act,et after incorporating by reference all factual allegations in the complaint,she alleges that master financial discriminated against her based on her source of income,occupation,and an arbitrary characteristic,the running of a family day care 
the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the unruh act cause of action.it reasoned that a mortgage lender may impose occupational or professional qualifications that exclude certain prospective borrowers.such restrictions do not constitute arbitrary discrimination unless the mortgage lender uses them as a pretext to exclude persons having the types of personal characteristics protected by the unruh act.the election to become a licensed home day care provider represents a professional and,probably,economic choice rather than a personal characteristic of the type enumerated in the act see roth rhodes th,d.since sisemore did not allege that the loan rejection was pretextual in order to discriminate on the basis of a protected personal characteristic,but merely alleged that master financial categorically refuse to approve mortgages for licensed home day care providers,the court concluded that the fourth cause of action failed to state a claim under the act.
sisemore asserts that the unruh act has been construed to afford broad protection against arbitrary discrimination.discrimination on the basis of one occupational status is not expressly proscribed by the statute.but our supreme court sisemore argues has reiterated that section of the civil code does not present an exhaustive list of the bases upon which discrimination is proscribed,and that courts have occasionally recognized other classifications,children,families with children that are subject to protection under the unruh act.sisemore asserts that discrimination,although not expressly mentioned in the statute,is conduct that courts have acknowledged to be prohibited under the act.
master financial responds that subdivision b of civil code section prohibits only discrimination based upon certain personal characteristics,such as gender,race,color,or religion.it argues that sisemore is attempting to improperly expand the unruh act to include protection against discrimination on the basis of an economic,rather than a personal,characteristic.master financial,citing harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,harris,contends that distinctions,such as the operation of a family day care home claimed here to be the basis of the discriminatory conduct,are not afforded protection under the act 
whether unruh civil rights act claim was alleged 
civil code section,subdivision b provides all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,medical condition,marital status,or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.as our supreme court has very recently emphasized the act expresses a state and national policy against discrimination on arbitrary grounds.citation.its provisions were intended as an active measure that would create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in california business establishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary,invidious discrimination by such establishments.citations.angelucci century supper club cal th,d.
and the supreme court has previously made clear that the listing of the particular bases for discrimination in civil code section is illustrative rather than restrictive.citation.in re cox cal d,cox.thus,in cox,the high court concluded that the unruh act prohibited a business arbitrary exclusion of a customer on the ground that he associated with a male with long hair and unconventional dress.ibid.similarly,in marina point,wolfson cal d,marina point,the court held that a blanket policy of excluding children or families with children from rental housing constituted discrimination under the act,notwithstanding the fact that those groups were not specifically enumerated in the statute.see also village green owners cal d,holding that a condominium development restricting residency to persons over violated unruh act.
in harris,supra,cal d,the supreme court revisited whether discrimination based upon characteristics not specifically enumerated in civil code section was potentially proscribed under the unruh act.after extensive discussion see harris,supra,at,the court rejected the defendants position that only classes specifically identified in the statute were protected.the harris court acknowledged that b eginning with cox in,the unruh act has been construed to apply to several classifications not expressed in the statute.citations.id.at.it therefore rejected the defendants contention that the legislature had repudiated the holdings in cox,marina point,and similar appellate decisions extending the unruh act beyond its specified categories of discrimination id.at.
the supreme court,in koebke bernardo heights country club cal th,d,koebke,reiterated that in harris,supra,it had affirmed the principle articulated in its earlier decisions that the act enumerated categories are illustrative,rather than restrictive.it explained that harris had established a a analytic framework for determining whether a future claim for discrimination,involving a category not enumerated in the statute or added by prior judicial construction,should be cognizable under the act.ibid.
although the case was not mentioned by the supreme court,slightly over a year before harris was decided,the fourth district court of appeal division three held that a police officer had stated a claim for discrimination under the unruh act on the basis of his occupational status.in long valentino d.long,the plaintiff,a police officer,attended a public meeting sponsored by the american civil liberties union aclu that concerned police practices.id.at.after being ejected by an aclu attorney,the plaintiff brought suit for damages,alleging,inter alia,a claim for unlawful discrimination under the act.id.at.the appellate court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a claim under the unruh act based upon arbitrary discrimination,and it rejected the defendants assertion that speech alone,words uttered ejecting the plaintiff was not actionable.the court stated a n announcement such as you ca eat at my diner because you are a lawyer,bricklayer,female,or indian chief would be actionable under the unruh act,although words alone were the means employed to effect the unlawful discrimination.id.at.see also mccalden california library ass cir,noting that protected classes under the unruh act have been broadly defined to include,inter alia,students,families with children,welfare recipients,and occupational groups.moreover,the court disposed of the defendants argument that police officers were not entitled to protection under the act,holding that they are as much entitled to the protections of the unruh act as any other citizen.they may not be refused service in a restaurant,denied an apartment,or ejected from a public meeting merely because of their occupation,whether working a shift or on vacation.long,supra,at.see also id.at.citing other hypothetical examples of prohibited discrimination by car rental agency,restaurateur,and transportation company.
sisemore urges that long established a judicially recognized category occupational status that is protected from arbitrary discrimination under the unruh act.she argues that since the supreme court in harris,supra,cal d,did not disturb prior case authority identifying certain protected classifications not specified in civil code section,she stated a viable cause of action under long for discrimination.
we conclude that sisemore has alleged a cognizable unruh act claim.at its most basic form,the fourth cause of action alleges that master financial arbitrarily discriminated against sisemore solely on the basis of her occupational status.liberally construed,the claim is that she was refused a mortgage loan simply because she is a family day care home operator.long,supra,d.supports the conclusion that arbitrary occupational discrimination is prohibited under the unruh act.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law,identifying occupational discrimination as being protected under unruh act,citing long.the supreme court has not overruled or even questioned long holding.in addition,we note that seven years before long was decided,the supreme court in dictum mentioned that discrimination on the basis of employment status was a cognizable claim under the unruh act.marina point,supra,cal d at,see also.concluding that arbitrary occupational discrimination was prohibited by unruh act.the high court has never repudiated that dictum.therefore,sisemore has stated a discrimination claim under the act 
master financial urges that it simply made a business decision that it would make no loans to a prospective borrower who intended to use the security for the loan his or her residence to operate a family day care business.it alternatively characterizes its conduct as a refusal to make a business loan.while these are potential explanations for its actions,the fact remains that the complaint alleges that master financial refused to provide a mortgage loan to was otherwise qualified for the loan under master financial she intended to engage in her chosen occupation as a family day care home operator.she is required by statute to use her residence to operate a family home day care facility.see health,defining facility as home regularly providing child care to or fewer children in the provider own home.sisemore therefore must use the security for her mortgage loan her home to engage in her chosen occupation.regardless of the label used to describe master financial alleged conduct,it can fairly be considered as a refusal to deal with sisemore solely on the basis of her occupation.
master financial,citing harris,also argues that the type of discrimination alleged by sisemore is entirely economic,rather than discrimination based upon a personal characteristic protected under the unruh act.this position is without merit for two reasons.first,we do not read harris as establishing a test in which discriminatory conduct is proscribed under the unruh act only if it involves a personal characteristic.rather,the court held that the act provides protection against discriminatory conduct based upon categories identified in the statute as well as others that have been identified in appellate decisions.harris,supra,cal d at.the harris court further held that,in evaluating the viability of an unruh act claim based upon a category not enumerated in the statute or identified in a prior appellate decision,one of the questions in the test is whether the new claim is based on a classification that involves personal characteristics.koebke,supra,cal th at,d.since long,supra,d,held that the unruh act prohibited arbitrary discrimination on the basis of one occupation,we need not engage in the harris test that would require a qualitative analysis of whether a person occupation is a personal characteristic,or a purely economic one.
second,even were such an analysis required,we would disagree with master financial that one occupational status is a purely economic characteristic.this case differs significantly from the circumstances in harris,where the claim was that a business could not discriminate under the unruh act by establishing a particular economic criterion for the rental of an apartment unit.here,sisemore contends that she was discriminated against because of her choice of occupations,not that she was denied a mortgage loan because that choice resulted in her earning insufficient income to meet the lender underwriting criteria.moreover,an individual choice of an it may,of course,be motivated at least in part by economic often a very personal one.
master financial relies on roth rhodes,supra,th,d,in support of its position that sisemore did not allege a viable unruh act claim.in roth,the plaintiff,a podiatrist,alleged that operators of medical buildings had,inter alia,violated the act by limiting its commercial tenants to medical doctors.id.at,d.the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of the defendants on the unruh act claim.id.at,d.the roth court posited that the question of whether a commercial landlord could refuse to lease space to podiatrists was analytically no different from the question of whether the law requires a department store which caters to the high end of the market to purchase shoes from a manufacturer who makes less expensive,lower quality shoes.or we could ask,does the law prohibit a landlord from limiting his tenancies to lawyers,merchants,or any specific trade or profession id.at,d.the court concluded that restrictions by a commercial landlord limiting tenants to certain occupations do not run afoul of the act as long as the restrictions are not used as a pretext to exclude persons having personal characteristics protected under the act.id.at,d.in so holding,the court noted that the choice of a profession is a professional and,frequently,an economic choice,rather than a personal characteristic of the type enumerated in the a id.at,d.
while a cursory reading of roth might suggest that sisemore occupational status is not protected under the unruh act against arbitrary discrimination of the kind alleged here,we conclude that roth dictates no such conclusion.roth concerned a commercial landlord decision to tailor its tenant base to a particular occupation to the exclusion of all others.this business decision provided a uniform tenancy for the commercial building,rather than an arbitrary exclusion of one particular occupational group.
further,the procedural posture in roth differs greatly from the status of our case.the trial court in roth granted summary adjudication after receiving evidence concerning the defendants business justification for the allegedly discriminatory practice.here,the court rejected the claim at the demurrer stage,without any evidence of master financial justification for refusing to make a mortgage loan to sisemore because of her occupation.on the face of the pleadings,master financial arbitrarily rejected sisemore as a borrower solely because of her occupation even though she otherwise met the lender qualifications.at this stage,it was improper for the court to have found that sisemore had not stated a viable claim under the unruh act.
moreover,roth did not repudiate the holding in long,supra,d,that the unruh act prohibits arbitrary occupational discrimination.indeed,the roth court neither cited long nor held categorically that the act does not protect against any form of discrimination.see elisa superior court cal th,d,language used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.we therefore conclude that roth is distinguishable from the circumstances before us and does not compel the conclusion that sisemore has failed to state a claim under the act.
the purpose of the unruh act is to compel a recognition of the equality of citizens in the right to the particular service offered by an organization or entity covered by the act.marina point,supra,cal d at,see also curran mount diablo council of the boy scouts d.as the supreme court has held,t he act is to be given a liberal construction with a view to effectuating its purposes.citations.koire metro car wash cal d,see also angelucci century supper club,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude that a finding here that sisemore stated a viable unruh act claim for occupational discrimination is consistent both with the holding in long and the statute policy of prohibiting arbitrary denial of access to public accommodations.
vi.feha claims 
background 
in the third cause of action,plaintiffs allege that master financial committed unlawful housing practices in violation of feha.they assert that master financial,as a mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for the purchase,organization,or construction of any housing accommodation,discriminate d against a person or group of persons because of the sex,familial status,or source of income in the terms,conditions,or privileges relating to the obtaining or use of that financial assistance,subd.e.
there are two essential components to plaintiffs position.first,they assert that they properly alleged a claim for intentional discrimination against a group specifically protected under,persons discriminated against based on the source of their income in violation of subdivision e of section.second,plaintiffs contend that they alleged a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination in violation of subdivision e of section because master financial policy of not lending to home day care operators disproportionately affected two protected classes,namely,women and families with children.since a feha violation may be shown as provided in section,subdivision b by establishing that an act prohibited by feha has the effect,regardless of intent,of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of sex or familial status,plaintiffs contend that they stated a viable disparate impact claim.
the court below concluded that neither plaintiff had alleged a viable feha claim.it concluded that the source of income category in section,when the statute is viewed as a whole and in conjunction with its legislative history,applies only to prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing.it does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for a mortgage loan.the court held further that plaintiffs disparate impact claim failed because the allegations did not establish that the alleged discriminatory practices affect women as a group or families with children as a group.instead,they establish that the discriminatory practices affect licensed home day care providers as a group.the feha does not protect this group.
we address separately below plaintiffs intentional discrimination and disparate impact theories.we also address master financial assertion that the order sustaining the demurrer was proper as to the entity plaintiff on the additional ground that project sentinel lacks standing to assert a feha claim.
plaintiffs intentional discrimination claims under feha 
section makes a variety of discriminatory housing practices unlawful.subdivision e of the which plaintiffs intentional discrimination claims are it unlawful f or any person,bank,mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for the purchase,organization,or construction of any housing accommodation to discriminate against any person or group of persons because of the race,color,religion,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,national origin,ancestry,familial status,source of income,or disability in the terms,conditions,or privileges relating to the obtaining or use of that financial assistance.italics added.based upon master financial statements to sisemore that it does not lend on day care homes,and to project sentinel that it will not make loans with home day care if the home day care income is required to qualify plaintiffs contend that they were denied a mortgage loan on the basis of source of income as proscribed by section,subdivision e.
master financial primary response is that the terms of section make it clear that the discrimination provisions apply only in the context of discrimination by a landlord against an actual or potential tenant seeking rental housing.in support of this position,it cites subdivision p of the statute,which provides for the purposes of this section,source of income means lawful,verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant.for the purposes of this section,a landlord is not considered a representative of a tenant.master financial argues further that the legislative history of the amendment to section compels the conclusion that the provisions protect only tenants or prospective tenants against discrimination by landlords.
the interpretation and application of a statute involve questions of law subject to de novo review.amdahl county of santa clara th,d.we take a sequential approach to interpreting statutory language.see halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d halbert lumber.first,we will examine the language at issue,giving the words of the statute their ordinary,everyday meaning.id.at,d see also lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.if we conclude that the statutory meaning is free of doubt,uncertainty,or ambiguity,the language of the statute controls,and our task is completed.halbert lumber,supra,at,d see also security pacific national bank wozab cal d.second,if we determine that the language is unclear,we will attempt to determine the legislature intent as an aid to statutory construction.halbert lumber,supra,at,d.in attempting to ascertain that intent,we must examine the legislative history and statutory context of the act under scrutiny.citations.sand superior court cal d.third,if the clear meaning of the statutory language is not evident after attempting to ascertain its ordinary meaning or its meaning as derived from legislative intent,we will apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.if possible,the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable citations,practical citations,in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result citations.halbert lumber,supra,at,d.
we will conform to this procedure in our interpretation of the statutory language at issue here.
whether language is clear on its face 
on its face,the language of subdivision e of section discrimination against any person or group of persons on the basis of source of clear on its face.person is not limited in any way in its ordinary sense,the language would suggest universal application to any man,woman,or child who is subjected to discrimination on the basis of his or her source of income in connection with the financing of the purchase,construction,or organization of housing.
but subdivision p of section undermines the supposedly clear meaning of any person or group of persons in subdivision e.while the definition of source of income found in subdivision p does not compel the conclusion that subdivision e prohibits discrimination only in the context of persons seeking rental housing,the collision of these two subdivisions creates an ambiguity unresolved by the first step of statutory construction.
accordingly,we will attempt to ascertain the meaning of the statute by examining legislative intent.
legislative intent 
master financial in its demurrer contended that the legislature clear intent was to make the provisions concerning source of income discrimination applicable only in the context.it cited certain language purportedly describing the purpose of the bill ultimately enacted in to amend section the language,describing a version of senate bill,reads this bill would make it unlawful for a landlord to use specified financial or income standards for the rental of housing.the standard would be unlawful if it a fails to account for the aggregate income of persons residing together or proposing to reside together,or the aggregate income of the tenants and their,on the same basis as the aggregate income of married persons residing together or proposing to reside together or b uses a minimum income standard based on a multiple or percentage of the rent that,in case where there is a government rent subsidy,fails to calculate the minimum income based solely on the part of the rent to be paid by the tenant.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
sisemore correctly notes that the above quoted language related to an early version of senate bill at the time,the proposed legislation did not have source of income language as part of an amendment to section.instead,it proposed the inclusion as subds.m and n of of language prohibiting the failure to account for certain income of actual or prospective tenants as outlined in the language quoted in the preceding paragraph.the proposed legislation was amended in july,at which time appeared the source of income language that ultimately became part of the amendment to section.therefore,we conclude that the language cited by master financial in its demurrer does not support the conclusion that the legislative intent was to limit the class of persons protected against discrimination to actual or prospective tenants seeking rental housing.
master financial also asserts that a heading to and introductory language concerning senate bill support its position regarding legislative intent.specifically,it cites the following heading and preamble to a committee report for the proposed legislation subject landlord and tenant of parties upon termination of section information and criteria description this bill would amend the laws as follows com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.but as we have noted,this description concerned an early iteration of senate bill that preceded its amendment in which language appeared.further,we find such descriptions in headings to analyses of proposed legislation to have little or no value in ascertaining legislative intent.
of some significance here in evaluating legislative intent is a portion of the legislative counsel digest of the final version of senate bill this bill would,until january,prohibit discrimination under feha on the basis of a person source of income,the failure to account for the aggregate income of coresidents,or the failure to exclude a government rent subsidy from that portion of the rent to be paid by the tenant in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing.legis.counsel,stats,ch,italics added.the legislative counsel use of the term person in the first clause to describe the class of individuals who would be protected under the bill against when juxtaposed against the term tenant in the second plaintiffs assertion that subdivision e of section was intended to protect all persons,not just tenants or prospective tenants,against discrimination.see harris,supra,cal d at,fn,courts may ascribe to the legislature the intentions expressed in the legislative counsel digest of a statutory amendment.
in our effort to ascertain the intent of the legislature here,we are mindful of the observation of justice sills that reading the tea leaves of legislative history is often no easy matter.even assuming there is such a thing as meaningful collective intent,courts can get it wrong when what they have before them is a motley collection of authors statements,committee reports,internal memoranda and lobbyist letters in light of these factors,the wisest course is to rely on legislative history only when that history itself is unambiguous.jones construction superior court,supra,th at,d.after consideration of the matter,we believe that it would be imprudent to render a conclusive interpretation of the amendment to section on the basis of legislative intent 
application of reason and common sense 
the court below interpreted the source of income protections of section as prohibit ing discrimination on the basis of a person source of income in assessing his or her eligibility for rental housing only.it thus restricted the statute to affording protection only to tenants or prospective tenants,and then,only in the context of discrimination by a landlord in a lease transaction.in effect,the court held that subdivision p source of income definition trumped other subdivisions of the statute that facially provide protection against discrimination to all persons.we conclude that this was an erroneous interpretation of the statute for several reasons.
first,this narrow interpretation ascribes little significance to the fact that section appears on its face to provide broad protection against discrimination in a variety of housing contexts,and not simply to situations.it is not only subdivision e of section subdivision at issue appears to afford broad protection to all persons against discrimination.subdivision a makes it unlawful f or the owner of any housing accommodation to discriminate against or harass any person because of the person source of income subdivision c of section prohibits the printing or publication of any notice,statement,or advertisement,with respect to the sale or rental of a housing accommodation that indicates any preference,limitation,or discrimination based on source of income further,subdivision i prohibits one whose business involves real transactions from discriminate ing against any person in making available a transaction,or in the terms and conditions of a transaction,because of source of income and subdivision j makes it unlawful t o deny a person access to,or membership or participation in,a multiple listing service,real estate brokerage organization,or other service because of source of income moreover,apparently broad proscriptions against discrimination appear in four other subdivisions of section.see,subds.d,h,k,l.
none of the nine subdivisions of the statute that make reference to prohibiting discrimination,on their face,appears to limit either the class of potential discriminatees to actual or prospective tenants or the proscription to relationships.the trial court construction of the statute fails to in fact creates conflict nine subdivisions of section appearing to provide broad coverage for discrimination,on the one hand,and subdivision p,on the other hand.see view water agency verjil cal th,d,provisions that are related should be read together and construed in a manner that gives effect to each,yet does not lead to disharmony with the others,fair employment housing com.cal d,s tatutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.
second,an interpretation limiting persons protected against discrimination under subdivision e of section to tenants or prospective tenants would conflict with our duty to make the language of the statute workable and reasonable.regents of university of california superior court cal d,fn.omitted.rather than make section,in its entirety,work,the trial court construction would result in subdivision e as well as eight other applied to individual cases in a much more restrictive manner than appears warranted by the statutory language.the limitation of discriminatees under section to tenants or prospective tenants is not a construction that makes the statutory language reasonable.
third,we believe that allowing subdivision p to effectively trump the nine preceding subdivisions of section by severely restricting the statute protections against discrimination would not be in accord with common sense and justice.halbert lumber,supra,th at,d.feha is to be liberally construed.auburn woods i homeowners fair employment housing com.th,d auburn woods see generally people ex rel.of transportation muller cal d,remedial statute should be liberally construed to promote its objectives.an interpretation of section limiting the statute apparently broad discrimination protections to circumstances would indeed be a narrow one.
fourth,the trial court construction of the statute does not avoid,but in fact promotes,an absurd result.wasatch property management degrate cal th,d,a statute should be interpreted to avoid an absurd result.it would make the apparent broad protections against discrimination found in nine different subdivisions of section virtually meaningless.the application of discrimination only to tenants or prospective tenants would render nugatory the source of income language in various subdivisions of the statute.for example,it is doubtful that subdivision j proscribing discrimination in connection with access to,membership in,or participation in,a multiple listing service,a real estate brokerage organization,or other realistically prohibit any discrimination if the only potential discriminatees were actual or prospective tenants.more to the point here,it is difficult to imagine that subdivision e would have any application if its discrimination prohibitions to loans made to assist in the purchase,organization,or construction of any housing accommodation applied only to tenants.
we therefore conclude that subdivision p of section does not confine the protections afforded to potential discriminatees under subdivision e to tenants or potential tenants seeking rental housing.rather,since subdivision e prohibits discrimination by any person,bank,mortgage company or other financial institution that provides financial assistance for the purchase,organization,or construction of any housing accommodation,the source of income definition in subdivision p should be read as having potential application only when the potential discriminatee is a tenant or potential tenant and the potential discrimination arises out of efforts to seek rental housing.in this manner,the apparent broad protections against discrimination afforded under subdivision e are harmonized with subdivision p definition of source of income in the context of potential tenant discrimination.moreover,such an interpretation is a liberal construction of feha that is in furtherance of its broad objectives to proscribe discrimination in the employment and housing settings.
plaintiffs have alleged that master financial discriminated against them on the basis of their source of income in connection with their efforts to obtain financial assistance to purchase a housing accommodation.they have stated a viable claim for intentional discrimination under section,subdivision e.the demurrer to the third cause of action of the complaint should therefore have been overruled 
plaintiffs disparate impact claims under feha 
background 
plaintiffs contend that their respective claims under feha are viable under an alternative theory of disparate impact discrimination.they argue that master financial practice of not lending to family day care home operators,while arguably facially neutral,had a disparate impact on protected and familial status.as noted above,the court rejected this contention,concluding that the allegations of the complaint merely showed that the discriminatory practices affect licensed home day care providers as a group.the feha does not protect this group.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that a disparate impact theory of discrimination is applicable to feha claims.they contend that the complaint properly alleged both elements of such a theory the existence of an outwardly neutral policy,no loans to family day care home operators and master financial lending practice,regardless of its intent,had the effect of discriminating on the basis of gender and familial status without a sufficient business justification for that practice.thus plaintiffs assert,as the policy is alleged to have had a significant adverse or disproportionate effect upon one or more protected classes,the third cause of action states a cognizable disparate impact claim.
master financial responds that the lending policy claimed to be discriminatory involved economic rather than personal characteristics.further,family daycare home providers are not recognized as a protected class under feha thus,the trial court properly rejected the disparate impact claim.moreover,master financial asserts that feha does not prevent lenders from taking business factors into consideration as criteria in deciding whether to make loans here,it was proper for master financial to reject the proposed collateral real property to be used for family day care in determining whether to make a loan.
we address the merits of these contentions below 
viability of disparate impact theory 
as a threshold matter,we consider whether a feha housing discrimination claim may be founded on a disparate impact theory we conclude that this theory is recognized both under the california statute,subd.b and under federal decisional authority applicable to feha.
a disparate impact theory,as an alternative to a theory of disparate treatment or intentional discrimination,is recognized in the context of employment discrimination claims under feha.carter cb richard ellis,th,d carter.as explained by our supreme court disparate treatment is intentional discrimination against one or more persons on prohibited grounds.citations.prohibited discrimination may also be found on a theory of disparate impact,that regardless of motive,a facially neutral employer practice or policy,bearing no manifest relationship to job requirements,in fact had a disproportionate adverse effect on members of the protected class.citations.guz bechtel national,cal th,fn,d.
the parties have cited no case authority specifically holding that a disparate impact housing discrimination claim may be asserted under opposed to a feha employment discrimination claim.but plaintiffs urge that section authorizes such a housing discrimination theory for purposes of this article,in connection with unlawful practices b proof of a violation causing a discriminatory effect is shown if an act or failure to act that is otherwise covered by this part,and that has the effect,regardless of intent,of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,sexual orientation,familial status,marital status,disability,national origin,or ancestry while there have been no reported decisions addressing the meaning and application of this statute,section,subdivision b plainly authorizes a claim for housing discrimination irrespective of intent,where the alleged act or omission has the effect of discriminating on the basis of one race,color,religion,sex,sexual orientation,familial status,marital status,disability,national origin,or ancestry.
the legislative history of section supports this conclusion.the senate judiciary committee report concerning assembly bill legislation that included the enactment of section see stats,ch,makes it plain that the legislature wished to recognize expressly that discrimination under feha could be based upon either disparate treatment or disparate impact.this bill specifically provides that violation of the feha may be established by proving that a an act or failure to act demonstrates an intent to discriminate in violation of the feha or b an act or failure to act has the effect,regardless of intent,of unlawful discrimination.the federal courts have generally held that violations of federal fair housing laws can be established by proving discriminatory effect.citations.discriminatory effect is demonstrated by application of a disparate impact analysis.this analysis permits a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a respondent practice or policies have an adverse impact on a statutory ily protected class,race,religion,sex.once the prima facie case is established,the burden shifts to the respondent to justify the challenged practice or policy com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the analysis cited several disparate impact cases decided under the federal housing discrimination laws.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.it also noted that feha as it existed in former section provided that nothing in it shall be construed to abrogate or limit the holding in keith volpe,relating to discriminatory effect.in that case,the ninth circuit upheld the district court finding that a violation of the federal housing discrimination laws had been established by evidence of discriminatory effect.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.the legislative history of section clearly demonstrates the recognition that housing discrimination under feha may be established either by disparate treatment or by disparate impact.see also assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
moreover,even absent this statutory authority,t he legislature sought to make the feha substantially equivalen t citation to the federal fair housing act the fha and its amendments et,konig fair employment and housing com cal th,d,see also broadmoor san clemente homeowners nelson th,d.accordingly,c ourts often look to cases construing the fha,when interpreting feha auburn woods,supra,th at,d,and federal authority plainly authorizes disparate impact housing discrimination claims under the fha.see betsey turtle creek associates,supra,at keith volpe,supra,at.
to present a prima facie disparate impact case under the federal statute the fha,a plaintiff must show at least that the defendant actions had a discriminatory effect.citations.discriminatory effect means that the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results in prohibited discrimination citation.keith volpe,supra,at,quoting united states city of black jack,missouri,supra,at.the plaintiff need not show a discriminatory intent to establish a disparate impact claim under the fha.pfaff of housing cir.rather,the essential premise of an fha disparate impact claim is that some housing practices,adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive,may in operation be functionally equivalent to intentional discrimination.citations.mountain side mobile estates secretary of hud cir,fn.omitted.
for example,a facially neutral practice of refusing to rent to a prospective tenant receiving afdc aid to families with dependent children benefits was nonetheless held to have had a discriminatory effect upon a protected class families with children to support a housing discrimination claim under the fha.gilligan jamco development cir.similarly,while an policy for an apartment building may have been facially,at the time,families with children were not a protected disparate impact claim was held maintainable where it had a disproportionately adverse impact on minority tenants.betsey turtle creek associates,supra,at.likewise,a municipality refusal to approve a low to moderate income housing development for tenants displaced by a freeway was held to have had a disproportionate effect under the fha because of the displaced tenants were minorities.keith volpe,supra,at.
in gilligan,betsey,keith,and other disparate impact cases,the challenged policy appears benign because it applies on its face to a group of individuals who are not members of a protected class.but the implementation of that policy has a disproportionate adverse effect upon members of a class that is protected.in this instance,the facially neutral practices are the alleged refusal to make loans to day care homes,and fund mortgage loans where the source of income used to qualify for the loan is the operation of a day care home.because of the residency requirements for such facilities health,these practices effectively constitute the refusal to make loans to family home day care operators.nationwide mut.ins.cisneros cir,holding that scope of fha was broad enough to include redlining,where discriminatory practice of limiting availability of property insurance directly impacted person ability to obtain housing.plaintiffs have alleged further that this facially neutral policy had a disproportionately negative impact on members of two protected and families with children,because licensed day care home providers in santa clara county are made up of higher percentages of women and families with children than the percentages of those groups as reflected in the county general population.therefore,since plaintiffs have alleged facts in the complaint of a violation causing a discriminatory effect by alleging practices that have the effect regardless of intent,of unlawfully discriminating on the basis of sex or familial status,subd.b,they have properly pleaded a disparate impact housing discrimination claim under feha.
but the court below reasoned that plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action because the complaint alleges only discrimination against licensed home day care providers,a class that is not protected under feha.this rationale for sustaining the demurrer was flawed.as we have noted,the essence of a disparate impact claim is that a challenged policy,while facially neutral,not evidencing intentional discrimination against a protected class,in practice and effect is discriminatory toward a particular protected class.guz bechtel national,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,the fact that master financial policies,on their face,impacted an unprotected class,family day care home operators does not preclude a disparate impact claim.
master financial claims that its challenged policies concern economic matters and do not discriminate even indirectly on the basis of personal characteristics.but there is nothing in feha that remotely suggests that housing disparate treatment or disparate impact not occur if the act or omission involved economic choices rather than ones based upon personal characteristics.and the federal statute the fha does not contain a limitation that housing discrimination must be based upon personal characteristics.see,gilligan jamco development,supra,challenging policy of excluding prospective tenants with afdc income national fair housing alliance,prudential ins.of america d challenging homeowners insurer redlining policy as having disparate impact on minorities seeking to purchase homes in certain regions.
in addition,master financial asserts that carter,supra,th,d,a case cited by the trial court in its ruling,is controlling.there,the plaintiff alleged that her employer reorganization demoting administrative managers had a disparate impact on women and persons over.id.at,d.but she asserted erroneously that administrative managers were a protected group.id.at,d.the appellate court concluded that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence at trial to support a disparate impact claim because her data set was incomplete id.at,d she had failed to present statistical evidence detailing the percentage of women and persons over in the control group of all employees to compare it with the administrative managers affected by the company policy.id.at,d.
carter is not controlling.first,carter was an employment discrimination case decided after a trial the appellate court held that the defendant jnov judgment notwithstanding the verdict motion should have been granted due to the absence of plaintiff evidentiary showing.carter,supra,th at,d.here,we examine only whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient ultimate facts in support of their disparate impact housing discrimination claim to survive demurrer.second,in contrast to the circumstances in the plaintiff made the erroneous assertion that administrative managers were a protected group id.at,d plaintiffs disparate impact claim here is not so.as noted,plaintiffs do not claim that day care home operators are a protected class.
third,plaintiffs here have alleged an adequate foundation for their disparate impact claim.they have asserted that master financial policies disproportionately affected women and families with children because those two protected classes comprise a much higher percentage of day care home operators in santa clara county than the percentages of those groups found generally in the county.see charleston housing auth.of agric.cir,tenants of public housing units slated for demolition established prima facie case that proposed action had disparate impact on minorities mountain side mobile estates secretary of hud,supra,at noting that a number of cases determined existence of disparate impact under the fha based on statistical evidence regarding the narrowly defined area in question.in contrast,the plaintiff in carter failed to present any evidence as to the composition of all employees of the company in order to determine whether the challenged policy in fact had a disparate impact on women and persons over.carter,supra,th at,d.thus,for all the court in carter knew,the composition of women and persons over in the company employment roster as a whole was at least equal to the percentages of those groups in the subset,administrative managers directly affected by the challenged policy.
we therefore hold that section,subdivision b authorizes a housing discrimination claim where the effect of the alleged practice was to discriminate against a person on the basis of,inter alia,his or her gender or familial status,irrespective of whether that discrimination was intentional.we conclude further that plaintiffs have stated a claim under this statute.master financial may ultimately disprove the allegations that its policies had a disparate impact upon women or families with children.it may ultimately defeat plaintiffs claims by,for example,establishing that its lending policy was justified by business necessity the allegations,however,are sufficient to sustain a disparate impact claim at this early pleading stage.see construction protective services,tig specialty ins,supra,cal th at,d.the demurrer to the third cause of action should have been overruled because the complaint adequately stated a disparate impact claim under feha.
project sentinel standing to sue 
master financial contended in its demurrer that project sentinel lacked standing to maintain the third cause of action.the court did not specifically rule on this issue,having sustained the demurrer based upon a finding that neither plaintiff had stated a cause of action under feha.master financial renews this position on appeal.
feha authorizes the filing of suit by a n aggrieved person to seek relief for a discriminatory housing practice or a breach of a conciliation agreement.the act defines aggrieved person as inclu
