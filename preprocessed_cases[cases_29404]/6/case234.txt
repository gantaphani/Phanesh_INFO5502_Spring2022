plaintiff bank of the united states exim appeals from a may,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york donald pogue,judge,united states court of international trade,sitting by designation quashing two writs of garnishment in connection with exim efforts to collect a million judgment against defendants pursuant to the federal debt collection procedures act fdcpa,et.the district court quashed the writs of garnishment to the extent they restrained electronic fund transfer eft credits at intermediary banks.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order and hold that an eft temporarily in the possession of an intermediary bank in new york may not be garnished under the fdcpa to satisfy judgment debts owed by the originator or intended beneficiary of that eft.
background 
i.the parties 
exim,a government corporation organized and existing under federal law as the official export credit agency of the united states,et,is the holder of over million of debt owed by defendants.exim is an agency of the united states and has a mandate to maintain and increase employment and to promote the export of domestic products by providing financial support for export sales to overseas buyers.in carrying out its mandate,exim offers direct loans,loan guarantees,working capital guarantees,and insurance.id.when exim guarantees a loan and the borrower defaults on payment obligations,exim pays the lender an amount up to the outstanding principal and interest on the loan.in return,exim is assigned the lender rights to the debt and any associated security interests.
defendants together form one of the largest paper manufacturers in the world.defendant asia pulp paper company,app is the former parent company of the three other defendants in this case pt indah kiat pulp and paper tbk pt pabrik kertas tjiwi kimia tbk tjiwi kimba and pt pindo deli pulp paper mills pindo deli collectively known as the principal indonesian operating companies piocs.the piocs are indonesian companies,while app is based in singapore.
ii.loan default 
the piocs borrowed over million via thirteen different loans issued through exim direct loan and loan guarantee programs.of these thirteen loans,twelve were private loans that exim guaranteed and one was issued directly to defendants by exim.three of the thirteen notes also included a separate guarantee signed by app that obligated app as guarantor to repay the loans.
in march,defendants announced a worldwide standstill on the repayment of over billion of debt,including the thirteen loans relevant to this appeal.upon defendants default,exim fully paid the private lenders on the twelve private loans and,in return,the private lenders assigned exim their respective rights,title,and interest in the loans.
iii.the district court proceedings 
following defendants default,exim sued for breach of contract,breach of promissory notes,and breach of guarantee and sought relief pursuant to the fdcpa.on february,the district court granted exim motion for summary judgment,finding that there was no dispute that defendants had defaulted on their loans and that defendants had failed to raise an issue of fact about whether their default should be excused.bank of asia pulp paper,wl,at.on may,the district court entered a judgment in excess of million in favor of exim against defendants,which we subsequently affirmed.bank of asia pulp paper,app x cir,unpublished disposition.
on february,seeking to collect on the judgment,exim applied pursuant to the fdcpa for the issuance of writs of garnishment to retain property in which several defendants purportedly had a nonexempt interest.the following day,the district court granted exim applications,and exim promptly served the writs on deutsche bank trust company americas deutsche bank and bank of new york mellon corporation bony,directing them to withhold all property in their possession,custody or control in which defendants tjiwi kimba and pindo deli,respectively,had a substantial nonexempt interest.
on march,deutsche bank answered the writ of garnishment it had received,noting that tjiwi kimba did not maintain any accounts at deutsche bank,but that deutsche bank nevertheless had in its custody,possession and control seven efts belonging to or in the name of tjiwi kimba,which deutsche bank had intercepted and restrained as an intermediary bank.the seven efts intercepted and restrained by deutsche bank,totaling,include three transfers for which tjiwi kimba is listed as originator and four transfers for which tjiwi kimba is listed as beneficiary.
on march,bony answered the writ of garnishment that it had received,stating that the only property it possessed in which pindo deli may have a property interest consisted of efts for which bony was the intermediary bank.specifically,between february,and march,bony received eft payment orders either to or from pindo deli.in total,bony had in its possession in bank credits for pindo efts.
defendants tjiwi kimba and pindo deli objected to the answers of deutsche bank and bony,respectively,arguing that new york law prohibits the restraint of efts at intermediary banks and as originator or intended beneficiary of the efts,neither tjiwi kimba nor pindo deli had any property interest in the efts restrained by deutsche bank and bony.on april,the district court quashed the writs of garnishment insofar as they may have been interpreted to permit garnishment of efts between intermediary banks.bank of asia pulp paper,wl,at april,ii.
discussion 
the present appeal requires us to determine whether an eft temporarily in the possession of an intermediary bank in new,a midstream be garnished under the fdcpa to satisfy judgment debts owed by either the originator or the intended beneficiary of the eft.to answer this question we first look to new york law to determine the scope and contours of the relationship between the midstream eft and the originator or intended beneficiary in other words,we look to new york law to determine the interests and rights,if any,that an originator or intended beneficiary has with regard to an eft temporarily in the possession of an intermediary bank.we then must determine as a matter of federal law whether those interests and rights,if any,are sufficient to trigger application of the fdcpa,a federal statute that authorizes the garnishment of property in which a debtor has a substantial interest.a.we review these legal questions de novo.shipping of india jaldhi overseas pte,cir reviewing de novo the threshold issue of whether efts are indeed defendant property,cert.denied,wl,see also salve regina college russell,holding that a court of appeals should review de novo a district court determination of state law.
i.the attachment of midstream efts under various federal statutes 
in addressing whether efts may be subject to garnishment or attachment in various contexts,we consider both the nature of efts and the legal provisions that regulate them.as we have previously observed 
an eft is nothing other than an instruction to transfer funds from one account to another.when the originator and the beneficiary each have accounts in the same bank,that bank simply debits the originator account and credits the beneficiary account.when the originator and beneficiary have accounts in different banks,the method for transferring funds depends on whether the banks are members of the same wire transfer consortium.if the banks are in the same consortium,the originator bank debits the originator account and sends instructions directly to the beneficiary bank,upon which the beneficiary bank credits the beneficiary account.if the banks are not in the same is often true in international the banks must use an intermediary bank.to use an intermediary bank to complete the transfer,the banks must each have an account at the intermediary bank or at different banks in the same consortium.after the originator directs its bank to commence an eft,the originator bank would instruct the intermediary to begin the transfer of funds.the intermediary bank would then debit the account of the bank where the originator has an account and credit the account of the bank where the beneficiary has an account.the originator bank and the beneficiary bank would then adjust the accounts of their respective clients.
after making these observations about the nature of efts,we recently held that efts in the temporary possession of an intermediary bank can not be subject to attachment under rule b of the supplemental rules for admiralty or maritime claims and asset forfeiture actions of the federal rules of civil procedure rule b.id.at.we arrived at this conclusion because rule b authorizes the attachment only of defendant property and because midstream efts are the property of neither the originator nor the beneficiary of the eft under new york law id.
we note that our holding and analysis in jaldhi was based firmly on the specific wording and provisions of rule b that limit attachment to property owned by the defendant.as we recognized in jaldhi,efts that are temporarily in the possession of an intermediary bank may be seized pursuant to other federal statutes,such as,because the language and purpose of those provisions differ significantly from rule id.at.in contrast to rule b,we noted that the forfeiture provisions of require only that the efts be traceable to illegal activities and do not require any inquiry into the identity of the owner of the efts.id.at.in sum,jaldhi instructs that whether or not midstream efts may be attached or seized depends upon the nature and wording of the statute pursuant to which attachment or seizure is sought.
here,exim sought writs of garnishment pursuant to the fdcpa.in line with jaldhi,we therefore look to the fdcpa language to determine whether the district court properly quashed exim writs of garnishment to the extent those writs restrained efts at intermediary banks.
ii.the fdcpa 
the fdcpa provides the exclusive civil procedures for the united states to recover a judgment on a debt.a.the statute was enacted to create a comprehensive statutory framework for the collection of debts owed to the united states government and to improve the efficiency and speed in collecting those debts.med.computer,cir.in contrast to rule b,which requires that funds be the defendant property in order to be attached,the fdcpa authorizes the issuance of writs of garnishment to any person in possession,custody or control of property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest.a emphasis added.subject to several exceptions not relevant here,the fdcpa broadly defines property to include any present or future interest,whether legal or equitable,in real,personal including choses in action,or mixed property,tangible or intangible,vested or contingent,wherever located and however held id.
although the fdcpa specifically defines the types of property potentially subject to garnishment,the fdcpa does not identify who has a right or interest in that property.this is unsurprising the federal debt collection procedures a procedural statute enacted to give the justice department uniform federal procedures to collect debts owed the united states nationwide,at emphasis added explaining change from scheme of reliance on diverse state procedural rules see also.noting that the purported goal of creating federal legislation regarding debt collection is simply to establish uniform procedural standards.there is no evidence,either from the statute language or legislative history,that the fdcpa creates any interests or rights in property.in the absence of a superseding federal statute or regulation,state law generally governs the nature of any interests in or rights to property that an entity may have,barnhill johnson.accordingly,although the fdcpa expressly preempt s state law to the extent such law is inconsistent with a provision of the fdcpa,d,there appears to be no inconsistency between the fdcpa procedural framework and new york state laws that govern the scope and contours of an entity interests and rights in property.franks inv.llc union pac,cir en banc noting a presumption against preemption in areas of law traditionally reserved to the states,like police powers and property law.this results because the fdcpa itself creates no property rights but merely attaches consequences,federally defined,to rights created under state law.united states craft,quoting united states bess,in reference to federal tax lien statute.
our analysis like the analysis of the federal tax lien statute,another federal statute that,like the fdcpa,creates no property rights but merely attaches consequences,federally defined,to rights created under state law,proceeds in two steps.first,we look initially to state law to determine what rights the judgment debtor has in the property the government seeks to reach.id.quoting drye united states.second,we then look to federal law to determine whether the judgment debtor rights,id.quoting drye,at,constitute a substantial interest in property sufficient to trigger application of the fdcpa.although t he answer to this federal question largely depends upon state law,it is ultimately a question of federal law whether or not the fdcpa applies and authorizes garnishment of the judgment debtor property rights and interests.see id.drawing upon the well known bundle of sticks analogy to describe property rights,s tate law determines only what sticks are in a person bundle federal law then dictates what may be done with that bundle.id.at.
it is important to highlight that the two steps of this analysis,although related,are distinct.in looking to state law,we must be careful to consider the substance of the rights state law provides,not merely the labels the state gives these rights or the conclusions it draws from them.such state law labels are irrelevant to the federal question of which bundles of rights amount to a substantial interest so as to be attachable under the fdcpa.id.at.our initial inquiry in this case is thus whether and to what extent an originator or an intended beneficiary has any interest in or right to a midstream eft under new york law,not whether new york shields any such interest or right from garnishment.if at step one of our analysis we determine that an interest or right exists under state law,and if at step two we determine that interest or right to be a substantial interest in property under the fdcpa,state law would be impotent to shield that interest or right from garnishment under the fdcpa.the fdcpa preempts state law to the extent such law is inconsistent with a provision of this chapter,d,and a state law provision that shields a interest or right from collection would be inconsistent with the fdcpa provisions that authorize garnishment of property in which the defendant has a substantial interest,a 
iii.whether an originator or intended beneficiary has a substantial interest in a midstream eft under the fdcpa 
applying the framework outlined above,we conclude that whatever interest or right an originator or intended beneficiary has in a midstream eft under new york law,if any,it is insufficient to constitute a substantial interest under the fdcpa.

pursuant to article,a receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts,or of any other party to the funds transfer,and the bank owes no duty to any other party to the funds transfer except as provided in this article or by express agreement.an
