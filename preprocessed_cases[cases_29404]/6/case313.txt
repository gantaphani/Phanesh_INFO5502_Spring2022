ginnine fried bought a home in for.it was near high tide in the real estate market,but she had to believe she was getting a bargain,as an appraisal estimated the home value to be.fried borrowed at a fixed interest rate to make her purchase and mortgaged the home as collateral.because the ratio was more than,jpmorgan chase bank,chase,the servicer for fried mortgage that is,the entity who performs the tasks for the loan,including collecting payments,required her to obtain private mortgage insurance.fried had to pay monthly premiums for that insurance until the ratio reached in other words,the principal of the mortgage loan needed to reduce to,which was projected to happen just before march.
we now know that the housing market crashed in,and the value of homes dropped dramatically.fried,like many homeowners,had trouble making mortgage payments.help came when chase modified fried mortgage under a federal aid program by reducing the principal balance to.the rub was that chase extended fried mortgage insurance premiums an extra decade to.whether it could do this depends on how we interpret the homeowners protection act protection act,et.does it permit a servicer to rely on an updated property value,estimated by a broker,to recalculate the length of a homeowner mortgage insurance obligation following a modification or must the ending of that obligation remain tied to the initial purchase price of the home we conclude the protection act requires the latter.
background 
mortgage insurance protects the owner or guarantor of mortgage debt typically the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac from a borrower risk of default.traditional underwriting standards require homebuyers to pay at least of a home purchase price in cash that is,they require the homebuyer to obtain equity in the home at the time of purchase and finance of the home purchase price.if homebuyers can not pay at least,then they must purchase mortgage insurance.once the balance due on a home loan falls below of the home purchase price,mortgage insurance is no longer necessary because excessive mortgage insurance coverage does not benefit the homeowner and provides little extra protection to a lender,at.
before congress took action by passing the protection act in,many lenders would continue to collect mortgage insurance payments after a homeowner had gone below the mark,at.in the act congress set national standards for mortgage insurance termination.it requires mortgage servicers to provide periodic notices to a regarding mortgage insurance obligations,automatically terminate mortgage insurance on a statutorily defined schedule,and grant a borrower request to cancel her mortgage insurance once certain conditions are met.
under the protection act,mortgage servicers must automatically terminate mortgage insurance for a loan like fried on the date on which the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach percent of the original value of the property securing the loan.a.the original value of a home is the lesser of the sales price of the property securing the mortgage,as reflected in the contract,or the appraised value at the time at which the subject residential mortgage transaction was consummated.as noted,the purchase price of fried home was less than its appraised value,so her home original value is.percent of that figure the key value for mortgage insurance termination is.under her loan amortization schedule,fried unpaid principal balance was set to reach just before march,and therefore her mortgage insurance obligation would terminate on that date.
when fried ran into financial trouble following the financial crisis of,she and chase agreed on january,to modify her mortgage under the home affordable mortgage program hamp.the hamp was enacted as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of in response to the financial and housing crisis of that time.see spaulding wells fargo bank,cir.under the hamp,participating mortgage servicers agreed to identify homeowners who were in default or would likely soon be in default on their mortgage payments,and to modify the loans of those eligible under the program.in exchange,servicers would receive a payment for each permanent modification,along with other incentives.id.at quoting wigod wells fargo bank,cir.per the modification agreement she reached with chase,the principal balance of fried loan was reduced to.
the protection act provides for the treatment of mortgage modifications in d 
if a mortgagor and mortgagee or holder of the mortgage agree to a modification of the terms or conditions of a loan pursuant to a residential mortgage transaction,the cancellation date,termination date,or final termination shall be recalculated to reflect the modified terms and conditions of such loan.
accordingly,chase was required to update fried termination date to reflect the modified terms and conditions to which the parties agree pursuant to the loan modified amortization schedule modified,that is,to account for the reduced principal,fried outstanding principal balance would reach of her home original value in july.compl.
after receiving the modification,fried asked chase when she would be relieved of her obligation to make monthly mortgage insurance payments.on august,chase responded that her mortgage insurance obligation would automatically terminate on november.this date was ten years later than her mortgage insurance termination date before the modification and twelve years later than the recalculated date based on her decreased principal balance.her monthly mortgage insurance premium is approximately,so a extension of those premiums would cost her an additional.see compl.
with this in mind,fried wrote chase to question the new termination date and ask how the bank reached its conclusion.it responded on october,and april,stating that november,is when the loan will reach based on the modified terms and conditions.compl.percent of what exactly chase did not say,so fried wrote again.
chase response on october,clarified how it arrived at the termination date.in order to participate in the hamp program,it was required to obtain a broker price opinion bpo estimating the value of fried home at the time of the modification.a bpo is a much less rigorous estimate of a property market value than is an appraisal.see in re thomas,bankr.full appraisals,not just the drive by broker price opinion,are used when the matter is contested.see also in re kasbee,bankr.bank realized that the comparables utilized in the bpo were inadequate and that as a result it was obtaining a full appraisal to determine the true value.
in any event,chase explained that it had substituted its bpo of for the home original value.because the bpo was much smaller,fried would not pay down her outstanding principal balance to of the bpo x until november.
it is worth pausing for a moment to understand the math behind chase purported extension of fried mortgage insurance obligation.remember that the mortgage insurance obligation ends when fried has paid down the principal balance owed on her mortgage to of her home original value.that is,she must pay down her mortgage balance to of,which is.
in this way,the protection act mortgage insurance termination date sets a finish line that homeowners go toward by paying down their mortgage debts.fried started with a mortgage debt of and would reach her finish line once the outstanding principal debt was.put differently,she would cross this threshold after making of payments toward her mortgage principal balance,which,according to her initial amortization schedule,she would do in.when her mortgage was modified,fried leapt forward toward her goal the modification decreased her outstanding principal balance to,so she would reach the finish line sooner,in,by making just in principal payments.but when chase substituted the bpo for the original value of fried home,it moved the finish line.percent of the bpo is.according to her modified amortization schedule,fried would not pay down her mortgage debt to chase new finish line more than in mortgage principal payments away until.
in april,fried filed a complaint on behalf of herself and similarly situated individuals.she asserted that by relying on the bpo to calculate her mortgage insurance termination date,rather than her home original value,chase violated the protection act.chase filed a motion to dismiss,contending that its substitution of the bpo for the original value did not violate the protection act and that fried action was barred by the act statute of limitations 
the district court denied chase motion but certified its appeal to our court,recognizing that whether chase violated the protection act is a controlling question of law with substantial ground for difference of opinion that is likely to advance this case resolution.see b katz carte blanche,cir.en banc.we agreed to hear the appeal.
ii.analysis 
chase contends that it was entitled to recalculate fried termination date by substituting the bpo it obtained at the time of the modification for her home original value.it equivocates on whether it could do this only because of certain hamp rules or whether the protection act would permit the substitution more generally.in either case chase is wrong the protection act required calculation of fried termination date on the basis of her home original value,which under the act is its purchase price.
whether fried knew or should have known of chase violation of the protection act outside of the period is not clear on the face of her complaint,and thus the district court was correct not to dismiss on this ground.
a.the homeowners protection act 
the statute text 
under the protection act a homeowner obligation to pay mortgage insurance premiums ends on the termination date if,on that date,the mortgagor is current on the payments required by the terms of the residential mortgage transaction.b.for a mortgage,like fried,the termination date is 
the date on which the principal balance of the mortgage,based solely on the initial amortization schedule for that mortgage,and irrespective of the outstanding balance for that mortgage on that date,is first scheduled to reach percent of the original value of the property securing the loan.
a.simply put,a homeowner termination date is when she will have paid down her loan principal balance to the point that it equals of her home original value all agree that the original value of fried home in was its purchase price of.
when fried and chase agreed to modify her mortgage in,another provision of the protection act came into play.section d provides that i f a mortgagor and mortgagee agree to a modification of the terms or conditions of a loan,the termination date shall be recalculated to reflect the modified terms and conditions of such loan.the process envisioned by d is that we ask which terms or conditions of fried loan she and chase agreed to modify then we recalculate her termination date to reflect the modified terms and conditions.
recall that to calculate initially the termination date for mortgage insurance payments we must determine when the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach of the original value of the property securing the loan.there is no question that fried agreement with chase modified the outstanding principal balance of her mortgage by reducing it to,so her termination date needed to be recalculated to account for that change.reducing a homeowner principal balance moves her closer to the finish line established by the termination date in fried case,the date at which her outstanding principal balance would reach.according to the modified amortization schedule reflecting the reduced principal balance,the termination date,per d,would be recalculated to occur in.
but chase went one step further.it replaced the original value of fried home with its bpo estimating the home value at the time of the modification.the bpo estimate was substantially less than her home original value.so the substitution had the effect of moving fried finish line further away she was not scheduled to pay down her debt to of the bpo value as noted,until.
according to fried complaint,her written agreement with chase did not explicitly mention or change the original value of her home as defined by compl.chase does not contend otherwise,but instead responds that substitution of the bpo for the home original value was permissible because it was a term or condition of fried modification under d that the hamp rules required.hence we turn to those rules.
the making home affordable program handbook for servicers of mortgages the hamp handbook states that s ervicers must obtain an assessment of the current value of the property securing the mortgage loan being evaluated for hamp.hamp handbook,property valuation,version,available at december.it goes on to specify that s ervicers may use either an automated valuation model avm,a broker price opinion bpo,or an appraisal to measure the property value at the time of modification.id.the handbook,however,says nothing about using the bpo to calculate the period of a homeowner mortgage insurance obligation.hamp rules told chase to get the bpo,but they did not require chase to substitute that value for the original value that the statute,relies on to compute the mortgage insurance termination date.
chase responds that,even if not required by the hamp,use of the bpo for the termination date calculation was a condition of the modification because chase would not have modified the loan without first getting an updated property valuation.this argument suffers from the same logical flaw as chase argument tied more closely to the hamp handbook even if chase obtaining a bpo was a prerequisite to fried mortgage modification,that cursory calculation does not replace under the protection act the original value of fried property for mortgage insurance purposes.
should we interpret conditions expansively to include any necessary precursors to the modification of fried loan we think not,as d relies on changes to the terms and conditions of the loan itself.no matter what led to the modification,the key inquiry is which of the loan terms and conditions were modified,not any conditions precedent.
most significantly,however,the protection act updates the termination date only with respect to the loan provisions that the parties agree to modify if a mortgagor and mortgagee agree to a modification of the terms or conditions of a loan,the termination date for mortgage insurance payments shall be recalculated to reflect the modified terms and conditions of such loan.d.here we come full circle to what did fried and chase actually agree.
the obvious objection is that if courts must look to each modification agreement to determine which terms and conditions the borrower agreed to modify in order to calculate the mortgage insurance obligation,the inquiry will be so individualized and factually intensive as to destabilize the mortgage market.but calculation of an updated termination date always requires reference to the modification agreement.there is no other way to know which terms and conditions of the loan have been modified.at the least,the updated principal balance and interest rate whether fixed or variable will depend on the agreement.moreover,as fried points out,inquiry into the terms of modification agreements likely will be a routine exercise,as servicers like chase use an industry standard form for modifications.see,rice green tree servicing,llc,wl,at,under the servicing guidelines,servicers are directed to use form,a standard form,during the loan modification process.
chase retorts that,regardless what its written agreement with fried might say,its reliance on the bpo was justified because all applicable or relevant laws must be read into the agreement of the parties just as if expressly provided by them,except where contrary intention is evident.williams stone,cir.quoting wright commercial sav.bank.according to chase,fried impliedly agreed to substitute the bpo estimate for her home original value because the hamp handbook provided the background law for the modification agreement.
we disagree,for as already discussed nothing in the hamp requirements even assuming they are applicable or relevant laws required substitution of the bpo for original value.and,in any event,d updates a homeowner termination date to reflect the terms and conditions of her loan she agreed to modify and does not incorporate the provisions of a handbook that guides her servicer.
what is ironic is that chase advocates a,interpretation of the hamp.as the seventh circuit observed,when homeowners have tried to assert rights arising under hamp itself against servicers,c ourts have uniformly rejected these claims because hamp does not create a private federal right of action for borrowers against servicers.wigod,at see also senter jpmorgan chase bank,supp,plaintiffs reliance on the hamp guidelines,rather than a formula contained in their agreements with chase to provide the terms of their permanent modifications,is an improper attempt to assert a private right of action under the hamp.puzz chase home,supp,even assuming that hamp guidelines encourage lenders to provide certain benefits to their debtors,there is no authority for the proposition that hamp or its regulations or guidelines create a private right of action against lenders who begin foreclosure without doing so.coulibaly morgan chase bank,no.dkc,wl,at,plaintiffs may not establish liability by relying on chase alleged violations of certain servicing guidelines promulgated by the department of the treasury in connection with hamp.the proverb what is good for the goose is good for the gander applies the hamp provisions do not bind the parties to a mortgage modification only when they benefit chase.
moreover,courts have held at least twice at chase behest that the hamp rules are not themselves the terms of modification agreements between borrowers and servicers,short chase home fin.llc,no,wl,at,hamp is not a contract between plaintiffs and chase,and did not amend plaintiffs loan documents.wright chase home fin.llc,no,wl,at.june,hamp is not a contract between plaintiff and defendants,did not amend plaintiff loan contracts,and does not contain a private right of action.see also grona citimortgage,wl,at,hamp is not a contract between plaintiff and defendant.hamp did not modify plaintiff loan documents,and hamp does not contain a private right of action.
for these reasons,the protection act text does not support replacement of the original value of fried home with chase bpo.
statutory structure and legislative history 
chase looks to the protection act statutory structure and legislative history to counter the result we reach,but these guides to the act intent only strengthen our conclusion.congress amended in the protection act with respect to loan modifications and refinancing transactions.see private mortgage insurance technical corrections and clarification act the corrections act,stat.amending.the purpose of the corrections act was,among other things,to eliminate uncertainty relating to the cancellation and termination of mortgage insurance for loans whose terms or rates are modified over the life of the loan.cong.rec,may.
with respect to mortgage refinance transactions,which are distinct from mortgage modifications,congress amended the definition of original value such that i n the case of a residential mortgage transaction for refinancing the principal residence of the mortgagor,original value means only the appraised value relied upon by the mortgagee to approve the refinance transaction.thus,when a homeowner refinances her home mortgage loan,the original value of her home will become the appraised value relied on by the mortgagee and,accordingly,her termination date will reflect the new original value.see.
but for mortgage modifications congress did not make any such provision to update a home original value.instead,with respect to modifications like fried,congress added the language discussed above that i f a mortgagor and mortgagee agree to a modification of the terms or conditions of a loan pursuant to a residential mortgage transaction,the termination date shall be recalculated to reflect the modified terms and conditions of such loan.corrections act,pl,stat d.unlike the refinance provision,the language congress chose for mortgage modifications does not change the original value of a home when the modification occurs.only the terms and conditions of the loan modified by the parties agreement are updated,and,for the reasons detailed earlier,replacement of the original value with some other value is not necessarily one of them.
chase contends that congress used different language and different statutory provisions with respect to loan modifications and refinanc ings,but it provided that updated property valuations be used for both modifications and refinancing transactions.chase reply at.of course,when congress uses different language in the same act,we usually presume the opposite that different language points to a different result.ins,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion internal brackets,quotation marks,and citation omitted.
here the distinction congress drew makes sense.when a borrower refinances her mortgage,she pays off her old debt with a new loan,often from a different lender.a refinancing is a new residential mortgage transaction.a transaction in which a mortgage or security interest is created or retained to finance the acquisition,initial construction,or refinancing of that dwelling.the new lender thus should not be bound by the property valuation relied on by the initial lender.
a modification,on the other hand,is merely an alteration or amendment to the existing mortgage contract,see modification,black law dictionary ed,and is not a new residential mortgage transaction,see.while the protection act presumes that a lender will rely on an appraisal before completing a refinancing transaction,see,the hamp handbook makes clear an appraisal is not a prerequisite to a mortgage modification.hamp handbook,at servicers may use either an automated valuation model avm,a broker price opinion bpo,or an appraisal.
chase directs us to several passages of the congressional record to support its contention that d despite its text permits substitution of an updated property value at the time of modification for a home original value not one of the passages it points to actually says that,nor do they overcome d text,structure,or amendment history.
congress reasonably chose to treat mortgage modifications and refinancing transactions differently.its explicit command to update the original value of a home when a mortgage is refinanced is strong evidence that it declined to permit such an update impliedly for mortgage modifications.
fannie mae servicing guidelines 
chase next argues that the fannie mae servicing guidelines support its position.unlike the sources discussed above,they do permit what chase did.however,we decline to follow the servicing guidelines because the protection act explicitly overrides them,and fannie mae interpretation of the protection act is not entitled to deference.
taken together,fannie mae and freddie mac own or guarantee close to half of the home loans in the united states.see town of babylon fed.hous.fin.agency,cir.even for mortgages not owned or guaranteed by them,mortgage lenders and servicers are guided in their decisions by fannie mae and freddie mac requirements.id.internal quotation marks omitted.as is typical in the secondary mortgage market,the agreement between chase and the owners of fried mortgage debt incorporates the fannie mae servicing guidelines 
the guidelines provide that servicers must calculate mortgage insurance termination eligibility by us ing the amortization schedule of the modified mortgage loan and the property value at the time of the mortgage loan modification.fannie mae servicing guide,termination of conventional mortgage insurance.html,emphasis added.the guidelines add that servicers must adhere to applicable state law related to the type of valuation to use to determine the property value at the time of the mortgage loan modification,but that general
