introduction 
plaintiff dmc,dmc filed an action for judicial foreclosure and declaratory relief to determine whether its deed of trust had priority over defendant downey savings and loan association downey deed of trust.after finding that downey deed of trust was senior to dmc lien,the court granted downey motion for summary adjudication and entered judgment accordingly.
on appeal,dmc claims that,because downey failed to present any admissible evidence to establish the character of its lien as a deed of trust,the court erred in making this initial finding.dmc alternatively claims that,because both debts were deeds of trust and because dmc lien was recorded first in time,the trial court erred in making its ultimate finding that downey lien was senior to dmc lien.
even if downey presented inadequate evidence to establish the character of its lien,undisputed facts in the record reveal that the debtor,sharon henry,obtained a mortgage loan from downey to repurchase her home after the original foreclosure proceedings.moreover,assuming that dmc lien reattached after the foreclosure,we conclude that the new lien has priority over any revived junior lien.for these reasons,we reject dmc claims and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
the following facts were undisputed.
sharon henry owned real property located at mountain avenue in norco,california.in october of,henry obtained a loan from accredited home lenders,accredited secured by a deed of trust against the property.accredited deed of trust was recorded on november.accredited later assigned its deed to aames capital corporation aames.
at around the same time,henry acquired a loan,which also was secured by a deed of trust for the same property,from certain designated beneficiaries.this deed of trust was recorded on november.the deed of trust provided that it was subject and junior to the one recorded on november.by the time dmc filed its complaint,the beneficiaries had assigned to dmc all of their rights and interest in the junior deed of trust.
in late november of,henry transferred title to the property to her parents,benjamin and ann finley.in october of,as a result of the owners default on the first mortgage loan,aames initiated foreclosure proceedings.during the proceedings,aames assigned its deed of trust to aspen limb,which completed the foreclosure and eventually acquired title to the property by april of.the foreclosure extinguished dmc lien.
in june of that year,henry obtained a loan secured by a new deed of trust from downey to repurchase the property.downey deed was recorded on june.
on april,dmc filed its first amended complaint for declaratory relief and judicial foreclosure.specifically,in its cause of action for declaratory relief,dmc asked the court to determine whether its second deed of trust attached to the property after the foreclosure and repurchase,and whether its deed of trust was superior to downey deed of trust.
in its motion for summary judgment,downey claimed that,as stated in the twelfth affirmative defense in its answer to dmc complaint,even if dmc deed of trust reattached to the property,it remained junior to downey new deed of trust.the court agreed with downey and granted the motion for summary adjudication as to this affirmative and complete defense.the court subsequently entered judgment in downey favor.
evidentiary objection 
dmc claims that downey submitted inadmissible evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment as to the necessary factual premise that downey deed of trust was a mortgage.even if dmc evidentiary objection had merit,undisputed facts in the record established that henry executed downey promissory note and deed of trust to secure the funds necessary to repurchase the house.
a lien is a deed of trust given to a lender to secure repayment of a loan used to pay all or part of the purchase price of an occupied dwelling for not more than four families the facts and circumstances that exist at the time the debt is created determine the character of the obligation as a mortgage 
based on downey undisputed fact,to which dmc agreed,i n june,henry obtained a loan from downey to purchase the p roperty and the loan was secured by a deed of trust against the p roperty in favor of downey this fact,and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,establishes that henry used the loan amount for the intended transaction,namely,the repurchase of the norco property.any error in the court evidentiary ruling,therefore,was harmless 
nevertheless,in its reply brief,dmc argues that downey failed to provide evidence to prove the other requirements of a purchase money mortgage,including that the loan was given to purchase property containing four or fewer units and that the property would be occupied by the.such facts are easily verifiable.indeed,the documents submitted in support of downey motion for summary judgment included a standard loan agreement for a residence and a deed of trust with a condition requiring the borrower occupancy.moreover,throughout the proceedings below,dmc did not challenge the character of downey deed based on these additional requirements.we therefore reject dmc late efforts to raise a new factual dispute 
in its motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication,downey claimed that,even assuming dmc lien reattached upon henry repurchase of the property,the lien remained junior to downey deed of trust.dmc responded that its lien,which it claims was both first in time and also a deed of trust,was superior to downey lien.at the hearing on downey motion,the trial court found that as a matter of law,a previously wiped out lien reattaches to the property junior to the mortgage,without which the funds to reacquire the property would not exist and,accordingly,the wiped out lien would not reattach.by finding that downey deed had lien priority,the court granted the motion for summary adjudication.
in reviewing the trial court decision to grant summary judgment or summary adjudication,we exercise our independent judgment to determine whether downey has established undisputed facts to state a complete defense thereby justifying the court award of judgment as a matter of law 
the issue in this case,assuming that the original owner repurchase of the property after a nonjudicial foreclosure revives the junior lien,is whether the new deed of trust has lien priority over the revived junior lien.this court and the parties have not found any california cases addressing this specific issue.nevertheless,we begin our analysis with rules governing lien priority.
in california,lien priority is determined by the first in time,first in right approach in regards to real property,liens that are recorded first have priority over any liens the explicit caveat in applying the first in time,first in right rule,however,is that all other things must be equal 
different types of liens are not on equal footing a mortgage,for example,has priority over all other liens on real property civil code section,subdivision a provides a mortgage or deed of trust given for the price of real property,at the time of its conveyance,has priority over all other liens created against the purchaser,subject to the operation of the recording laws.the character of the obligation as a debt,once determined by the facts that exist at the time of its creation,retains that character after subsequent transactions t he purchase money character of an obligation is not changed simply because new notes on substantially similar terms have been exchanged for old notes 
in this case,application of these general rules does not resolve the question of lien priority.dmc claims that,even after its lien was extinguished by the foreclosure and then revived by the original owner repurchase of the property,its deed was superior to downey deed.dmc fails to cite any authority to support this specific claim.however,cases from other states,as consistent with other principles governing lien priority in this state,suggest a different result.
one such case is a opinion from a new york lower court.in duer jaeger albert firth realty company company owned a plot of land consisting of
