michael appeals from his conviction on one count under,the bank fraud act.we affirm.
was indicted under the bank fraud act the act on june.the act provides 
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice 
to defraud a financial institution or 
to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises 
shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the indictment alleged that violated subsections and of the act.specifically,the indictment alleged that he knowingly executed and attempted to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud countrywide bank,fsb,a financial institution,and to obtain money and other property owned by and under the custody and control of countrywide bank,fsb,by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,representations,and promises,concerning material facts and matters in conjunction with a mortgage loan in the amount of for property located at harbor street,salem,massachusetts.
following indictment,waived his right to a jury trial and opted for a bench trial.he also entered into a stipulation.the stipulation set forth the following facts concerning the scheme alleged in the indictment.
while serving as a loan originator operating through his loan originator business,amex home mortgage corporation,completed loan applications and submitted them to mortgage companies on behalf of individuals seeking to purchase or refinance property.in,sought to defraud mortgage lenders in connection with the refinancing of the property in salem,massachusetts referenced in the indictment.
the scheme began with efforts to obtain a mortgage loan on a different property,which was owned by a woman named.in connection with that transaction,submitted a mortgage loan application containing false information about to homecomings financial network.also paid,from a bank account controlled by amex,approximately that was supposed to put down herself to secure the loan for that property.
after was successful in securing the mortgage loan in name,then sought to secure a second mortgage loan in name,this time for the salem,massachusetts property named in the indictment.sought this loan in order to obtain the that he had put down to secure the first loan in name.
submitted the application for this second loan to a different entity from the one to which he had submitted the application for the first loan.the stipulation referred to the entity to which submitted the second loan application as follows countrywide,where countrywide home loans employees underwrote and processed the application.
this second loan application contained many of the same false statements that were in application for the first loan in name.also provided fraudulent responses to various inquiries in the course of seeking this second loan.when this second loan closed,pocketed most of the proceeds.
the key issue at trial concerned whether fraudulent scheme to secure the second loan targeted countrywide bank,fsb,as the indictment alleged,or only countrywide home loans,as contended.the identification of the intended target was crucial because stipulated that countrywide bank,fsb was a financial institution within the meaning of the act,while the government did not dispute that countrywide home loans was not.
in ruling from the bench at the close of evidence,the district court explained that it had determined that the record showed that was on notice that countrywide bank,fsb was part of this transaction in some form in the second loan transaction.with that finding in place,the district court then found that was guilty of attempt ing to execute though not of actually executing a scheme or artifice described in subsections and both because had intended to defraud countrywide bank,fsb and because he had intended to obtain money and property that was under countrywide bank,fsb custody and control.this appeal followed.
we review a bench trial conviction de novo,examining the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states ngige,cir.citing united states tum,cir.the ultimate question is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states grace,cir.quoting united states casas,cir.t his court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached,but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.united states hatch,cir.
we start with the supreme court most recent case construing the act,loughrin united states.loughrin makes clear that subsections and of the act set out two routes to proving criminal liability under the statute.see id.at.loughrin also makes clear that proof that the defendant violated either subsection is sufficient to support a conviction under the act.id.because we conclude that the evidence in this case was sufficient to prove a violation under subsection,we confine our analysis to what the evidence shows regarding that portion of the act see united states gaw,cir.w e must affirm each count if the evidence is sufficient for the jury to have convicted the defendant under any one of the relevant theories of liability presented to the jury as to that count.
under subsection,a defendant who knowingly executes or attempts to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution violates the act contends that because the district court found him guilty under subsection only of attempt ing to defraud a financial institution rather than of actually knowingly execut ing such a scheme,the government was required to show that specifically intended to defraud countrywide bank,fsb and that he took a substantial step towards doing so.the government does not appear to disagree.the government instead simply contends that the evidence sufficed to show that did specifically intend just that.
contrary argument proceeds in the following steps.he first argues that,under the attempt prong of subsection,the government had to prove that he specifically intended to defraud a financial institution.he thus contends that the government had to prove that he specifically intended to defraud countrywide bank,fsb,and not simply countrywide home loans.after all,the parties agree that only countrywide bank,fsb is a financial institution under the act.for that reason,an attempt to defraud countrywide home loans would not be an attempt to defraud a financial institution and thus would not be a crime under subsection.
then contends that the evidence shows that,at most,countrywide bank,fsb may have been involved in some way in the transaction.as a result,contends,he can not have been found guilty under subsection,because the evidence in the record that supports a finding that knew that countrywide bank,fsb was involved in some way is insufficient to show that he specifically intended to defraud countrywide bank,fsb 
to support this argument about the insufficiency of the evidence,contends that the record reveals what he characterizes as only a perfunctory reference to countrywide bank,fsb in the papers that he received in connection with his application for,and the approval of,the second loan transaction.he also notes that most of the loan documents that he saw referenced countrywide home loans and not countrywide bank,fsb.further,he points out that the documents that he did see and that referred to countrywide bank,fsb,also contained references to countrywide home loans.thus,he contends that,although the evidence shows that he may have specifically intended to defraud countrywide home loans,the evidence that he knew of countrywide bank,fsb involvement in the transaction is simply too slight to show that he specifically intended to defraud countrywide bank,fsb.
the first of the documents that received that referred to countrywide bank,fsb,however,was not just any document.it was the loan conditions sheet,which contained the loan terms and the conditions for its approval.and that document did not just contain any
