first union mortgage corporation appeals the district court grant of class certification to a class of plaintiffs seeking damages for first union alleged violation of section of the real estate settlement procedures act respa.see,et.we accepted jurisdiction over this appeal.see.f.we review a district court certification of a class for abuse of discretion.see sikes teleline,cir.for a district court to apply the wrong legal standard is an abuse of discretion.see id.we vacate the grant of class certification.
background 
this case is one of several dealing with respa effect on the legality of the payment of yield spread premiums ysp by mortgage lenders to mortgage brokers.for a detailed discussion of ysp and their role in the real estate mortgage market,see culpepper inland mortgage,cir culpepper i and culpepper irwin mortgage,cir culpepper iii a ysp is a payment made by a lender to a broker in exchange for that broker delivering a mortgage that is above the par rate being offered by the lender.briefly stated,the payment is typically a certain percentage of the total amount of the loan the exact percentage is determined by the extent to which the actual interest rate exceeds the par rate.these ysp potentially violate section a of respa,which prohibits the payment of kickback fees and referrals in association with mortgage lending.
in culpepper the same day as this concluded that class certification in a case alleging a violation of respa was appropriate where the payment of a ysp was based solely upon the amount by which the loan rate exceeded the par rate and where the payment of the ysp was not tied to specific services provided by the broker.because whether this standard was satisfied could be determined on a basis,we concluded that the district court in culpepper iii did not err by granting class certification.see culpepper iii,at.
shortly after our culpepper iii ruling,the department of housing and urban development issued a statement of policy the sop purportedly clarifying a statement of policy issued in the sop our ruling in culpepper iii had relied heavily on the sop.according to first union,the sop is at odds with the outcome of culpepper iii and compels a different result in this case.
discussion 
before we address the substance of the sop,we must determine its applicability to this case.although the sop raises some concerns about the retroactive application of agency interpretations,about the deference given to policy statements,and about the ability of an agency interpretation to overrule prior circuit precedent,we ultimately conclude that nothing prevents the application of the sop to this case.
retroactive application of the sop 
the sop was promulgated after the transactions that gave rise to this litigation and after the district court ruling on the issue of class certification.but because we accept that both the sop and the statement it interprets,the sop,are clarifications of existing law and not new rules or regulations,no problem with the retroactive application of the statements exists.see piamba cortes american airlines,cir c oncerns about retroactive application are not implicated when an amendment that takes effect after the initiation of a lawsuit is deemed to clarify relevant law rather than effect a substantive change in the law pope shalala,cir,overruled on other grounds,johnson apfel,cir a rule simply clarifying an unsettled or confusing area of the law does not change the law,but restates what the law according to the agency is and has always been it is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determination construing and applying a statute to a case in hand.quoting manhattan general equip.commissioner.see also farmers telephone fcc,cir orr hawk,cir cowen bank united of texas,cir.
while not dispositive,an agency determination that a new statement is a clarification of existing law,rather than an entirely new rule,is generally given much weight.see pope,at.we will defer to an agency statement that a new rule is a clarification of the law,instead of a new rule altogether,unless the prior interpretation is patently inconsistent with the later one.id.another significant indicator that a statement only clarifies existing law is when the law supposedly being clarified is ambiguous.see piamba cortes,at.
we accept that the sop created no new rule,but instead only clarified the interpretation of respa found in the sop.the sop itself states that it is merely clarifying the sop and nowhere in the sop does hud claim to be changing the law.and,we do not consider the sop to be patently inconsistent with respa or with the sop.in culpepper iii we wrote that the sop was ambiguous and subject to different interpretations.culpepper iii,at.based upon these considerations,we conclude that the sop is a clarification of existing law and that no retroactivity problems prevent its application to this case.
ii.chevron deference 
an additional preliminary question is what deference,if any,should be given to the sop.
no deference is to be given to an agency interpretation that is at odds with the plain meaning of the statute being interpreted.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.but respa does not,by its plain language,speak to the standard for determining whether the payment of a ysp violates the act.section a of respa simply prohibits kickbacks and referral fees,see section c allows payment for services actually performed in the making of a loan.the question of how to determine when a ysp is an illegal kickback and when it is a legally permissible payment for services actually performed is not specifically addressed in respa.our ruling in culpepper iii did not purport to rely squarely upon the plain language of section of respa,but rather upon an interpretation of respa language and of the ambiguous sop.see culpepper iii,at.the plain language of respa does not prevent us from giving deference to the sop 
a question also exists about whether the sop is the kind of agency statement to which the courts should give broad deference.in united states mead,d,the supreme court wrote that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.id.at.respa contains an express delegation of congressional authority the statute authorizes the secretary of hud to prescribe such rules and regulations,to make such interpretations,and to grant such reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions,as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.a emphasis added.hud regulations identify a statement of policy as a document that embodies such a rule,regulation,or interpretation under respa delegation of authority.see a ii 
because the power to issue interpretations is expressly delegated in respa,the sop carries the full force of law.as a result,we give deference to the sop.the precedents are not to the contrary.in mead and christensen harris county,d,the supreme court concluded that certain kinds of agency pronouncements were not due broad chevron deference.see united states mead.at concluding that customs service ruling letter was not entitled to chevron deference christensen.at concluding that department of labor opinion letter was not entitled to chevron deference.but,neither of the agency interpretations at issue in mead and christensen involved an agency acting pursuant to a statutory delegation of interpretive power.in this case,on the other hand,a congressional delegation of authority giving hud statement of policy the force of law does exist.and,the interpretation we are promulgated pursuant to that delegation of authority.
given the express delegation of authority in respa,formal is not needed to extend deference to the sop.see barnhart walton,d stating that chevron deference can still apply even in the absence of a notice and comment period mead.at t he want of notice and comment here does not decide the case,for we have sometimes found reasons for che
