this intervention action arises out of a former relationship concerning real property that was damaged by the san diego county wildfires of.the main action is a master complaint by damaged property owners,including a defaulting borrower,plaintiff,and appellant paul thoryk appellant,who owned the property at the time of the fires.a year later,and respondent highland valley investors,llc highland nonjudicially foreclosed under the junior trust deed it held and took the real property security,subject to a senior lien held by a party that is no longer involved in this action 
in the main action,appellant sued the wildfire defendants,san diego gas electric company cox,and sempra energy the third party tortfeasors,for damages for inverse condemnation,negligence,trespass,nuisance,and violation of the public utilities code.highland also filed its complaint in intervention against those same.cornelison kornbluth cal d,fn,fn.cornelison actions by mortgagees against nonpossessing third parties for tortious impairment of security are not affected by the antideficiency legislation.also,highland sued appellant,seeking declaratory relief that it is entitled to a judicially imposed lien under the terms of its deed of trust and related note,under the doctrine of equitable conversion,upon any recovery that appellant might eventually obtain from the third party tortfeasors.
to evaluate the granting of declaratory relief in favor of highland,we must interpret the antideficiency body of law in terms of any applicability of exceptions to antideficiency protections and the one action rule.code civ,all further statutory references are to this code unless noted.specifically,appellant argues the trial court erred in determining that there was no bar in the antideficiency statutes for highland presently to obtain a lien on appellant future property damage recovery under the master complaint,for any damage inflicted on his real property in the nature of inverse condemnation.in its ruling,the trial court set the amount secured by highland lien at the unpaid principal amount of appellant mortgage debt,along with postforeclosure interest and prejudgment interest,plus attorney fees and costs pursuant to the terms of the note.
case law establishes various exceptions to statutory antideficiency protections for a borrower,such as the mixed collateral rule.where there are liens established upon both personal and real property in the subject transaction,a foreclosing lienholder using the power of sale may continue to pursue remedies against the former property.hatch security first national bank cal d,hatch no violation of section where creditor does not seek a personal judgment for the unpaid balance of a loan,but instead seeks to enforce additional security secondarily liable for the principal loan,such as selling a pledge or other trust deeds given as additional security for the otherwise secured loan mortgage guarantee sampsell d,sampsell sale of real property under the power of sale in the deed of trust does not wipe out the indebtedness and the creditor may proceed against any other security see miller starr,cal.real estate ed,to miller starr.
highland claims the trial court correctly recognized that the debt represented by appellant default on the promissory note,which was secured by the nonjudicially foreclosed trust deed,survived the foreclosure,and that security other than the lost land was expressly or impliedly created in the trust deed and may be pursued,money related to the real property or substitutes for the land,such as inverse condemnation awards.see los angeles trust savings bank bortenstein,bortenstein a mortgagee had the right in a judicial foreclosure action,over objections of the mortgagor,to obtain a lien for an amount representing its security interest,upon an award of eminent domain damages that the mortgagor had recovered from a municipality in another action,for partial destruction of the mortgaged property equity required allocation and no impermissible deficiency judgment resulted.the trial court imposed a lien against appellant future recovery against the third party tortfeasors,to permit highland to recover the interest and attorney fees that were provided for in the promissory note,as well as obtaining the unpaid balance on the note.
we agree with appellant that highland,the junior lienholder foreclosing under power of sale,has failed to show the applicable exceptions cover its situation,either under the terms of the note or through the equitable conversion doctrine,to allow it to obtain a lien against appellant.the lien ruling on the deed of trust was the functional equivalent of a deficiency money judgment.it does not properly account for any ultimate allocation that may become necessary of any recovery from the third party tortfeasors,for property damage for the respective ownership periods,or for highland impairment of security.see birman loeb th,birman.we reverse the declaratory relief judgment in favor of highland,with directions to enter a different judgment denying the lien application.
factual and procedural background 
property and junior lien litigation 
from to,appellant owned a large parcel of real property that was planted with avocado and other trees,and he built infrastructure improvements toward the development of multiple homesites.the seller,pfi,held a first trust deed on the property,securing its loan 
in,highland loaned appellant million in return for his promissory note,taking a second trust deed on the property as security.
appellant pursued development efforts until october,when the property was extensively damaged by wildfire.he subsequently defaulted on highland loan.
in july,highland foreclosed on its second trust deed under its power of sale,on a partial credit bid of million,and held the property until.appellant remaining indebtedness on the note was,including preforeclosure interest and attorney fees.
in,appellant sued the third party tortfeasors for damages on theories including inverse condemnation and negligence,pursuant to a second amended master complaint.appellant alleged the fires had damaged and destroyed the real property,trees,improvements and personal property,during his ownership.
highland complaint in intervention is modeled on the master complaint against the third party tortfeasors,and alleges that it had acquired an interest in the subject property through nonjudicial foreclosure.additionally,against appellant,highland added a cause of action for declaratory relief that sought to impose a lien on any eventual recovery appellant might obtain against the third party tortfeasors,for physical damage to the property.highland asserted that appellant note and debt survived the nonjudicial foreclosures and it was entitled to recover damages or a lien up to the remaining indebtedness on the note,plus attorney fees and postforeclosure prejudgment interest.
status of senior trust deed prior opinion 
in june,highland defaulted on the loan secured by the first trust deed,and the senior lender,pfi,nonjudicially foreclosed and recovered the property by making a full credit bid of at the trustee sale 
pfi also sued the third party tortfeasors in the master litigation,but its complaint in intervention was dismissed after a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,based upon lack of standing to seek further damages,in light of its possession of the real property.we upheld that ruling in our prior opinion issued in the same trial court case.in our analysis,we noted that appellant owned the real property at the time of the fires.it was then that his cause of action against defendants accrued.pfi acquired title to the property after it had been damaged by the fires.the transfer of title did not include a transfer of thoryk cause of action as the property owner.that cause of action remained with thoryk as his personal property.vaughn dame construction d.pfi status as the current owner of the property does not give it standing to sue for damage to the property.
with respect to the status of appellant debt to the first lender,pfi,we stated in our prior opinion that its acquisition of the property by full credit bid extinguished thoryk debt,and thus extinguished pfi security.citation.furthermore,no exception to the full credit bid rule applied.citations.pfi lacks standing as the holder of a security interest in the property.the court properly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
declaratory relief trial appellate briefing on effect of ongoing master complaint action 
in the coordinated wildfire litigation,the trial court bifurcated for trial highland declaratory relief claim against appellant.at a court trial,offers of proof of the trust deed and the note were submitted.highland contended that the note was secured not only by the real property security,but also by mixed collateral and additional security,within the definitions set forth in the trust deed.thus,appellant had granted highland a security interest in the real property by parcel number,including all money held on deposit related to the real property,and all other rights,royalties and profits relating to it.
highland also relied on the form deed definitions of property,as including both real property and personal property.generally,personal property includes money related to the real property,as well as all substitutions or replacements for such property.also,the trust deed grants the lender a security interest in the property under the commercial code,to the extent any of the property constitutes fixtures or other personal property.
the matter was argued and submitted,and the trial court granted highland request for a declaration that it was entitled to a lien,both under the deed of trust and pursuant to the equitable conversion theory.bortenstein,supra.this appeal followed.
in their briefs,the parties discuss how the remaining master complaint litigation will potentially allocate any recovery against the third party tortfeasors for property damage,in terms of measures of damages.appellant brief states on this topic,t he measure of the property values immediately before and after the wildfires will ultimately be the subject of dispute at trial with the defendants.if the property retained sufficient value after the wildfires to satisfy both liens against it,then highland valley security interest was not impaired at all.
highland takes several different positions on this topic,mainly arguing that appellant rights to recover fall within the category of personal property security created by the trust deed and note.highland alternatively argues that all of appellant rights to recover for injury to the real property under tort and inverse condemnation theories,against the third party tortfeasors,were already foreclosed upon under the power of sale and are thus owned by highland.it states,while it may be true that amounts recovered by highland from third party tortfeasors will become credits against the amount of the lien,that issue was not and is not before the court,as there is no evidence of any such recovery,nor has there been one as of the date of this writing.appellant does not purport to address the question of the amount secured by the lien after a partial credit bid at foreclosure,the accrual of interest on the amount remaining unpaid,or the effect of foreclosure on a portion of the collateral on the ability to enforce the lien on the remainder.
those particular disputes need not now be resolved.at this time,only the declaratory relief issued concerning highland lien against any future recovery by appellant is before this court.
discussion 
generally,the parties agree that the historical facts are undisputed and that on appeal,the trial court resolution of the legal issues presented by the documents in the record and application of statutes is subject to de novo review.dreyfuss union bank of california cal th,dreyfuss trujillo north county transit district th.
we interpret the trust deed,an executed contract,under the rules of interpretation applicable to contracts in general.the prime rule for interpreting deeds is to determine the objective and not the subjective intent of the parties by an examination of the deed since the language of each instrument is sui generis,no rules of construction exist for determining the parties actual intent,which is the ultimate interpretive touchstone.accordingly,despite the technical rules of construction,the court must review the entire instrument to ascertain the actual intent of the parties so far as can be determined.miller starr,supra,to,fns.omitted parsons bristol development cal d,city of manhattan beach superior court cal th.
deficiency judgment doctrinea.nonjudicial foreclosure statutory scheme 
in pertinent part,section provides no judgment shall be rendered for any deficiency upon a note secured by a deed of trust or mortgage upon real property or an estate for years therein hereafter executed in any case in which the real property or estate for years therein has been sold by the mortgagee or trustee under power of sale contained in the mortgage or deed of trust.
a deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against a debtor for a recovery of the secured debt measured by the difference between the debt and the net proceeds received from the foreclosure sale.dreyfuss,supra,cal th at,citing,hatch,supra,cal d,defining a deficiency judgment as a personal judgment for the unpaid balance due upon an obligation after unsuccessful resort to the security.under the one form of action rule,section,subdivision a,a secured creditor is generally required to pursue its security,not the underlying obligation.cadlerock joint venture,lobel th,cadlerock.
the antideficiency statutes are to be construed liberally to effectuate the legislative purposes underlying them,including the policies to prevent a multiplicity of actions,to prevent an overvaluation of the security,to prevent the aggravation of an economic recession which would result if debtors lost their property and were also burdened with personal liability,and to prevent the creditor from making an unreasonably low bid at the foreclosure sale,acquire the asset below its value,and also recover a personal judgment against the debtor.cadlerock,supra,th at.s ection should be interpreted to avoid the thwarting of its purposes by a subterfuge cadlerock,supra,at,quoting freedland greco cal d.
there is a relationship between the security first aspect of the rule and the prohibition against a deficiency judgment after a nonjudicial foreclosure sale,and the issues often arise in the same case.the aspect of the rule requires that all of the security be exhausted prior to the recovery of personal liability against the trustor.when the beneficiary forecloses a deed of trust by the private power of sale,there is a prohibition against the recovery of a personal judgment against the trustor.however,in both instances,the beneficiary is entitled to pursue all of the security for the debt and,after a nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust,the beneficiary may also foreclose any other security for the same debt.the same rule applies under the antideficiency limitations that allow the beneficiary to foreclose liens on other assets that are security for the debt after a nonjudicial foreclosure on one of the assets.miller starr,supra,to fns.omitted,italics added.
exceptions to prohibition on deficiency judgments 
in the underlying master complaint proceedings,highland complaint in intervention is an appropriate means to pursue its own remedies against the third party tortfeasors,and those fall outside the scope of antideficiency law.cornelison,supra,cal d,fn.romo stewart title of california th,romo lender claims for fraud or negligence damages against a third party tortfeasor escrow agent,arising during real estate transactions,were unrelated to any claims of impairment of real property security for the loan.as against the third party tortfeasors,highland seeks recovery of inverse condemnation damages on its own behalf from the time that the fires occurred.it additionally seeks damages from them for the impairment of its security interest,measured by the unpaid indebtedness together with interest accrued after the foreclosure date july,plus attorney fees.
as to section,its text does not explicitly contemplate the existence of multiple liens on a single real property or the possibility of a junior lienor.cadlerock,supra,th.the current set of facts involves multiple liens on a single real property,held by different lenders.these facts do not involve the usual definition of a junior lien,where the junior lender security has been rendered valueless by a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the property under a senior encumbrance,and the junior lender is not prohibited from obtaining a deficiency judgment.roseleaf chierighino cal d.the reason is that the security has been lost by the foreclosure sale of the senior lien,and thus the junior lienor can sue the debtor directly on the promissory note,which is then considered unsecured.miller starr,supra,to italics added.
here,highland foreclosed on its junior lien under the power of sale and obtained its security,but only held it for a limited time period.normally,where a junior lienholder has made an election to proceed against the real property securing the debt under the power of sale,section precludes a deficiency judgment.in re marriage of oropallo th,the senior lienholder had taken part of the junior security,and the junior nonjudicially foreclosed on the remainder,and thus could not also attempt to collect a deficiency judgment.in freedland greco,supra,cal d,the court ruled that a judicial action on a separate note based on the same debt,following nonjudicial foreclosure on real property security for the debt,was barred by antideficiency legislation.
through the lien,highland effectively seeks to appropriate to itself appellant future recovery for tortious conduct of others,if he obtains any on his own behalf.appellant claims this declaration that highland is entitled to such recovery against him improperly exceeded the extent to which its own security interest was impaired,for the to lending period.it thus appears that the master complaint proceedings will involve some resolution of the respective rights of the parties to keep any recovery they may obtain from the third party tortfeasors,under some kind of allocation for the different periods of ownership of the property,subject to the periods in which highland still held a security interest.
for now,we are required to consider only appellant claims that this lien on any recovery he may receive for property damage or inverse condemnation damages,or to secure an ongoing obligation for interest and attorney fees,is not supported by any separate collateral identified in an ongoing relationship with highland.
additional security theorya.issues presented 
where,as here,the creditor sues a third party tortfeasor for impairment of security,that claim is based on a cause of action separate and apart from any attempt to recover on the note or the debt.birman,supra,th.
as against appellant,highland seeks to avoid the operation of the antideficiency law,by showing that the language of the trust deed and note created additional collateral,beyond the real property security that it took under power of sale.its lien theory against appellant requires highland to justify its argument that deficiency principles and the one action rule of section allow seriatim foreclosure of mixed collateral in this case,subd.a a walker community bank cal d,see pt.iii,post,for discussion of highland alternative claim that any potential eminent domain recovery by appellant amounts to a substitute for the real property itself,under the equitable conversion doctrine bortenstein,supra.at.
where additional collateral was created for an obligation,a relationship may survive a nonjudicial foreclosure,if the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to pay the debt.see redingler imperial savings loan d,redingler creditor could collect on insurance policy named as additional security for mortgage,up to the amount of the indebtedness remaining after the foreclosure sale.in sampsell,supra,d,the foreclosing creditor could collect on the debtor assignment of rental income,because the sale of the real property under the deed of trust does not wipe out the indebtedness nor prevent the creditor from proceeding to recover upon any other security.ibid.
highland likewise claims that antideficiency law does not prohibit this lien,because these loan documents created additional,unrealized personal property collateral that remained after the nonjudicial foreclosure,to be applied to the unpaid loan balance.commercial code section allows a lender to proceed in any sequence to realize on the security,including foreclosing on the real property first and the personal property thereafter.highland argues that since appellant indebtedness was not fully paid by the proceeds of the foreclosure,the debt continued to exist and should bear interest according to its terms,and the attorney fees provisions of the note and deed would also survive,postforeclosure.
terms of trust deed and note security 
the trust deed appears to be a standard form document,referring,for example,to keeping the property in tenantable condition,although this was basically raw land with some infrastructure improvements.the conveyance and grant in this deed of trust,with a power of sale,identifies the real property it secures by assessor parcel numbers,further defining the real property as including all fixtures,easements,water rights,plans or engineering reports,permits,entitlements,and all money held on deposit for any of the foregoing or otherwise related to the real property and all other rights,royalties,and profits relating to the real property,including without limitation all minerals 
next,the trust deed entitles the beneficiary to require that all or any part of an inverse condemnation award be applied to the unpaid indebtedness.see pt.iii,post such contract rights are limited by statute,subd.a.
the trust deed property definitions include both real and personal property.personal property includes money related to the real property,or money held on deposit.personal property also includes all substitutions for,any of such property and together with all proceeds including without limitation all insurance proceeds and refunds of premiums from any sale or other disposition of the property.no issues are raised about insurance proceeds here.
the trust deed provides that it shall constitute a security agreement to the extent any of the property constitutes fixtures or other personal property,and lender shall have all of the rights of a secured party under the uniform commercial code as amended from time to time.with regard to the personal property,such as fixtures,the lender is given all the rights of a secured party,including without limitation the right to recover any deficiency in the manner and to the full extent provided by california law.
terms of trust and note attorney fees and interest provisions 
the terms of the promissory note acknowledge that it is secured by the second trust deed,in addition to any other collateral.it states that any unpaid balance bears interest at the nondefault rate of percent per annum,and upon default at the rate of percent per annum.
the note and trust deed each contain an attorney fees clause for fees incurred in enforcing the terms of the note trust deed.also,the terms of the trust deed allow to lender all reasonable expenses lender incurs that in lender opinion are necessary at any time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights,as part of the indebtedness.
mixed,additional or substitute collateral cases 
here,as in birman,supra,th,the nonjudicial foreclosure,at which highland acquired the property for less than the full amount of the outstanding indebtedness,did not extinguish all of the debt on the note.id.at cornelison,supra,cal d at.the question is what further recourse highland should have,that does not contravene the purpose of the antideficiency statutes.
in other situations,creditors have been allowed additional recovery against a debtor following foreclosure under a power of sale,because the particular claims did not conflict with the policy behind the antideficiency laws.birman,supra,th.thus,t he courts have repeatedly held that resort to additional security following a nonjudicial foreclosure is not an attempt to secure a deficiency judgment.ibid.
these cases that allow a nonjudicially foreclosing lender to resort to additional security involve certain types of valuable property that were mentioned or incorporated into the mortgage documents.in dreyfuss,supra,cal th,serial enforcement of security was allowed,through separate nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings,because the borrowers had separately granted security interests in several different parcels of real property.in redingler,supra,d at pages to,the borrower had specifically agreed to allow insurance policy proceeds to be paid to the lender.in sampsell,supra,d,the borrower had assigned certain rental income to the lender,which could be reached despite a nonjudicial foreclosure.
with regard to the attorney fees now being sought,the court in passanisi merit mcbride realtors,d,passanisi,held the purposes of section do not prevent a from recovering attorney fees and costs it had expended to defend a separate action brought by the to restrain foreclosure of the security under the power of sale.in that situation,even though the security property was later sold at a trustee sale,the judgment for attorney fees and costs was separate and enforceable.in passanisi,when the creditor foreclosed,there was a surplus of funds,so the creditor bid exceeded the debt.id.at.there were mutual debts,allowing offsets.the creditor owed the debtors the surplus from the foreclosure sale.the debtors were liable to the creditor on the judgment for attorney fees and costs.birman,supra,th.
in passanisi,the court observed,section does not by its express terms apply in such a case,nor does the policy behind section dictate such a result.enforcement of the judgment for attorney fees and costs is not simply a subterfuge for the collection of a deficiency on the secured note.the award for attorney fees and costs is neither measured by,nor interrelated to,a deficiency on the note.passanisi,supra,d.the reasoning of such cases examines whether any enforceable mutual obligations existed between the parties,after the remedy of nonjudicial foreclosure on a trust deed is elected.
from a plain reading of the trust deed,we think that the general references to personal property,money held on deposit related to the real property,or rights relating to the real property,are too general to amount to sufficiently specific designations of existing additional security.the personal property rights relating to the property are not sufficiently described as separate and distinct,to have survived the nonjudicial foreclosure or to have created remaining mixed or additional collateral,to support a lien that effectively creates a money judgment.the items listed in the deed as amounting to other rights relating to the real property,such as mineral rights,do not include future tort recovery by appellant,under a reasonable reading of the trust deed.
rather,highland foreclosure on the junior deed of trust under its power of sale merged and extinguished highland security rights in the real property,and the personal property security interests identified in the trust deed were likewise extinguished.next,its junior mortgage lien was discharged when the nonjudicial foreclosure of the senior deed of trust occurred.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.security transactions in real property.the relationship was not preserved,and thus highland claim for attorney fees and interest,based on the note,is not now enforceable,without a stronger showing of the availability of additional or mixed collateral,beyond the real property security.see rosenbaum funcannon cir,even where a trust deed is extinguished through sale of the property,the debt itself may not be extinguished but may be unenforceable.highland has not shown current entitlement to any continuing interest and attorney fees that would be recoverable and consistent with antideficiency protections.
the general rule is that a lien may be created in a mortgage on property not yet acquired,and the lien will attach at the time it is acquired.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,security transactions in real property,subd.a.however,the mortgage must contain an express provision to that effect.hosford henry d,duarte lake gregory land water d,holding that even though the lender had been assigned any award of damages for injury to property,the lender full credit bid in exercise of its power of sale served to extinguish the mortgage and security interest,including the assignment clause,and no additional security rights remained.
there is no express language in this trust deed that assigns any tort claims for injury to the real property as additional security for the mortgage debt,as falling within the category of all other rights,royalties and profits relating to the real property when the loan was made in,the wildfires had not occurred,to give rise to appellant cause of action against the third party tortfeasors.that cause of action for tort damages accrued when the fires occurred and was his personal property that would be assignable as a chose in action.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts,see vaughn dame construction,supra,d,keru investments,cube th.a transfer of title,through nonjudicial foreclosure,would not ordinarily include a transfer of a right of action as a property owner,which is viewed as personal property.no such assignment was made clear here.
under commercial code section,appellant claim against the third party tortfeasors amounts to a commercial tort claim it arose in the course of his business and did not include personal injury damages,subd,subd.e.as an property asset,this tort claim does not constitute a security interest,without more specific assigning language.we can not see how appellant chose in action against the third party tortfeasors was expressly or impliedly included in the personal property defined by the trust deed,as money related to the real property.
in conclusion,the lien imposed was impermissibly measured by,and interrelated to,the remaining deficiency on the note,but these loan documents did not create additional available security for the same obligation.passanisi,supra,d.this plain reading of the loan documents leaves some additional questions remaining about the equitable conversion doctrine based on the inverse condemnation claims being asserted,respectively,by highland and appellant.
equitable conversiona.law 
equitable conversion theory will permit a lender to recover from the borrower tort damages fund,to the amount that its security was damaged.american savings loan association leeds,supra,cal d,fn.the theory is that condemnation of an entire mortgaged property in effect substitutes a money award for the security of the land mortgaged,and the mortgagee is ordinarily entitled to as much of the award as is necessary to satisfy the debt.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,security transactions in real property.this rule presupposes that the lender still has a security interest in the real property,based on a debt,when entitlement to the money award arises and is made.see miller starr,supra,on condemnation of property that is security for a debt,the lender loses its lien on the real property,but the condemnation award is substituted for the property and the lender obtains a lien on the condemnation proceeds,fn.omitted.
in bortenstein,supra.at pages to,the court stated,it is a rule of equity,based upon the doctrine of equitable conversion,that when land is taken for public use,the money awarded for such land remains,and is to be considered,as land in respect to all rights and interests relating thereto.the money,in such cases,is deemed to represent the land,and is applied in equity to discharge the liens upon it,precisely in accordance with the legal or equitable rights of creditors or encumbrancers in respect to such land.
in bortenstein,the mortgagee was permitted in a judicial foreclosure action to impress with his mortgage lien a fund that has taken the place of so much of the mortgaged realty as was destroyed by the flood.the foreclosure decree makes no attempt to fasten upon appellant bortenstein,the mortgagor a personal liability
