appellants john logan and alan michael laws were found guilty by a jury sitting in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee on counts of criminal charges,which included making false statements,false entries,false claims,and one count of conspiracy.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to this court,challenging their convictions and the corresponding sentences.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to to review the final judgment of the district court and pursuant to a to review the sentence imposed.for the reasons set forth below,we hereby affirm the judgment reached and sentences imposed by the district court.
background 
appellants in this case are the sole shareholders and controlling officers of financial corporation llfc,an entity which made mortgage loans by the federal housing administration of the department of housing and urban development.through llfc,appellants issued securities backed by pools of federally insured mortgages to secondary market purchasers under the government national mortgage association gnma securities program mbs program.as an issuer of securities under the mbs program,llfc was required to collect monthly principal and interest payments from property owners,which it passed through to the security holders,less servicing fees.in the event that a property owner failed to make a monthly payment,llfc role as a lender required it to pay security holders from its own funds.if llfc failed to make such payments,gnma guaranteed payment to the security holders.thus,the united states,through gnma,was ultimately responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest due on llfc securities.
in connection with this practice,a grand jury returned a count indictment against appellants,charging them with conspiring to defraud and commit offenses against the united states making false claims to making false entries in reports to gnma making false statements to gnma and wire fraud.prior to trial,one count of making false claims to and the wire fraud count were dismissed.a jury convicted appellants on each of the remaining counts in the indictment.pursuant to the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines,the district court sentenced appellants to serve months of imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.in addition,the district court ordered appellants to make restitution to and gnma in the amount of one million dollars.
in this court,appellants challenge both their convictions and sentences.more specifically,appellants raise the following issues whether the search warrant executed by the government of llfc premises was a general warrant in violation of the fourth amendment of the united states constitution whether there was sufficient evidence to find appellants guilty of false claims whether there was sufficient evidence to find appellants guilty of false entries or false statements whether there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there was a knowing and willing agreement between appellants to commit a crime whether the district court erred in admitting evidence of a settlement agreement between and llfc whether the district court erred in permitting the government to inquire as to appellants reported taxable income whether the district court incorrectly calculated loss under the guidelines whether the district court improperly refused to depart downward from appellant laws sentencing computation under the guidelines whether the district court erred by enhancing appellants sentences for obstruction of justice whether the district court incorrectly calculated appellant laws criminal history category under the guidelines and whether the district court improperly refused to allow investigation of alleged jury misconduct.the court considers each of these issues below.
ii.discussion 
the issues raised on appeal in this case generally fall into three categories.first,appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence leading to their convictions.next,appellants assert that the district court erred in making several material evidentiary rulings.finally,appellants raise various challenges to the rulings made in the court below.we consider these categories in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
in considering claims for sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction,this court,while reviewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,should grant relief only if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at trial,no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.see jackson virginia,d.
false claims convictions 
on appeal,appellants argue that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support their convictions for making,or causing to be made,false loan insurance claims under.appellants contend that the false claims counts were based upon submission of either a verification of employment form voe or a verification of deposit form vod,neither of which satisfies the materiality requirement present in the false claims statute.thus,appellants argue that these forms,even if false,did not render the claims false within the meaning of the statute because the required element of materiality remains unsatisfied.
this circuit first addressed the particular issue of whether materiality is an element of a false claims offense in united states nash,cir.as in this case,the appellant in nash argued that materiality is an element of this offense,and that because the government failed to prove that his statements were material,no rational trier of fact could find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of making false statements.id.at.
in determining whether materiality was an element of the false claims statute in nash,this court first looked to the plain language of.that language provides 
whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil,military,or naval service of the united states,or to any department or agency thereof,any claim upon or against the united states,or any department or agency thereof,knowing such claim to be false,fictitious,or fraudulent,shall be imprisoned not more than five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount provided in this title.
id.based upon that section,this court noted that the plain language neither mentions materiality nor in any way implies that the claim must be material.nash,at.furthermore,we recognized that reading materiality into the statute would make surplusage of congress explicit use of the term in other statutes the legislative history of does not indicate that congress intended to make materiality a necessary element of the statute and the requirement of materiality would set up an incongruous heads i win,tails you lose dichotomy.id.this being the case,we made clear in nash that the sixth circuit joined the second,fifth,ninth,and tenth circuits in finding that materiality is not an element of.id.on this basis alone,we find appellants argument concerning insufficiency of the evidence as to the false claims convictions to be entirely without merit.under the law of this circuit,materiality is not an element of an offense arising under.
moreover,even if materiality were to be considered an element of this offense,the evidence was still sufficient to support appellants convictions under.that is,in light of the fact that the trial in the instant case took place,the jury was charged that materiality was required the jury found that the false voes and vods were,in fact,material to decision concerning whether to pay particular claims upon default.the record reveals that claims manager james gibson testified at trial that the voes and vods for the relevant claims were fraudulent.more specifically,gibson explained that he,appellants,or other llfc employees forged the documents to make the loan files acceptable to for payment on the loan insurance claims.at.furthermore,allen stailey,a marketing and outreach specialist for hud,testified that because the program is primarily based on the creditworthiness of the borrower,it is critical that the lenders follow procedures and that they are truthful in the verification of employment and deposit information so that can determine whether to pay on a particular claim.at.based upon this testimony,it was reasonable for the jury to conclude,as it did,that the contents of the voes and vods were material to the decision as to whether to pay particular claims.
appellants make much of the fact that neither the applicable regulations governing approval by a lender of a loan,nor the regulations governing the submission of a claim,specifically require that a voe or vod form be used or submitted.this technical argument amounts to nothing more than an unsuccessful attempt to circumvent the inevitable conclusion that appellants submitted false documents in order to induce to pay on certain loan insurance claims,regardless of the manner in which such information was submitted.in viewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the court finds that the evidence adduced at trial was such that a rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.for the reasons,the court finds appellants argument concerning insufficiency of the evidence with respect to the false claims convictions to be without merit.
false entries and false statements convictions 
appellants next assert that there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial upon which a rational jury could find them guilty of the offense of making false entries in reports under.similarly,appellants argue that there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction for making false,fictitious,or fraudulent statements concerning material facts within the jurisdiction of gnma in violation of.the court considers these arguments in turn.
section,entitled federal credit institution entries,reports and transactions,provides,in pertinent part,the following 
whoever,being connected in any capacity with the department of housing and urban development with intent to defraud the institution or to deceive any officer,auditor,examiner or agent of the institution,makes any false entry in any book,report or statement of or to any such institution,or without being duly authorized,draws any order or bill of exchange,makes any acceptance,or issues,puts forth or assigns any note,debenture,bond or other obligation or,with intent to defraud the united states or any agency thereof participates or shares in or receives directly or indirectly any money,profit,property,or benefits through any transaction,loan,commission,contract,or any other act of any such corporation,institution,or association,shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
thus,the offense of making false entries under requires that appellants,while officers,agents,or employees of a lending corporation,acting pursuant to federal law and in a capacity connected with the gnma of the hud,with the intent to defraud such agencies,knowingly and willfully made or caused to be made false entries in reports to them.
in the instant case,the government alleged at trial that appellants made false entries in form reports,which provided information on pools of loans in form reports,which summarized all of the pools that llfc issued during its existence and in letters from appellant logan to guy wilson,a of gnma,which repeated the information represented in the and forms.at.appellants do not dispute the fact that,as an authorized title i lender,llfc was required to submit monthly reports to gnma reflecting the status of each borrower account on a form and a form.as in the court below,however,appellants argue that the forms and letters were not false because the payments reflected therein were actually made to the borrowers accounts,regardless of the fact that they were paid out of llfc own funds.on this basis,appellants contend that the reports accurately reflect that a payment had been made and,therefore,were not false.
in united states walker,cir,this circuit made clear that a statement may be false when it contains a half truth or when it conceals a material fact.in that case,we were faced with a similar situation,in which the appellant argued that the entries were not false because they recorded actual transactions as they occurred.id.nevertheless,the government alleged and proved that the entries at issue were false because they failed to disclose that the loans were not made for the benefit of the named borrower and that the named borrower had not made the interest payments with his own funds.id.on this basis,we upheld the false entries convictions.id.
here,the gnma guidelines establish that the reports in question are required to reflect the payments that were actually received from the borrowers.according to the testimony presented at trial,gnma requires lender reports to reflect actual payments from borrowers and the loan delinquency information because it needs to obtain a complete picture of how many loans were delinquent and how such delinquency affected the lender cash flow.at.in this way,gnma is able to gauge the risk that it is undertaking with respect to each lender,and it is able to determine whether to allow the lender to continue participating in the program.id.at.if the lender masks the number of delinquent loan payments by making the payments from its own funds,and thereby classifies such payments as actually received,the effect would be to deprive gnma of the mandatory information it requires to assess continued relations with the lender.the record reflects that each witness who testified about the propriety of a lender making payments to the accounts of delinquent borrowers,with the exception of appellants,explained that such a practice was not permitted pursuant to the gnma guidelines and would have been done only to deceive gnma about the lender true loan delinquency rates.at.viewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,we find that the record evidence adduced at trial could have led a rational jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to the false entries convictions.
similarly,appellants challenge their convictions for making false statements pursuant to.that statute provides in part 
whoever,in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states,knowingly and willfully 
falsifies,conceals,or covers up by any trick,scheme,or device a material fact 
makes any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation or 
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or entry 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
in order to establish a violation of,the government must demonstrate that the defendant made a statement the statement is false or fraudulent the statement is material the defendant made the statement knowingly and wilfully and the statement pertained to an activity within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.see united states rogers,cir.a statement is material under if it has the natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the federal agency.see united states lutz,cir.
in this case,the statements at issue relate to letters from appellants to guy wilson relating to llfc dq ratios.the dq ratios are an indicator of the loan delinquencies for a gnma issuer loan portfolio and were used by gnma to determine whether authority to issue additional securities would be granted.at.these dq ratios were determined from the loan delinquency information contained in the form and the form reports.the government contends that because these reports contained false loan delinquency about by llfc making delinquent loan payments from its own dq ratios submitted to wilson based upon this information were also false.
at trial,wilson testified that if llfc dq ratios were not in proper compliance with gnma standards,then gnma was going to end the commitment authority and not issue any more pools.at.he further explained that the result of masking the dq ratios by making delinquent payments from its own funds allowed llfc to falsely represent to gnma that its delinquency rates were in compliance.at.in this way,llfc allowed its commitment authority and the issuance of new pools to remain unchanged.we find that this testimony provides an adequate basis upon which the jury could find that the false representations were material and that gnma relied on the statements in extending additional loan commitments to llfc.accordingly,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the evidence presented at trial could have led a rational jury to find appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to the false entries convictions.
conspiracy convictions 
appellants further argue that there was insufficient evidence to establish the conspiracy convictions.more specifically,appellants assert that the government failed to demonstrate that there was a knowing and willing agreement between them to commit a crime because there was insufficient evidence to support the underlying substantive claims.as discussed previously,the government produced sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could find appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of making false entries,false claims,and false statements.the evidence produced by the government established that appellants knowingly and voluntarily entered into an agreement to commit the underlying substantive offenses,and that they committed an overt act for the purpose of advancing or helping the conspiracy.on this basis,the jury possessed a rational basis upon which it concluded that appellants were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of conspiracy.
propriety of the evidentiary rulings 
appellants also raise several challenges to specific evidentiary rulings made by the district court.as an initial matter,appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence due to the alleged insufficiency of the search warrant that led to the discovery of such evidence.furthermore,appellants contend that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a review by hud monitoring division,the resulting action by hud mortgagee review board,llfc july response to the mortgagee review board,and the settlement agreement and letter of reprimand disposing of the administrative action.in addition,appellants state that the district court erred in permitting the government to inquire as to their amount of income gained from llfc and related corporations.we now consider each of these arguments in turn.
sufficiency of the warrant 
on july,special agent derek johnson of the federal bureau of investigation prepared an application and affidavit for a search warrant of llfc premises.special agent johnson sought the warrant after obtaining information indicating that llfc regularly falsified loan documents filed with and fraudulently manipulated its records to give the appearance that it was in compliance with gnma requirements.upon review of the affidavit and application,united states district judge thomas hull issued a search warrant.the warrant authorized the following items to be seized 
information data stored in the form of magnetic or electronic coding on computer media or in media capable of being read by a computer or with the aid of computer related equipment.this media includes but is not limited to floppy diskettes,fixed hard disks,removable hard disk cartridges,tapes,laser disks,video cassettes,and any other media which is capable of storing magnetic coding.

instructions or programs in the form of electronic or magnetic media which are capable of being interpreted by a computer or related components.the items to be seized could include but would not be limited to operating systems,application software,utility programs,compilers,interpreters,and any other programs peripherals either directly or indirectly via telephone lines,radio,or other means of transmission.
printed material which provide sic instructions or examples concerning the operation of a computer system,computer software,any related device.
telephone long distance call records and records of wire and electronic interstate communications.
records,files,documents,notes,correspondence,microfiche,or computerized entries concerning the department of housing and urban development hud,government national mortgage association gnma,federal housing administration fha,manufactured home dealers,borrowers both past and present,payment history and current loan status of borrowers,loan files and accounts of borrowers,loan applications,and copies of submissions to fha,gnma,hud,fha insurance claims and claims records.
accounts receivable and records thereof.

internal documents or instructions to employees,representatives or agents concerning gnma,fha,borrowers or manufactured homes dealers,personal and informal files,notes,diaries,telephone call logs and telephone records,calendars and working papers of employees and officers of,articles of incorporation,or partnerships.
all of the above listed documents may be found in written or electronic form.
at.thus,the warrant authorized agents of the government to search for and seize any records,files,and documents relating to the mobile home loans made by llfc by and upon which llfc issued securities pursuant to gnma.the government agents executed the search warrant on july.
prior to trial,appellants filed motions to suppress the documents and items seized during the search of llfc.in the motions,appellants argued that the search warrant was general and that it effectively authorized the seizure of almost every single piece of paper or piece of information in the corporate building.at.the district court referred the matter to magistrate judge dennis inman for report and recommendation.on february,magistrate judge inman held an evidentiary hearing on,inter alia,the motions to suppress.thereafter,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that the warrant was,in light of the nature of the activity under investigation,and the manner of storing the information,as particular as it could be.at.furthermore,the magistrate judge stated 
this warrant was broad,to be sure,but it was not general.the warrant was rather specific about what could be searched and seized.although the description encompassed virtually all of the business records of the corporation,that does not mean that the warrant lacked particularity it simply means that it was extremely broad.the issue,therefore,is whether there was probable cause to support a search of this breadth,not whether the warrant was general.
at internal citation and quotations omitted.finding that all records of the corporation relating to its and gnma activities were potentially probative of criminal conduct,magistrate judge inman recommended that the district court deny the motions to suppress on the ground that there was probable cause to support a search of this breadth.
appellants filed timely objections to the report and recommendation.the district court denied these objections and,consequently,adopted the report and recommendation in its entirety.in a memorandum opinion,the district court found that the search warrant,though broad,attempted to uncover specific evidence of convoluted fraudulent activity,buried amidst mounds of paperwork and computer documentation.at.in addition,the district court stated the following 
because of the complex nature of the criminal scheme in the present case,the warrant could not have been more specific as to the identity of the documents to be seized.even with the aid of the confidential informants who provided the information upon which the affidavit in support of the warrant was based,the officers could not have known precisely where and in what form documentation of this scheme existed.for example,according to the statements of one informant,the checks used to make payments to delinquent borrowers accounts were returned to and stored with other records in the second floor storage area,which also housed all of the records dating to the beginning of the corporation.these records also included,amidst mountains of paperwork,evidence,in unknown forms,of fraudulent loan payments and filings with fha and gnma.hence,naming the general class of items,such as all documents relating to the hud,fha,and gnma transactions and loan payments,was as specific as possible,and thus reasonable under the circumstances.
at internal citation omitted.thus,the district court held that the warrant sufficiently stated the items to be seized,even though it effectively encompassed the bulk of the company records.at.
appellants contend that the district court should have declared the search warrant invalid because the description of the property did not meet the constitutional standards of particularity.they argue that the warrant was general in nature and,therefore,allowed for a general rummaging search.furthermore,appellants contend that the law enforcement officials seeking the warrant had specific information with which they could have limited the search to a significant degree but which they chose not to include in the warrant.based upon these alleged deficiencies,appellants state that the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress.
we review a district court factual findings regarding motions to suppress for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see united states blair,cir.in doing so,we extend great deference to a previous finding of probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant.see id.thus,it is this court task to determine whether,in light of the totality of the circumstances,the judge issuing the warrant had a substantial basis for concluding that a search of the specified premises would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.see id.
the fourth amendment to the united states constitution requires a warrant to particularly describ e the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.the purpose of this particularity requirement is to prevent the use of general warrants authorizing rummaging searches in violation of the constitution proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.see andresen maryland,d united states schultz,cir see also united states blakeney,cir recognizing that the warrant must enable a searcher to reasonably ascertain and identify the things which are authorized to be seized.this court has recognized that the issue of whether a warrant is general,or lacks the requisite particularity,is best resolved upon examination of the circumstances of the particular case.see white fabricating.united states,cir see also blair,at stating that the degree of specificity in a warrant must be flexible,depending upon the type of items to be seized and the crime involved united states henson,cir finding that the particularity required depends on the items sought and the specific circumstances in the case.a description contained in a warrant is sufficiently particular if it is as specific as the circumstances and the nature of the alleged crime permit.blair,at.in addition,once a category of documents has been adequately described in the warrant,in part by an illustrative list of items to be seized,the fourth amendment is not violated when officers executing the warrant exercise minimal judgment as to whether a particular document falls within the described category.see id.
in this case,we find that the lower court correctly determined that the search warrant satisfies the particularity requirement.the search warrant at issue authorizes the seizure of items specifically related to false or fraudulent activity taking place within the context of the loans and the gnma securities.in particular,items such as records,files,documents,notes,correspondence,microfiche,or computerized entries concerning,gnma,manufactured home dealers,borrowers both past and present,payment history and current loan status of borrowers,loan applications,and copies of submissions to fha,gnma,and hud,fha insurance claims,and other claims records could logically lead to evidence that appellants were involved in the suspected illegal activity.appellants argument concerning the particularity requirement is based upon their position that investigating officers dug too deeply into the overall business of llfc,instead of focusing on one portion of the operation that was alleged to have involved illegal practices.appellants miss the point.
from the face of the search warrant and accompanying affidavit,it is clear that the warrant general nature was due to the investigators belief that granting loans and gnma securities constituted llfc entire operation.that being the case,law enforcement officials were necessarily involved in an examination of an extensive paper trail in order to discover which transactions may have been illegal in nature.keeping in mind that the particularity requirement is determined relative to the specific circumstances in each case,we find that the items sought in light of the illegal activity alleged were appropriate.the warrant specified that the items sought were those related to lending and gnma securities and,as such,did not violate the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment.
furthermore,even if we were to find that the warrant lacked sufficient particularity under the fourth amendment,the district court would still have been correct in denying the motions to suppress under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule outlined in united states leon.see schultz,at.the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule states that the fruits of a constitutionally infirm search need not necessarily be suppressed unless the warrant contained a knowing or reckless falsehood the issuing judge acted as a mere rubber stamp for the police or the warrant and the affidavit,even after extending appropriate deference to the issuing judge determination,did not establish probable cause or possessed a technical deficiency such that the executing officers can not reasonably assume the warrant to be valid.leon,at.
in the instant matter,there exists no evidence that special agent johnson gave a knowingly false affidavit or otherwise acted in bad faith upon seeking the search warrant.the warrant was issued by a proper authority,namely united states district judge thomas hull.furthermore,the record is devoid of any evidence that judge hull abandoned his neutral role when he issued the warrant.finally,we can not say that this warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.schultz,at.this being the case,the officers good faith reliance on the warrant in executing the search was,indeed,reasonable.therefore,under either scenario,the evidence obtained from the search warrant at issue properly survived appellants motions to suppress.
admission of the settlement agreement 
over appellants objections at trial,the district court admitted into evidence a review by hud monitoring division the resulting action by hud mortgagee review board llfc july response to the mortgagee review board and the settlement agreement and letter of reprimand disposing of the administrative action.appellants contend that the district court erred in admitting this evidence.in particular,appellants argue that the admission of the settlement agreement was in violation of federal rules of evidence rules,b and.the government asserts that the evidence was relevant,material,and admissible to demonstrate that appellants were on notice of improprieties in their loan origination process and to explain one reason why appellants were falsifying loan insurance claims.
we review the district court admission of testimony or other evidence at trial for an abuse of discretion.see united states talley,cir.an abuse of discretion exists only if this court is firmly convinced that the district court has made a mistake.see united states wiedyk,cir.this court first considers appellants argument that the evidence in question was admitted in violation of rule.
rule provides 
rule.compromise and offers to compromise 
evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to furnish,or accepting or offering or promising to accept,a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount,is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible.this rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations.this rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose,such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness,negativing a contention of undue delay,or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.
the issue of whether rule serves to prohibit admission of administrative or civil settlement negotiations in a criminal context is one of first impression in this circuit.
in ruling on motions for judgment of acquittal or,in the alternative,for a new trial,the district court held,without citation,that rule,which excludes evidence of compromise and settlements in a civil context,does not foreclose the use of this type of evidence in a criminal case.at.several circuits,including the second and seventh circuits,have confronted the question of whether rule applies to evidence of a settlement agreement sought to be admitted in a criminal matter.in each instance,the court held that rule is inapplicable to criminal cases.
the second circuit reached the conclusion that rule does not apply to criminal cases by looking to the plain language of the rule.see united states baker,cir finding it fairly evident that the rule applies only to civil litigation.in reviewing the plain language,the court held that words such as validity and claim establish that the drafters of the rule intended for it to apply solely in a civil context.see id.furthermore,the second circuit has held that the primary policy consideration that underlies the purpose of rule,which is to encourage the settlement of civil cases,does not apply to criminal prosecutions.see manko united states,cir united states gonzalez,cir see also united states peed,cir holding that rule was inapplicable in the context of a criminal case because the negotiations at issue were not negotiations aimed at settling a civil claim,negotiations that the policy behind rule seeks to encourage.
similarly,the seventh circuit held that the plain language of rule reflects that it applies only to civil cases,specifically the language concerning validity and amount of a claim.united states prewitt,cir.in addition,the court recognized that nothing in rule particularly circumscribes the use of evidence of settlement negotiations with a private party in the context of a criminal case.see id.finding that the public interest in the prosecution of crime is greater than the public interest in the settlement of civil disputes,the court made clear that the law in the seventh circuit provides that rule should not be applied to criminal cases.see id.
we find that the cases that exist in the second and seventh circuits are correct in concluding that the plain language of rule makes it inapplicable in the criminal context.although this conclusion arguably may have a chilling effect on administrative or civil settlement negotiations in cases where parallel civil and criminal proceedings are possible,we find that this risk is heavily outweighed by the public interest in prosecuting criminal matters.based upon the foregoing,we conclude,as have the second and seventh circuits,that rule does not serve to prohibit the use of evidence from settlement negotiations in a criminal case.
next,we turn to appellants argument that the review by hud monitoring division,the resulting action by hud mortgagee review board,llfc july response to the mortgagee review board,and the settlement agreement and letter of reprimand disposing of the administrative action were inadmissible pursuant to rule b.that rule provides,in pertinent part 
rule.character evidence not admissible to prove conduct exceptions other crimes 
b other crimes,wrongs,or acts.evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident,provided that upon request by the accused,the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial,or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown,of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.
b.on appeal,appellee contends that these documents were properly admitted to prove knowledge and intent to defraud.
in united states gold unlimited,cir,this court set out a test for the admission of evidence under rule b.in that case,we stated 
this court requires a district court to make three findings before the district court admits evidence under federal rule of evidence b.the district court must find that the prior bad acts occurred a finding reviewed for clear error that the evidence helps prove a material issue a finding reviewed de novo and that the evidence passes the balancing test of rule a finding reviewed for abuse of discretion.
id.citing united states jobson,cir.appellants do not contest the first or second elements,implicitly admitting that the bad acts transpired and that the evidence helps to prove a material issue.instead,appellants direct their argument to the third element,claiming that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,and misleading the jury under rule.
rule states the following 
rule.exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice,confusion,or waste of time 
although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
in reviewing rule challenges to the district court decision to admit certain evidence,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.see united states sanders,cir.as such,we maximize the probative value of the evidence and minimize its potential prejudice to the defendant.see id.the prejudice noted by the court is only the unfair prejudice against the defendant caused by the admission of the evidence.see id.accordingly,e vidence that is prejudicial only in the sense that it paints the defendant in a bad light is not unfairly prejudicial pursuant to rule.id.at citing united states mullins,cir.based upon these standards,the trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to admit evidence pursuant to rule b.see talley,at.
in this case,the court finds that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a review by hud monitoring division,the resulting action by hud mortgagee review board,llfc july response to the mortgagee review board,and the settlement agreement and letter of reprimand disposing of the administrative action.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the evidence at issue was properly admitted to demonstrate appellants knowledge,motive,and intent.although some prejudice may have arisen due to the admission of this evidence,the prejudice does not amount to the type of unfair prejudice contemplated by rule.based upon the foregoing,we find that the trial court acted within its broad discretion in admitting the evidence pursuant to rule b and that appellants argument in this regard is without merit.
admission of income evidence 
similarly,appellants contend that the district court erred in permitting appellee to inquire about the amount of their income from llfc and related corporations.the evidence in question reflected a gross income of over for each appellant.appellants argue that the admission of this income evidence was unfairly prejudicial,lacked any probative value of any element of the crime charged by the government,and was in violation of rule.
in maximizing the probative value of this evidence and minimizing its prejudicial effect,we find that the income evidence was relevant to demonstrate that financial gain was the motive for the crimes charged.see,pointer united states.proof of motive always welcome.stated another way,appellants substantial income was necessarily dependent upon gnma continuation of llfc loan commitment authority.in the event that gnma became aware of the actual number of llfc loan delinquencies,the result would have had a profound financial effect on appellants,llfc sole shareholders,in that they would cease to gain profits from the issuance of the securities.in this way,the income evidence had a significant probative value because it demonstrated what appellants stood to lose if they properly reported the actual loan delinquencies.for this reason,the trial court properly exercised its broad discretion in admitting this evidence.
next,appellants challenge various rulings made in the court below.the first four of these challenges relate to the district court decisions in fashioning appropriate sentences under the guidelines.more specifically,appellants challenge the district court determination of the amount of loss attributable to them,its denial of a motion for downward departure made by appellant laws,its application of an obstruction of justice enhancement,and its computation of appellant laws criminal history category.the final challenge involves the district court ruling concerning an investigation into alleged jury misconduct at trial.prior to addressing these particular issues,we briefly reiterate the district court general determinations at sentencing.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court allowed testimony and other evidence concerning appellants objections to the presentence investigation reports.upon conclusion of such evidence and argument related to the same,the district court sentenced each appellant to a term of months of imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.the court further ordered that appellants make restitution to the victims in this case,namely and gnma,in the amount of one million dollars.appellants now appeal their sentences to this court.
amount of loss 
appellants first contend that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss attributable to them at sentencing.the district court definition of loss is a question of law to be reviewed de novo.see united states kohlbach,cir.we review the district court factual findings with respect to loss under the clearly erroneous standard.see id.to the extent that one challenges the district court calculation of loss,therefore,the appellant bears the heavy burden of persuading the reviewing court that the evaluation of the loss was not only inaccurate,but was outside the realm of permissible computations.united states jackson,cir.
in this case,the district court computed the amount of loss under of the sentencing guidelines.section of the guidelines governs the calculation of loss for offenses involving fraud or deceit.that section begins by assigning a base offense level of six,and then increasing the base offense level by the amount of loss.in the instant case,the district court computed the amount of loss using three figures.first,the district court determined the amount of loss to incurred due to the false claims convictions.next,the district court inquired as to the amount of loss calculated in light of the conspiracy conviction.last,the district court included the amount of loss incurred by gnma.the district court added these three figures to arrive at a total loss of at least for purposes of sentencing.section b provides that if the loss was more than but less than,then the district court shall increase the base offense level of six by fourteen levels,resulting in an offense level of twenty.a and b o.accordingly,the district court increased appellants offense levels to twenty.we now consider appellants argument that the district court computation of loss and corresponding increase in the offense levels was in error.
amount of loss for false claims convictions 
in examining the amount of actual or intended loss caused by appellants false claims,the district court first noted the presentence investigation reports psrs calculation of in actual or intended losses to.at.the court adopted the psrs calculation in this regard,based in part on the undisputed fact that paid a total of in actual loss on of the false claims.at.with respect to three of the false claims upon which denied payment,the district court found that because the average claim payment was approximately,those claims represented an additional in intended losses to.at citing united states moored,cir l oss under is not the potential loss,but is the actual loss to the victim,or the intended loss to the victim,whichever is greater.adding the in actual loss to in intended loss,the district court arrived at as the total amount of loss to.at.
appellants contest the computation of the false claims figure by arguing,inter alia,that it fails to include any for amounts collected on the defaulted loans,the inclusion of monies paid by llfc in annualized amounts for each loan to cover losses,or the value of the note for each loan assigned to the government in exchange for payment of the claim.such an argument,however,is insufficient to demonstrate that the evaluation of the loss fell outside the realm of permissible computations under the guidelines.the commentary to provides 
for the purposes of subsection b,the loss need not be determined with precision.the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.this estimate,for example,may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim,or on more general factors,such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations 
id.at cmt.furthermore,the commentary addresses the circumstances presented in fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases in note b,which states 
in fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases,the loss is the actual loss to the victim or if the loss has not yet come about,the expected loss.for example,if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets,the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered,reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered or can expect to recover from any assets pledged to secure the loan.however,where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss,the intended loss is to be used.
id.at cmt.according to these passages,the district court was not required to make the precise determination of loss caused by appellants,by amounts recovered on the defaulted loans.to the contrary,the application notes specifically delineate that in circumstances where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss incurred,the district court shall use the intended loss in calculating the proper offense level under the guidelines.
the relevant case law also supports the use of intended loss under,explaining that the figure is designed to assign responsibility for the harm that was meant to take place,regardless of whether the harm did,in fact,occur.see moored,at.that is,so long as the intended loss is supported by a preponderance of the evidence,the district court may use it in reaching the appropriate offense level.see id.at.in this instance,the district court found that there was evidence in the record sufficient to support a finding that appellants caused a loss of to.at.upon a review of,its accompanying commentary,and the relevant case law as applied to the facts in the record in this case,we find that the court below properly calculated the amount of loss for false claims submitted to.
amount of loss for conspiracy convictions 
moreover,because appellants were found guilty of conspiracy to submit false claims,the district court found that of the guidelines required that all false claims submitted by,even those claims not charged in the indictment,be included within the relevant conduct for purposes of fashioning the appropriate sentence.at trial,gibson testified that there were additional claims submitted to that contained materially false documents,in addition to those with which appellants were charged.at.the amount paid on these additional false claims was.at.based upon this testimony,the district court determined that the total loss for all false claims was.
appellants contest the district court findings with respect to the loss arising out of the conspiracy convictions.generally,appellants argue that the relevant conduct should not have included these additional false claims because the government failed to establish that these loan files actually contained any materially false documents.accordingly,appellants ask this court to reverse the district court finding concerning the relevant conduct for purposes of sentencing.
section a a of the guidelines explains that fraudulent claims that are submitted and paid,but not part of the counts of conviction,shall be included in the sentencing calculation as relevant conduct.this provision instructs that the offense level be determined based upon all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,in preparation for that offense,or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.a a.here,appellants were found guilty on the charge of conspiracy to defraud the united states.the additional false claims were identified at trial by gibson.the record further reflects that,upon examination by hud investigators,the files in question did contain false claims.as such,these claims constitute additional criminal wrongdoing,not specifically charged in the indictment,that is properly taken into consideration when formulating the relevant conduct for sentencing.based upon the information in the record,we find appellants argument concerning the relevant conduct to be without merit.
amount of loss to gnma 
finally,the trial court considered the amount of loss to gnma which,without knowledge of llfc actual loan delinquency rates,extended additional loan pool commitment authority to llfc.the district court explained that appellants misrepresentations resulted in an increased amount of loans and securities,of which loans defaulted.at.the record reflects that these defaulted loans resulted in a loss of to gnma.at.adding the loss incurred by gnma to the loss incurred by,the district court found that the psrs correctly determined the amount of loss to be at least.at.
the general rule in determining loss requires the court to examine the causal connection between the criminal conduct and the alleged loss,and whether it was reasonably foreseeable to the defendants that the loss would occur.united states krenning,cir stating that the amount of loss must bear a reasonable relation to the actual or intended harm of the offense.in this regard,the district court observed that 
llfc had a high delinquency rate in its loan portfolio due to the high number of falsifications in the documents,which falsifications were the direct result of defendants knowing and willful actions.loans were therefore made to individuals who were poor credit risks.the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that llfc manipulated the delinquency rate information in order to conceal its true delinquency rate from gnma authorities.in other words,but for the criminal action by these defendants,the additional loans would not have been issued by llfc and underwritten by gnma.it was foreseeable to these defendants that a high number of loans would default because llfc had been previously warned by gnma that the rate was not currently at an acceptable level.
at footnote omitted.upon a thorough review of the evidence presented at trial,in addition to the law and argument set forth by the parties on this issue,we find that the district court properly concluded that it was reasonably foreseeable that the loss in question would be incurred by gnma as a direct result of appellants conduct.for this reason,we affirm the district court ruling that the loss incurred by gnma was in the amount of.furthermore,the district court correctly added this loss to that incurred by,finding that the total loss was at least.
based upon our determination that the district court made proper findings concerning the amount of loss to incurred due to the false claims convictions the amount of loss under the relevant conduct figure calculated in light of the conspiracy convictions and the amount of loss incurred by gnma,we conclude that the district court properly applied b,which required it to increase appellants base offense level of six by fourteen levels,resulting in a level twenty.a and b o.as such,we find appellants argument concerning the district court computation of loss and corresponding increase in the offense level to be without merit.the district court computation of loss in this case is,therefore,affirmed.
downward departure 
next,we consider appellant laws argument that the district court improperly refused to depart downward from its sentencing computation under the guidelines.the record reflects that counsel for appellant laws filed a written motion in the district court just one day prior to the sentencing hearing,in which he requested a downward departure from the guidelines pursuant to.at.while recognizing its authority to make such a departure,the district court,nevertheless,found that the grounds set forth in the motion and supporting memorandum did not warrant the requested departure.at.on this basis,the district court denied the motion.at.appellant laws now objects to the district court failure to grant him a downward departure pursuant to of the guidelines.
section states,in pertinent part 
the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines,if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.
internal quotations omitted.appellant laws argues that he was entitled to a departure pursuant to this provision because there are at least two features of his conduct that take this case outside of the heartland of comparable fraud cases.first,appellant laws argues that he lacked the intent to steal money from the united states.second,he argues that the voe and vod forms were not even necessary,as the loan files already contained adequate verification of employment and adequate verification of deposit upon which could and would have relied to pay the majority of the claims.as to the latter argument,appellant laws states that while he was found by a jury to have technically violated the law,his intention was not to defraud the government but rather to ensure prompt payment on the claims to which it was rightfully entitled payment.
the refusal of a district judge to make a downward departure is not ordinarily appealable.see united states byrd,cir.in united states davis,cir,we held 
where,as here,the guideline range was properly computed,the district court was not unaware of its discretion to depart from the guideline range,and the sentence was not imposed in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines,the failure to depart is not cognizable on appeal under a.
in the instant case,appellant laws does not make any effort to avoid this rule,which prevents him from making the argument concerning the downward departure in this court.furthermore,the district judge went beyond this circuit requirements in ruling on the motion,by stating affirmatively that he was aware that he possessed the power to make a downward departure but declined to do so.byrd,at explaining that the trial judge does not have a duty to state affirmatively that he knows that he possesses the power to make a downward departure,but declines to do so.for these reasons,we affirm the district court ruling.
obstruction of justice enhancement 
we now turn to appellants argument that the district court erred when it enhanced their sentences for obstruction of justice.section of the guidelines states that 
if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense,increase the offense level by levels.
one type of obstructive conduct specifically mentioned in the guidelines is perjury.see id.at cmt.b.we employ a clearly erroneous standard in reviewing a district court factual determination that a defendant conduct warrants an obstruction of justice enhancement.see united states walker,cir.
in the instant case,the court below determined that appellants falsely testified under oath about a material matter when they denied any knowledge concerning the admission of false and fraudulent claims.at.in particular,in a memorandum and order issued on october,nunc pro tunc august,the district court pointed to the following testimony made by appellant logan 
logan,at any time,at any time,did you ever direct any employee of llfc to make any false entries in any claims 
no,sir,never.
q.what about jim gibson what knowledge did you have before your business was closed that he was submitting any false insurance claims to hud or fha 
i had no knowledge of him doing that.
at citing doc,attachment.the district then turned to the following testimony made by appellant laws 
did you or not ever sic knowingly or willfully make or cause anyone else to make any false claims to hud 
q.did she iva jean lewis ever indicate to you that she was forging any documents 
no,she did not 
q.did she ever indicate to you she needed to forge any documents to get the claims filed 
no,she did not.
q.did you ever tell anybody to falsify any documents 
i never told jim gibson or iva lewis or anybody else in our office to falsify any documents whatsoever.
at.contrary to this testimony made by appellants,however,the district court noted that,at trial,witnesses gibson and lewis swore under oath that appellants logan and laws directed them to falsify documents for the submission of loan insurance claims.at.
in addition,the district court stated the following with respect to the evidence in the form of testimony made by various llfc employees 
lewis pointed to specific entries in her contemporaneous notes in which she detailed laws directions to falsify documents.likewise,jacquelyn matheson testified that she was directed by laws to complete missing forms for use in fha claims.similarly,leisa tadlock campbell testified that she and other employees were personally directed by defendants logan and laws to falsify documents for use in fha loan insurance claims.finally,sarah mays,a,testified that it was common knowledge throughout llfc that gibson was using false documents in fha claims and that she too had been asked to create false documents.
at.considering the record as a whole,the district court found that,based upon its own assessment of the evidence presented at trial,appellants committed perjury by giving untruthful testimony on material matters designed to substantially affect the outcome of the case.at.thus,the district court applied the enhancement to appellants guideline calculation.at.in doing so,the district court was careful to note that it made the finding of obstruction of justice independent of the jury verdict of guilty.id.therefore,the district court made its own independent determination that appellants engaged in obstructive conduct which warranted an application of the enhancement.
appellants main argument on appeal is that the district court memorandum and order making the findings required by is without effect because it was issued after appellants filed a timely notice of appeal and was not timely served on appellants counsel.even assuming that appellants position properly reflects the relevant procedural history,we find any error by the district court committed in this regard to be harmless in nature.the information upon which the district court ultimately based its decision to apply the enhancement is clearly set forth in the psrs,which state 
the defendants rely on spears,cir,in stating that the adjustment for obstruction of justice is inappropriate when the defendant testifies and the court relies on the jury verdict of guilt in applying the enhancement.this is true to the extent that the court can not rely simply on the verdict of guilt to support the enhancement.the court must make findings of specific instances of the defendant testimony,which was directly contradicted by the testimony of other witnesses.the united states has a transcript of various witnesses at the trial,listing specific examples for the court of direct contradictions to the defendants perjured testimony.this transcript will be provided at the sentencing hearing for the court use in determining specific examples of perjured testimony.once this testimony is identified,the enhancement meets the standard set forth in spears.
in the presentence report,the defendants perjured testimony has been used as the basis of the obstruction of justice enhancement.while the probation officer feels that this alone is sufficient to warrant the increase,it should also be noted that the defendants transferred over million dollars in assets from llfc to john laws,defendant alan michael laws father,and elizabeth logan,wife of john logan.these transactions occurred after the fbi search and seizure of records from llfc,and the defendants were aware they were under investigation for the instant offense.details of these transactions are outlined in the financial section of the presentence report.the transfer of these assets represent s an obstruction of justice,in that it impedes the administration in the collection of restitution.the enhancement for the transfer of assets is supported by black,cir.
at.appellants argument on appeal is tantamount to an assertion of lack of notice with respect to the district court findings in support of the obstruction of justice enhancement.we find this argument to be without merit for several reasons.
at sentencing,the district court adopted the factual findings as suggested by the probation officer in the psrs and thereby made appellants aware of the basis for its application of the enhancement,overruling appellants objections on the record to the same.furthermore,the record at the time of sentencing was replete with examples of the obstructive conduct,including a detailed explanation of the perjury and the transfer of assets outlined in a brief submitted by the government.at.at the time of sentencing,the district court had before it the information in the psrs,the government brief,and its own observations of the trial made independent of the jury verdict of guilty.based upon this record,the district court found that the enhancement was proper.moreover,the district court issued the above outlined memorandum and order specifically addressing the findings that gave rise to its application of the enhancement.although the memorandum and order would have been more properly issued prior to appellants filing the notice of appeal,appellants were adequately aware of the particular basis upon which the trial judge made his decision
