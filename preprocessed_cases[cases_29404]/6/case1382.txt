national city appeals from the trial court january,order.national city contends that the trial court erred in construing its july,filing as a petition to vacate pursuant to section of the code rather than a motion under section e of the code even if its filing was properly characterized as a section petition to vacate,the trial court erred in determining that it had not satisfied the requirements for vacatur and the trial court erred in confirming the foreclosure sale.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
the record documents the following proceedings relevant to the disposition of this appeal.on february,jp morgan filed a foreclosure complaint against mortgagors and national city.the complaint alleged that,on june,mortgagors had executed and delivered to jp morgan a note.mortgagors also executed and delivered to jp morgan a mortgage on the property located at south street in charles.jp morgan alleged that mortgagors were in default on the note after failing to make installment payments for three months.jp morgan requested the trial court to take an account of the sums owed by mortgagors and to order payment by a date certain.jp morgan further requested that,absent payment of the amount due,the mortgaged property be sold to satisfy the indebtedness.the complaint also alleged that national city was a mortgagee under a separate mortgage recorded september,on the same property to secure a note of.
on february,national city was served with notice of the complaint through its agent,ct corporation system.on february,and march,mortgagors received service of the complaint.
on may,after notice was given and after neither mortgagors nor national city appeared in court to defend the action,the trial court granted jp morgan motion for default.the trial court also entered a judgment of foreclosure providing that mortgagors owed jp morgan in principal,interest,fees,and costs.the order provided that the period of redemption would expire on june,at which time the property could be sold at public auction.the order further provided that there is no just cause for delaying the enforcement of this judgment,or an appeal therefrom.the order additionally provided that the trial court retain ed jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing this judgment,for the purpose of amending the amounts due to jp morgan to reflect receipts,disbursements and charges which are made or accrue after the entry of this judgment and prior to sale and for the purpose of appointing or continuing a receiver herein during the period of redemption.
on june,jp morgan gave notice to mortgagors and national city that the property would be sold by sheriff sale on july.
on july,jp morgan moved the trial court to confirm the sale and to enter an order for possession.attached to the motion was a sheriff report of sale indicating that the property had been sold to pathfinder for the sum of.
on july,national city moved pursuant to section e of the code to vacate the default judgment and the judgment of foreclosure and sale.national city further requested the trial court to void the foreclosure sale and to grant it leave to file an answer to jp morgan complaint.national city argued that it did not become aware of the entry of the default judgment until july,when it received jp morgan motion to confirm the sale.national city argued that the trial court had the discretion to vacate the default judgment because it had not yet entered a final order disposing of the case.national city argued that a judgment of foreclosure was not a final judgment instead,national city argued that the final judgment in a foreclosure action is the order confirming or denying the foreclosure sale.national city further argued that it had a meritorious defense to the complaint in that its mortgage interest was superior to jp morgan.finally,national city argued that the bid at the sheriff sale was grossly inadequate in view of the fair market value of the property.
in support of its motion,national city attached the affidavit of dorothy thomas,the supervisor of national city default litigation department.national city also attached a copy of a motion filed by jp morgan in breck and elaine fankhauser bankruptcy proceeding in which it stated that its mortgage lien was a second mortgage lien.national city also attached a copy of the settlement statement prepared at the closing on national city loan transaction,which indicated that national city had loaned mortgagors.the settlement statement reflected that a portion of the loan proceeds was used to pay off jp morgan loan.national city also attached a july,broker price opinion indicating that the fair market value of the property was.finally,national city attached a copy of breck and elaine fankhauser august bankruptcy petition filed in federal court,indicating that the property had a market value of.
on august,the trial court granted pathfinder leave to file an appearance as an intervenor.
on november,the trial court granted national city motion to vacate and entered an order vacating the judgments of default and foreclosure.the trial court further vacated the july,judicial sale.the trial court granted national city leave to file an answer or otherwise plead to jp morgan complaint.
on december,pathfinder filed a motion requesting the trial court to reconsider its november,order.in its motion,pathfinder argued that national city motion to vacate should have been brought under section of the code rather than section e of the code.pathfinder noted that the trial court may,default and foreclosure judgments contained language pursuant to supreme court rule a a,making them immediately enforceable and appealable.because national city did not file its motion to vacate until days after the entry of the may,order,pathfinder argued that national city had to comply with the requirements of section of the code to obtain any relief.pathfinder argued that national city failed to allege that it had exercised due diligence in the proceeding or that it had a meritorious defense to the underlying complaint.
on january,the trial court granted pathfinder motion to reconsider and vacated its november,order.the trial court also confirmed the sheriff sale.in its written order,the trial court indicated that its ruling was based upon section of the code.the trial court order further reflected that its ruling was based on the pleadings and oral arguments.national city filed a timely notice of appeal.
national city first contends that the trial court erred on reconsideration when it construed its motion to vacate as a petition brought pursuant to section of the code.national city argues that section governs a petition seeking relief from a final judgment more than days after judgment was entered.national city argues that the trial court judgment of foreclosure was not final and appealable until such time as the trial court confirmed the sale of the property and directed the distribution.national city further contends that the presence of rule a language in the judgment of foreclosure did not alter the nonfinal nature of the judgment,because the trial court expressly retained jurisdiction over the sale and the distribution of the proceeds.national city concludes that,because the judgment of foreclosure was not a final order,the trial court should have construed its motion to vacate as one brought pursuant to section e of the code.
we begin by noting our standard of review.national city has appealed from the trial court order granting pathfinder motion to reconsider.generally,a motion to reconsider is a matter addressed to the trial court discretion,and we will not reverse its ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.duresa commonwealth edison,d.however,where a motion to reconsider raises a question of whether the trial court erred in its previous application of existing law,we review de novo the trial court determinations of legal issues.duresa,d at.
whether the trial court properly characterized national city motion to vacate as a section petition rather than a section e motion depends on whether the trial court may,judgment of foreclosure was a final order.section e of the code provides that the trial court may in its discretion,before final order or judgment,set aside any default,and may on motion filed within days after entry thereof set aside any final order or judgment.ilcs e west.meanwhile,section of the code governs a party request for relief from a final judgment where more than days have passed since entry of the final judgment.ilcs west.here,national city filed its motion to vacate the judgment of foreclosure on july,which was more than days after the trial court entry of the judgment of foreclosure.if the trial court judgment of foreclosure was a nonfinal order,then national city could properly move to vacate the order pursuant to section e even though more than days had passed since its entry.however,if the trial court judgment was indeed a final order,then national city could seek relief only through section of the code because more than days had passed since its entry.
as jp morgan correctly notes,our supreme court has stated that a judgment ordering the foreclosure of a mortgage is not final and appealable until the trial court enters an order approving the sale and directing the distribution.in re marriage of verdung.a judgment of foreclosure is not final and appealable because it does not dispose of all the issues between the parties and it does not terminate the litigation.marion metal roofing mark twain marine industries,d.the order confirming the sale,however,does conclusively establish the purchaser right to the property and gives final approval to the proposed distribution of the sale proceeds.margaretten martinez,d.accordingly,the order confirming the sale,rather than the judgment of foreclosure,is the final and appealable order in a foreclosure case.marion metal,d at.
however,a judgment of foreclosure is final and immediately appealable where it contains language pursuant to rule a a that there is no just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal.verdung,at,in re estate of yucis,d,wl plaza bank kappel,d,bell federal savings loan ass bank of ravenswood,d.in the instant case,the judgment of foreclosure contained a rule a finding that there was no just cause for delaying the enforcement of this judgment,or an appeal therefrom.in view of the authorities,we conclude that the trial court may,judgment of foreclosure was a final judgment.
in so holding,we reject national city argument that the judgment of foreclosure was not final because the trial court specifically reserved jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and to determine the amount due to jp morgan as a result of disbursements and receipts occurring prior to the sale.pursuant to section d of the illinois mortgage foreclosure law the foreclosure law,a mortgagee is entitled to reimbursement at the time of redemption for any additional expenses incurred after the judgment of foreclosure.ilcs d west.in view of the mortgagee statutory right to reimbursement,we do not believe that the trial court order retaining jurisdiction to oversee such reimbursement rendered its judgment of foreclosure nonfinal.whether it expresses it or not,the trial court always retains the statutory authority,following the entry of the judgment of foreclosure,to provide for such reimbursement.ilcs d west.therefore,despite the presence of this provision in the judgment of foreclosure,we conclude the trial court rule a finding rendered the judgment final and appealable.see verdung,at,plaza bank,d at.
in light of our conclusion that the may,judgment of foreclosure was a final judgment,and given that national city motion to vacate was filed more than days after the entry of the final judgment,the trial court properly considered the motion as one seeking relief pursuant to section of the code.we thus turn to consider whether national city was entitled to relief under section.as already noted,section provides a statutory procedure to seek relief from final judgments after days from the entry thereof.ilcs west.to be entitled to relief under section,the petitioner must affirmatively set forth specific factual allegations supporting each of the following elements the existence of a meritorious defense or claim due diligence in presenting this defense or claim to the circuit court in the original action and due diligence in filing the section petition for relief.smith airoom.the quantum of proof necessary to sustain a section petition is a preponderance of the evidence.smith,at.whether a section petition should be granted lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,depending on the facts and equities presented.smith,at.
based on our review of the record,we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined on reconsideration that national city was not entitled to relief under section.even if national city had a meritorious defense to jp morgan action,the record plainly establishes that national city did not exercise due diligence in presenting its defense to the trial court.due diligence under section requires the petitioner to have a reasonable excuse for failing to act within the appropriate time.smith,at.section does not relieve the consequences of a litigant own mistake or negligence,and a litigant is not entitled to relief unless he shows that through no fault or negligence of his own,the error of fact or the existence of a valid defense was not made to appear to the trial court.smith,at,quoting brockmeyer duncan.the litigant must show that the failure to defend against the action was the result of an excusable mistake and that under the circumstance he acted reasonably,and not negligently,when he failed to initially resist the judgment.smith,at.
here,the record reflects that jp morgan properly served national city with a summons and a copy of its complaint on february,by leaving a copy with its registered agent,ct corporation.additionally,jp morgan continued to send national city notices of the proceedings,including a notice of its motion for the entry of a judgment of foreclosure,a notice of the foreclosure sale,and a notice of its motion to confirm the foreclosure sale.national city does not deny that the summons and other notices were received by its registered agent.despite receiving proper notice of the proceedings,national city did not appear in court to defend the action until july.by this time,the trial court had already entered a judgment of foreclosure and the foreclosure sale had already occurred.the only explanation that national city offered for its untimely appearance in the case was that the appropriate personnel of national city did not become aware of the exparte judgment entered by default or of the judgment of foreclosure until on or about july,when national city received a motion to confirm sale.such an explanation is insuffic
