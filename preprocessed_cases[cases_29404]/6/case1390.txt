law office of david stern,stern seeks review of the fourth district court of appeal decision in security national servicing law office of david stern,so d dca,on the ground that it expressly and directly conflicts with three decisions of this court,cowan liebowitz latman,kaplan,so d,kpmg peat marwick national union fire insurance of pittsburgh,so d,and forgione dennis pirtle agency,so d.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
this case involves a legal malpractice claim arising out of an attempted mortgage foreclosure.briefly,security national alleges that stern committed legal malpractice by filing an untimely foreclosure action and by voluntarily dismissing a previously filed,timely foreclosure action on the same mortgage.this blunder apparently occurred because stern,having realized its error in filing the untimely action,intended to dismiss it but instead dismissed the timely foreclosure action by mistake.stern continued to prosecute the untimely foreclosure action,and the trial court entered summary judgment against it.meanwhile,the mortgage and note were assigned several times before security national finally acquired them during the appeal in the foreclosure action.security national retained stern as counsel to represent its interests in the appeal.ultimately,the second district affirmed the trial court decision on appeal.
subsequently,security national brought a legal malpractice action against stern,claiming to have standing either by virtue of its relationship with stern or as the assignee of the mortgage and note involved in the underlying foreclosure action.the trial court entered summary judgment against security national,but the fourth district reversed.the fourth district held that security national has standing to sue stern as the assignee of the mortgage and note.see stern,so d at.
now stern seeks review by this court of the fourth district decision.for the reasons stated,we conclude that security national lacks standing to sue stern for legal malpractice either by relationship or by assignment.therefore,we quash the decision below.
factual and procedural background 
the fourth district described the facts of this case as follows 
this legal malpractice action arises out of a botched mortgage foreclosure.security national is the transferee of the underlying note and mortgage 
in,the holder of the note and mortgage,timely filed a mortgage foreclosure action.while that action was pending,assigned the loan to emc mortgage.emc hired stern to foreclose the loan.stern filed a second foreclosure action on the same note and mortgage on december.by this time,the statute of limitations had already expired,so that this foreclosure action was untimely.
on february,stern substituted as counsel in the timely foreclosure suit,then five days later voluntarily dismissed that timely action,leaving only the untimely action intact.stern essentially admits that this was malpractice.
on august,emc assigned the loan to universal portfolio buyers,universal.stern continued on as universal counsel in the untimely action.on october,universal assigned the loan to north american mortgage north american.stern remained as north american counsel in the action.
on july,the owner of the encumbered property moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.on november,the trial court entered summary judgment for the defendant.north american appealed.
on april,while the appeal was pending,north american assigned the loan to security national.the record does not reflect whether there was consideration for this transfer or whether security national had knowledge of the status of the foreclosure at the time.thereafter,stern remained as counsel representing security national,but only for a month or two.
on december,the second district affirmed the final judgment.on november,security national brought this legal malpractice action against stern.the complaint alleges negligence in dismissing the timely action at the time emc owned the loan and in failing to timely move to reinstate the action until after the motion for summary judgment was filed potentially spanning the ownership of emc,universal,and north american.
although the trial court stated in her order that she may take issue with the fairness of such ruling,she felt bound to enter summary judgment on stern behalf because there was no relationship between stern and security national at the time the cause of action accrued.
stern,so d at citation omitted.on appeal,the fourth district reversed,holding that under this court decision in kaplan,security national received a valid assignment of the legal malpractice claim against stern.the fourth district reasoned that the malpractice action was transferred incident to the transfer of the note and mortgage,stern,so d at,and that the assignment in question did not implicate relevant policy concerns against legal malpractice assignments.see id.at.
on february,stern filed a notice to invoke this court discretionary jurisdiction.stern claims that the fourth district misapplied and improperly extended our holding in kaplan,which was expressly limited to the particular facts of that case.stern argues that security national does not have standing either by its relationship with stern or by an implied general assignment of the malpractice claim.we address both of these issues in turn.as stated earlier,we ultimately determine that security national does not have standing to sue stern for the legal malpractice it alleges.
standing by relationship 
the fourth district properly concluded that security national relationship with stern did not give it standing to bring a legal malpractice action based upon acts that occurred during stern representation of a prior holder of the note and mortgage.as the fourth district explained 
a legal malpractice action has three elements the attorney employment the attorney neglect of a reasonable duty and the attorney negligence as the proximate cause of loss to the client.see kates robinson,so d,dca.for statute of limitations purposes,a cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue until the underlying adverse judgment becomes final,including exhaustion of appellate rights.see silvestrone edell,so d.that is the first point at which there is a redressable harm.id.at.until then,a malpractice claim is hypothetical and damages are speculative.see also hold manzini,so d,dca mere knowledge of possible malpractice is not dispositive of when a malpractice action accrues.security national points to this law and argues that because it owned the loan by the time the appeal was completed and the cause of action accrued,the law regarding the assignment of legal malpractice claims is irrelevant.simply put,it claims that it was the owner of the loan at the critical point in time.
by contrast,stern points to language from our decision in kates,so d at 
in stating a claim for legal malpractice,it is not sufficient merely to assert an relationship.the plaintiff must also allege that a relationship existed between the parties with respect to the acts or omissions upon which the malpractice claim is based.
see also maillard dowdell,so d dca.these cases rejected attempts by former clients to retroactively expand the scope of the attorney representation.while they are factually different,the basic point seems sound the time of the alleged negligent act or omission is the critical point for testing the scope and existence of the relationship.
stern,so d at.we agree with the fourth district conclusion.security national did not gain standing to sue stern for prior acts of legal malpractice by forming an relationship with stern during the appeal of the underlying foreclosure action.therefore,we approve the fourth district conclusion on this issue.however,as explained below,we disagree with the fourth district extension of kaplan into the context of general assignments of notes and mortgages.
standing by assignment 
we disapprove of the fourth district decision and conclude that security national did not receive a valid assignment of the right to sue stern for legal malpractice.first,in kaplan,we did not adopt the minority,approach regarding the assignment of legal malpractice claims.we continued to adhere to the majority view that legal malpractice claims are generally not assignable.second,the fourth district reliance on kaplan is further misplaced because the facts in stern are significantly different from those in kaplan.third,the relevant policy considerations in cases such as this weigh against recognizing the assignment of a legal malpractice claim in a general assignment of a note and mortgage.we address each of these reasons in order.
first,the fourth district misinterpreted our holding in kaplan as an abandonment of the majority view which generally prohibits legal malpractice assignments in favor of the minority,approach,which permits all legal malpractice assignments that do not violate relevant policy principles.as we explained in kaplan,a majority of the states that have examined this issue,including florida,have held that legal malpractice claims are generally not assignable a minority of jurisdictions allows assignment of legal malpractice claims.so d at see also kpmg,so d at l egal malpractice claims are not assignable because of the personal nature of legal services which involve a confidential,fiduciary relationship of the very highest character,with an undivided duty of loyalty owed to the client.forgione,so d at quoting washington fireman fund ins,so d,dca florida law views legal malpractice as a personal tort which can not be assigned because of the personal nature of legal services which involve highly confidential relationships.the fourth district read kaplan as follows 
the significance of kaplan is not a narrow point pertaining to the privilege,but rather the more broad view that the door is now open to assignment of legal malpractice actions in exceptional cases which do not fully implicate the core policy concerns underlying the general rule.
stern,so d at emphasis added.contrary to the fourth district interpretation,the significance of kaplan was indeed the narrow point pertaining to privilege.kaplan was not intended to proclaim that the door is now open to assignment of legal malpractice actions in exceptional cases.
kaplan was the first and only case in which this court permitted a limited exception to the general prohibition on legal malpractice assignments,and our holding was confined to the specific facts and circumstances of that case.specifically,kaplan involved the following facts 
medical research industries,mri,a florida corporation,developed and marketed homeopathic medical products.to raise money for capital improvements,mri decided to issue a private placement of shares in the company.mri majority shareholder,william tishman,consulted attorneys who prepared private placement memoranda.through four private placements between and,mri raised over million from about shareholders.later,tishman borrowed about million in unsecured loans from mri,leading to its eventual insolvency.mri sued tishman to recover the loan amount and obtained a judgment.unable to satisfy the judgment,however,mri executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors to donald kaplan.kaplan then sued for legal malpractice the attorneys who prepared the private placement memoranda.the trial court granted the attorneys motions to dismiss,concluding that legal malpractice claims are personal and not assignable and are exempt from levy and sale under an execution of assignment.
so d at footnote omitted.the trial court dismissed the action,concluding that legal malpractice actions are not assignable.on appeal,the third district reversed,holding that the legal services at issue in kaplan were not personal in nature but rather involved the publication of corporate information to third parties.subsequently,we approved the third district holding and receded from broad dicta in forgione and kpmg,which purported to prohibit the assignment of all legal malpractice claims.see kaplan,so d at see also kpmg,so d at forgione,so d at.in reaching our conclusion,we compared lawyers preparing private placement memoranda to independent auditors as in kpmg,and reasoned that both types of professionals owe professional duties to intended third parties who rely on the statements contained in their published documents.we permitted the assignment of the legal malpractice claim because the information prepared in kaplan was intended for release to third parties,and,therefore,the assignment did not violate confidentiality.however,we stressed that the vast majority of legal malpractice claims remain unassignable because in most cases the lawyer duty is to the client.kaplan,so d at emphasis added.
thus,in kaplan we reaffirmed our adherence to the majority view that most legal malpractice claims are nonassignable.in so doing,we necessarily rejected the minority,approach of evaluating whether particular assignments violate public policy concerns.we do so again in this case.
second,we also disapprove of the fourth district reliance on kaplan because the factual circumstances in stern are not analogous to those in kaplan.in kaplan,t he attorneys owed a duty to the public when advising mri and preparing the private placement memoranda.kaplan,so d at.we explained that attorneys preparing private or public placement memoranda act not just for the corporation benefit,but for the benefit of all those who rely on the representations in their this case,potential shareholders.id.at emphasis added.unlike the attorneys in kaplan,stern did not perform legal work for emc with the intention of directly benefiting security national or any other third party.indeed,at the time stern filed the untimely foreclosure action and voluntarily dismissed the timely foreclosure action,the duty stern owed was solely to its client at the time,emc.
kaplan also differs from stern in that the assignment of the legal malpractice claim in kaplan was express,whereas security national asserts an implied assignment of the legal malpractice claim through the general assignment of the note and mortgage.we find that the right to bring an action against stern for legal malpractice is not one of the rights security national acquired when it purchased the note and mortgage by general assignment.first,we note 
as a general rule,the assignee of a nonnegotiable instrument takes it with all the rights of the assignor,and subject to all the equities and defenses of the debtor connected with or growing out of the obligation that the obligor had against the assignor at the time of the assignment.
state family bank of hallandale,so d,dca citing dickerson,federal deposit ins,so d,dca guaranty mortgage ins.harris,so d,dca,rev on other grounds,so d see also rose teitler,so d dca.whereas the general assignment of a note and mortgage conveys to the assignee the rights of the assignor under the note and mortgage subject to the equities and defenses of the obligor,such an assignment does not implicitly assign the relationship between the assignor and his attorney.as we have stressed before,the real basis and substance of the malpractice suit is a breach of the duties within the personal relationship between the attorney and client.forgione,so d at emphasis added quoting christison jones,d.
in stern,the legal malpractice claim arose from the personal relationship established when emc hired stern to enforce its rights under the note and mortgage.this relationship was not inherent in those instruments themselves.in other words,the right to sue for legal malpractice is not connected with or growing out of the relationship between the mortgagor and mortgagee rather,the legal malpractice claim is connected to and grows out of the separately established relationship between the attorney and the client.see family bank of hallandale,so d at.
third,we disapprove of the fourth district decision below because the relevant policy concerns weigh against permitting legal malpractice assignments.as we noted in kaplan,the following passage from california second district court of appeal well explains the policies against legal malpractice assignments 
it is the unique quality of legal services,the personal nature of the attorney duty to the client and the confidentiality of the relationship that invoke public policy considerations in our conclusion that malpractice claims should not be subject to assignment.the assignment of such claims could relegate the legal malpractice action to the market place and convert it to a commodity to be exploited and transferred to economic bidders who have never had a professional relationship with the attorney and to whom the attorney has never owed a legal duty the commercial aspect of assignability of legal malpractice actions is rife with probabilities that could only debase the legal profession.the almost certain end result of merchandizing such causes of action is the lucrative business of factoring malpractice claims which would encourage unjustified lawsuits against members of the legal profession,generate an increase in legal malpractice litigation,promote champerty and force attorneys to defend themselves against strangers.the endless complications and litigious intricacies arising out of such commercial activities would place an undue burden on not only the legal profession but the already overburdened judicial system,restrict the availability of competent legal services,embarrass the relationship and imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.
kaplan,so d at quoting goodley wank wank,d.in essence,the two major policy concerns justifying a general prohibition against the assignment of legal malpractice claims are protecting confidences and preventing a market for legal malpractice claims.the fourth district determined that these policy concerns were not present in stern.
as to the first policy concern,the fourth district reasoned that t he case does not involve personal services.it also seems unlikely that emc or north american shared privileged information with stern.see stern,so d at.given the complete absence of any record support for this reasoning,it is rather speculative.we are unwilling to presume that stern relationships with emc and north american did not involve personal services or that confidential information was not disclosed.likewise,we also are unwilling to determine,as the fourth district necessarily did,that emc impliedly waived the privilege when it conveyed the note and mortgage by general assignment.see id.at.finding such an implied waiver in the general assignment of a note and mortgage would permit numerous unforeseen assignees downstream to have access to the original assignor confidential information and would expose the assignor attorney to virtually limitless liability to parties with whom the attorney never owed a professional duty.see kaplan,so d at citing goodley.at.
we also disagree with the fourth district conclusion that permitting legal malpractice assignments in this context would not tend to create a marketplace for legal malpractice claims.to the contrary,this is precisely the type of transaction that our precedent warns against.see kaplan,so d at kpmg,so d at forgione,so d at.recognizing legal malpractice assignments under these circumstances would create an incentive for both holders of such impaired instruments and speculators to market these notes and mortgages with the right to sue the attorney in the failed foreclosure action included as a major factor in pricing the transaction.as stated earlier,this would expose attorneys to liability to parties who had no connection to the underlying foreclosure action,never had a professional relationship with the attorney and to whom the attorney has never owed a legal duty.kaplan,so d at quoting goodley.at.permitting such a market to arise would create an undue burden on not only the legal profession but the already overburdened judicial system,restrict the availability of competent legal services,embarrass the relationship and imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.id.quoting goodley.at.
in short,the assignment of legal malpractice claims that arise in mortgage foreclosures violates the two policy concerns underlying the general prohibition against such assignment.
conclusion 
for the reasons expressed above,we quash the fourth district decision and hold that security national does not have standing to bring an action against stern for legal malpractice either through an relationship or by general assignment.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully disagree with the holding of the majority that the assignment of the legal malpractice claim in the instant matter was not permissible under our previous decision in cowan liebowitz latman,kaplan,so d.although i dissented in kaplan and disagree with the analysis it presents,it is now the law of florida.i am of the opinion that the fourth district below correctly followed kaplan and concluded that the assignment was permissible under the reasoning of this court in kaplan.see sec.servicing law office of david stern,so d,dca.therefore,i concur in result only based on my continued belief,as expressed in my concurring in result only opinion in kaplan,that the decision of this court in kaplan was overly broad and violated the principle in this state that legal malpractice claims are not assignable.see kaplan,so d at lewis,concurring in result only i can not subscribe to the broad reasoning employed by the majority and its unnecessary reliance on broad concepts of general assignability that i believe to be inapplicable to the instant matter.
contrary to the assertions of the majority,the decision of this court in kaplan was not confined to the specific facts and circumstances of that case.majority op.at.instead,the kaplan decision established factors to be applied to permit the assignment of legal malpractice claims in situations where the legal services provided by the attorney are not personal in nature and therefore do not involve any confidential communications that would trigger the policy concern of protecting the privilege,which generally justifies the prohibition against the assignment of legal malpractice claims.see kaplan,so d at permitting the assignment of a legal malpractice claim where t he claim does not involve personal services or implicate confidentiality concerns.it is now too late for this court to close the proverbial barn door by asserting that the kaplan decision was limited only to the specific facts presented in that case without receding from that decision.
in the instant matter,as in kaplan,the legal services provided were not personal in nature.see id.at.a mortgage foreclosure action requires only that the claimant be the owner and holder of the note and mortgage and that the mortgagee has defaulted on that note and mortgage.see chemical residential mortgage rector,so d,dca.in such actions,an attorney duty is to the client only to the extent that the client is the owner and holder of the note and mortgage.the benefit or detriment of any actions taken by the attorney with regard to the foreclosure will clearly flow to any subsequent holders,and,accordingly,subsequent holders should be permitted to hold the attorney accountable for malpractice with regard to the foreclosure action if the kaplan analytical factors are applied.similar to the preparation of the private placement memoranda in kaplan,an attorney filing a foreclosure action acts for the benefit of not only the present client,but also any subsequent holder of the mortgage and note,who will rely on the representations contained in those documents.
additionally,upon application of the underlying principles of kaplan,the policy concerns that generally militate against permitting the assignment of legal malpractice claims are not present in the instant matter.as noted above,a foreclosure action requires only the mortgage and note,as well as a determination of whether the mortgagee has defaulted.see chemical,so d at.there is absolutely no reason to believe or assume that an attorney undertaking such an action will obtain confidential information from a client that would be protected under the privilege.the assertion of the majority that the fourth district position that no privileged information with regard to the foreclosure action
