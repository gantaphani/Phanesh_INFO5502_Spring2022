before the court is an interlocutory appeal of the district court denial of summary judgment to jefferson dental.we reverse in part and remand to the district court.
facts and proceedings 
jefferson dental employs approximately people.four female former employees of jefferson dental filed charges of discrimination with both the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the texas commission on human rights tchr alleging violations of title vii and the corresponding texas labor code provisions.specifically,three of them alleged that their supervisor had made sexual comments and had inappropriately touched them.the fourth charging party witnessed much of this behavior.seventeen days after making the charge to the eeoc,these four charging parties filed a state court action against jefferson dental,its president,and one of its former employees.in this suit,the charging parties did not raise any statutory claims but instead brought tort claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent retention,and wrongful discharge.while discovery in the state court case was progressing,the eeoc filed an action in federal court seeking monetary and injunctive relief.one of the other state court defendants moved for a plea in abatement in the state court case,which jefferson dental joined.the charging parties,however,opposed this plea.the state court agreed and scheduled a trial.prior to the state court trial,the parties attended a mediation session.eeoc lawyers attended the session,which did not result in a settlement.eeoc lawyers also attended the trial and communicated with the lawyers for the charging parties.after the state court trial,the court entered a judgment in favor of jefferson dental the four charging parties took nothing.
in the middle of the state court trial,the eeoc responded to discovery requests from jefferson dental in the federal case and objected to production of some of the documents.these documents,the eeoc argued,were correspondence with the charging parties attorneys and were protected by virtue of joint representation,the work product privilege,and the privilege.the eeoc made similar objections to discovery on occasions.the eeoc also objected to discovery on privacy grounds on behalf of the charging parties.
after losing the state court case,the charging parties moved to intervene in the eeoc federal case.jefferson dental opposed the motion.jefferson dental also moved for summary judgment on all of the eeoc claims,arguing that they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the district court denied the charging parties motion to intervene but also denied jefferson dental motion for summary judgment on the basis that the eeoc was not in privity with the charging parties and that,therefore,res judicata could not apply.the district court acknowledged that its decision permitted the parties to indirectly receiv e a second bite at the apple,which they could not accomplish directly,permitted an interlocutory appeal under b,and stayed the proceedings.this court granted leave for jefferson dental to appeal the order.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews the res judicata effect of a prior state court judgment de novo.see schmueser burkburnett bank,cir.the district court denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see easter powell,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.shell offshore babbitt,cir quoting.c.
iii.discussion 
jefferson dental argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because,under texas law,the eeoc claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the judgment in the charging parties case is a final texas state court judgment.federal courts give a texas state court judgment the preclusive effect it would be given under texas law.ellis amex life ins,cir citing hogue royse city,cir.
under texas law,a party seeking to have an action dismissed on the basis of res judicata must establish the presence of three things a prior final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction identity of parties or those in privity with them and a second action based on the same claims as were raised or could have been raised in the first action.amstadt brass.the scope of res judicata is not limited to matters actually litigated the judgment in the first suit precludes a second action by the parties and their privies not only on matters actually litigated,but also on causes of action or defenses which arise out of the same subject matter and which might have been litigated in the first suit.barr resolution trust.the eeoc does not dispute that the state court judgment satisfies the first element.because the district court determined that the eeoc and the charging parties were not in privity,thereby adjudicating the second element against a finding of res judicata,it did not reach the third element.
as to the second element,the application of res judicata to suits by those in privity with a prior party exists to ensure that a defendant is not twice vexed for the same acts,and to achieve judicial economy by precluding those who have had a fair trial from relitigating claims.amstadt,at.the texas courts have been clear that there is no categorical rule for privity instead the courts look to the circumstances of each case.getty oil ins.of,there are at least three ways in which parties can be in privity under texas law they can control an action even if they are not parties to it their interests can be represented by a party to the action or they can be successors in interest,deriving their claims through a party to the prior action.amstadt,at.
jefferson dental position is that the eeoc suit is barred by res judicata because the eeoc raised objections on behalf of the charging parties and alleged an relationship with the charging parties in the federal case,thus exhibiting control the eeoc participated in the mediation and trial of the charging parties claims in state court,thus exhibiting control and the federal suit uses the same factual basis as the state court suit,indicating representation of the eeoc interests at the state court trial.
jefferson dental argues that two types of actions taken by the eeoc indicate that the eeoc controlled the charging parties litigation.under texas law,i n determining whether privity exists through control over a prior action,the courts have focused on whether an individual actively and openly participated in the prior proceedings to such an extent that it was clear that the individual had the right to direct them.maxson travis county rent account,superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in rice louis williams.m ere participation in a prior trial does not suffice to bar the participant on principles of res judicata,nor does knowledge of an ongoing trial.brown zimmerman,see also state farm lloyds,holding that being copied on letters,attending depositions,and discussing available defenses are insufficient bases to establish privity.
evidentiary objections 
jefferson dental argues that the eeoc asserted an privilege with the charging parties and that therefore privity exists because u nder texas law,there is no relationship absent a showing of privity.banc one capital partners kneipper,cir.jefferson dental assertion of privilege during the federal case,however,does not indicate control of the state case.see brown,at noting that participation does not equal control.
jefferson dental also argues for privity on the basis that the eeoc raised privacy objections on behalf of the charging parties during discovery.again,invoking this privilege in the federal action does not create privity.doing so does not indicate control to such an extent that it was clear that the eeoc had the right to direct the state court case.maxson,at.
participation at mediation and trial 
jefferson dental stresses that the eeoc attendance at the mediation in the state case,including giving a statement,and attendance at the trial,including consultation with the charging parties lawyers,establish privity.the eeoc role in the charg
