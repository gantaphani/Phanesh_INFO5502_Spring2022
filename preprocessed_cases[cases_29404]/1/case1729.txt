the united states seeks false claims penalties from the owners of an apartment project for falsely certifying that the property was decent,safe,and sanitary in requesting supplemental rent payments funded under section of the united states housing act the district court granted summary judgment for the owners and a panel of this court remanded for trial those decisions addressed the materiality of the allegedly false certifications and the issue whether the owners knowingly submitted false claims.we do not reach those questions because we hold that,on this record,no false claims were made.we therefore affirm the judgment for the owners.
background 
the national housing act of was enacted to encourage private industry to provide housing for families it authorizes the department of housing and urban development hud to guarantee private mortgage loans to construct new housing and rehabilitate old structures for families with incomes so low that they could not otherwise decently house themselves.private property owners receiving the nonrecourse mortgages must enter into a regulatory agreement with hud which specifies rents,charges,and other methods of operation,in such form and in such manner as in the opinion of the secretary of hud will effectuate the purposes of this section in,the united states housing was enacted to provide housing by making payments directly to local housing authorities.section was added to this act in to authorize the making of assistance payments to encourage private property owners to provide housing the amount of these assistance payments made directly to the private property owners in the form of a subsidy is determined by what the tenants can afford to pay,and what the private property owner could otherwise expect to charge under the prevailing market rates to receive assistance payments the property owner must enter into a housing assistance payment contract hap contract 
in,thad mclaurin,charles taylor,and arthur doty the owners executed an agreement called the regulatory agreement for insured housing projects with section housing assistance payment contracts the regulatory agreement.under this agreement,hud promised to guarantee the owners obligation under the mortgage used to purchase an abandoned apartment jackson also to subsidize tenants rent payments in accordance with a hap contract.the owners,in turn,agreed to substantially rehabilitate the property and to keep it in good repair and condition.the property was rehabilitated using the proceeds of a million nonrecourse mortgage loan guaranteed by the united states.the owners invested of their own funds in the project.
under the hap contract,the owners agreed to maintain the property to provide decent,safe,and sanitary housing.the contract also required that the owners make monthly requests for housing assistance payments.in each a hap voucher the owners were required to give the details of occupied apartments and the supplemental rental payments due,and certify that to the best of their knowledge and belief i the dwelling units are in decent,safe,and sanitary condition,and ii all other facts and dates on which the request for funds is based are true and correct 
both the regulatory agreement and the hap contract explained hud remedies if the owners failed to comply with the contracts terms.the regulatory agreement stated that upon violation of any of its parts hud may give written notice of such violation.if the owners failed to take corrective action,hud was authorized to declare a default,and,among other things,to request that the mortgagee bank declare the owners note due and foreclose on the property.the hap contract required that hud inspect the property at least once a year to see that the owners were maintaining the units in decent,safe,and sanitary condition.in the event that hud notified the owners in writing that the property was not in decent,safe,and sanitary condition,and the owners thereafter failed to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice,hud was authorized to exercise any of its rights and remedies under the contract,including the abatement of housing assistance payments.
from until the owners submitted hap vouchers in accordance with the hap contract and hud paid the vouchers.up until the record does not indicate that the property ever failed to pass hud yearly inspections.but by the property was deteriorating and had become the center of criminal activity.in august the property received a below average rating during hud yearly inspection.the report stated that repair and maintenance in many areas was urgently needed,and noted that the property,like many in its area,was experiencing a problem with illegal drug activity.hud letter advising the owners of the results of this inspection requested that the owners respond in writing to the deficiencies noted and include a detailed explanation of their planned corrective measures.
in august hud undertook both a management review and a physical inspection.the management received a satisfactory rating and the report stated that m anagement is to be commended for the steps taken and planned to provide a more secure environment for the residents.however,as a result of the physical inspection,hud gave the property a below average rating.the report stated that many of the deficiencies noted in had not been corrected.of the units inspected,all but two needed immediate repairs,although each unit was deemed passable under hud housing quality standards.the report detailed numerous corrective actions required and,for each,listed an estimated cost and time frame for correction.several months later hud wrote,it is understood that funds are not readily available for repairs,but asked that the owners be mindful of the safety of tenants and workers and that hazardous deficiencies be addressed as soon as possible.
after,the owners devoted all rental income and subsidies to mortgage payments and property maintenance and repairs.they took no further distributions for return on their investment in the property.
in the property was rated below average for the third time,and all of the inspected units failed to meet hud housing quality standards.again,corrective action was prescribed with an estimated cost and time frame for each.many of the deficiencies were the same as those in and.the report warned that if the property was not brought into compliance within days further subsidy payments may be jeopardized.hud letter transmitting the report to the owners warned them that t he department does not allow management to continue at this level of performance.
in late hud gave the property the lowest rating unsatisfactory.the report said there were compelling reasons for this rating,including the fact that every inspected unit failed to comply with hud housing quality standards.the report again cataloged the property deficiencies and,for each,listed the necessary corrective action along with an estimated cost and time frame.the report also noted,however,that the property staff were very cooperative throughout the physical inspection.the letter that accompanied this report stated that the property could not continue to operate in its present condition,and that failure to make corrections could result in the denial of future participation in housing programs.however,in another letter hud wrote,among other things,we look forward to working with you in an attempt to bring this property back to satisfactory condition.
hud last inspection was in may.for the second time hud gave the property an unsatisfactory rating.hud again cataloged each of the property deficiencies and advised the owners that t he department does not allow management to continue at this level of performance.in august,the owners wrote that they were discontinuing mortgage payments due to lack of funds,and that the property was being turned over to hud.they offered to manage the property for no charge until control could be transferred.the owners managed the property without compensation until after the property was auctioned in july.
the united states initiated this proceeding on august.the united states claims that the owners violated the civil false claims act because hap vouchers they submitted between july and january falsely certified that the property was decent,safe,and sanitary the united states argues that each certification constitutes a false claim for payment or approval within the meaning of a,and also a false statement record within the meaning of a.the certifications had been used to secure in housing subsides,and because the united states claimed that the certifications were knowingly false when made,it sought treble damages,for a total of about million.
discussion 
the civil false claims act,in relevant part states 
a liability for certain person who 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or 
knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 
is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person 
as the preceding statutory text shows,and as the name of the act suggests,the act is aimed at false claims.the statute defines a claim as any request or demand,whether under a contract or otherwise,for money or property which is made to the government will at least in part use government money or property to pay it.stated differently,it is a request or demand made in connection with a contract or otherwise,the contract or otherwise allegedly warranting the making of the claim.thus,whether a claim is valid depends on the contract,regulation,or statute that supposedly warrants it.it is only those claims for money or property to which a defendant is not entitled that are false for purposes of the false claims act.see costner urs consultants,cir o nly those actions by the claimant calculated to caus e the united states to pay out money it is not obligated to pay are properly considered claims within the meaning of the fca.united states ex rel.wilkins am.constr,d,collecting authorities for the proposition that a false claim is a claim for more than one is due.
in this case unless the owners submitted claims for money to which they were not entitled no false claims act liability arises.although a prohibits the submission of a false record or statement,it does so only when the submission of the record or statement was done in an attempt to get a false claim paid.there is no liability under this act for a false statement unless it is used to get false claim paid 
when we apply this law to the hap contract and the course of conduct between hud and the owners,we conclude upon this record that the owners were entitled to the housing assistance payments sought and,thus,they made no false claims.
the contract 
decent,safe,and sanitary is a meaningful and useful description of homes and apartment houses,but it is not precise or measurable.there will be wide difference of opinion of what is,and what is not,decent,safe,or sanitary.just look at the current attire of people in our society to see the variations in notions of decency.consider the plight of an owner who could be subject to false claims act liability by certifying that his apartments are decent,safe,and sanitary when on any given day a united states attorney could decide to the contrary,and perhaps ultimately convince a jury to agree.that owner would be forced to walk away from the property at an early sign of deterioration.if no one else were willing to incur the risk of false claims act liability,tenants would lose their housing.that state of affairs would be unacceptable to all parties and wholly inconsistent with federal housing policy.
furthermore,if enforcement of the condition of the property were left to false claims act sanctions,consider the burden of the attorney who must prove that the owner has knowingly certified falsely.it would not suffice that government employees,or even jurors,describe the property as less than decent.the burden would be to prove the state of mind of the owner that he knew he could not honestly describe the property as decent,safe,and sanitary.
fortunately for everyone,these problems are avoided by the terms of this contract between the owners and hud where the mechanism is spelled out for controlling the abatement of the payments,and the entitlement of the owners,when the condition of the property deteriorates.
section to the hap contract,in relevant part,provides as follows 
units not decent,safe,and sanitary.if the government notifies the owner that he has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in decent,safe,and sanitary condition and the owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice,the government may exercise any of its rights under the contract,including the abatement of housing assistance payments,even if the family continues to occupy that unit.if,however,the family wishes to be rehoused in another dwelling unit with section assistance and the government does not have other section funds for such purposes,the government may use the abated housing assistance payments for the purpose of rehousing the family in another dwelling unit.where this is done,the owner shall be notified that he will be entitled to resumption of housing assistance payments for the vacated units if the unit is restored to decent,safe,and sanitary condition,the family is willing to and does move back into the restored unit,and a deduction is made for the expenses incurred by the family for both moves.
notification of abatement.any abatement of housing assistance payments shall be effective as provided in written notification to the owner.the government shall promptly notify the family of any such abatement.
thus,according to the hap contract,if the property is not decent,safe,and sanitary and hud chooses to work with the owners to remedy the property condition,the owners remain entitled to housing assistance payments until hud provides written notice,prescribes a time for corrective action,and notifies the owners that they have failed to take the necessary corrective action within the specified time period 
the united states does not contend that an abatement of payment by hud was ever exercised.the central position of the united states in this litigation has been that the claims for housing assistance payments submitted by the owners during the period covered by the complaint,july through january,were false claims,claims for payments to which the owners were not entitled,because during this period the owners were in breach of their obligation under the hap contract to provide decent,safe,and sanitary housing.what this ignores is that the hap contract explicitly addresses a breach of this nature and provides a specific remedy when the owners are notified by hud that they have failed to maintain the property in decent,safe,and sanitary condition and that corrective action must be taken within the time specified in the notice,the owners continue to be entitled to receive housing assistance payments during the corrective action period and until hud notifies them in writing that they have failed to take the necessary corrective action and that housing assistance payments will be abated.during the corrective action period,then,claims for housing assistance payments are not false claims because they are claims for money to which the owners are entitled and which provide the wherewithal both to operate the property and to take the necessary corrective actions.
course of conduct 
the exchanges and conduct of the parties demonstrated that housing assistance payments continued in an effort to keep the apartments habitable and to provide the means to take the corrective action requested by hud.during the period of time covered by the complaint,july through january,there was significant evidence that the property was increasingly uninhabitable,and that hud had concluded that the property had fallen below the decent,safe,and sanitary standard.at the same time,hud was willing to work with the owners to continue with their efforts to bring the property back into compliance.moreover,hud seemed to recognize that the property noncompliance was at least partially explained by a lack of funds and nearby criminal activity.in,perhaps recognizing the lack of funds for routine maintenance and repairs,hud asked the owners to at least address hazardous deficiencies that presented a danger to the safety of tenants and workers.in,following the property receipt of its lowest rating to date,hud wrote that it was look ing forward to working with you in an attempt to bring this property back to satisfactory condition.
the undisputed conduct and exchanges by and between the parties during this entire period demonstrates,not only that the vouchers were promptly paid,but that all parties regarded them as entitled to be paid.
conclusion 
we hold that under the hap contract and on this record the owners were entitled to receive the housing assistance payments that they sought during the corrective action period at issue.their claims therefore can not be false under the false claims act as a matter of law.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i am delighted that the entire court has seen fit to deliver the owners of the jackson square apartments from further exposure to false claims act liability.one may readily infer from the majority holding that this is a case that should never have been brought.
nevertheless,i am uncomfortable with the majority rationale that excludes the parties dealings from the false claims act solely because of hud contract provisions.this theory was never presented to the district court,was not ruled upon by it,and was never briefed to this counsel were ordered to submit letter briefs less than a week before en banc oral argument.as a matter of prudence and judicial restraint,and under this court authorities,we almost never decide cases on issues or theories that were not litigated in the trial court.united states brace,cir en banc en banc court declined to consider en banc an issue neither preserved in district court nor presented to appellate panel we review only those issues presented to us we do not craft new issues or search for them in the record in short,it is not for us to decide which issues should be presented,or to otherwise try the case for the parties.the court majority evidently believe this is such an exceptional case because their analysis affords a narrower basis for affirming the summary judgment.to my mind,whether excluding an entire category of hud contracts and contractual dealings from the false claims is narrower than applying defenses under the act to the facts before us is in the eye of the beholder.but in addition,the broader ramifications of the court unprecedented reasoning,which flows from standard contractual provisions of the sort that probably exist throughout the vast breadth of federal government contracting,are uncertain and have been utterly unexplored.
in my view,the preferable narrow resolution of this case is based on the issues raised and litigated in the district court concerning whether the owners falsely certified as decent,safe and sanitary a apartment project in jackson,mississippi in order to obtain hud subsidies i would affirm on alternative grounds based on the particular facts of this case.first,the defendants monthly certifications,included in their vouchers seeking reimbursement,were not material to hud decision to continue making subsidy payments,and they therefore did not constitute false statements to get a false claim paid.a.second,the defendants did not knowingly submit false claims for reimbursement because the government determined the amount of funds available to maintain the project,the defendants spent every penny of those funds on the project,and the government knew the project essential condition.b.the government got exactly what it was willing to pay for.
judge reavley opinion adequately states the facts.
the false claims act imposes liability on a ny person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or knowingly makes a false statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.a and.the statute,which dates from the civil war era with even older antecedents,was originally passed to prevent all types of fraud against the united states government that might result in financial loss.united states,d.the issues raised by the parties in this en banc court are the same as those pressed by the owners in the district court whether their monthly certifications that the project was decent,safe and sanitary were material to hud decision to keep subsidizing it and whether the owners knowingly filed false claims.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.boston old colony ins.tiner,cir.summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.turner houma mun.fire police civ.serv,cir quoting.c.
a.the payment vouchers were not material to hud s decision making.
because the panel opinion has been vacated by the order for rehearing en banc,there should no longer be any doubt that materiality is an element of a civil false claims act case.our past precedent and every circuit that has addressed the issue have so concluded this conclusion is strengthened in a case involving allegedly false certifications contained in official payment vouchers,because,for fca liability to arise,a false certification must be a false statement made to get a false claim paid.see a.the express connection of a false statement with getting a false claim paid is tantamount to requiring that the false statement be material to the payment decision.
the government is willing to concede,as it did not previously in this litigation,that materiality is an element of its cause of action upon which it carries the burden of proof.the government asserts,however,that whenever it conditions payment for services rendered upon a certification of certain conditions by the payee,a false certification constitutes a material false statement as a matter of law and renders the entire claim actionably false this position is overbroad and unsupported by relevant law.
the accepted definition of materiality for civil fca claims,as for other federal statutes,equates materiality with ha ving a natural tendency to influence,or being capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.kungys united states,d.the supreme court adopted this more general formulation of materiality,because the judgment in question of materiality does not lend itself to mechanical resolution.id.at.at.applying this test of materiality,three justices found kungys misstatements of his date and place of birth on his naturalization application not material because those statements were neither relevant to citizenship qualifications nor,if correctly reported,would they have led to other facts relevant to qualifications for citizenship.three other members of the court applied an even stricter standard of materiality.as kungys demonstrates,the determination of materiality is and sensitive to what the government accomplishes by means of requiring disclosure of certain information.
pursuant to kungys,many certifications made in order to receive government payments may be material to the government decision to pay,but such is not invariably the case.in thompson,this court reflected that reality when it stated that,to create liability under the fca,a false certification of compliance must be a prerequisite to obtaining a government benefit.thompson,at.where the facts demonstrate that an agency,though formally requiring a certification,did not condition payment on its veracity,and indeed,the responsible government officials did not even see or review the certification in question,then the certification is not material,and the certified statement will not give rise to fca liability.see,united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir certification of assurances that school district would comply with applicable federal law not a prerequisite,under facts of that case,to receipt of federal idea funds.further,were a court to hold that any kind of government certification required in connection with federal government payment and reimbursement vouchers is material as a matter of law,the government could erase the crucial distinction between punitive fca and ordinary breaches of contract by the simple expedient of requiring broad,boilerplate certifications.
the circumstances of this case demonstrate as a matter of law that the owners monthly certifications on their hap vouchers that the project was decent,safe and sanitary were not material to hud decisions to continue paying subsidies.
first,although it is clear that hud was aware of the basic condition of the project,hud never informed the owners that their project failed to meet the decent,safe and sanitary contractual standard.hud did not utilize the contractual procedure whereby hud was required to inform the owners of their noncompliance and to impose a suitable corrective action plan upon them.only if the owners failed to comply,after notice,could hud,as one of its possible remedies,contractually elect to discontinue housing assistance payments.the fact that hud never invoked any remedy against the owners and continued making the payments throughout the period covered by this lawsuit demonstrates the immateriality of the owners monthly certifications to payment of the vouchers.
second,it was hud normal practice,in keeping with the parties respective rights and obligations under the hap contract,to allow owners to continue to receive subsidies while the owners worked to correct deficiencies that hud had identified.indeed,it is evident from the proof that hud made housing assistance payments with the expectation that the would use those payments to bring their property up to standard.united states southland mgmt,d.the government acknowledged in the district court that hud often elects to continue payments for a particular property despite knowledge that the property,contrary to the owners hap voucher certification,does not meet hud decent,safe and sanitary standard,since the of work to the detriment of tenants.hud project manager vicki gross testified that she never stopped payments,on any of the projects for which she was responsible,because of noncompliance with the decent,safe and sanitary standard.since hud routinely made section housing assistance payments to owners of property irrespective of their compliance with the decent,safe and sanitary standard,the owners certifications were not material to hud decision to pay.
third,it is undisputed that all of the money received by the owners in rent payments and hud subsidies was applied to the mortgage the upkeep of the project from onward.since hud policies governed both the amount of rent charged to the tenants and the amount of monthly subsidies,hud determined the ultimate quality of the project.in this there is no evidence of the owners misapplication of funds or the project was not decent,safe and sanitary,hud control of the pursestrings led to that result.the owners were not required to invest their capital in the project.christopher.retsinas,cir.consequently,hud funding actions determined whether the owners certifications were material.
fourth,the government points to no evidence supporting its materiality position except the deposition of quinton lewis,a hud employee responsible for reviewing and approving the defendants and hundreds of other payment vouchers each month.lewis,however,testified only that he would not have approved the vouchers if the certifications had not been signed by the defendants or their agents.lewis also testified that he had not read the certification in any depth and had never heard of the phrase decent,safe and sanitary until the date of his deposition.as the district court observed,there is nothing in the record to show that lewis,or anyone else with hud,took into account the actual substance of the certifications in deciding whether to approve the vouchers.southland mgmt,d at.instead,hud policy decisions concerning the project were made by gross and her superiors based on direct dealings with the owners and regular inspection reports 
for all these reasons,the district court correctly concluded that hud decision to pay the owners monthly hap vouchers was not linked to their certification as to the condition of the apartments.southland mgmt,d at.
b.the defendants did not knowingly present false claims for payment.
a defendant may be liable for a civil false claim by knowingly presenting such a claim,a,but specific intent to defraud is not required.b.on the other hand,the statute definition of knowingly excludes liability for innocent mistakes or negligence.united states ex rel.hochman nackman,cir hindo university of health sciences,cir the circuits have thus rejected the proposition that claimants knowingly presented false claims where there were instances of mere contractual or regulatory noncompliance 
t he fca is not an appropriate vehicle for policing technical compliance with administrative regulations.the fca is a fraud prevention statute violations of agency regulations are not fraud unless the violator knowingly lies to the government about them.
united states ex rel.lamers city of green bay,cir.innocently made faulty calculations or flawed reasoning can not give rise to liability.united states ex rel.wang fmc,cir.further,where disputed legal issues arise from vague provisions or regulations,a contractor decision to take advantage of a position can not result in his filing a knowingly false claim.see united states ex rel.siewick jamieson sci.eng g,hagood sonoma county water agency,cir.
most of our sister circuits have held that under some circumstances,the government knowledge of the falsity of a statement or claim can defeat fca liability on the ground that the claimant did not act knowingly,because the claimant knew that the government knew of the falsity of the statement and was willing to pay anyway.if the government knows and approves of the particulars of a claim for payment before that claim is presented,the presenter can not be said to have knowingly presented a fraudulent or false claim.united states ex rel.durcholz fkw,cir.the government knowledge defense captures the understanding that the fca reaches only the knowing presentation of what is known to be false.hagood,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.where the government and a contractor have been working together,albeit outside the written provisions of the contract,to reach a common solution to a problem,no claim arises.united states ex rel.becker westinghouse savannah river,cir lamers,at united states ex rel.butler hughes helicopters,cir.the government knowledge and acquiescence in its contractor actions in many of these cases was highly relevant,see united states ex rel.hagood sonoma county water agency,cir,to show that the contractor did not submit payment claims in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of their truth or falsity 
the conclusion that these owners did not knowingly present false claims fits easily within the established caselaw.the district court opinion is persuasive 
on this issue,the evidence positively demonstrates beyond reasonable question that at the time of defendants submission of the challenged vouchers and hud s approval of those vouchers,hud,based on its own annual inspections of the property,knew full well of the very conditions of the property which it now claims made the property not decent,safe,and sanitary.hud,through its contract inspector,management solutions of america,conducted annual inspections of the jackson apartments for each of the years defendants hap contract was in effect and for each of the years from august to may,based on conditions found to exist at the property by hud inspector,the apartments received below average or unsatisfactory physical inspection report
