petition for asylum 
abdullah asylum application stated that he is a citizen and national of pakistan who first entered the united states from pakistan on january.he remained here until april,when he returned to pakistan.he came again to the united states on july,on a visa that expired on october.he said that in he had married zarina abid,a native and citizen of pakistan,and that she lived in kashmir with their children,who were born in,and.abdullah indicated that his application for asylum or withholding of removal was grounded on persecution,or fear of persecution,based upon political opinion abdullah stated that he had experienced past harm in pakistan because of charges and his membership in the political national party.he said he feared returning to pakistan because he will be stoned and beaten and tortured by islamic fundamentalists and militants because of his political association.
in a december,statement attached to his asylum application,abdullah wrote that he was arrested on october,by middleboro,massachusetts police for having sex with two women.he wrote that the charges were dropped,but,according to his information and newspaper publishing sic from pakistan,the islamic fundamentalists in the wake of political animosity have made this issue the basis of declaring death sentence for him.he wrote that the fundamentalists had made life hell for him and his family and had threatened to murder him in public.
abdullah explained that the awami national party anp had been founded by abdul khan,a progressive nationalist,and that the party has fought against islamic fundamentalists for the last years.abdullah stated that he had worked with the party for the last thirty years in an effort to uphold human rights,and that his activities caused him to be considered to be among the top political leaders of the anp at the national level.abdullah wrote that the islamic fundamentalists label anp party leaders to be pagans and agents of united states and india,and that they blew this baseless sex scandal out of proportion against him as a political issue.he wrote that the difference between the anp party and the fundamentalists is that the anp is striving to improve economic conditions of the citizens of pakistan,and that,by contrast,the fundamentalists do not work to improve citizens lives but rather push for orthodox religious ideas.
abdullah asserted that in a meeting in pakistan of fundamentalist religious leaders,he was out caste sic from the religion and ordered death by stoning because,according to islamic law,a married man who is caught having sex with a woman other than his wife is punishable by death through stoning.he wrote that due to this bad publicity other religious organizations are following the propaganda by using newspapers to declare death sentence for him.he claimed that according to these newspapers,these fundamentalists attacked his house in mardan,nwfp northwest frontier province and injured his two sons,and that the city mayor had put police surveillance on his house.
abdullah wrote also that,prior to his coming to the united states,the fundamentalist party in pakistan had forced him not to compete against their candidate during elections and had asked him to leave the country for a few months.he stated that his usa visa expired on october,but since the general elections were due after nine days on october,he had to overstay his visa.as he was preparing to return to pakistan,however,suddenly middleboro police arrested him for this sex scandal and jailed him for two months.he wrote that he was an accomplished political figure successful businessman and owner of a company engaged in ocean cargo management that involves millions of pakistani rupees.
hearing before the ij 
on july,abdullah,appearing pro se,testified before the ij.abdullah said that dilawar jan,the information secretary of the jamiat ul islam religious fanatics organization,told him to leave pakistan before his arrival in the in,in order to allow the fundamentalists to have a position open for them in the country elections.he stated that this was the only trouble he experienced in pakistan and admitted that he otherwise ha s no political problems.
abdullah stated that the main reason that he is afraid to return to pakistan is that he believes people have heard that he was charged with a crime.he testified that people in pakistan found out about the massachusetts charges against him derived from the middleboro incident and that it was given to the newspapers also.he testified that the pakistani newspapers had learned of the story because a friend of his in texas,kahlid,told his brother,president of the peshawar press club,that abdullah had been arrested in the united states.he claimed that three days after the news was published in the pakistani press,he started getting letters from the religious people,including one affiliated with the moahammadi m organization.abdullah testified that the m group published in two local newspapers in mardan that abdullah had become nonreligious,and now we need to stone him to death.
abdullah testified that his family left pakistan,went to kashmir,and are now living in a jungle.he claimed he can not join them because he can not live in the jungle out there.he also claimed that he could not move to some other city in pakistan because religious fanatics are everywhere.he testified that,although the entire population of pakistan does not know of the accusations against him,these people will find out somehow or the other.
abdullah proffered several documents in support of his claim,including newspaper clippings in urdu with which he submitted english translations.one,said to be from the daily gouj in mardan,was dated october,and was translated to say that abdullah had been arrested on rape charges in the united states.the translations reflected that a similar bureau report appeared in the daily parwaz of peshawar on october,a report in the daily pukhtoon of mardan on october,stated that abdullah had been declared a pagan by religious clerics.a translation from the daily badban in peshawar on october,was headlined abdullah abid insulted islam in america because he had allegedly raped someone.a translation of an october,report from the daily shaheen in mardan reported that rocks were thrown and gunshots taken at abdullah house.a similar report appeared in the daily haider of peshawar on october.a translation of a report appearing in the daily ittefaq of mardan on october,stated,abdullah abid will be shot to death on return to pakistan.an english clipping from the daily microscreen in peshawar on november,is headlined abdullah abid comes to stoning and states that religious extremists have sentenced him to death as a result of the charges against him in the united states.all of the articles are stated to be from newspapers in the northwest region of pakistan.
one unlabeled,undated article contained a picture of a person holding a banner on which was handwritten,in english,and in reverse,as if it had been flipped in xeroxing,we want abdullah abid.asked why the document appeared altered the lettering went outside the confines of the banner,as if it had been written onto the picture after the fact,abdullah stated that he did not know because he was in jail at the time and did not know how they were published or how they were done.the government challenged the authenticity of abdullah proffered newspaper clippings and stated that after an extensive search through electronic sources,it could not find any existence of any of these newspapers.
abdullah reiterated his belief that he would be harmed by religious people if he returned to his hometown and stated that they would kill him since,he alleged,they had already issued a killing order that can not be taken back.he also testified that when he was in pakistan,he was rolling in millions,and claimed that he worked at the stop and shop in middleboro,massachusetts only because his friend owned it.he said he did not know what happened to his millions.
abdullah admitted that in pakistan,if one is accused of rape,the law requires that four muslim men of good moral character have to have witnessed it,which was not the case in the middleboro incident,but stated that when religious fanatics do the decision,they just do it without any witnesses they can decide whatever.
ronaz zaman,a united states citizen,testified that he had met abdullah in pakistan three years previously at a political function.zaman testified that he himself was not politically active and had no business dealings with abdullah.zaman testified that he had visited pakistan three months ago and tried to visit abdullah factory but found a big lock on the door.
waheed mansur,an acquaintance who had recently met abdullah,testified that he helped abdullah translate some documents.mansur testified that he had very little knowledge of the anp party but knew that it was a very small party based in the northwest frontier province that was never able either to gain power or take over the government in pakistan.
the record contains numerous results of computerized searches for the names of the newspapers which abdullah said had published stories about the middleboro incident.those results verify that the search did not return any hits.
abdullah submitted other evidence,including copies of unidentified photos and letters,an october,criminal complaint from the trial court of massachusetts wareham district court charging him with indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen and also with assault and battery.
ij decision 
on july,after reviewing the testimony and evidence,the ij denied abdullah application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat,and ordered his removal to pakistan.she noted that abdullah two witnesses appeared credible but not very knowledgeable about abdullah activities.the ij stated that she would take abdullah at his word regarding some proffered photographs of abdullah and anp members.
the ij noted abdullah testimony that he was involved with the anp,helped with humanitarian causes in pakistan,and was rolling in millions in his home country as a businessman,but she found it difficult to characterize abdullah credibility.she credited his testimony that he had never had any political problems prior to his arrival in the united states in and that the only trouble he experienced in pakistan occurred when the secretary of the jamiat ul islam party whispered to him that it would be a good thing if he le ft the country.the ij also noted the massachusetts complaint issued against abdullah concerning an incident with two girls at a store was later dismissed and that he was presumed innocent.
regarding abdullah proffered documents,the judge expressed serious doubts about the authenticity of a particular document,noting that it did not seem that everything even matches up.the ij pointed out that the photograph on the page showed that it may have been at one time of persons holding a banner but it seems quite clear that whatever was on that,or if it was a blank,has been written on but written on the photograph,not the banner,suggesting that after the photograph was taken,someone had manually created the text of the banner.the ij said the writing on the banner in the picture seemed to go outside of the border,and that the a in abdullah simply,even to the naked eye,looks like a composite altered document.
the ij concluded that this unexplained and material discrepancy severely hampers abdullah credibility on the issue of what would occur to him if he were to return to his home based on the incident in the united states,and found that she could not accept these documents as authentic documents.she wrote that even if the documents had been published while noting that there was no evidence of how they were published,that they certainly do appear to be fraudulent document s and so on that part,which is actually the central part of abdullah claim abdullah is not credible.
further,the ij wrote that even if there was publicity in pakistan that abdullah had raped two girls that publicity in his home country,even if it was not altered,or doctored in some way,is certainly inaccurate.the ij also found abdullah claim that this information appeared in local pakistani papers because his friend friend decided to publish it,and that an islamic organization now wished to harm him,to be a contention that was not terribly likely.the ij,noting abdullah admission that the real issue was not his political matter,but the incident that occurred in the and the alleged publicity,found abdullah not credible on that issue as to the publicity,and found that even if the claimed newspaper clippings were published and circulated,that they were,at least in some respects,doctored.
regardless of her finding that abdullah was not credible on the core of his claim,due to the doctoring of the documents,the ij also found it unlikely that this would be such big news in his home country.she wrote that even if abdullah were a man of means and involved with his party,it did not seem that he was such a public figure that this would be of particular interest,pointing out that the claim is false and he was not charged with raping two girls.finally,she also found it highly unlikely that in the country of people in pakistan,that abdullah could not find some area of safety in his home country by relocating,if necessary,within pakistan.
the ij concluded that abdullah failed to meet his burden to establish entitlement to asylum.in the ij view,having not met the more generous fear of persecution standard,he can not meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.an alien seeking withholding of removal bears the burden of proving that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a b.an alien who fails to satisfy the standard for asylum automatically fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.mekhoukh ashcroft,cir guzman ins,cir.the ij further pointed out that abdullah has not shown that he has ever been tortured in the past by the government of pakistan,nor does it seem likely that he would be tortured in the future,reiterating her finding that abdullah was not credible on matters substantial to his claim.the ij thus found abdullah not eligible for protection under the cat and ordered him removed to pakistan.
motion to reconsider and motion to reopen 
after the board had affirmed the ij order without opinion on october,abdullah moved to reconsider on october.the board denied the motion on january.on march,abdullah filed a motion to reopen,submitting new evidence consisting of national daily newspapers,which amount to testimonials and affidavits,and asserting the same claims made in his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,and claiming that his previous testimony was credible.he argued that the ij had erred in questioning his credibility regarding the newspaper articles when the printing technology based in pakistan could be compared to that of the united states.he further argued in the motion that his family and property were under attack in pakistan and that his family w
