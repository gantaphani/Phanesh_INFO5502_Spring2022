in this petition for review,juan alvaro santa santa cruz contests the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings.we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the bia.
background 
santa cruz is a native and citizen of colombia who has been a permanent legal resident of the united states since.since his arrival in this country,he has been convicted of several offenses.most relevant to this petition is santa cruz may,conviction in a florida state court for attempted trafficking of a controlled substance,cocaine.
on july,santa cruz was placed in removal proceedings when the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause charging him,inter alia,with being removable under a b i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b i,as an alien convicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance.
in late august,a hearing was held before an immigration judge ij to determine whether santa cruz should be removed.during this hearing,santa cruz requested a discretionary waiver of removal under former c of the ina,c repealed the ins argued that because of santa cruz controlled substance conviction and the restrictions promulgated under the and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,he was ineligible for a discretionary waiver of removal under c.the ij agreed with the ins and ordered santa cruz removal to colombia.
santa cruz appealed the order to the bia.on may,the bia affirmed the decision of the ij,finding santa cruz statutorily ineligible for a c discretionary waiver because of his conviction for a controlled substance offense.the bia issued a final order of removal.
however,on june,the assistant district director of the ins stayed the order of removal pending a determination that santa cruz,despite the decisions of the ij and bia,might nevertheless have qualified for a c waiver of removal under in re soriano,wl bia,while this determination was pending,santa cruz was released from custody.after the bia determined that santa cruz was in fact ineligible for c relief under in re soriano,he was arrested on may.
on may,santa cruz filed a motion to reopen with the bia,asking the bia to remand his case to an immigration judge for reconsideration of his eligibility for a c waiver in light of the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.on june,the bia denied the motion.the bia decided that the restrictions set forth in d of aedpa governed santa cruz eligibility for a waiver under c and that santa cruz was ineligible for a waiver under these restrictions santa cruz now appeals the bia decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see ins doherty,d falae gonzáles,cir.we find an abuse of discretion if the bia has made an error of law or acted in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious.see carter ins,cir see also henry ins,cir further explaining that we would find an abuse of discretion if the bia considered improper factors,failed to consider a relevant factor,or assigned a factor improper weight in making a determination.
b.the motion to reopen 
santa cruz argues that the bia erred in denying his motion to reopen because it improperly applied d of aedpa to bar him from seeking a waiver of removal under former c of the ina section d of aedpa made an alien ineligible for a waiver of removal if he or she had committed inter alia,any offense covered in a b i of the ina,which includes a violation of any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance.santa cruz contends that d of aedpa may not be applied to bar c relief to an alien who engaged in criminal conduct prior to the effective date of aedpa but who has been convicted by a guilty plea made after the effective date of aedpa.santa cruz offers three cases in support of this argument.
first,santa cruz argues that the supreme court holding in ins cyr,d,bars the application of aedpa to his request for a waiver of removal in cyr,the court held that iirira could not be applied retroactively to bar c relief to an alien who had entered into a plea bargain before the effective date of iirira.id.at.the court noted that preserving the possibility of c relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea bargain.id.at.because aliens may have relied on the availability of c relief when entering into plea bargains,the court held that c relief remains available for aliens who would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea.id.at.emphasis added.when santa cruz entered into his plea agreement on may,he was no longer eligible for c relief because aedpa had already been effective for one month.santa cruz position was rejected in our decision in lawrence gonzáles,cir,in which we held that the proper date to be used in determining the applicability of d of aedpa is the date of conviction.we specifically stated that the date of criminal conduct is irrelevant.see also khan ashcroft,cir d is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens who pleaded guilty following aedpa effective date,even if the criminal conduct underlying their convictions took place before aedpa date.unlike in cyr,santa cruz could not have reasonably relied on the possibility of c relief when he decided to enter into the plea bargain.as we explained in lawrence gonzáles,cir,santa cruz had no basis for assuming as part of his plea or otherwise that section c relief would be potentially available as part of the quid pro quo for the plea.furthermore,the reasoning in cyr would not extend to santa cruz conduct because it is unlikely that santa cruz was relying on the possibility of a waiver of removal when he decided to commit his crime in.see,ins,cir it is difficult to argue,for example,that a convict would have refrained from committing the criminal act if he had just known of the potential for future deportation consequences.accordingly,cyr provides no support for santa cruz contention that d of aedpa should not apply to his application for c relief.
second,santa cruz suggests that our decision in goncalves reno,cir,supports his contention that d of aedpa does not apply to his application for a c waiver.in goncalves,we held that d of aedpa would not apply to an application for c relief filed prior to the effective date of aedpa.id.at.we noted that neither the text nor the legislative history of aedpa suggested that congress had meant d to apply to applications for c relief already pending on the effective date.id.at.however,unlike in goncalves,where the application for a c waiver was made before aedpa became effective,santa cruz made his application for a c waiver after aedpa became effective and barred him from relief because d of aedpa had already made santa cruz ineligible for a c waiver before he submitted his application,goncalves fails to lend support to santa cruz position.
third,santa cruz contends that the holding in henderson ins,cir,provides support for his argument that d of aedpa does not apply to his application for c relief.in henderson,the second circuit held that d did not apply to an alien seeking c relief whose removal proceeding had commenced prior to the effective date of aedpa.id.at.as in goncalves,the second circuit noted that there was no evidence of congressional intent to make d applicable to pending immigration proceedings.however,unlike in henderson,where removal proceedings began before aedpa became effective,removal proceedings against santa cruz did not commence until july,more than three months after the effective date of aedpa.because aedpa became effective before santa cruz was subject to removal proceedings,henderson also fails to support his position.
accordingly,we conclude that d of aedpa does apply to santa cruz application for a waiver of removal under former c of the ina.santa cruz does not contest the fact that he was convicted by a florida court of attempted trafficking of a controlled substance.under d of aedpa,an alien convicted of any offense relating to a controlled substance is no longer eligible for a w
