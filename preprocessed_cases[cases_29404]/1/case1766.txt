the separation from his mother deprives this child of the continued love,affection and care of his mother and primary caretaker in violation of the ninth amendment to the united states constitution,

ii.analysis 
we review de novo a decision to dismiss a complaint for lack of jurisdiction,and we accept any factual findings that the district court made in its analysis unless it committed clear error davis united states,cir.
on appeal,the parties focused their briefing on whether g barred the district court from exercising jurisdiction over hamdi complaint and whether hamdi was sufficiently aggrieved by agency action to state a claim providing jurisdiction under the apa.neither the parties nor the district court discussed whether hamdi could assert jurisdiction under general jurisdiction pursuant to,and whether the district court,by grounding its decision in g,avoided the potential jurisdictional impact of b that dhs raised below.although neither party specifically addressed on appeal,we are under an independent obligation to examine our own jurisdiction,baird norton,cir quoting,city of dallas,and that of the district court to determine whether hamdi complaint could be adjudicated under any grounds supported in the complaint,estate of mueller comm r,cir.we may determine that the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction should have been denied if facts pleaded in the complaint are sufficient to infer jurisdiction.holy see,cir,cert.denied.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at ed.i f the allegation of the district court jurisdiction is insufficient or entirely lacking but there are facts pleaded in the complaint from which the court jurisdiction may be inferred,then the motion to dismiss under rule b motion also must be denied.however,we may affirm the district court dismissal for reasons other than those stated if dismissal is appropriate.hensley propride,cir apple glenn,cir.
we will address each jurisdictional issue in turn,taking care to remember a familiar principle of statutory construction the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.kucana holder.even so,we address these issues mindful that the supreme court recently reasserted that a statute affecting federal jurisdiction must be construed both with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which congress has expressed its wishes.id.at quoting cheng fan kwok ins.
a.the jurisdictional bar of g does not apply to independent actions brought by a citizen child raising distinct constitutional rights 
the district court dismissed hamdi complaint in part on the basis of the jurisdictional bar in g.section g precludes the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by dhs to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.g.dhs maintains that the district court properly interpreted hamdi complaint as brought on behalf of his mother,an alien in removal proceedings,because his allegations and the relief requested are in the interest of his mother and inextricably intertwined with his mother removal order.hamdi argues that this action is brought on behalf of himself to enforce his own constitutional rights violated by the order of his mother removal and that his mother is only an incidental beneficiary in the action.we agree with hamdi,and conclude that g does not preclude the district court from exercising jurisdiction over hamdi complaint because the complaint adequately raises his independent claims on his own behalf.
the proper interpretation of the on behalf of language in g is a matter of first impression in this circuit and apparently in all circuits.we review de novo such questions of statutory interpretation,united states parrett,cir,employing a framework established by the supreme court first,a natural reading of the full text second,the meaning of the statutory terms and finally,consideration of the statutory and legislative history for guidance,lockhart napolitano,cir quoting united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir citing united states wells.the natural reading of the full text requires that we examine the statute for its plain meaning,including the language and design of the statute as a whole.id.quoting parrett,at.if the statutory language is not clear,we may examine the relevant legislative history.parrett,at.
we conclude that hamdi claims do not fall within the meaning of g.although many courts have dismissed actions brought by,or asserting the rights of,a citizen child,few courts have addressed g.dictionary definitions are not extremely helpful to our analysis.black law dictionary ed does not define the phrase on behalf of or behalf ed defines the phrase as in the interest of also as a representative of,and further defines behalf as interest,benefit also support,defense.we have found only two courts that have directly addressed the impact of g on a citizen child complaint.in kruer gonzales,wl.june,unpublished opinion,the district court rejected the applicability of the jurisdictional bars in a and g because the face of the children petition does not indicate it is being brought on their mother behalf,though this be the indirect result of their filing,and research reveals no binding authority so interpreting the statute as brought on the mother behalf.id.at.the kruer district court found a implicitly limited its applicability to review sought by the individual subject to the removal order.id.at.with this conclusion,the kruer district court accept ed jurisdiction of the citizen children action and rejected the merits with prejudice.id.at summarizing holding by accepting that court had jurisdiction and that plaintiffs had standing.in coleman united states,d,the district court held that g did not apply to bar jurisdiction because the citizen child suit presented the child own rights and a separate redressable injury that would only incidentally benefit the immigrant parent.id.at.relying on precedents favoring narrow construction of jurisdictional limits,the district court looked solely to what the plain text makes clear and reasoned that s ection g does not apply here because that statute does not bar claims by citizens because such claims are not brought by any alien alleging that removal orders violate the citizen distinct personal rights because such claims are not on behalf of any alien.id.at citing maldonado fasano,d,citing lindahl office of personnel,webster doe.
we find the reasoning in coleman persuasive.we recognize that the provisions of are intended to narrow the availability of judicial review for removal orders,precluding federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over many claims related to a final order of removal.see kucana.at emphasizing that congress aggressive amendments to were intended to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal basis to remain in the united states reno comm.aadc.we must be cautious,however,not to interpret broadly provisions in the absence of explicit congressional intent.aadc,at prado reno,cir in aadc,the supreme court taught that interpreting the jurisdiction limiting provisions of iirira requires a close textual reading and that restrictions on jurisdiction should conform tightly to the precise language chosen by congress.
while it is in hamdi own interest to litigate his claims that his mother removal order violates his distinct constitutional rights,it plainly would benefit her as well if hamdi were to be successful and to secure the relief he review and cancellation of his mother removal order.one could argue that hamdi is asking the federal courts to take his mother substantive arguments and convert them into his own action seeking the relief that she has been denied,but the remedy hamdi seeks does not dictate the substance of his complaint.mustata dep t of justice,cir distinguishing an claim asking for a stay of a deportation order from a g challenge to the execution of the order itself aguilar immigration customs enforcement div.of the dep t of homeland,st cir holding b barred jurisdiction even though available on face of undocumented aliens complaint because substance trumps form and we must look through such easy evasions as creative labeling and consider the fundamental nature of the claims asserted to not allow collective end runs around congressional directives citing,inter alia,nashville,ry.wallace,penhallow doan adm rs,dall.we hold that a complaint brought by a citizen child who asserts his or her own distinct constitutional rights and separate injury does not fall fairly within the on behalf of any alien jurisdictional bar in g.hamdi challenges the constitutionality of the final order of removal for his mother,but his claim asserts his own distinct constitutional rights.thus,the district court improperly relied upon g in dismissing hamdi complaint.
b.the administrative procedure act does not provide jurisdiction here 
hamdi argues in the alternative that his constitutional and claims provide a basis for jurisdiction under the apa this circuit has not yet addressed whether the apa can provide jurisdiction for citizen children to challenge immigration proceedings,but we now conclude that hamdi attempt to assert jurisdiction solely under the apa is unavailing.to utilize the apa,hamdi must have alleged sufficiently that he is suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.bangura hansen,cir.the supreme court has held,however,that i mmigration proceedings are not governed by the apa because congress intended the provisions of the immigration and nationality act of ina to supplant the apa in immigration proceedings.ardestani ins,citing marcello bonds,robert reno,app x,cir unpublished opinion the apa simply does not govern immigration proceedings under the ina and may not be used to challenge the hearing provisions of the ina.but see acosta gaffney,cir holding citizen child had standing under the apa and to assert a constitutional challenge to parents removal but no constitutional right to prohibit removal.as a result,the apa does not provide jurisdiction in the instant case to the extent that hamdi seeks review of his mother order of removal.instead,the apa general waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to claims applies to allow hamdi distinct constitutional claims to proceed under the district court general jurisdiction of,see united states city of detroit,cir en banc,especially in light of the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action,kucana.at see also gonzales,cir reaffirming,in the context of a suit,that the administrative procedure act,et,may in some instances serve as a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity,and through the general federal question jurisdiction of,empower the federal district courts to hear timely appeals from certain board orders citing sabhari reno,cir accord ginters frazier,wl,cir affirming the continuing validity of sabhari after the enactment of a b and the supreme court decision in kucana.
jurisdiction under is appropriate 
a citizen child raising distinct constitutional rights may assert jurisdiction 
we agree with the district court that hamdi has asserted a sufficient injury in fact for standing purposes,but we conclude that the district court erred in not recognizing that the constitutional nature of hamdi alleged injury,apparent on the face of the complaint,provided jurisdiction as a federal question within the meaning of.see reno catholic soc,holding that a challenge to regulations used in applications was not lacking a statutory jurisdiction source since,generally granting federal question jurisdiction,confer s jurisdiction on federal courts to review agency action quoting califano sanders.a plaintiff properly invokes jurisdiction when she pleads a colorable claim arising under the constitution or laws of the united states.arbaugh y h.
in addressing hamdi standing to bring this claim before the district court and in its arguments related to the apa on appeal,dhs argues that jurisdiction is lacking because hamdi has failed to assert a violation of a constitutionally protected right.however,j urisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.steel citizens for a better env t,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.even so,a claim invoking jurisdiction under may be dismissed for want of jurisdiction if it is not colorable,if it is immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.arbaugh,at quoting bell hood.we previously have explained the propriety of dismissal on this basis 
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel citizens for a better env t,quoting oneida indian nation of new york county of oneida.this requirement of substantiality or of the federal question refers to whether there is any legal substance to the position the plaintiff is presenting.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.
primax recoveries,gunter,cir see also aichai hu holder,app x,cir unpublished opinion a claim is not colorable if it is immaterial and asserted only to support jurisdiction,or if it is utterly insubstantial and frivolous.although many precedents,including some from this circuit,may undermine hamdi constitutional claims,we can not say that his claims may be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds of insubstantiality or frivolousness 
dismissal was proper because hamdi fails to state a constitutional claim upon which relief may be granted 
hamdi has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because federal district courts are prohibited from reviewing and vacating a removal order,the ultimate relief that hamdi seeks.hamdi complaint can be reduced to the claim that because hamdi has constitutional rights that his mother order of removal adversely affects,and because dhs did not consider hamdi rights in imposing his mother order of removal,hamdi is entitled to relief.his requested relief is that the federal district court should review his mother order of removal and,taking proper account of his constitutional rights,cancel that removal order.in its arguments below,dhs asserted that a and b precluded the district court from exercising jurisdiction over hamdi claim.although we acknowledge that the provisions of,even apart from g discussed above,are intended to narrow the availability of judicial review of removal orders and for claims arising from a final order of removal,see kucana.at aadc,at,we conclude that the scope of the jurisdictional bar in b does not preclude the district court from exercising jurisdiction over hamdi claim.however,b does operate to preclude the district court from providing the particular relief that hamdi review of his mother order of removal and cancellation of that order.
in nken holder,the supreme court explained the changes in judicial review of immigration procedures brought on by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,which substantially amended the immigration and nationality act ina,et,
the new review system substantially limited the availability of judicial review and streamlined all challenges to a removal order into a single proceeding the petition for review.see,a barring review of certain removal orders and exercises of executive discretion b c establishing strict filing and briefing deadlines for review proceedings b consolidating challenges into petition for review.
id.although b has been described as the unmistakable zipper clause,aadc,at,its scope reaches only claims for judicial review arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.b.the supreme court has contrasted b with g,stating that b is a broader jurisdictional limitation for review of the legality of final orders of removal than g and demonstrates the normal manner of imposing such a general jurisdictional limitation for all claims arising from deportation proceedings.aadc,at see muka baker,cir explaining impact of a b to channel judicial review of legality of removal orders.by its terms,the provision aims to consolidate all questions of law and fact that arise from either an action or a proceeding brought in connection with the removal of an alien.aguilar,at.
indeed,b is a judicial channeling provision,not a one.id.at.we,like the first circuit in aguilar,can not endorse an interpretation of the arising from language in b that swallow s all claims that might somehow touch upon,or be traced to,the government efforts to remove an alien.id.at.
furthermore,if congress had intended to accomplish so a result,it could have used broader language.mcnary haitian refugee,suggesting that if congress intended a certain provision of the ina to be read more expansively,it could have used more expansive language.for example,congress would have used the term related to instead of arising from.see humphries various fed.usins employees,cir suggesting that related to signifies a somewhat looser nexus than arising from.
id.here,hamdi claim raises his distinct constitutional rights that he alleges his mother removal order adversely affects.we can decide this issue of hamdi constitutional rights separately from the merits of the order of his mother removal itself because this issue of hamdi rights is distinct from the question of whether his mother order of removal is invalid based on dhs failure to consider the effects of his potential separation from his mother.see id.at r emoval proceedings are confined to determining whether a particular alien should be deported.citing c a.a judicial determination that hamdi constitutional rights are violated by separation from his mother is distinct from judicial determination of questions arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.b see mcnary haitian refugee,distinguishing heckler ringer,on ground that granting general jurisdiction would not have effect of deciding the merits of claims in a proceeding separate from and prior to the prescribed process under the relevant statute.this approach does not disregard congress plain inten tion to put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held sway in regard to removal proceedings,aguilar,at,and instead is consistent with precedents that have allowed challenges to proceed in the district court because the petitioner did not challenge the order of or because an available remedy would not affect the order of removal see id.at finding support for a bounded reading of b in the fact that certain claims are excluded from the sweep of section b by virtue of legislative intent,habeas review of detention and judicial precedent,legality of detention and bail availability.
even though we conclude that b does not bar hamdi claim from proceeding under general jurisdiction,we must still consider the district court ability to grant the remedy requested.a claim can be sufficient for jurisdiction purposes even if it is unsuccessful and possibly verging on the foolhardy in light of prior precedent barring the relief sought.primax,at internal quotation marks omitted.t he possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover does not defeat a district court jurisdiction,which remains valid so long as the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and the laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another.steel,at quoting bell hood.but under the current interpretation of b,no federal court has the authority to review the order of removal of the mother elgharib to determine whether a violation of the child hamdi constitutional rights renders the imposition of the mother removal order invalid or whether the immigration court would have decided,in its discretion,not to order elgharib removal if it had otherwise entertained the claims now presented by hamdi were we to agree with hamdi and endorse a different interpretation of b with regard to judicial review of an actual order of removal of an alien,then he would have a claim that could survive a rule b motion to dismiss.because we can not endorse such an interpretation under current law,see kucana.at aadc,at elgharib,at,muka,at,we conclude that hamdi has failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted no other relief was pleaded,and we can identify no other available relief that would redress hamdi injury in fact without running afoul of current precedent interpreting b.therefore,we hold that hamdi has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and the district court did not err in dismissing hamdi complaint.
iii.conclusion 
we understand hamdi plight,and we are not insensitive to the substantial hardship that he may endure if and when his mother is finally removed from this country.however,for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court order dismissing hamdi complaint with prejudice based on our conclusion that hamdi failed to state a claim upon which a federal court may grant relief.
concurrence 
like the majority,i would affirm the dismissal of hamdi complaint,but my reasoning differs in some respects from that of the majority opinion.while i fully agree that the jurisdictional bar of g is inapplicable to hamdi claims because they are not brought on behalf of his mother,i disagree with the majority opinion analysis with respect to a and b.taken together,these sections do indeed create a jurisdictional bar to hamdi claims.
essentially,hamdi seeks to challenge the order removing his mother from this country.under a and b,judicial review of such an order can occur only in the context of a petition for review filed with the appropriate court of appeals.the subsections make no distinction between the individual against whom the order of removal is explicitly directed and a third party in establishing the petition for review as the sole vehicle for such a challenge.thus,giving b its channeling effect results in the funneling of hamdi challenge to the removal order into a petition for review,even though hamdi was not a party to the immigration proceeding and could not have raised his claim of constitutional violations there.
this result stems from the characterization of hamdi claim as a challenge to the removal order and one involving legal issues arising from his mother immigration proceeding.if hamdi claims were instead collateral to the removal process,then in my view they could be brought under the apa.as the majority opinion notes,we would have jurisdiction over hamdi constitutional and based claims under.and the apa provides the necessary waiver of sovereign immunity to permit the claims to proceed.because the claims were indeed collateral,they would not be immigration proceedings in which the ina supplants the apa.under this analytical route,we would analyze the complaint individual claims to determine whether a claim on which relief could be granted had been stated.but because i do not think that hamdi claims can be categorized as collateral to the removal process,i will not undertake this analysis.
the majority opinion view of the substance of hamdi claim seems close to mine,but it concludes that the problem lies in the relief sought.proper conceptualization of this case is not an easy task,but my own view is that,based on a and b,we lack jurisdiction over hamdi claim.
section g,exclusive jurisdiction,states except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the attorney general to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.
the order stated in a footnote that the same reasoning that required the court to dismiss hamdi claims related to his mother order of removal also prevented the court from exercising jurisdiction over the complaint allegations related to hamdi father immigration issues.doc.dist.op.at.hamdi brief on appeal did not raise any arguments related to his father immigration status,and we do not address any potential issues related thereto.
the district court decided dhs motion to dismiss entirely on the grounds that the complaint failed to establish jurisdiction,because dhs arguments in its memorandum of law accompanying its motion had focused primarily on this ground.however,dhs also stated in its motion that hamdi complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,albeit with a citation only to.b,and dhs accompanying memorandum of law included arguments related to the merits of hamdi claims.see doc.mot.to dismiss.although inartfully drafted,dhs jurisdictional arguments may also be construed as arguments that hamdi has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because he has no meritorious constitutional claim,and no federal court may review his mother order of removal.because the merits of hamdi claim are relevant for our analysis of jurisdiction under the apa and for whether his claim is redressable,we may address both aspects of dhs motion on de novo review.see winnett caterpillar,cir citing rogers stratton,cir reviewing an issue raised under rule b as if plaintiff had filed a rule b.here,both parties briefed the viability of hamdi constitutional claims and the impact of the provisions of under their argument headings related to g and the apa,and no additional argument from either party would alter our ultimate decision on jurisdiction or grounds.as this court has recognized,generations of jurists have struggled with the difficulty of distinguishing between rules b and b in federal question cases nowak ironworkers local pension fund,cir.in theory,the difference is clear the former determines whether the plaintiff has a right to be in the particular court and the latter is an adjudication as to whether a cognizable legal claim has been stated.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.yet in practice,the difference between the two motions is often difficult to discern.recoveries,gunter,cir alteration in original.indeed,it would have been error for the district co
