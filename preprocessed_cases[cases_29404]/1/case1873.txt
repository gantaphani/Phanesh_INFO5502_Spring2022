this appeal arises from income tax deficiencies and assessments levied by the irs and upheld by the tax court.because the tax court did not clearly err in finding that homer richardson fraudulently created sham trusts and underreported the couple income and in finding that gloria richardson failed to show that she was entitled to relief,we affirm.
homer and gloria richardson spent most of their careers as hardworking and traditional,though perhaps reluctant,taxpayers.gloria worked as a medical assistant.homer,a graduate of the university of missouri,managed drug stores for twelve years and ran a tool business for three.after abandoning the tool business,homer obtained licenses to sell insurance and securities.
in late,the richardsons met representatives of the aegis company,who promoted several packages and the trusts capacities to reduce taxes.homer set up his own trust in august and that same year began peddling the aegis trust packages to others.homer targeted insurance agents and conducted informational workshops where he told attendees they could reduce their taxes by up to if they used the aegis system.he boasted that customers could leave more money for their children,ja,and that they essentially would become their own charit ies using the money in their trust as a retirement plan,ja.homer sold the trust packages for apiece,and his success in marketing them generated considerable receipts of in and in.
in the face of this new wealth,the richardsons created two new trusts for themselves,the hg asset management company the business trust and the hg richardson charitable trust the charitable trust.although the trust instrument for the charitable trust prohibited transactions that were not to charitable organizations or would otherwise jeopardize the federal income tax exemption of the trust pursuant to section c of the internal revenue code,ja,the richardsons never sought c status for the trust.the richardsons transferred all of their assets,including their personal residence,and all rights in their future income to the business trust in exchange for and a full ownership interest in both trusts.the richardsons maintained exclusive control over the funds of both trusts,and they named their four children as successor directors and beneficiaries of the business trust.homer served as the executive director and executive trustee of the business and charitable trusts,and gloria served as the executive secretary of each trust.
for the first six days of the trusts existence,an aegis associate served as a director of the business trust,but the richardsons were otherwise the trusts lone directors and trustees.neither trust had any employees,and homer made all of the investment decisions.the richardsons tax returns say that gloria spent two hours a week working for the charitable trust.
although the richardsons transferred all of their assets to the business trust,their lifestyle did not change.in exchange for the richardsons services,the business trust contractually provided them with housing,transportation,health care,educational and incidental expenses.ja.the rationale for maintain ing adequate housing,the contract with the business trust explained,was that t he law says that the rental value of a residence which is maintained for the convenience of any employer is generally not taxable.ja.in this case,the adequate housing the trust provided was their residence.the couple,in their capacity as trust directors,also authorized expenditures from the business trust to remodel their home and to purchase a car titled in homer name.
in and,the richardsons filed joint personal tax returns and a separate form income tax return for estates and trusts for the business trust.on their personal returns,they reported only homer receipts for and for,and after taking the standard deduction and two exemptions,they reported no taxable income for either year.they opted to report their far more substantial aegis income a combined total of nearly one million dollars of gross income for and on the business trust returns and managed to reduce the trust taxable income to zero through a series of deductions.the business trust claimed deductions for the richardsons personal living expenses,their health insurance,their homeowners insurance,their car payments,depreciation on their residence and certain fiduciary fees.the business trust then took charitable deductions for the balance of its income in and in based upon transfers to the charitable trust.the richardsons did not file a tax return in for the charitable trust,but in and they reported the business trust charitable contributions on a form return of private foundation.
the richardsons had several opportunities to consider the legitimacy of the trusts and their tax returns.at a board meeting on june,they discussed irs notice,which warned taxpayers about the illegality of abusive trusts.the notice said that a busive trust arrangements often use trusts to hide the true ownership of assets and income or to disguise the substance of transactions,frequently involve more than one trust and purport to involve charitable purposes.notice.the irs notice characterized a business trust as abusive when the trust makes payments to the trust unit holders or to other trusts created by the owner characterized either as deductible business expenses or as deductible distributions.id.and it explained the legal principles behind the tax treatment of abusive trusts and threatened severe penalties against those who utilized or promoted them.id.at.at this board meeting,the richardsons allegedly consulted legal research about this irs notice,provided by aegis,and determined that the aegis business trust is not the kind of trust that is addressed.ja.
at some point between and early,missy vaselaney,an attorney hired by some of homer clients to help them close their aegis trusts,told homer that the aegis schemes were illegal.homer dismissed her advice because she was not a tax expert as far as trusts were concerned.ja.although homer said that he had consulted other lawyers,he never provided the name of a lawyer not affiliated with aegis.
on july,the irs sent the richardsons a copy of notice,advised them that they might be involved in an abusive trust and gave them an opportunity to correct their tax returns.the letter asked the richardsons to send the irs their trust documents,but instead of complying with the inquiry homer questioned the agents authority to look into the trusts and failed to attend an appointment with irs agents to discuss the trusts.
after the richardsons refused to cooperate,the irs audited them and issued a series of summonses to obtain the richardsons financial records.homer responded to these summonses by threatening his banks with lawsuits if they disclosed any information,by threatening to sue an irs agent because he had had enough of the agent lawless disregard for his rights,ja,and by filing a motion to quash in the district court.
after the district court denied this motion,the civil investigation lay dormant for two years while the irs commenced a criminal investigation of the richardsons.the irs resumed the civil investigation in.the richardsons continued to challenge the irs agents authority to investigate them and failed to furnish any of the requested documents to the agents.in july,the irs issued the richardsons two deficiency notices for and for,asserting that the trusts were sham entities,attributing all of the couple aegis income to them and making the income taxable to them personally.in addition to assessing joint tax liabilities,the notices charged homer individually with fraud penalties of for his tax filings and for his tax filings.through all of this,homer point of view,as described by one of his clients,was to stick with it and continue to try to fight it because we in the tax protesting mode.ja.
the richardsons challenged the deficiency findings in the tax court.they argued that the invalidation of the business trust as a sham entity violated ohio law and the tenth amendment to the constitution the trusts were not sham entities the fraud penalty against homer was insufficiently supported the statute of limitations barred the assessment because there was no fraud and gloria was entitled to relief.the tax court upheld all of the commissioner findings.
the richardsons appeal the tax deficiencies and fraud penalties levied against them.because the tax court fraud,and rulings are factual ones,we review them for clear error,giv ing deference to the tax court factual findings and inferences.indmar prods.comm r,cir.
the internal revenue code requires taxpayers to report all income from whatever source derived,including income derived from business and i ncome from an interest in an estate or trust.a.in determining whether to attribute income to a taxpayer,the code elevates substance over form,asking not what the surface of a transaction suggests but what the economic realities of the transaction show.see comm r court holding.because even the most patriotic citizens do not have a duty to increase their taxes,helvering gregory,cir,it is entirely legal and legitimate to minimize taxes through permissible means,estate of kluener comm r,cir.but if a transaction or entity has no valid,business purpose,nominally uses another person or entity as a conduit through which to pass title,court holding,at,or br ings about no real change in the economic relation of the taxpayers to the income in question,comm r tower,the commissioner has the authority to find that the transaction or entity lacks economic substance and disregard it for tax purposes,see coltec,united states,characterizing the doctrine as a judicial tool for effectuating the underlying congressional purpose that,despite literal compliance with the statute,tax benefits not be afforded based on transactions lacking in economic substance.
in ascertaining whether a trust has economic substance,courts look to a variety of factors whether the relationship of the grantors to the transferred property changed materially whether any independent trustee exists to prevent the grantors from acting solely in their own interests whether any economic interest in the trust assets passed to other beneficiaries and whether the trust imposes any restrictions on the grantors use of the assets.see markosian comm r.applying these principles,the tax court concluded that the richardsons trusts lacked economic substance,finding that the relationship of petitioners to both their physical assets and their activities remained essentially unchanged after the formation of the trusts.ja.
ample evidence supports this finding.the richardsons maintained exclusive control over the trusts assets they were the trusts sole beneficiaries and the trusts lacked independent trustees.most notably,the richardsons use of the trusts assets was no more constrained after the creation of the trusts than it was before their formation they lived in the same home they had similar expenses and homer had the same job a salesperson.
so far as the record shows,the business trust also had no valid,business purpose.estate of kluener,at.all that changed after the formation of the trust was the richardsons tax obligation,which by itself does not suffice to establish a legitimate business purpose for the trust.the richardsons,the record shows,used the trust as nothing more than a conduit through which to pass title,court holding,at,and experienced no real change in the ir economic relation to the income in question,tower,at,even after the trust ostensibly owned all of their assets and their right to earn income.
making matters worse,the internal revenue code expressly bars the types of deductions the business trust purported to authorize.n o deduction,the code says,shall be allowed for personal,living,or family expenses.a.the nondeductibility of personal expenses remains fundamental to our income tax regime,muhich comm r,cir,prompting courts to be skeptical of efforts to transform a famil y expenses into expenses of trust administration,id.at see also harris comm r,cch,to anyone not incorrigibly addicted to the free lunch philosophy of life,the entire family trust scheme had to have been seen as a wholly transparent sham.
no less inappropriate was the richardsons use of the charitable trust to deduct the remainder of their income.because the richardsons alone control led the donee trust,they undertook a heavy burden of proving the facts that would entitle them to a charitable deduction.see smith comm r,cir.to be charitable,a contribution must be to an organization operated exclusively for religious,charitable,scientific,literary,or educational purposes and may not inure to the benefit of any private shareholder of the recipient organization.c b,c emphasis added see also comm r john danz charitable trust,cir noting that to be tax exempt a trust must be organized exclusively for charitable purposes.i n searching for the intentions or motives behind the structure of a charitable entity,a court may look beyond the four corners of the creating instrument and may consider extrinsic evidence on this subject where it is helpful.id.at.
considerable evidence shows that the richardsons operated the trusts for less than charitable purposes and intended the trust funds to inure to their own benefit in the end.in his own words,homer told potential clients in his promotion materials that they had to pay out five percent each year to a charity from the charitable trust,but other than those payments you essentially would become your own charity,and the charitable trust would become retirement income.ja.establishing retirement income for one self,needless to say,is hardly a selfless and charitable act.the richardsons nonetheless claim that the trust was a legitimate charitable entity,relying on the trust instrument,which ostensibly required all trust disbursements to be charitable,and on several donations to various charities between and.but the richardsons never sought c status for the trust,and the sum of charitable donations given over four years approximately represented only a small percentage of the charitable deductions the richardsons claimed for the two relevant and.the relatively modest amounts of these the fact that the richardsons made many of them after the irs investigation rather than legitimize their intentions.we agree with the district court that the evidence shows that the couple intended to use the trust corpus as retirement savings and designed the modest disbursements to give the trust the veneer,but not the reality,of legitimacy.just as the initial disbursements made by a typical ponzi scheme do not make the investment scheme real,see wolff cash titles,cir,so too the richardsons charitable disbursements can not hide their purposes nor keep the entire transaction from being disregarded as a sham.
that the trusts were valid under ohio law,does not make them legitimate for federal income tax purposes.by adhering to state law in forming a trust,an individual does not necessarily give it economic substance as a matter of federal law.just as the world can see through a potemkin village,so the tax code sees through sham entities in assessing taxes,even though the trusts are otherwise valid under state laws.tower,at.see also zmuda comm r,w e will look through that form regardless of whether the entity has a separate existence recognized under state law.for the same reason that a valid registration of a name of incorporation under state law does not innoculate it from challenge under the federal trademark laws,the same is true with respect to state trusts and federal income tax liability.
the tenth amendment does not give the richardsons any refuge either.the amendment,it is true,reserves t he powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution to the states.const.amend.x.but after the ratification of the sixteenth amendment in,what more is there to delegate the amendment broadly delegates to congress the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes,from whatever source derived.id.amend.xvi.and,it is assuredly necessary and proper,id.art.i,cl,to the administration of that authority to impose income taxes on transactions according to their substance,not to what state law says about them,court holding,at.to permit the true nature of a transaction
