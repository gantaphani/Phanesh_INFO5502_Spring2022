three environmental organizations brought this suit under the clean air act provisions,alleging that the tennessee valley authority tva shirked its duty to obtain appropriate pollution limitations at a power plant it operates in clinton,tennessee.the district court granted summary judgment to tva,concluding that the statute of limitations had run on the plaintiffs claim for statutory penalties and that the rule barred their claim for injunctive relief.we conclude that the district court ruling on the statute of limitations was in error,reverse its grant of summary judgment,and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
regulatory framework 
the primary purpose of the clean air act caa is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.to achieve these goals,congress instructed the united states environmental protection agency epa to develop limits on the maximum concentrations of various pollutants allowable in different areas of the country,known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs.id.to enforce these limits,the caa employs a system of cooperative federalism,requiring states to create plans provid ing for implementation,maintenance,and enhancement of the naaqs.id.a.such a plan,called a state implementation plan sip,must 
include enforceable emissions limitations and control measures,as well as compliance schedules,id.a a 
provide for monitoring and analysis of air quality,id.a b 
include an enforcement program,id.a c 
regulate the construction and modification of sources of pollution,
prohibit emissions that will harm other states efforts toward reducing air pollution,id.a d i 
assure proper funding,staffing,and legal authority to carry out the sip,id.a e and 
require polluters to monitor the output of pollution and report the results to the state,id.a f.
after several years under this regulatory regime,congress recognized that merely setting ceilings on emissions did not discourage existing polluters from increasing their pollution levels up to these limits,or encourage new polluters to minimize their emissions.to fix this defect,congress amended the caa in to include the new source review program.united states duke energy,d,aff,cir,cert.granted sub nom.envtl.def.duke energy,d.new source review featured provisions for the protection of areas with relatively clean air known as prevention of significant deterioration,or psd.duke energy,d at.
under psd,each sip must contain emission limitations and such other measures as may be necessary to prevent significant deterioration of air quality by new sources of pollution or old sources that have undergone modifications.because a key purpose of psd is to assure that any decision to permit increased air pollution is made only after careful evaluation of all the consequences of such a decision,id,polluters are required to limit emissions to a baseline rate and to obtain a permit before constructing or modifying facilities.duke energy,d at emphasis in original.these permits are often referred to as psd permits,and they must both set forth emission limitations for such facility,a,and require that any proposed facility must be subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant emitted from,or which results from the facility,id.a additionally,psd permits require the owner or operator of the plant to agree to ongoing monitoring to determine the effect which emissions from any such facility may have,or is sic having,on air quality in affected areas.id.a.
tennessee sip provides for separate permits for construction and operation of sources of air pollution,compare.comp.regs.with id,but prohibits the issuance of an operating permit until all requirements of the construction permit are met,id.e.tennessee regulations prohibit the commencement of modification of an air contaminant source without the operator first having applied for and received a construction permit for the construction or modification of such air contaminant source.id.a.in turn,any construction or modification must comply with the emissions limitations expressed in the approved construction permit application,and also with all provisions of the regulations of the tennessee sip,any applicable measures of the control strategy,and all provisions of the tennessee air quality act.id.d.plants must also operate in accordance with the limits expressed in construction permits because,as the deputy director of the tennessee air pollution control division explained in deposition,the limitations included in construction permits are carried into operating permits,which contain no independent emissions limitations themselves.joint appendix at,styke depo.at.
the construction permitting requirements of tennessee sip also provide 
in the case where a source or modification was constructed without first obtaining a construction permit,a construction permit may be issued to the source or modification to establish as conditions of the permit,the necessary emission limits and requirements to assure that these regulatory requirements are met.the appropriate enforcement action shall be pursued to insure that ambient air quality standards and other regulatory requirements will be met.
comp.regs.e.this provision places upon polluters an ongoing duty to ensure that they obtain the appropriate emissions limitations in their construction permits,even if they failed to do so before construction.these limitations include best available control technology bact,id.j,and other limitations flowing from the sip psd provisions,see id.
the tennessee sip psd program,however,does not apply to all modifications of emissions sources.instead,the psd subset of the generally applicable construction regulations described only to new construction and to major modifications that would produce a significant net emissions increase of a pollutant.id.a.similar to the general construction regulations,the psd program employs a permitting process that forbids any owner or operator to commence construction without the necessary approvals or to construct or operate a source or modification inconsistently with the applicable psd permit.id.a.and like the general construction regulations,the emissions limitations established in a psd permit determine the emissions limitations in an operating permit.as the tennessee air pollution control division deputy director put it,the psd permit establishes an initial limit which would be carried over to a separate operating permit and subsequent operating permits until such time that a recision of the psd permit occurred.at styke depo.at.further,tennessee psd program requires that subject sources shall apply best available control technology and shall meet each applicable emissions limitation under the state implementation plan.comp.regs.j.
relevant factual background 
tva,a corporation created by statute with a board of directors appointed by the president,owns and operates the bull run power plant in clinton,tennessee.in,tva performed a major overhaul of the boiler used to produce electricity,in which it replaced approximately feet of tubing inside the boiler.joint appendix at.this quantity amounts to about of the total tubing inside the boiler.tva admits that it never applied for,or obtained,a psd permit under the tennessee sip psd regulations,and does not indicate whether it applied for any other permit before the project.
following an investigation,in november,the epa issued an administrative compliance order aco concluding that the boiler overhaul at bull run constituted a modification of the plant,and therefore triggered the psd provisions of the tennessee sip.tva whitman,cir,cert.denied,d.the aco further required tva to obtain all required permits and enter into a compliance agreement with the epa.id.
after extensive negotiations between tva and the epa and various amendments of the aco,the epa decided to reconsider the aco by adjudicating the issue of whether tva had violated the caa before the epa environmental appeals board eab,which substantially affirmed the aco.id.at.the epa chose to pursue the matter in front of the eab rather than file an enforcement action because it believed that tva could not be sued in federal court.id.at.tva petitioned for review of the eab decision in the eleventh circuit,which ultimately concluded that critical aspects of the aco procedure violated due process.id.at.for this reason,the court further concluded that acos lack legal consequence and can not constitute final agency action.accordingly,the court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute,and that the epa must prove violations of the caa in an enforcement action brought in district court rather than through its aco procedure.id.at.apparently still clinging to its belief that it could not sue tva in federal court,the epa has not pursued such an action.
on february,plaintiffs national parks conservation association national parks and sierra club filed their original complaint.they amended the complaint to add our children earth foundation oce as a plaintiff in november.the essence of their complaint is that tva violated the caa and the tennessee sip by failing to obtain a psd permit before it modified the bull run plant in,and by continuing to operate the plant without such a permit,without having performed the required analysis,and without applying bact.the result of these violations,according to the plaintiffs,is that tva has evaded the appropriate emissions limitations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox.to rectify these alleged wrongdoings,they seek declaratory relief,an injunction,and civil penalties to be paid to the epa.
procedural history 
after national parks and sierra club established organizational standing,the district court stayed all proceedings in april pending resolution of related litigation in the eleventh circuit.see tva united states envtl.prot.agency,cir,op.withdrawn in part,whitman.the district court lifted the stay in july,and the following month,tva moved for summary judgment on its statute of limitations defense.before ruling on tva motion,the district court granted the plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint,which they did in november.
on december,the parties jointly moved the district court to decide tva statute of limitations defense before ruling on its sovereign immunity defense.the district court granted this motion.
after a hearing on tva motion for summary judgment,the district court granted the motion and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice.in its opinion,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs did not establish a continuing violation of the caa and the tennessee sip,that the plaintiffs cause of action accrued in,and because the statute of limitations on the plaintiffs claim for civil penalties had run,the rule barred the plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief.the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration under federal rule of civil procedure e and for leave to amend under rule.on july,the district court denied both motions.the plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment.dicarlo potter,cir.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the district court decision to grant summary judgment,we must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
iii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
a statute of limitations applies to any action for the enforcement of any civil fine,penalty,or forfeiture.the caa provides for civil penalties of per day per violation,b and the plaintiffs first amended complaint seeks such penalties.the plaintiffs now argue that notwithstanding their request for civil penalties,this is not a case for the enforcement of such penalties because tva is immune from liability for civil penalties.
we recently concluded that under any circumstances in which the state or the united states declines to raise sovereign immunity as a threshold defense,the federal courts have discretion to address the defense and the merits in whichever order they prefer.nair oakland county cmty.mental health,cir.here,tva did not raise sovereign immunity as a threshold defense,by way of motion to dismiss.instead,it and,for that matter,the plaintiffs requested that the district court reserve a decision on tva immunity until after the court addressed tva statute of limitations defense.the district court did so,and because it concluded that the plaintiffs claims were,never reached the immunity issue,which therefore is not presently before us.under nair,the district court reserving adjudication of tva immunity defense was within its discretion.accordingly,the plaintiffs request for civil penalties remains part of the operative complaint,and their suit is one for the enforcement of civil penalties.we hold that statute of limitations applies.
continuing violation 
because applies,for their suit to be timely,the plaintiffs must identify a wrongful act that took place within five years of their filing this suit.tva argues,and the district court concluded,that the caa and sip prohibit only construction without a permit.the only construction here at issue tva replacing tubing in the bull run plant boiler took place in so according to tva,the statute of limitations for any violation premised upon that construction ran in.the plaintiffs counter that tva subsequent and continuing failures to apply bact and to obtain a construction permit containing emissions limitations under the tennessee sip psd provisions are actionable.we agree.
both parties,as well as the district court,framed this dispute as one regarding whether the plaintiffs have alleged a continuing violation of the caa.under the doctrine,the court can consider as timely all relevant violations including those that would otherwise be time barred.sharpe cureton,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.see also gandy sullivan county,cir the doctrine may allow a court to impose liability on a defendant for acts committed outside the limitations period.
we previously have said that c ourts have been extremely reluctant to apply this doctrine outside the context of title vii.lrl props.portage metro hous,cir.since then,we nonetheless have applied the doctrine to claims for deprivations of civil rights.see,tolbert ohio dep t of,cir applying theory in action brought under alleging racially discriminatory allocation of highway sound barriers kuhnle,county of geauga,cir considering doctrine in case involving takings claim and due process claims for deprivations of liberty and property.no opinion has articulated a principled reason why the doctrine should be limited to claims for deprivations of civil rights and employment discrimination,and other courts have considered the doctrine in environmental disputes.see,united states duke energy,d concluding violations of the north and south carolina sips psd provisions are continuing violations new york niagara mohawk power,d,concluding violations of federal psd regulations are not continuing violations united states westvaco,d,concluding violations of maryland psd regulations are not continuing violations.
we need not decide whether the doctrine applies in environmental suits,as we conclude this case presents a series of discrete violations rather than a single violation that may or may not be continuing in nature.courts have long distinguished continuing violations,which toll the applicable statutes of limitations,from repetitive discrete violations,which constitute independently actionable individual causes of action.for instance,in gandy,we noted that each check based on a discriminatory method of calculating pay constitutes a separate violation of the equal pay act,and we concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a recovery based on any such checks received within the limitations period.at.we further recognized,although the cause of action is continuing in nature,invocation of the continuing vio
