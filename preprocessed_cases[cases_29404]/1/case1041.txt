opinion of the court 
raritan baykeeper and the edison wetlands association collectively,raritan baykeeper brought this suit under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the clean water act cwa to bring about the remediation of contaminated sediments in the raritan river.the district court,citing the involvement and expertise of the new jersey department of environmental protection,dismissed the action on abstention grounds.we conclude that this case does not call for abstention,and we will vacate the judgment of the district court.
the following facts derive from the complaint,whose allegations we presume true for the purposes of this appeal.from the until,nl industries nl manufactured titanium dioxide pigments on a acre plot of land the site surrounded on three sides by the raritan river.although nl ceased its operations on the site in,it retained ownership of the property and leased portions of it to other companies,who manufactured sulfuric acid on the site.nl continued to own the site until,when the sayreville economic and redevelopment agency sera acquired the site by eminent domain.sera chose properties group,as the site developer and,in turn,formed sayreville seaport associates,ssa to purchase and redevelop the site.sera,ssa,and the county of middlesex entered into an agreement controlling the sale of the site.although the agreement made ssa responsible for most environmental issues at the site,it provided that nl would retain liability for contamination of sediments in the raritan river.the agreement does not,however,call for any remediation of the sediments.
prior to,when nl still owned the site,the company began to address the site environmental issues.in,nl undertook an environmental investigation of the site pursuant to new jersey environmental cleanup responsibility act,which has since been renamed the industrial site recovery act.nl also entered into an administrative consent order with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep,requiring nl to investigate contamination at the site and to perform remediation of certain areas.pursuant to the order,nl collected sediment samples from the raritan river in and and analyzed them for contaminants.sediments from the portions of the river both adjacent to and downstream from the site showed elevated levels of arsenic,copper,lead,and zinc.nl concluded,however,that sources other than the site,such as nearby roadways,were contributing to the pollution of river sediments.
nl submitted its analysis of river sediments to njdep.in,njdep issued a letter in which the agency agreed that sources were contributing to the contamination of river sediments and that any remedial actions conducted in this area of the river should be part of a regional approach.njdep did not require nl to undertake any further investigation or remediation.to date,no such regional approach has been proposed,let alone commenced.in,however,the united states environmental protection agency epa ordered remediation of river sediments upstream from the site.
shortly after the epa action,raritan baykeeper brought this suit against nl,sera,ssa,and an array of government officials and agencies.the complaint asserted claims under section a b of the rcra,a b,and section of the cwa,a.each statute authorizes citizen suits except in certain enumerated circumstances,none of which applies here.among other things,raritan baykeeper sought injunctive relief requiring the defendants to remediate sediments in the raritan river.the defendants moved to dismiss on abstention grounds.the district court granted the motion,concluding that abstention was appropriate under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and under burford sun oil.raritan baykeeper now appeals.
the district court had jurisdiction under the citizen suit provisions of the rcra and cwa,a b and a,respectively.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a district court decision to abstain on primary jurisdiction grounds or under burford for abuse of discretion.see maritime shipping auth.valley freight,cir primary jurisdiction riley simmons,cir burford.we review the district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion,but the district court analysis of the law on abstention is subject to de novo review.riley,at.
before we address the parties arguments on appeal,we write briefly on the statutory background of this case.the rcra and the cwa both authorize citizen suits as a way to ensure their rigorous enforcement.raritan baykeeper brought this suit under the rcra provision authorizing suits 
against any person,including the united states and any other governmental instrumentality or agency,to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution,and including any past or present generator,past or present transporter,or past or present owner or operator of a treatment,storage,or disposal facility,who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
a b.the rcra,however,does not permit citizen suits under certain circumstances.for example,a citizen suit can not proceed if the administrator of the epa or a state is diligently prosecuting an enforcement action through formal proceedings.see id.b b c.
similarly,the cwa authorizes citizen suits 
against any person including i the united states,and ii any other governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the constitution who is alleged to be in violation of a an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter or b an order issued by the administrator or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation.
a.and,like the rcra,the cwa does not allow a citizen suit if the epa administrator or a state is diligently prosecuting an enforcement action.see id.b b.
the parties agree that none of the enumerated exceptions to the citizen suit provisions in the rcra or the cwa applies here.it is therefore undisputed that the district court had jurisdiction over this matter.we must decide whether the district court erred by declining to hear the case for reasons other than those enumerated in the rcra and cwa.
we will first address raritan baykeeper argument that the district court should not have abstained on primary jurisdiction grounds.federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them.river water conservation dist.united states,d.abstention,therefore,is the exception rather than the rule.riley,at.the doctrine of primary jurisdiction 
applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.

while n o fixed formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,the parties and the district court have relied on a test for determining whether a court should abstain on primary jurisdiction grounds.those factors are 
whether the question at issue is within the conventional experience of judges or whether it involves technical or policy considerations within the agency particular field of expertise whether the question at issue is particularly within the agency discretion whether there exists a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings and whether a prior application to the agency has been made.

these factors weigh against the application of primary jurisdiction.the first factor focuses on the competence of the court and the agency to address the matter.while njdep has expertise in environmental matters,federal courts are nonetheless competent to decide cases such as the one before us.congress decided as much when it wrote the rcra and cwa to authorize citizen suits in federal courts.when the matter is not one peculiarly within the agency area of expertise,but
