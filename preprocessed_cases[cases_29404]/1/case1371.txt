after suffering severe injuries in an accidental fall,maurice eugene meyer applied for social security disability insurance benefits.an administrative law judge alj denied the claim,noting that meyer failed to provide an opinion from his treating physician.when meyer requested review of his claim by the appeals council,he submitted a letter from his treating physician detailing the injuries and recommending significant restrictions on meyer activity.the appeals council made this letter part of the record but summarily denied meyer request for review thus,the alj decision denying benefits became the final decision of the commissioner of the social security administration.meyer appeals,contending that the appeals council erred by failing to articulate specific findings justifying its denial of his request for review.we reject that argument.the appeals council need not explain its reasoning when denying review of an alj decision.but because in this case we can not determine,from review of the record as a whole,if substantial evidence supports the denial of benefits,we must reverse and remand for further proceedings.
in december,meyer fell feet out of a deer stand while hunting and suffered significant injuries.he fractured three lumbar vertebrae,which required reconstructive surgery.he also fractured his left wrist and injured his left shoulder,requiring additional surgery.at the time of his fall,meyer was years old and owned and operated a rural feed store.
on december,byron bailey,an attending neurosurgeon at the medical university of south carolina in charleston,performed meyer back surgery.on december,bailey discharged meyer from the hospital,and referred him for physical and occupational therapy.bailey observed meyer in clinic for through the spring of,and reviewed meyer progress through at least april.
following his surgery,meyer underwent extensive physical therapy at the rehabilitation centers of charleston,averaging between five and ten visits per month until his discharge in june.at that time,bailey referred meyer to the hospital pain management clinic.arthur smith,an anesthesiologist,treated meyer in clinic with various injections that provided meyer relief from his pain.in august,however,smith ceased the injections,acknowledging that they failed to provide meyer with any benefit.
on july,meyer filed a claim for disability insurance benefits with the social security administration.after both his initial claim and request for reconsideration were denied,meyer requested a hearing.the alj heard meyer claim and issued an unfavorable decision on june.
in his opinion,the alj followed the federal regulations governing administrative review of social security disability claims,proceeding through the customary sequential analysis.see a.applying the first three steps,the alj determined that meyer had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the date of his accident,had the severe impairments of degenerative disc disease and a history of left wrist injury,but did not have an impairment that meets or medically equals an impairment that the federal regulations define as disabling.
as the regulations instruct,the alj evaluated meyer residual functional capacity before proceeding to step four.see a.the alj concluded that meyer could perform the full range of light work,which involves lifting no more than pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to pounds,and a good deal of walking or standing,or sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.see id.b.in reaching these conclusions,the alj found meyer assertion that he suffered from constant,unrelenting pain not entirely credible because it was inconsistent with the medical evidence of record,including meyer reports to his physicians,and the treatment sought and received.the alj relied on evidence that between august and june,meyer reported improvements in his condition,decreased pain,and less use of pain medication,and clinical observations that during this time meyer was in no apparent distress and appeared generally healthy.the alj also cited a june physical therapy discharge form noting that meyer was able to perform his activities of daily living independently had no restrictions and could ambulate independently.further,the alj considered meyer testimony that he was able to drive and assist his wife in caring for their horses and dog,and evidence suggesting that meyer continued,although to a lesser degree,to ride horseback and operate his tractor.
the alj emphasized that g iven the claimant allegations of totally disabling symptoms,one might expect to see some indication in the treatment records of restrictions placed on the claimant by a treating physician,yet a review of the records reveals no such restrictions.meyer had asserted before the alj that although he sought opinions from bailey and smith,his treating physicians,it was their policy not to provide such opinion evidence in these types of proceedings.meyer did submit the findings of barry weissglass,who,at meyer request,performed an independent occupational evaluation of meyer in november.weissglass opined that meyer was incapable of performing the functions of light work and recommended restrictions on his activities that were consistent with that finding,including that meyer not lift more than pounds and refrain from extended sitting or standing.however,the alj accorded weissglass opinion only minimal evidentiary weight as it is inconsistent with the other evidence of record,that detailed above.
proceeding to step four of the analysis,the alj concluded that meyer was unable to perform his past relevant work of operating a rural feed store or being a marine machinist.at the fifth and final step,the alj considered meyer residual functional capacity for light work,his age of years,and his limited education,and,based on the medical vocational guidelines,which take administrative notice of the availability of job types in the national economy,concluded that meyer was not disabled.see pt,subpt.p,app.
after issuance of the alj decision on june,meyer timely sought review by the appeals council.with his request for review,meyer submitted new evidence not before the alj,including an opinion letter from his treating physician,bailey,dated august.in the letter,bailey described meyer back injury and surgery and explained that meyer post operative course has been complicated by chronic,debilitating back pain which was anticipated due to the magnitude of his injury.bailey opined that meyer long term restrictions include no lifting greater than pounds,avoid bending,stooping,squatting,and no sitting,standing or walking for more than minutes without rest periods.he explained that meyer will continue to require frequent and medical management and will likely require further surgical intervention in the future.at the close of his letter,bailey noted his agreement with the majority of weissglass findings.
on october,the appeals council denied meyer request for review.in doing so,the appeals council noted that it made bailey letter a part of the record.but in the notice of appeals council action,the appeals council found that this information does not provide a basis for changing the alj decision and so the alj decision is the final decision of the commissioner of social security in meyer case.
meyer then filed this action.a magistrate judge recommended affirmance of the commissioner decision,concluding,inter alia,that bailey letter should be accorded only minimal weight because he was not one of meyer treating physicians.meyer objected to the magistrate recommendation but the district court entered a final order affirming the commissioner decision.meyer timely noted this appeal.
as the appeals council properly informed meyer,because it denied review,the decision of the alj became the final decision of the commissioner.wilkins sec y,dep t of health human servs,cir en banc see also sims apfel.we uphold the factual findings underpinning the commissioner final decision if they are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standard.cr
