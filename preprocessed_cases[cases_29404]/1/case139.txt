petitioner lyle craker,a professor at the university of massachusetts,seeks review of an order from the drug enforcement administration dea denying his application for registration to cultivate marijuana for medical research.after review of the administrative record,we deny the petition.
statutory landscape 
in an effort to consolidate the nation drug laws and increase federal enforcement capabilities,congress enacted the comprehensive drug abuse and prevention and control act in.see gonzales.raich.included within that act was the controlled substances act csa,a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illegal drugs.id.at.while observing that many drugs within the purview of the csa have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the american people,congress also determined that the health and welfare of americans were detrimentally affected by t he illegal importation,manufacture,distribution,and possession and improper use of controlled substances.id.
consonant with these concerns,congress devised a closed regulatory scheme making it unlawful to manufacture,distribute,dispense,or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the csa.raich,at citing a,a.under this regime,controlled substances were organized into five schedules,reflective of their accepted medical uses,their potential for abuse,and their psychological and physical effects.id.at.congress placed marijuana in schedule i,the most stringently controlled group.c a schedule i drug has a high potential for abuse,has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states,and lacks accepted safety for use under medical supervision.id.b.
the manufacture of a schedule i substance is a criminal offense unless the manufacturer has registered with the attorney general.id.a the csa provides that the attorney shall register an applicant to manufacture substances in schedule i or ii if he determines that such registration is consistent with the public interest and with united states obligations under international treaties,conventions or protocols in effect on may.id.a.the public interest determination must be based on the following statutory factors 
maintenance of effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances and any controlled substance in schedule i or ii compounded therefrom into other than legitimate medical,scientific,research,or industrial channels,by limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical,scientific,research,and industrial purposes 
compliance with applicable state and local law 
promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing these substances and the development of new substances 
prior conviction record of applicant under federal and state laws relating to the manufacture,distribution,or dispensation of such substances 
past experience in the manufacture of controlled substances,and the existence in the establishment of effective control against diversion 
such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.
id.a.the applicant carries the burden of proof at any administrative hearing on a registration application.a.
since,the national center for natural products research ncnpr at the university of mississippi has held the necessary registration and a government contract to grow marijuana for research purposes lyle craker,drug enforcement admin,denial of application craker ii.the contract is administered by the national institute on drug abuse nida,a component of the national institutes of health nih,which,in turn,is a component of the department of health and human services hhs.id.the contract is opened for competitive bidding every five years.id.the ncnpr is the only entity registered by the dea to manufacture marijuana.lyle craker,drug enforcement admin,opinion,recommended ruling and decision craker i.
among the international treaties,conventions or protocols referred to in section a,the csa implements the provisions of the single convention on narcotic drugs,single convention,in an effort to establish effective control over international and domestic traffic in controlled substances.u.as relevant to this proceeding,article of the single convention addresses cultivation of marijuana referred to therein by its taxonomic genus,cannabis with reference to the system of controls as provided in article respecting the control of the opium poppy.pursuant to article,any signatory nation that permits the cultivation of marijuana or opium must designate one or more agencies to license cultivators and designate where plants may be grown purchase and take physical possession of each year crops and have the exclusive right of importing,exporting,wholesale trading and maintaining stocks other than those held by manufacturers of opium alkaloids,medicinal opium or opium preparations.
ii.adjudication of craker application 
craker,a professor in the university of massachusetts department of plant,soil and insect sciences,applied to the dea for registration to manufacture marijuana for clinical research in.at the dea request,he supplemented his application in august.he stated that a second source of plant material is needed to facilitate privately funded food and drug administration fda approved research into medical uses of marijuana,ensuring a choice of sources and an adequate supply of quality,marijuana for medicinal applications.craker ii.at.craker indicated that his production costs would be underwritten by a grant from the multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies maps,a,research and education organization seeking to develop marijuana into an prescription medicine.id.at.
in december,a dea official issued an order to show cause,proposing the denial of craker registration application.id.at see c a,c.the order first concluded that craker registration would not be consistent with the public interest as that term is used in a.craker ii.at.the order also concluded that registration would be inconsistent with the united states obligations under the single convention.id.craker timely requested a hearing,see d,which was conducted by an administrative law judge alj over nine days in august and december.see generally outlining hearing procedures.
in february,the alj issued an page opinion,recommending that the dea grant craker application.craker i.the alj first concluded that the single convention was not a bar to craker registration,noting that it appeared that marijuana grown by the ncnpr or any other registrant for use in research would qualify as either medicinal or special stocks under the treaty,and thus not be prohibited by a government monopoly requirement.see craker i at craker ii.at.
the alj also found that craker application satisfied the public interest requirements of a.the alj first noted a dispute that we will revisit whether,as craker asserts,the adequately competitive conditions requirement of section a must be disregarded if there has been a finding that the applicant can maintain effective controls against diversion.craker i at craker ii.at see noramco of,drug enforcement agency,noting dea position that supply and competition can be disregarded if registration does not increase risk of diversion.
the government position with respect to craker application was and is that both the diversion and criteria must be satisfied.without resolving the issue,the alj considered both factors,concluding that craker had adequately proven that there is minimal risk that any marijuana he cultivated would be diverted.with respect to supply,the alj found that researchers had not experienced difficulty obtaining marijuana from ncnpr when it was needed.nevertheless,the alj found the supply to be inadequate because nida refused to supply some researchers who held dea registrations and approvals from hhs.finally,the alj concluded that the competitive bidding process for renewing the single extant nida marijuana contract did not amount to adequate competition within the meaning of the statute.
after finding that craker satisfied all but one of the remaining statutory factors promotion of technical advances under section a the alj recommended that his application be granted.
in january,the dea deputy administrator administrator rejected the alj recommendation and denied craker application.craker ii.at.turning first to the single convention,the administrator concluded that craker application evinced an intent to distribute marijuana outside the hhs system.id.at.in support of this finding,the administrator noted that one of craker putative colleagues,maps president rick doblin,testified that w hat we trying to do is get the public health service and nida out of the picture.id.at.craker intent,the administrator ruled,is to elide the very government monopoly over the wholesale distribution of marijuana that the single convention demands.thus,from the outset craker proposed registration can not be reconciled with united states obligations under the treaty.id.at.
the administrator additionally rejected craker assertion that his plans fell within the single convention medicinal opium exception both because marijuana currently has no accepted use in the united states,id.at,and that even if considered analogous to medicinal opium,craker proposal would run afoul of the single convention central theme,that a single national agency must control the distribution and production of raw marijuana used for research.id.at.
next,the administrator found that granting craker application would not be within the public interest,as required by a.in so doing,the administrator first agreed with the alj that the dea had inconsistently construed section a in the past,at times calling for consideration of supply and competition regardless of the potential for diversion and at other times ignoring adequacy of supply and competition if effective diversion controls were in place.id.at.after a lengthy disquisition on the issue,id.at,the administrator determined that a registrant must prove both that effective controls against diversion are in place and that supplies and competition are inadequate.id.at the alternative interpretation,though found to be permissible,provides no mechanism to prevent the proliferation of bulk suppliers beyond that necessary to adequately supply these materials under adequately competitive conditions.this heightens the risk of oversupply,which,in turn increases the risk of diversion.
the administrator then concluded that the existing supply and quality of marijuana was adequate,observing that nida had been able to successfully supply research efforts and that the nida denials cited by craker were not due to insufficient supply,but rather were due to lack of scientific merit.id.at.the administrator further accepted the alj finding that the existing marijuana supply was of sufficient quality to meet the research community needs,id.at,observing further that craker opposing anecdotal evidence of shortcomings in taste,potency and freshness was countered by evidence of researchers overall satisfaction with marijuana received from nida.id.at.
in addressing the adequately competitive conditions criterion,the administrator focused on cost,noting that nida provided marijuana either at cost to researchers or for free to researchers,at no profit to nida.id.at.thus,craker could not claim that his entry into manufacturing would lower costs to researchers,beyond a generalized reference to the idea that more competition would lead to lower costs,a claim which itself was belied by the fact that,as maps president doblin noted,maps costs would be affected by its own motivation.id.as a final consideration under section a,the administrator accepted the government reasoning that the process by which the nida marijuana contract was opened periodically for competitive bidding helped to ensure adequate competition.id.at.
the administrator next accepted the alj recommendations concerning sections,and of a,agreeing that craker had adequately demonstrated that he would abide by applicable laws,that he had failed to demonstrate that his proposed activities would promote scientific advancements in the field,and that he had never been convicted of violating any controlled substance law.id.at.with respect to section a,the administrator noted that while craker had no experience in the manufacture of controlled substances,he would have satisfactory diversion control in place.id.at.finally,the administrator concluded that doblin admission that he regularly smoked marijuana in violation of federal drug laws and that he was to play a central role in the proposed manufacturing operation was another factor weighing against craker application.id.at a.
the administrator ultimately concluded that any one of three negative findings could provide a compelling basis to deny the application conflict with the single convention existing adequate supply and competition and doblin conduct and involvement.craker ii.at.concurrent with the denial,however,the administrator also granted craker fifteen days in which to file a motion for reconsideration to refute any facts of which the administrator had taken official notice during the proceedings.id.at see e.
availing himself of the opportunity,craker filed a motion for reconsideration in january.he also requested that the hearing be reopened for him to call additional witnesses.on february,the administrator issued an order permitting further briefing and stating that she would decide on the basis of those submissions whether to grant craker request to reopen the administrative hearing or grant his request for reconsideration.in december,the administrator denied the request to reopen the hearing,but allowed craker to further supplement the record and to raise new arguments.in august,the administrator denied the motion for reconsideration.lyle craker,drug enforcement admin,order regarding officially noticed evidence and motion for reconsideration craker iii.
the administrator rejected claims that craker had made alleging political and institutional bias,as well as his argument that the fda,rather than nida,should assess registration applications under.id.at.the administrator also reiterated the finding that craker registration would be inconsistent with the single convention.id.at.at the same time,the administrator backed away somewhat from the previous conclusion with respect to doblin,observing that some controls could conceivably be put into place to alleviate concerns over his personal use of marijuana,but that the other grounds for denial of the application rendered analysis of that issue unnecessary.id.at.
the final pieces of the background puzzle emerge from craker initial filing with us after the dea issued craker ii.on february,while his motion for reconsideration was pending,craker filed a petition for review of craker ii in this court,pursuant to.at the same time,he filed a motion to stay the appellate proceedings and hold them in abeyance,which we granted on march,until such time as the motion for reconsideration before the administrator was acted on.in his appellate motion,craker indicated that the goal of the motion was to preserve his appeal rights in the event that craker ii was deemed to be a final decision within the meaning of,thus triggering the statute day deadline for seeking judicial review.on august,after receiving notification that craker iii had been issued,we lifted the abeyance and permitted the petition for review to proceed.
iii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the government argues that we are without jurisdiction to address the merits of craker petition.its jurisdictional theory starts with the fact that congress has permitted judicial review only of final agency decisions.see also john doe,drug enforcement,final decision requirement under is jurisdictional in nature fry drug enforcement,cir nutt drug enforcement,cir same.the government position is that the only final decision is craker iii,from which craker did not seek review.while the government acknowledges that craker did seek review of craker ii,it argues that the pendency of the motion for agency reconsideration of that decision deprived the order of finality,and thus us of jurisdiction.the premature petition for review,the government further contends,did not ripen so as to vest us with jurisdiction once the agency issued its final decision on reconsideration.
the government relies on a rule,established by the circuit and adopted by others,whereby a petition for review filed during the pendency of a motion for agency reconsideration is incurably premature and in effect a nullity.gorman ntsb,internal quotation omitted accord council tree commc,fcc,cir.in the cases in which that rule has been applied,however,either the governing statute or the implementing regulations expressly provided for agency reconsideration.see,council tree commc,at petition for reconsideration of fcc order pursuant to clifton power ferc,motion for rehearing and reconsideration of ferc order pursuant to b.no similar procedural guarantee existed here,which is why craker filed his protective petition with us.nevertheless,the government argues that the facts of this case still favor applying the incurably premature rule.the administrator expressly afforded craker the opportunity to refute the facts of which she had taken official notice by filing a motion for reconsideration and,after craker availed himself of that opportunity and also sought broader reconsideration of the order,permitted him to file supplemental briefing.accordingly,the government argues,craker appeal was premature despite the fact that neither the csa nor dea implementing regulations provide for a motion for reconsideration 
it is not clear that even those courts that have adopted the maturation rule would apply it here,where the opportunity granted to the petitioner was limited to contesting facts of which the agency had taken official notice,while broader reconsideration of the factual and legal bases for the agency final order remained only,at the time of the filing of the petition for review,a mere possibility.see supra noting that the administrator february,order withheld judgment on the propriety of craker motion for reconsideration.in concluding that,where a party original petition for review of an agency order was unripe,that party must file a new petition upon disposition of its motion for reconsideration,the circuit explained 
we develop this bright line test to discourage the filing of petitions for review until after the agency completes the reconsideration process.if a party determines to seek reconsideration of an agency ruling,it is a pointless waste of judicial energy for the court to process any petition for review before the agency has acted on the request for reconsideration.
telestar,fcc.
the circuit has,however,declined to apply the rule where the motion for reconsideration was not timely filed.that is because,at least where the agency does not consider the merits of the tardy request,there is no possibility that the order complained of will be modified in any way which renders judicial review unnecessary.see gorman,at internal quotation omitted.similarly,the possibility of concurrent jurisdiction and the judicial economy concerns that arise from it,while not wholly eliminated,are considerably diminished in cases,such as this one,in which reconsideration may or may not have been permitted in the agency discretion.see craker iii.at explaining the decision to permit reconsideration as an exercise of the administrator discretion see also city of.springs solis,cir concluding that the rule announced in icc of locomotive eng,whereby the timely filing of a motion for administrative reconsideration renders the underlying order for purposes of judicial review,is not applicable in this case because the agency has not established a rehearing or reconsideration procedure for the type of order at issue.
moreover,such jurisdictional concerns are further alleviated here,because we suspended and then resumed consideration of a petition for review upon completion of the reconsideration process.as the supreme court has observed,a stay is as much a refusal to exercise federal jurisdiction as a dismissal.moses cone mem.hosp.mecury const,see also in re graves,concluding that although the court can not exercise jurisdiction over the appeal before the agency enters its reconsideration decision,its jurisdiction was,in effect,suspended until the agency acted northside sanitary landfill,thomas,cir once our jurisdiction has been timely invoked by a petition for review,it makes little sense to require an amendment to the petition to preserve that jurisdiction only because the agency has ruled on the motion for reconsideration.
given that,in the circumstances of this case,holding the petition in abeyance served equally the interests of judicial economy,we are not persuaded that we should impose a bright line test requiring dismissal or amendment of a petition filed during the pendency of a motion for reconsideration,at least where the reconsideration process is ad hoc,as here.we also hesitate to apply such a rule retroactively in any event.see telestar,at giving newly adopted incurably premature rule prospective effect only see generally crowe bolduc,cir noting that in determining whether to give a new rule prospective effect,we consider,among other factors,whether retroactive application give s rise to a substantial inequity.accordingly,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider craker petition for review and turn to the merits 
chevron analysis 
in reviewing the administrator decision,we first address whether congress has unambiguously spoken to the precise question that is at issue,chevron,natural resources defense council.if it turns out that the statute is ambiguous,then chevron deference must be afforded the agency interpretation of the statute will be upheld as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in the end,we may set aside the administrator decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,not supported by substantial evidence,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.nlrb reg home care,cir see also a,e.a decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins.we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency,even if we disagree with its conclusions.river street donuts,llc napolitano,cir.here,to set the stage for the chevron analysis,we engage in a more detailed review of the decision at issue.
as previously noted,the administrator rejected craker application both because it was inconsistent with the single convention and because it did not meet the public interest requirement of.because we resolve the matter under section,we need not review the arguments relative to the single convention,since failure to satisfy either is fatal to craker claim.a.
in analyzing the csa,the administrator first compared congress treatment of schedule i and ii substances in section a with that of schedule iii,iv and v substances,as set forth in section d.notably,the two statutory sections contain identical public interest factors,except that in section d which deals with substances that congress regards as less dangerous there is no reference as there is in section a to limiting supply and competitive conditions.unlike considerations with respect to less dangerous drugs,then,according to the administrator,section a explicitly sets out both congress stated purpose to maintain effective controls against diversion and how it intends that the objective is to be achieved by limiting the number of manufacturers to that which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply under adequately competitive prices.craker ii.at.moreover,the administrator also found that section a mandate to consider the existence in the establishment of effective contr
