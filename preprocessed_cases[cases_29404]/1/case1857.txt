on february,the oakwood deposit bank company oakwood failed.the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic was immediately appointed as receiver.on the following day,the fdic signed a purchase and assumption agreement p a agreement with state bank and trust company state bank that caused the insured deposits of oakwood to be transferred to state bank.a group of partially uninsured depositors collectively referred to as the uninsured depositors filed a complaint in state court against state bank in an attempt to recover the value of their uninsured deposits.
the fdic removed the case to federal district court.despite a ruling on the merits by the district court,this court on appeal subsequently ordered that the judgment be vacated and the case remanded to the state court because the fdic was not yet a party when it had sought removal.after remand,state bank filed a complaint against the fdic,seeking indemnification under the terms of the p a agreement.the state court allowed the complaint,following which the fdic again removed the case to federal district court.state bank and the fdic then renewed their motions to dismiss the uninsured depositors claims or for summary judgment,and the uninsured depositors once more filed a motion to remand.
the district court granted state bank and the fdic motions for summary judgment,finding that the uninsured depositors had failed to comply with the relevant statutory scheme for bringing their claims.it also denied the uninsured depositors motion to remand,finding that federal jurisdiction was proper over the entire dispute.those two decisions have been appealed by the uninsured depositors.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
this court aptly summarized the relevant facts of this case during the initial appeal 
the day after oakwood deposit bank company oakwood was placed in federal receivership,the fdic,as receiver,entered into a purchase and assumption agreement for state bank and trust state bank to take over oakwood insured deposits and some of its assets.using the best information available at the time,the fdic set at four million dollars the premium state bank would pay for these assets mostly loans and liabilities deposits.two weeks later,the fdic returned half of the four million dollar premium to state bank because it had overvalued some of the assets transferred to state bank.further investigation of oakwood records disclosed that insured deposits were nearly sixty million dollars more than previously thought.these additional deposits were liabilities of the receivership,not state bank.
village of oakwood and a handful of individuals and businesses with deposits exceeding the fdic insurance limit,collectively the uninsured depositors,filed suit in an ohio court.though the complaint alleged that the fdic breached its fiduciary duty by not using the four million dollar premium to cover their losses,it named state bank,rather than the fdic,as defendant and alleged four ohio causes of action successor liability state bank being the successor of oakwood,aiding and abetting the fdic breach of its fiduciary duty,equitable constructive trust,and contract.

the fdic also alleged that,following the transfer of the insured deposits to state bank,it issued receivership certificates for the portions of the accounts that exceeded the insurance limit.receivership certificates entitle the holder to a pro rata share of any remaining money following the payment of secured creditors and administrative expenses.the fdic,in its role as receiver,is entitled to the same pro rata share as the other holders of receivership certificates.at the time of briefing in this case,the fdic records reflected that the uninsured depositors had been paid dividends equal to of their outstanding claims.moreover,the fdic states that further payments may be possible,although it offers no predictions as to the amount or the timing of such payments.
procedural background 
the uninsured depositors filed their initial complaint against state bank in the ohio court of common pleas in december of.in the state court,the fdic filed a motion to intervene and to be substituted for state bank as the defendant.before the motion to intervene was ruled on by the state court,the fdic filed a notice of removal to the federal district court pursuant to b b.the uninsured depositors subsequently filed a motion to remand.
initially,the district court granted the uninsured depositors motion.the court then reconsidered,granted the fdic motion to intervene,and ultimately granted summary judgment to state bank and the fdic.on appeal,this court reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the case to the state court.remand was necessary because the fdic had removed the case before the state court had granted the fdic motion to intervene,a defect that was not cured by the district court subsequent grant of the fdic motion to intervene in the federal proceedings.village of oakwood,at.
following the remand to the state court in june of,state bank filed a complaint against the fdic.state bank sought indemnification from the fdic on the basis of the p a agreement between them.after the state court accepted the complaint,the fdic again removed the case to federal district court,having now become a party to the lawsuit.state bank and the fdic once more moved to dismiss the uninsured depositors claims or for summary judgment,and the uninsured depositors moved to remand the case to state court.while those motions were pending,the parties filed a report of their planning conference,wherein they agreed that the formation of a discovery plan was premature until the pending dispositive motions have been ruled upon.
the district court,in october of,denied the uninsured depositors motion to remand and granted the motions of state bank and the fdic for summary judgment.this timely appeal followed.

b.the district court jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,the uninsured depositors argue that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the case,and that it therefore incorrectly denied their motion to remand to the state court.the uninsured depositors contend that exclusive jurisdiction over state bank complaint lies in the court of federal claims pursuant to the tucker act.accordingly,the uninsured depositors assert that the complaint should have been dismissed and the case remanded to the state court.
state bank and the fdic argue in response that the tucker act does not provide the sole grant of federal jurisdiction to claims brought against the fdic.they contend that the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea,stat,which specifically governs the fdic,provides a broad grant of jurisdiction pursuant to that is not preempted by the tucker act.state bank and the fdic therefore contend that the uninsured depositors motion to remand was properly denied.
the little tucker act,grants original jurisdiction to t he district courts,concurrent with the united states court of federal claims,of a ny civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.but the tucker act itself grants exclusive jurisdiction to the court of federal claims for contract claims against the united states that exceed.see auction of am.fdic,auction.i for contract cases,the little tucker act gives the district courts jurisdiction,concurrent with the court of federal claims,if the amount sought is less than.if more than is at issue,the suits lie only in the court of federal claims under the tucker act proper.according to the uninsured depositors,the claims made by state bank against the fdic in the complaint are,as a matter of law,contract claims against the united states that exceed.they therefore argue that jurisdiction over the complaint should lie exclusively in the court of federal claims.
firrea,on the other hand,contains a broad waiver of sovereign immunity directly applicable to the fdic,whereby that entity has the power to sue and be sued,and complain and defend,by and through its own attorneys,in any court of law or equity,state or federal.a fourth the sue and be sued clause.the statute further provides that all civil suits in which the fdic is a party in any capacity shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the united states the deemer clause,and that the fdic has the power to remove any action,suit,or proceeding from a state court to the appropriate united states district court.b a b.as this court explained during the first appeal in this case,u nder b,if a case or controversy includes any claim to which the fdic is a party,the district court has jurisdiction over the entire case or controversy.village of oakwood,at emphasis in original.
the jurisdictional argument of state bank and the fdic,which is based on the language of firrea,is straightforward the claims against the fdic arise under the laws of the united states,and the fdic properly exercised its power to remove the action from a state court to the appropriate united states district court.b.after this case was remanded to the state court as a result of the first appeal,state bank filed its complaint against the fdic.thus the concern expressed during the first appeal of this case that t he fdic has not asserted any claims against a party,nor has any party asserted claims against the fdic,is no longer relevant.village of oakwood,at.
the uninsured depositors respond by arguing that the caselaw from this and other circuits clearly indicates that the tucker act preempts firrea with respect to jurisdiction over contract claims brought against the fdic,so that state bank complaint can be heard only by the court of federal claims.according to the uninsured depositors,t he law in three other circuits is that claims such as those in the complaint are,as a matter of law,claims against the united states and therefore belong in the court of federal claims.our own analysis of the relevant cases leads us to the opposite conclusion.
neither state bank nor the fdic dispute the fact that claims against the fdic can be considered claims against the united states,nor do they dispute that state bank claims against the fdic are based on contract law.but these two undisputed facts do not answer the relevant question of whether the tucker act requires that all contract claims against the fdic exceeding be brought in the court of federal claims,or whether firrea provides an alternative source of jurisdiction.a review of the cases cited by the parties demonstrates that the weight of authority lies in favor of concluding that the sue and be sued clause of firrea provides an alternative source of jurisdiction in cases such as the present one.
the circuit squarely addressed this issue in auction.i,a case that the uninsured depositors cite for the proposition that b ecause the amount of state bank claim against the fdic exceeds,it can only be brought in the court of federal claims under the tucker act.in fact,however,the circuit reached no such conclusion in auction.i.that case involved a suit against the fdic to enforce a contract that the auction company of america had made with the fdic statutory predecessor,the resolution trust corporation rtc.at issue was the determination of the proper statute of limitations for the suit against the rtc.the fdic argued that the district of columbia statute of limitations for the enforcement of contracts applied,while auction company contended that the statute of limitations for suits against the united states was applicable.
auction company advanced a jurisdictional argument that is essentially identical to the position of state bank and the fdic in the present case.the circuit explained that the case was not a tucker act suit,and that 
auction company finds a waiver of sovereign immunity in fdic enabling legislation,the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,which empowers it to sue and be sued in any court of law or equity,state or federal.a fourth see also united states nordic village,d such clauses are broad waivers of immunity.and auction company finds subject matter jurisdiction in firrea deemer clause,b a,which provides with an exception not relevant here that all actions to which the fdic is a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the united states.district courts can thus hear these actions as part of the arising under jurisdiction granted by.
auction.i,at.the circuit adopted this argument,explicitly rejecting the contention presently advanced by the uninsured depositors that the tucker act requires suits such as the complaint by state bank to be filed in the court of federal claims.id.at.
in declining to adopt the fdic argument that a distinction should be drawn between suits against governmental agencies and suits against the united states,the auction.i court noted that 
d istinguishing between suits against agencies and those against the united states would frequently be necessary if tucker act jurisdiction were is,if tucker act jurisdiction by its mere existence barred jurisdiction granted by another statute.it does not.if a separate waiver of sovereign immunity and grant of jurisdiction exist,district courts may hear cases over which,under the tucker act alone,the court of federal claims would have exclusive jurisdiction.
we conclude,as did the auction.i court,that 
a s a consequence of the different waivers of immunity available,plaintiffs suing the fdic have a fairly wide choice of forum,at least if they sue in contract.they may bring suit in the court of federal claims,if they have a tucker act suit for more than they may bring a tucker act suit for a lesser amount in either the court of federal claims or a district court and they may sue in any court of law or equity under the fdic clause.
the uninsured depositors reliance on auction of america fdic,auction.ii,is also misplaced.according to their argument,auction.ii stands for the proposition that the fdic as receiver counts as the united states for tucker act purposes.although the circuit in auction.ii indeed reached this conclusion,it did so in the broad context of revisiting the jurisdictional issues that were first addressed in auction.i.the court said that the fdic counts as the united states for purposes of the tucker act,but went on to explain that this fact does not,standing alone,establish tucker act jurisdiction over the fdic as receiver.auction.ii,at.moreover,the court reiterated the jurisdictional holding of auction.i,which looked to the fdic clause for a waiver of immunity and found subject matter jurisdiction based on firrea.id.both auction.i and auction.ii,therefore,support the argument of state bank and the fdic that firrea provides an independent jurisdictional basis for claims against the fdic.
interestingly enough,the federal circuit itself has endorsed the jurisdictional argument advanced by state bank and the fdic.in far west federal bank,director,office of thrift supervision,the fdic was the party presenting the argument now advanced by the uninsured depositors that congress in the tucker act showed its intention to exclude contract claims from sue and be sued clauses.id.at.but the court rejected the fdic argument.it explained that t his position is contravened by the variety of claims for monetary relief which have been brought under sue and be sued clauses.id.the court cautioned against finding implied restrictions on sue and be sued clauses because the clauses reflect congressional intention that judicial remedy not be withheld when governmental agencies enter into transactions with the public.id.at.
sue and be sued clauses in an agency enabling legislation are correctly viewed as coextensive with the statutory assignment of the agency,absent a specific restriction to the contrary.id.at.ultimately,the federal circuit concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims for rescission and restitution both claims.see also karstens,fdic,table,wl,at,relying on far west in holding that firrea sue and be sued clause constitutes a waiver of immunity over a district court suit involving money damages on a contractual claim.
the tenth circuit is the only circuit that initially adopted the argument that the tucker act provides the sole grant of jurisdiction over contract claims against the fdic.in farha fdic,cir,the court affirmed the district court conclusion that it did not have jurisdiction over the plaintiff contract claim because t he united states claims court has exclusive jurisdiction over contract actions where the amount in controversy exceeds.id.at.this conclusion was reached without any analysis of the potential jurisdiction over the claim under the sue and be sued clause of firrea,despite the plaintiff argument that he was seeking jurisdiction pursuant to that clause.
the holding in farha,however,was effectively overruled two years later in fdic hulsey,cir.in hulsey,the court relied in part on far west to conclude that the sue and be sued clause constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity for contract claims against the fdic.id.at.the court acknowledged farha holding that the claims court has exclusive jurisdiction over contract actions against the fdic where the amount in controversy exceeds.id.at.but it also observe d that farha did not consider,nor did it discuss,the exception found within the sue and be sued clause of firrea.id.in an analysis that closely mirrored that undertaken by the circuit and the federal circuit,the tenth circuit in hulsey held that the claims at issue in farha,which were in the form of counterclaims based on contract,fall within the sue and be sued clause of firrea.id.
the uninsured depositors next contend that this court decision in campanella commerce exchange bank,cir,controls the jurisdictional issue here.in campanella,we affirmed the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a contract claim against the small business administration sba despite a sue and be sued clause in the sba statutory framework.id.at.the court concluded that the contract disputes act cda grants exclusive jurisdiction to the court of federal claims for contract claims exceeding brought against executive agencies.id.at.but the fdic is not an executive agency as defined in,which includes wholly owned government corporation s as defined by.rather,the fdic is designated as a government corporation in.
moreover,the cda purports to provide final and exclusive resolution of all disputes arising from government contracts covered by the statute,and it is the paradigm of a precisely drawn,detailed statute that preempts more general jurisdictional provisions.campanella,at quoting brown gsa,d.the uninsured depositors have made no attempt to argue that the tucker act similarly purports to provide final and exclusive resolution of all contract claims against the fdic or that it is the paradigm of a precisely drawn,detailed statute.
in the present case,firrea is the precisely drawn,detailed statute with regard to the fdic,and the tucker act is essentially the paradigm of a general jurisdictional provision,granting jurisdiction to the court of federal claims over all claim s against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.a.given the fact that campanella involved a statutory framework that is inapplicable to the instant action,that case does not demonstrate that this court has already rejected the jurisdiction argument of state bank and the fdic.
the uninsured depositors have raised one other rather complicated and confusing argument regarding the district court jurisdiction.essentially,the uninsured depositors contend that the district court concluded that firrea deprived the state court of jurisdiction,so the district court should have dismissed state bank claims against the fdic and remanded the case to state court.the uninsured depositors read the following excerpt from the district court order as indicative of this conclusion 
in addition to pursuing claims via the administrative process,claimants can file suit on such claim in the district court d a ii.thus,nothing would have stopped the discovering if it is indeed the case that they could not obtain redress via administrative filing suit in district court as allowed under d.
with due respect to the uninsured depositors,this excerpt can not be plausibly read as a conclusion that the state court lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.in fact,neither the parties nor the district court have previously asserted that the state court lacked jurisdiction.the relevant issue in addressing the uninsured depositors motion to remand is whether the federal district court had jurisdiction.that issue can be resolved without any analysis of the potential jurisdiction of the state court.
the uninsured depositors reliance on kircher putnam funds trust,d,for the proposition that w hether a federal statute precludes jurisdiction in state court is for the state court to determine on remand is also misplaced.tellingly,the uninsured depositors have not provided a pinpoint citation,nor quoted any language from the kircher opinion,to support their argument.kircher is in fact not relevant to this case.the supreme court in kircher addressed the scope of federal appellate jurisdiction over a district court decision to remand a case to the state court based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.at.explaining that the question in the case was whether an order remanding a case removed under the securities litigation uniform standards act of is appealable,notwithstanding the general statutory prohibition against appellate review of a district court order remanding a case from federal to state court.
the kircher court did not have occasion to make the ruling that the uninsured depositors contend was made in that case because neither the district court nor the seventh circuit had concluded that a federal statute precluded the state court jurisdiction.rather,the district court had decided that there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction,and the seventh circuit concluded that it could review that decision.the supreme court reversed the seventh circuit because the district court decision was purely jurisdictional and therefore unreviewable.id.at.the work done is jurisdictional,as is the conclusion reached and the order implementing it.footnote omitted.
in the only part of the opinion that comes close to addressing the uninsured depositors present jurisdictional argument,the supreme court discussed the ramifications of its decision on the federal courts jurisdiction over whether federal statutes preclude action regarding particular claims.even if the uninsured depositors are arguing that firrea has a preclusive effect over actions in state court an argument that they do not explicitly make,the kircher court explained that 
a district court does not have the last word on preclusion under the act,for nothing in the act gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over preclusion decisions.a covered action is removable if it is precluded,and a defendant can enlist the federal judiciary to decide preclusion,but a defendant can elect to leave a case where the plaintiff filed it and trust the state court an equally competent body to make the preclusion determination.
