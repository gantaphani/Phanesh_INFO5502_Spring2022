the plaintiffs,carl and mary sue mclaughlin,filed suit in district court pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act,et,seeking to overturn the order of a state hearing review officer in favor of the defendant school board in a dispute over the individualized education program iep for their daughter,emma mclaughlin,that had been proposed by holt public schools for the school year.the district court reversed the administrative ruling,holding that the school system must afford the child the appropriate educational program outlined in the iep at the school in her neighborhood rather than the facility some distance from her home that was identified by the defendants as the most appropriate educational setting for a student with emma particular needs.this placement,the district court ruled,constituted the least restrictive environment under the requirements of the act.
because we conclude that the district court analysis of the least restrictive environment mandate was flawed,and because the court applied the incorrect burden of proof and failed to give due weight to the administrative decision on issues of educational policy,we find it necessary to reverse the judgment below.
factual and procedural background 
the individuals with disabilities education act provides federal funds to help states educate disabled students.see.a state receiving funds under the act is required to provide a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities residing in the state.id.at a.under the act,an individualized education program must be developed for each child with a disability,including statements of the child present level of educational performance,measurable annual goals,and the special education and related services as well as supplementary aids and services that will be provided to the child.id.at d a.the plan is developed by the iep team,which includes the child parents,as well as regular and special education teachers and others.id.at d b.the act contains a requirement that the iep for a disabled child educate that child in the least restrictive environment 
to the maximum extent appropriate,children with disabilities,including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities,are educated with children who are not disabled,and special classes,separate schooling,or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.
id.at a.educational placement decisions are based on the iep.
the act also establishes procedural safeguards to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents can present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.id.at b.upon presenting such a complaint,the parents or guardians have the procedural right to an impartial due process hearing conducted by the appropriate state or local educational agency.id.at f.in michigan,there is a review system a dispute is first presented to a local hearing officer,and if an aggrieved party chooses to appeal,to a state hearing review officer.see michigan administrative code rule.after the administrative appeals,an aggrieved party shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented in the administrative review process.i.
emma mclaughlin was born on december,and diagnosed with a condition commonly known as down syndrome shortly thereafter.because of this condition,emma is a child with a disability as defined in the act,and she has received special education services since she was two months old.she lives with her parents in dimondale,michigan,and is currently eligible for special education services as a child who falls into the category of educable mentally impaired.
until june,emma parents signed iep plans in agreement with the school district proposals each year.since that time,however,the parties have had a series of disagreements about how to structure emma education.after the school year,in which emma attended a special education classroom operated by holt public schools,her parents refused to continue classroom services through holt,and they chose to enroll emma for the school year in the michigan state university child development lab school at their own expense.the holt school district continued to provide ancillary and related services.the mclaughlins emma at the lab school during the school year,again with the holt school district providing certain ancillary and related services.
in may,emma parents disagreed with the plan proposed for the school year and requested a hearing.while the hearing was pending,a reevaluation was due at the same time as the next annual iep.hence,the hearing on the iep was postponed to allow completion of those tasks,and it was agreed that any issues surrounding the iep would be subsumed in any new hearing request after the reevaluation and the iep for the school year were completed.the iep team meeting was held on april and,and a plan was developed that provided various goals and objectives for emma.everyone attending the meeting agreed emma would fully participate in the general education kindergarten setting,which was a program,with paraprofessional support.it was also agreed that emma would need a full day program,meaning she would receive special education classroom support during the other half day.the parties disagreed as to what type of classroom was appropriate for emma a categorical classroom or a resource room 
the school officials on the iep team determined that a categorical classroom was necessary to meet emma individual goals and education needs.because emma parents disagreed with that determination,they filed a dissenting report to the iep indicating that they felt emma special education needs could be met in a resource room rather than a categorical classroom.they noted in the dissenting report that emma qualified for the resource room because her needs did not require more than half of her instructional day in special education,which was the cutoff for allowing the delivery of special education services through a resource room.see michigan administrative code rule a.the primary reason for their disagreement with the categorical classroom placement was that the categorical classroom placement required emma to attend sycamore elementary school rather than dimondale elementary school,her neighborhood school.
the holt public school district operates six elementary schools,including dimondale elementary and sycamore elementary,the two schools at issue in this case.dimondale elementary was the closest school to emma the one she would have attended if not disabled.sycamore elementary was miles further away from her house.dimondale elementary has a resource room but not a categorical classroom therefore,to receive special education services in a categorical classroom,emma would have had to attend sycamore elementary.
in response to the mclaughlin objection to emma placement,a local hearing officer held a due process hearing in july to determine which special education classroom setting was appropriate to address emma individual needs and found that the appropriate placement for emma was the categorical classroom.emma parents appealed,and in september,a state hearing review officer affirmed the local hearing officer decision that emma should participate in the categorical classroom instead of the resource room.
subsequent to that decision,the mclaughlins filed the current action in federal district court and,ultimately,received a ruling in their favor.it is from that judgment that the current appeal by the school system arises.
discussion 
standards of reviewa.in the district court 
in actions filed pursuant to the idea,there are two parts to a court inquiry.first,the district court must determine whether the state has complied with the procedural requirements of the act.see board of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch.dist.rowley,d.second,the court must decide whether the iep developed through the act procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.see id.at.the act requires states to provide a free appropriate public education to all children who are disabled and in need of special education.a a.michigan has added to this standard a requirement that the educational plan must be designed to develop the maximum potential of a child.comp.laws ann.a,a,see also burilovich board of educ.of lincoln consol,cir incorporating the michigan maximum potential standard into the act.it is clearly established that the mclaughlins bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the iep devised by holt public schools is inappropriate.see dong board of educ.of rochester cmty,cir listing cases doe by and through doe board of educ.of tullahoma city,cir.
in an idea action,the court i shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings ii shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party and iii basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i b.the supreme court has construed this provision to mean that an initial reviewing court should make an independent decision based on the preponderance of the evidence,but also should give due weight to the determinations made during the state administrative process.see rowley,at.the amount of weight due to administrative findings depends on whether the finding is based on educational expertise.less weight is due to an agency determinations on matters for which educational expertise is not relevant because a federal court is just as well suited to evaluate the situation.more weight is due to an agency determinations on matters for which educational expertise is relevant.see burilovich,at.reviewing courts may not substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.doe,at quoting rowley,at.
this modified de novo standard of review applies to both procedural and substantive matters.see burilovich,at.according to this modified de novo standard of review,a district court is required to make findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence contained in the complete record,while giving some deference to the fact findings of the administrative proceedings.knable ex rel.knable bexley city sch,cir.
on appeal from the district court,we apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court findings of fact and a de novo standard of review to its conclusions of law.see knable,at.we must also accord due deference to the state hearing review officer decision.see roncker walter,cir.
ii.the district court idea analysis 
in resolving the dispute over emma mclaughlin educational plan,the district court attempted to reconcile the act least restrictive environment requirement with michigan state law maximum potential requirement.in doing so,we conclude,the district court,in effect,mixed the proverbial apples and oranges and reached the wrong conclusion as a result.
from the onset of this case at the administrative level,the sole issue was whether emma should receive special education services in a categorical classroom or in a resource room in order to achieve the goals in her iep,goals that had been agreed upon by the school officials and emma parents.the local hearing officer limited the due process hearing to this discrete of the two options for delivery of special education was appropriate for emma.as the local hearing officer repeatedly emphasized,the case before him did not present a neighborhood schools issue or a least restrictive environment issue.the mclaughlins and holt were in agreement that emma would be fully included,or mainstreamed,in holt kindergarten program.thus,the sole issue for the administrative review involved her special education placement for the second half of the day 
the local hearing officer recognized that the least restrictive environment question involved the issue of mainstreaming emma in a general education classroom for part of the school day and not the determination of which special education classroom was appropriate for the remainder of the child school day.as he put it,e vidence relating to emma being placed at her neighborhood school is not relevant because the issue is not one of least restrictive environment but rather which special education classroom setting is appropriate to address emma individual needs.
after hearing testimony from,among others,a holt general education kindergarten teacher,a holt resource room teacher,a holt categorical classroom teacher,holt director of special education,a speech and language pathologist,a special education resource room teacher in the lansing school district,and emma teacher at the lab school,the local hearing officer found the preponderance of the evidence supported emma placement in the categorical classroom as necessary to meet her iep goals and objectives.
on appeal to the state hearing review officer,the mclaughlins argued that the local hearing officer erred in determining that the categorical classroom was the appropriate delivery method for emma special education services.they believed that because the resource room was not inappropriate and because it was located at dimondale elementary,emma neighborhood school,the least restrictive environment requirement mandated emma placement in that classroom.the state hearing review officer found the parents had the burden of proving that placing emma in a categorical classroom was inappropriate.like the original hearing officer,he rejected the mclaughlin claim that the act least restrictive environment provision required emma be placed at her home school of dimondale elementary.instead,he noted that a child with a disability should be educated in the school he or she would attend if except when the child iep required placement elsewhere.he therefore concluded that emma iep plan required placement elsewhere because the preponderance of the evidence in the case supported her placement in a categorical classroom,which was not available at dimondale,the elementary school she would attend if.
at their inception,the due process hearings at the administrative levels were solely about which of the two classroom settings was appropriate,and,at least initially,the district court judge recognized this fact,announcing at the bench trial that t he issue here is not the goals and objectives because the parents and the school district are in agreement.the issue is whether the placement or program,whichever is the appropriate word in this field,was appropriate in light of how to best achieve those goals and objectives in the least restrictive environment.in its written opinion,however,the district court changed the issue from the appropriate type of classroom placement to the appropriate school placement.the court conceded that it was the issue,explaining that the administrative hearing officers had failed to consider the least restrictive environment mandate.it appears to us,however,that the administrative officers did not overlook that requirement but properly found that it was not relevant to the issue in dispute.we further conclude that the district court misinterpreted the act least restrictive environment mandate,misapplied it to emma iep plan and,in doing so,improperly shifted the burden of proof from her parents to the school system.
inapplicability of idea least restrictive environment requirement 
the district court may have gotten off track early,by beginning its analysis based on the incorrect premise that at the administrative hearings both sides agreed,in the abstract,that dimondale elementary represented the least restrictive environment.in fact,as noted above,the local hearing officer determined that the issue of least restrictive environment was not relevant because the parties had agreed about the extent to which emma would be in a general education classroom.the least restrictive environment analysis is relevant when there is a question of mainstreaming does not address the q
