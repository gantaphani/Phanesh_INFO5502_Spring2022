plaintiffs comprise a group of officers employed by the wayne county airport authority and assigned to several specialty units.while off duty,they were required to carry pagers and to remain within a specified geographic area in order to maintain availability during hours.they filed suit under the fair labor standards act,et.flsa,seeking overtime compensation for all hours not on duty but during which they carried the pagers.after suit was filed,airport authority management requested that officers return their pagers and also eliminated compensatory time in favor of overtime and assigned vehicles to the officers.based on these actions,plaintiffs amended their complaint to include claims of retaliation in violation of the flsa and.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims.because plaintiffs are not entitled to overtime pay under the flsa,and because defendants actions do not constitute retaliation,we affirm.
background 
plaintiffs are police officers assigned to the wayne county,michigan airport,which services much of michigan lower peninsula,including the entire detroit metropolitan area.all employees of the airport police department were originally employees of the wayne county sheriff department until the airport authority was formed as a separate entity to operate the airport on march.generally,plaintiffs were scheduled to work a workweek.if plaintiffs wanted to work overtime,they would place their names on an overtime list and would be called to work according to seniority their collective bargaining agreement,if and when overtime hours became available.an officer could refuse the overtime offered.officers working overtime were paid overtime pay.
the plaintiffs in this case are members of four specialty police units,including the special response unit,explosive and ordnance disposal squad,and the accident investigation unit ai.officers belonging to these specialty units receive extra specialty pay.all officers in the four specialty units had to live within a close geographical area to the airport.members of the and squad units had to agree,as a condition of employment,to live within a travel time from the airport.officers are required to maintain reasonable availability when off duty.
further,officers assigned to the four specialty units were required to carry digital pagers which operated on a basis.the pagers were to be carried both on and off duty and always turned on,and squad officers all agreed to respond to calls for service at all hours as a condition of being selected to the unit.two plaintiffs testified that they were orally counseled for not responding when paged,and other plaintiffs testified they understood that failure to respond to an page would result in discipline.
prior to september,plaintiffs claim they generally could attend to their personal business while off duty,subject to responding when paged.however,immediately after the events of september,the officers were placed on shifts,seven days per week,and had their leave and vacation days cancelled.on september,the shifts were reduced to ten hours,six days per week,and squad officers were told that,when they were off duty,they had to stay close to home and be able to respond immediately should the need arise.this continued until november,when the officers went on a per week schedule,ten hours per day,and were allowed to use their vacation time.
in october,shortly after the terrorist attacks,defendant mark debeau was hired as the director of public safety at the airport.he was directed to review his department administrative functions and expenses.due to his review,the airport considered a number of changes in its policing operations.several of these policy changes were later implemented.airport management issued sports utility vehicles to each of its officers,and discontinued the payment of flat rate mileage for driving to and from work to those officers.management also decided to freeze the accumulation and use of banked compensatory time,or comp time,due to staffing problems caused by the september terrorist attacks and resulting personnel requirements mandated by the federal government.allowing officers to utilize comp time,in addition to vacation time,forced the airport to rely on and pay for overtime to compensate for their absences.instead of paying officers comp time for certain activities,the airport decided that it would be less costly to pay its officers actual overtime pay.later,the sport utility vehicles were returned to the airport and the flat rate mileage reimbursement policy was reinstated due to the dissatisfaction of the unit officers and their union.
in,officers filed suit against wayne county seeking overtime pay under the flsa.after the initial complaint was filed,airport management collected the pagers from all of its officers at the airport.plaintiffs then amended their complaint to add a second count under,alleging that the collection of all pagers was unlawful retaliation against them.plaintiffs later added a retaliation claim under the flsa for the changes implemented by the airport as recommended by mark debeau.this appeal names wayne county and the wayne county airport authority as municipal defendants and debeau,director of public safety,as a defendant individually and in his official capacity 
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.allen michigan dep t of corrections,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
plaintiffs demand for overtime pay under the flsa 
plaintiffs first claim that the district court erred in ruling that they failed to state a claim under the flsa for overtime compensation.their chief contention is that carrying pagers as required by the airport entitles them to overtime pay for all hours not at work that the pagers were worn.
the flsa provides that employees must be compensated at one and times their regular rate for overtime work.martin ohio turnpike comm n,cir citing a.although the flsa does not state whether time spent on call is working time,the supreme court has held that,under some circumstances,waiting time is compensable.see armour wantock.skidmore swift.both armour and skidmore involved plaintiff firefighters required to spend approximately half of their time off in firehouses in order to respond quickly to alarms.the court declined to rule definitively as to whether time is working time rather,those cases held that the result turns on whether an employee time is spent predominantly for the employer benefit or for the employee,a question dependent upon all the circumstances of the case.armour,at.
although the armour and skidmore plaintiffs spent their on the employers premises,this circuit has acknowledged that an employee may be entitled to compensation even though he or she is on call at home or elsewhere.martin,at.in martin,we held that time spent at home may be compensable if the restrictions imposed are so onerous as to prevent employees from effectively using the time for personal pursuits.id.at.that case considered the claims of highway maintenance workers for overtime pay to compensate them for time spent away from work but on call and subject to telephone or pager summons from the employer.id.at.the martin plaintiffs,unlike plaintiffs here,were designated as either on or off call,and employees were summoned to work before employees.the workers could determine the likelihood of being summoned by consulting the roster of employees who had worked the least amount of overtime to date.id.during a period,while there were instances of discipline for failing to report when called,no employee was ever discharged for such a failure.id.at.finally,there was no evidence that the workers were called to work with any frequency.id.
the martin court evaluated the claims in light of the precedent of other circuits and the department of labor promulgated regulations concerning the compensability of time.id.at.the relevant regulations provide that t ime spent at home on call may or may not be compensable depending on whether the restrictions placed on the employee preclude using the time for personal pursuits and that where the conditions placed on the employee activities are so restrictive that the employee can not use the time effectively for personal pursuits,such time spent on call is compensable.d.this court found summary judgment against the plaintiffs claims appropriate because they failed to demonstrate that the employer policy resulted in severe restrictions on their personal time,imposing burdens that seriously interfere with their ability to use the time for personal pursuits,such as being summoned to work so frequently that effective use of personal time was made impracticable.id.at.that some of the plaintiffs personal activities may have been affected was deemed insufficient to establish a flsa claim.id.at see aiken city of memphis,cir see also rutlin prime succession,cir licensed funeral director and embalmer owed overtime compensation for time spent on to phone calls he received per night while on call,but owed no overtime pay for the rest of time that required him to remain at home and prevented him from drinking alcohol,visiting his children,or boating.
plaintiffs proffer three reasons why the airport management policy is so severely restrictive as to require payment of overtime compensation under the flsa.first,they argue that their personal pursuits are severely restricted because they are subject to discipline for not responding when paged.plaintiffs argue that the martin court noted an unpublished district court opinion which concluded that the employees obligation to respond to the pages prevented them from using the time for their own purposes because the employees were subject to discipline.see martin,at discussing owens itt rayonier,no,wl,dist.lexis.however,the martin court explicitly discredited the reasoning of that decision because it failed to cite any cases or rest on any legal analysis for support id.martin then went on to note that the defendant policy included discipline for failure to respond to a page.although the defendant took disciplinary action times in a period for failure to respond to a page,the martin court did not find that this policy was especially restrictive or burdensome and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant.id.at.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs were not severely restricted by the defendants policy because plaintiffs admitted that they could engage in all of their regular activities while off duty.although plaintiffs assert that the fear of imposition of discipline alone is sufficient to transform otherwise time into compensable time,they provide no precedent holding the same.the policy at issue in this case presents no objective restrictions on plaintiffs time besides requiring them to carry pagers.the law in this circuit plainly states the test for determining whether time is compensable whether,during that time,the employer imposes burdens on the employee so onerous that they prevent employees from effectively using their time for personal pursuits.id.at.the mere threat of discipline does not,by itself,prevent employees from effectively using their time for personal pursuits.
furthermore,there is no evidence that plaintiffs ever were subject to discipline for failing to respond to a page while off duty.only three plaintiffs claim to have been disciplined.one plaintiff was orally counseled for failing to answer a page while on duty and another plaintiff was disciplined for not carrying his pager while on duty.despite the existence of airport management orders requiring plaintiffs to carry their pagers at all times,there is no policy regarding disciplining plaintiffs for failing to respond to a page.
second,they argue that the restriction on their ability to live outside the geographical limits associated with their positions constitutes severe restriction.however,employment of squad and officers was contingent on their agreement to live within thirty minutes of the airport.the pagers they carried operated on a basis,allowing them to travel throughout michigan in their time.plaintiffs could refuse to answer pages.if they did report to work when paged,they received overtime pay for such work.importantly,plaintiffs admitted that they could engage in all of their regular personal activities while off duty.additionally,plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they received so many calls that they could not effectively use their time.in three years,was called only once,while squad and ai units were called in twice.the unit was called between fifteen to twenty times.
third,plaintiffs argue that the airport requirement that they remain at home to wait for a call after the september,attacks also severely restricted their ability to attend to personal pursuits.the airport management terrorist attack policy that temporarily required plaintiffs to remain close to home for enhanced availability in case of emergency also does not create compensable time.while at home,plaintiffs activities were not restricted in any way thus,the emergency management policy in place during those months did not severely restrict plaintiffs personal activities.moreover,plaintiffs testified that they were rarely called in during this period.the evidence reveals that plaintiffs time was not utilized predominantly for the employer benefit,but for the employees.
the evidence and arguments presented by the plaintiffs are insufficient to show that defendants acted in violation of the flsa.
alleged unlawful retaliation in violation of the flsa 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that they failed to state a claim of retaliation in violation of the flsa.they specifically disagree with the district court conclusion that the actions taken by airport management were not materially adverse and were not motivated by the filing of plaintiffs lawsuit.
the provision of flsa provides that an employer is prohibited from discharg ing or in any other manner discriminat ing against an employee because such employee has filed a complaint or instituted any proceeding under the flsa.a.the analysis in mcdonnell douglas green,d,applies to a flsa claim of retaliation.see,moore freeman,cir.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,an employee must prove that he or she engaged in a protected activity under the flsa his or her exercise of this right was known by the employer thereafter,the employer took an employment action adverse to her and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.see,williams motors,cir.such a prima facie showing of retaliation creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee.mary honor ctr.hicks,d.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,the burden then shifts to the defendant to set forth a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.mcdonnell douglas,at.if the defendant carries this burden,the plaintiff then must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant proffered reasons were not its true reasons,but merely a pretext for illegal discrimination.kocsis,cir.
plaintiffs here satisfy the first two prongs of the analysis.they engaged in a activity,filing a cause of action seeking overtime pay,and notified defendants of the activity by serving them with the complaint.more questionable is whether plaintiffs satisfied the third and fourth prongs of the framework.
materially adverse employment action 
the third prong requires an adverse employment action taken against the employee by the employer.the employment action must be materially adverse.kocsis,at.employment actions qualifying as materially adverse include termination of employment,a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.id.at quoting crady liberty bank trust,cir.mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities fail to consti
