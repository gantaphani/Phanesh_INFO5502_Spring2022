the question in this case is whether the,a g coal corporation a g,can assert a permit shield defense for discharges of selenium when it failed to disclose the presence of this pollutant during the permit application process.we hold that the shield defense is unavailable to a 
a g owns and operates the kelly branch surface mine kelly branch in wise county,virginia.in,a g applied for and received from the virginia department of mines,minerals,and energy dmme a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit for its discharges from kelly branch.in its permit application,a g indicated that its operation at kelly branch was bituminous coal mining.the application provided information regarding the discharges from more than existing and proposed outfalls discharge points of wastestreams into a body of water.
a g included on the outfall list the two artificial ponds relevant to this case,each of which discharges into a tributary of callahan creek.the mining company identified the discharge from both ponds as surface runoff and indicated that one would also discharge ground water.a source of the discharge for both outfalls was identified as a surface mine,while one of the ponds also identified hollow fill underdrain as an additional source.nowhere,however,did the permit application state whether or not a g would be discharging selenium,a naturally occurring element that can be harmful in high doses to aquatic life and is categorized as a toxic pollutant under the clean water act cwa,et.the permit that the dmme issued to a g in neither authorizes nor restricts the discharge of selenium from kelly branch.
environmental groups collectively referred to as southern appalachian mountain stewards,or sams sampled discharges from the two ponds,finding that they contained selenium.a g own subsequent sampling detected this element as well after complying with the applicable statutory notice requirements,sams brought this suit against a g for declaratory and injunctive relief and civil penalties.sams contended that a g was violating the cwa by discharging selenium from kelly branch without authorization to do so.
a g responded that because it disclosed the pollutants that it knew or had reason to believe were present at kelly branch,selenium not among them,it complied with its legal obligations.in addition,it argued that the dmme reasonably contemplated that a g could discharge the pollutant.consequently,it was protected under the cwa permit shield and did not violate the cwa.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court denied a g motion and granted summary judgment to sams regarding the allegations under the cwa.it found that a g failure to disclose selenium in its permit application prevented it from receiving the protection of the cwa permit shield.according to the district court,a g lack of knowledge that it was discharging selenium was,the key consideration was whether the permitting agency contemplated the discharge.finding no issues of material fact regarding a g lack of authorization to discharge selenium or whether the dmme contemplated the discharges,the court ruled in favor of sams.this appeal followed.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,requiring that the record contain no genuine issues of material fact and drawing all reasonable inferences on behalf of the party.george.llc imagination entm t,cir 
a brief description of the actual operation of the npdes permitting process is necessary to an understanding of this case.the cwa was passed in order to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.it shifted the focus of federal water regulation from the condition of navigable waters to effluent limitations,prohibiting the discharge of pollutants into those waters,except where otherwise authorized by the act.see id.a.relevantly,the cwa allows the federal government or by delegation,the states to issue npdes permits for the discharge of certain pollutants.see id.a,b giving the environmental protection agency epa authority to issue permits and allowing it to delegate administration of the permitting program to the states united states cooper,cir noting that virginia administers the state npdes program.the dmme is the agency that issues and enforces npdes permits for surface coal mines in virginia.see ann.
under the permitting scheme,a person wishing to discharge one or more pollutants applies for an individual permit from the proper state or federal agency.see.using the disclosures from the application,as well as other available information,the agency then develops a draft permit made available to the public for notice and comment.after the administrative process has run its course,the agency can issue the permit.see a,b.
federal regulations require that the permit application include significant detail regarding the nature and composition of the expected discharges.g.there are two sets of pertinent requirements for applicants that operate within a primary industry category,including coal mining,depending on how their discharge is classified.because there is a disagreement as to the nature of a g discharges,it is necessary to describe both regulations.
for those outfalls that discharge process wastewater,defined as any water which,during manufacturing or processing,comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material,intermediate product,finished product,byproduct,or waste product,each applicant must report quantitative data on a large number of pollutants a list that includes selenium.id.defining process wastewater,g v b part,apps.a listing coal mining as a primary industry category,d listing selenium in table iii as one of the pollutants that must be tested for in process wastewater pursuant to regulation.thus,those discharging process wastewater must,as part of their permit applications,give a quantitative measure of selenium.
an applicant whose discharges are not classified as process wastewater must nonetheless indicate whether it knows or has reason to believe that any of the pollutants in table ii or table iii of appendix d to this part including selenium for which quantitative data are not otherwise required is discharged from each outfall.id.g vi b.according to the instructions contained in the epa application form,the form that must be filled out by any person applying to the agency to discharge wastewater of any sort,a party must mark whether each listed element,including selenium,is believed present or believed absent.epa,application form wastewater discharge information application form.thus,according to the epa,disclosure means affirmatively informing the relevant agency of the presence or absence of specified pollutants.
virginia has incorporated these same requirements into its own regulations,using nearly identical language.see.admin.code h e requiring applicants in primary industry categories that discharge process wastewater to report quantitative data for those pollutants listed in table iii of.part,appendix d,which includes selenium,h g requiring each applicant not discharging process wastewater to indicate whether it knows or has reason to believe that any pollutants listed in tables ii or iii of appendix d are being discharged.the state did not,however,stop there.the dmme npdes application instructions require that in addition to disclosing data regarding a series of parameters listed in the application table,information is required regarding the following pollutants total selenium the applicant must report at least one analys i s for each pollutant.please attach certificate of analyses or reference appropriate information on file at the division.at.the cwa sets the minimum requirements that states must demand in their npdes applications,see.a iv,but states can,as virginia has done here,exceed that minimum and require more stringent reporting requirements.
the cwa contains a permit shield provision for those who have successfully applied for npdes permits through the framework described above.it states that c ompliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance with various sections of the statute that detail effluent limitations and their enforcement.k.the permit shield is meant to prevent permit holders from being forced to change their procedures due to changes in regulations,or to face enforcement actions over whether their permits are sufficiently strict.du pont de nemours train,d.by rendering permits final,the shield allows permit holders to conduct their operations without concern that an unexpected discharge might lead to substantial liability.
but this broad protection comes with an important responsibility at the permit application stage full compliance with federal and state reporting requirements,as well as with the conditions of the permit.we have previously noted just how crucial this provision of information is to the success of the cwa the effectiveness of the permitting process is heavily dependent on permit holder compliance with the cwa monitoring and reporting requirements.piney run ass cnty.comm rs,cir.indeed,the extent of the information provided has a direct impact on the applicability of the permit shield because the permitting scheme is dependent on the permitting authority being able to judge whether the discharge of a particular pollutant constitutes a significant threat to the environment,discharges not within the reasonable contemplation of the permitting authority during the permit application process do not receive the shield protection.id.at.
this emphasis on disclosure echoes the reasoning of the epa environmental appeals board eab in in re ketchikan pulp,wl eab,to which we applied chevron deference in piney run.see piney run,at citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.the eab emphasized,as we did in piney run,the need for a party to properly document the contents of its discharges in order to avail itself of the permit shield.it noted that the permit applicant disclosures during the application process as to the wastestreams which may potentially be discharged,and the permit authority knowledge as a result of that disclosure,are critical factors in determining whether the shield defense i s applicable.ketchikan,wl at.the administrative body continued 
w hen the permittee has made adequate disclosures during the application process regarding the nature of its discharges,unlisted pollutants may be considered to be within the scope of an npdes permit,even though the permit does not expressly mention those pollutants.the converse is also true where the discharger has not adequately disclosed the nature of its discharges to permit authorities,and as a result thereof the permit authorities are unaware that unlisted pollutants are being discharged,the discharge of unlisted pollutants has been held to be outside the scope of the permit.
relying on ketchikan and its emphasis on the disclosure built into the cwa permitting scheme,we devised a test in piney run to determine whether k shields a permit holder from liability 
we therefore view the npdes permit as shielding its holder from liability under the clean water act as long as the permit holder complies with the express terms of the permit and with the clean water act disclosure requirements and the permit holder does not make a discharge of pollutants that was not within the reasonable contemplation of the permitting authority at the time the permit was issued.
piney run,at.a party must meet both prongs of this test in order to qualify for the shield.the key questions regarding a g discharges of selenium,then,are whether it provided adequate information to the dmme in order to comply with the law and permit conditions,and if the selenium discharges were within the reasonable contemplation of the dmme.
a g claims that it has met both prongs of the piney run test and as a result can assert the permit shield defense.it makes three distinct arguments to support this contention.we address them in turn.
the heart of a g case is that it met prong one of the piney run test because,under the applicable regulations,it was required to identify selenium in its application only if it knows or has reason to believe that it will be present in the discharges from any outfall.appellant br.at internal quotation marks omitted.because,a g asserts,it had no such knowledge that selenium was present at kelly branch,it did not violate the cwa disclosure requirements.see id.at.
we begin by noting that the provision on which a g relies c.g vi b applies to those permit applicants who are not discharging process wastewater.a g permit application states that both outfalls at issue would discharge surface runoff and groundwater.see at.the united states has claimed,however,that the discharges described by a g in its permit application actually meet the regulatory definition of process wastewater.see br.of united states as amicus curiae at.if indeed a g discharge is process wastewater,then under g v b,a g would have been required to test for selenium and the other pollutants listed in table iii of appendix d and submit those tests to the dmme as part of its permit application.we note the force of the government definitional argument,but we need not decide the technical question of whether a g mislabeled its discharges from the outfalls.for even assuming a g properly identified its runoff,it still failed to fully compl y with the express terms of the permit and with the clean water act disclosure requirements.piney run,at.
the dmme npdes application instructions unequivocally require that an applicant submit an analysis of total selenium discharged as a part of the permit application.see at.it is uncontested that a g did not submit any selenium data with its application.furthermore,federal and virginia regulations require that an applicant state whether it knows or has reason to believe any of the pollutants listed in tables ii or iii of part,appendix d is discharged from each outfall.see g vi b.admin.code h g.as noted,selenium is one of the pollutants listed in table iii.as discussed above,epa application instructions indicate that,consistent with the regulatory language,an applicant must affirmatively note on the application whether selenium is believed present or believed absent.see application form.silence as to the existence of a referenced pollutant is not adequate.once again,it is uncontested that a g did not indicate whether it believed selenium was present or absent anywhere in its application.as a result,we can not find that the company met its disclosure obligations as required by prong one of the piney run test.
a g framing of the disclosure requirement that it needed to mention selenium only if it knew or had reason to believe that the element would be present in its discharges turns the presumptions of the cwa on their head.as noted above,the cwa and its implementing regulations focus on the information that the permit applicant must gather and provide to the permitting agency,so that it can make a fully informed decision to issue the requested permit.the statute and regulations purposefully place the burden of disclosure on the permit applicant.see piney run,at w here the discharger has not adequately disclosed the nature of its discharges to permit authorities,and as a result thereof the permit authorities are unaware that unlisted pollutants are being discharged,the discharge of unlisted pollutants has been held to be outside the scope of the permit.quoting ketchikan,wl at.
meanwhile,a g vision of disclosure,which asks solely about what the permit applicant knew about the presence of a pollutant when it applied for a permit,subtly absolves the applicant of the need to provide the mandated information to the permitting authority.in order to do so,a g replaces the requirement in g vi b that an applicant indicate whether it knows or has reason to believe a pollutant is present with one that requires disclosure if the applicant has or should have knowledge.see appellant br.at,appellee br.at.a g claims this difference is immaterial,appellant reply br.at,but the alteration carries an important consequence.the need to indicate whether a pollutant is present requires that an applicant affirmatively disclose after appropriate inquiry its knowled
