opinion of the court 
introduction 
petitioner sulaiman appeals the denial of his application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act,and his request for relief under the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment convention against torture or convention.we now add our voice to the chorus of other circuits which have held that a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review an asylum petition that an immigration judge ij or board of immigration appeals bia deems untimely.in reaching the merits of the petitioner requests for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture,we conclude that the immigration judge finding that tarawally was not likely to be persecuted or tortured was supported by substantial evidence.
sulaiman tarawally is a citizen of sierra leone who entered the united states in january as a visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until february.tarawally filed an application for temporary protected status,which was eventually denied.sometime after october,he filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.
during the asylum hearing that followed,tarawally testified to his personal history in sierra leone.tarawally father was chairman of the all people congress apc for the kono district of sierra leone.the apc was the ruling party until a coup,during which the national provisional ruling council,also known as the armed forces revolutionary council afrc,took power.in early,the afrc arrested tarawally father for his political activities and detained him for about a month.at that time,tarawally was living in the town of bamakonta,some nine to twelve miles away from his family.sometime after his father detention,in march of,tarawally was visiting his family home and awoke one night to the sound of gunfire.when he discovered that the rest of his family was missing,he immediately left kono.he spent three days walking to the town of bo,sierra leone,where he lived and attended secondary school from to 
in,the school was closed due to civil unrest,so tarawally traveled first to guinea for three months,then to gambia for a year,returning to sierra leone in.although tarawally application for admission to injala university in bo was accepted,he did not attend because of financial constraints.
tarawally regularly traveled back and forth between sierra leone and gambia from until.sometime in or,tarawally was sleeping in a school in gambia when other sierra leone citizens,also in gambia,threw a molotov cocktail into the building.when tarawally attended a soccer game in gambia,he was physically attacked by the same individuals who had thrown the molotov cocktail 
between and,tarawally advocated in support of the apc and assisted new members to register to vote.he also was active in the student mobilization for democracy smfd,and the youth defense army vigilante group in sierra leone.all of these groups opposed the revolutionary united front ruf and afrc.
in,tarawally discovered that his family was living in the town of makeni in sierra leone and visited them for a week.he then went to freetown,sierra leone,where he lived for a year.around this time,he became uneasy about his participation in the smfd and therefore decreased his involvement in its activities.
although the sierra leone people party had been elected to power in,a coup occurred in may of,and the ruf,with support from the afrc,overthrew the government after the coup,the afrc and the smfd met in freetown,and the afrc threatened tarawally and other smfd members with amputation of their limbs if they did not cooperate and support the afrc regime.three days later,tarawally was in freetown and then taken to the pademba detention facility where he was held for several weeks and beaten.around the same time,on june,tarawally father and sister were killed for their political activities and their opposition to the ruf tarawally was able to escape from prison with the assistance of a former school friend who was working there.tarawally fled through the jungle to guinea,a journey of approximately miles,which he said he made in two days.he then went from guinea to gambia.he subsequently fled to the united states.
iii.procedural posture 
following a removal hearing,the ij issued an opinion in which he determined that because tarawally did not file his asylum application within one year of his entry into the united states,his request for asylum should not be considered.the ij then denied tarawally application for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture,finding that tarawally was not credible because of his initial uncertainty as to how long his father was detained following arrest his lack of knowledge regarding how his father was treated in prison his initial uncertainty as to what night he heard gunfire and fled kono the implausibility that he would walk kilometers from kono to bo and instead of trying to locate his missing family,decide to enroll in a school in that city the inconsistency between his affidavit,in which he stated that he started a new chapter of the smfd in bo in and that he was chairman of the chapter at the school,and his later testimony that he stopped actively participating in the smfd organization in,and that he never attended the university the conflicting dates he provided of his arrest,both early and june of contradictions between petitioner affidavit and his testimony as to the dates he attended high school contradictions as to whether he attended the university and whether he applied in or in after his father death contradictions between his affidavit and his testimony as to whether threats of amputation occurred at the meeting between the afrc and smfd or three days later his failure to testify,consistent with his affidavit,that he was cut with razor blades and beaten senseless when arrested the inconsistency between his statement that he left prison in june and his affidavit that he arrived in guinea in september,and that the trip took him only two days the implausibility that,between and,he would have traveled back and forth between sierra leone and gambia a three to four day trip each way with regularity to participate in student groups and contradictions as to whether he ever returned to bo after.
