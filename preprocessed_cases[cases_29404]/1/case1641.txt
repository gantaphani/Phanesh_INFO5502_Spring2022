plaintiffs,residents of tammany parish,louisiana,who allege that the environment surrounding their dwellings,businesses,and recreational areas will be unlawfully harmed by a residential subdivision developer dredging and filling of wetlands,challenge the united states army corps of engineers the corps finding of no significant impact fonsi on the environment under the national environmental policy act of nepa,which resulted in the corps issuance of a permit to dredge and fill wetlands to the developer under of the clean water act.plaintiffs contend that the corps acted arbitrarily in issuing the fonsi for the dredge and fill permit because its environmental assessment ea,the basis for the fonsi,does not articulate a rational basis for finding that the mitigation measures imposed by the corps upon the dredging and filling operations reduce their harmful effects below the level of significant environmental impacts does not adequately consider the project cumulative effects and improperly segments the project by considering only the first of three possible phases of development.consequently,plaintiffs argue,nepa required that the corps prepare a environmental impact statement eis before issuing permits affecting the wetlands.
the district court agreed with plaintiffs and held that the corps had acted arbitrarily in violation of nepa because it failed to articulate or demonstrate how the mitigation measures will succeed consider the cumulative effects of the project,the permits to third parties,and the growing area urbanization consider the effects of the current proposal together with the effects of additional phases of the developer long range residential subdivision plans.
we agree with the district court that the corps acted arbitrarily in issuing a fonsi based on an ea that fails to articulate how the mitigation measures will render the adverse effects insignificant and to consider the cumulative effects of the project,area urbanization,and permits issued to third parties.but we disagree with the district court conclusion that the corps engaged in improper segmentation of the project by failing to include full analysis of two possible future phases of development in its ea.accordingly,we affirm the district court holding that the corps acted arbitrarily in the foregoing respects,but we amend the district court injunction,reverse the balance of its decision,and remand the case to the corps for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i.the nepa framework 
before we begin our analysis,we review nepa framework,terminology and objectives.nepa was intended to reduce or eliminate environmental damage and to promote the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the united states.dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d quoting.instead of mandating particular environmental results,nepa imposes procedural requirements on federal agencies,requiring agencies to analyze the environmental impact of their proposals and actions.coliseum square ass n,jackson,cir quoting pub.citizen,at.nepa central requirement is that federal agencies must,except in certain qualifying situations,complete a detailed environmental impact statement eis for any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.to assist these agencies in determining whether an eis must be prepared,nepa authorized the council on environmental quality ceq to promulgate guidelines in the form of regulations.see see also coliseum square,at.
nepa requires an agency to produce a full eis only where the agency proposes to undertake a project that qualifies as a major federal action,and then only when that action significantly affect s the quality of the human environment.c see also coliseum square,at.the ceq regulations define a m ajor federal action as actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to federal control and responsibility.see also coliseum square,at.effects,for the purposes of the regulations,include a d irect effects,which are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place,and b i ndirect effects,which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance,but are still reasonably foreseeable.see also coliseum square,at.
the ceq regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited document,an environmental assessment ea,if the agency proposed action neither is categorically excluded from the requirement to produce an eis nor would clearly require the production of an eis.pub.citizen,at.citing a,b.an ea should be a concise public document that serves to b riefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis.a.in some cases,an agency may find that it must complete a full eis.where an ea results in a determination that an eis is not required,however,the agency must issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi.coliseum square,at quoting pub.citizen,at.the fonsi must briefly state the reasons why the proposed agency action will not have a significant impact on the human environment.coliseum square,at citing e.
ii.factual and procedural background 
agency proceedings 
the planche family plans to develop its plot of land in tammany parish,near covington,louisiana,as a residential subdivision.the plot includes wooded wetlands bordering timber creek,which flows through the property to timber branch,a tributary of the tchefunte river.the subdivision development will require dredging and filling of wetlands and the discharge of materials into navigable waters.the clean water act requires that the developer obtain a permit from the corps before such discharge and that the corps comply with nepa in issuing the permit 
in,a representative of the planche family filed an initial permit for a project that covered total acres including acres of wetlands.in september of that same year,the corps and the louisiana department of environmental quality jointly posted public notice of the proposed project and its permit application as a result of that notice,the corps received public comments,including objections from the united states environmental protection agency.eventually,the applicant withdrew the initial permit application.
in september,a different representative of the planche family,august hand,submitted a revised permit application.the new application sought a permit only for phase i of the project,covering total acres,including acres of wetlands.the corps again posted public notice and accepted comments.the corps also began nepa review of the project and determined that,in light of the mitigation measures mandated by the permit conditions required by the clean water act,as well as other state and local laws the requested permit would have no significant impact on the environment.
accordingly,on november,the corps issued a mitigated fonsi a finding of no significant impact concluding that the project adverse impacts would be reduced to a level via mitigation conditions attached to the permit.see spiller white,cir approving the use of mitigated fonsis.on december,the corps issued a permit allowing dredging and filling in acres of the project wetlands,conditioned on performance of specified mitigation measures.
district court proceedings 
plaintiffs,residents who live,work,and recreate near the proposed development,sued to enjoin the permit.they alleged that the corps had not complied with nepa requirements because it did not prepare an eis prepared an inadequate ea and failed to consider the project direct,indirect,and cumulative effects.both parties submitted for summary judgment,at which point the district court granted eric bopp,a part owner of the property and member of the planche family,permission to intervene on the side of the corps.
the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,concluding that the corps had acted arbitrarily by issuing the permit without preparing a full eis in order to comply with nepa.in finding the corps actions arbitrary,the district court held that the corps ea and fonsi were not justified under nepa because the administrative record contained no support for the corps conclusion that the mitigation measures would render insignificant the identified adverse impacts of the project.further,the court held that the arbitrariness of this action by the agency was exacerbated by its failure to consider fully the cumulative adverse effects of the project with those of other permits already issued within a mile radius the continued rapid growth and urbanization of that part of tammany parish and phases ii and iii of the developer long range residential subdivision plans on the planche family other plots of land in the same area of tammany parish.the district court also held that the corps improperly segmented the entire long range subdivision plans by considering only phase i in developing its ea.army corps of engineers,wl,at.august.accordingly,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment denied the defendants motion for summary judgment and enjoined the permit issued by the corps to the developer.
the corps and the intervenor appealed.on appeal,however,only the intervenor contends that the corps ea,fonsi,and permit should be affirmed.the corps does not object to the ea or the fonsi being vacated and the case being remanded to the agency for further proceedings that may,if additional findings and reasons so warrant,lead to the preparation of a second ea and another mitigated fonsi.both appellants,however,take issue with the district court injunction,which apparently leaves the corps no recourse but to prepare a full eis before granting the developer a permit to dredge and fill wetlands.
iii.discussion of the district court decision on the merits 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.terrebonne parish sch.bd.mobil oil,cir.therefore we,like the district court,may only set aside the corps decision not to prepare an eis where a plaintiff establishes that the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also marsh or.natural res.council,d kleppe sierra club,d.
courts may not,of course,use review of an agency environmental analysis as a guise for substantive decisions committed to the discretion of the agency.however,this restriction does not turn judicial review into a rubber stamp.in conducting our nepa inquiry,we must make a searching and careful inquiry into the facts and review whether the decision was based on consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.marsh,at.
the district court in this case based its decision on three grounds the corps failure to demonstrate the feasibility of the mitigation measures imposed the corps failure to consider the cumulative effects of the project,other permits,and area urbanization and the corps improper segmentation of phase i of the project.we discuss each in turn.
a.the feasibility of the mitigation measures 
the district court held that the administrative record contains no support for the corps conclusion that the mitigation measures would remove or reduce to insignificance the identified adverse impacts of the project.t he ea discusses the project adverse impacts and describes the associated mitigation measures but nothing in the document connects the two together,wl at.
we have consistently accepted the proposition that reliance on mitigation measures may reduce a project impacts below the level of significance.in spiller,at,we explicitly approved that principle,while noting that we have implicitly endorsed such use.id.citing sierra club espy,cir holding that eas satisfied nepa where they considered appropriate alternatives,including mitigation measures and louisiana lee,cir holding that it was proper to consider restrictions placed on dredging permits in reviewing the agency decision not to file an eis.other circuits agree.see,cabinet mountains wilderness peterson,now,fed.aviation,cir greenpeace action franklin,cir roanoke river basin ass hudson,cir audubon soc y of cent.dailey,cir.
furthermore,the supreme court has held that proposed mitigation measures need not be laid out to the finest detail,even within the more context of an environmental impact statement.robertson methow valley citizens council,d there is a fundamental distinction between a requirement that mitigation be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated and a substantive requirement that a complete mitigation plan be actually formulated and adopted.river basin alliance westphal,cir quoting robertson,at.mindful of that distinction,we have still required that an eis involving mitigation must include a serious and thorough evaluation of environmental mitigation options for a project to allow its analysis to fulfill nepa requirements.river basin alliance,at.we have,moreover,noted that mere perfunctory or conclusory language will not be deemed to constitute an adequate record and can not serve to support the agency decision not to prepare an eis.citizen advocates for responsible expansion,dole,cir citing capital park planning comm postal,see also daniel mandelker,nepa law litig.an environmental assessment does not require the full and reasonably complete discussion of mitigation measures that is required in an impact statement.agencies must develop the record to a reasonable degree,however,in a manner that thoroughly and fairly evaluates environmental consequences.with these principles in mind,we examine the corps ea and the reasons set forth there for its conclusion that each significant environmental impact it had identified would be reduced to insignificance by its prescribed mitigation measure 
adverse effects on soils and flood capacity 
the corps ea predicts that the project will have substantial,adverse effects on project site soils,including creation of anoxic and anaerobic due to clearing,grading,excavation,and filling possible impairment of subsurface drainage due to substrate compaction and decreased aquifer recharge capability due to an increase in impervious surfaces all of the above work could contribute to a possible reduction in the site flood control functions,including increased surface runoff volume and rate reduced subsurface lateral flow,storage,and recharge and reduced filtration.
in discussing the role of mitigation in reducing these problems,the ea states that the drainage plan incorporated into the development relies on a vegetated buffer zone for flood water storage as well as creating detention areas.additionally,the plan would raise the elevation of the major road.the ea also notes that the drainage plan meets tammany parish requirements.the ea asserts,without data or analysis,that the project as mitigated should have minimal e ffect on flooding within the scope of a storm,although storms in categories above a event could flood the development 
ii.increased source pollution 
in its assessment of water quality impacts,the corps ea notes that the project could cause,adverse impacts from increased source pollution primarily in the roadside drainage swales incorporated in the project design.the ea asserts that the planned vegetated buffer will minimize the amount of sediment entering the river and that the project will comply with tammany parish ordinances enacted to control.the ea also states that best management practices will be incorporated into project construction and inclusion of vegetated drainage swales and greenspaces will filter and that c ompliance with the recommendations requirements of local ordinances best management practices should limit the volume of sediments entering local waterways.it neither describes what these practices may include nor how they will work.similarly,the ea states that compliance with required state environmental permits should eliminate the potential for contamination of ground water resources,but does not describe what these permits require.
iii.loss of wildlife habitat 
the ea predicts moderate to major adverse impacts on wildlife habitat,which,in turn,would create adverse impacts to wildlife in a localized area.the document also notes that the project will result in a increase in noise to levels loud and frequent enough to disturb wildlife in adjacent areas.in discussing mitigation of habitat loss and other adverse impacts on wildlife,however,the ea states,without explanation,that the buffer zone will mitigate some of the impact to aquatic organisms.when discussing habitat for wildlife the ea simply states that the buffer zone will be preserved and may provide habitat for some species,although others may be eliminated entirely.
iv.loss of wetland functions 
the ea notes that the project will result in a total and complete loss of wetland functions for the developed portion of the site,which will,in turn,affect the remaining area directly affected by the development,as well as nearby wetlands and.some of the mitigation discussion is built into the requirements pertinent to flood control,source pollution,and wildlife habitat,discussed above.beyond that,the ea says only that compensatory mitigation for wetland functionality losses will be required.the permittee must purchase credits for acres of pine wetlands,which will be acquired from an approved site within the same usgs hydrologic watershed.
adverse effects on traffic and safety 
the ea states that the project will result in adverse and impacts on traffic and transportation patterns,and as a result,could lead to increased safety concerns.the discussion of mitigation,however,is limited to statements that a ppropriate adjustments to the local highway system,such as warning signs,and traffic control signs or signals may be required to accommodate increases in traffic volume and that areas of congestion points may need to be altered.the ea also mentions that the applicant indicated in that it would conduct a traffic study,and that the developer would fund some identified improvements in order to mitigate adverse impacts.
after reviewing the ea findings of significant adverse environmental impacts that will result from the project together with its reasoning as to the feasibility of the described mitigation measures imposed,we conclude that the district court correctly held that the ea fails to sufficiently demonstrate that the mitigation measures adequately address and remediate the adverse impacts so that they will not significantly affect the environment.the ea before us lists the potentially significant adverse impacts,and describes,in broad terms,the types of mitigation measures that will be employed.as is evident from our above review of the corps treatment of each individual potential impact,however,the ea provides only cursory detail as to what those measures are and how they serve to reduce those impacts to a level.because the feasibility of the mitigation measures is not,we agree with the district court that the ea does not provide a rational basis for determining that the corps has adequately complied with nepa.
we recognize that an ea is meant to be a,preliminary look at the environmental impact of a proposed project.spiller,at.the record before us,however,is simply not sufficient to determine whether the mitigated fonsi relies on mitigation measures which compensate for any adverse environmental impacts stemming from the original proposal that,unmitigated,would be significant.id.at quoting cabinet mountains wilderness,at.in other words,the ea fails to tell us why the proposed agency action will not have a significant impact on the human environment.coliseum square,at citing e.we therefore agree with the district court determination that,the corps acted arbitrarily in relying only on the information in the current ea to support the issuance of its mitigated fonsi.in so holding,we pause to note that w e have never said that deficiencies in an ea can only be cured by preparing an eis,and that is not the law.fritiofson alexander,cir overruled on unrelated grounds by sabine river auth.dep t of interior,cir.our review of the record today indicates only that we lack the information that would allow us to defer to the corps determination that mitigation will reduce the project effects below the level of significance.
cumulative impacts 
the intervenor argues that the district court incorrectly determined that the ea is supported by no real analysis or data with respect to cumulative effects of this project,wl at.we begin by reviewing nepa specific requirements regarding cumulative impact analysis.
the ceq regulations define a project cumulative impacts as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.see also requiring that agencies take cumulative impacts into consideration during nepa review.the regulation states that c umulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.in that vein,we have held that a consideration of cumulative impacts must also consider c losely related and proposed or reasonably foreseeable actions that are related by timing or geography.vieux carre prop.owners,residents,pierce,cir.
in this case,the intervenor challenges the district court holding with regard to the corps treatment of cumulative impacts.that court found that the ea merely recites the potential cumulative effects of the project in light of other wetlands destruction in the area but is supported by no real analysis or data with respect to cumulative effects of this project,wl at.
the corps has already issued other permits within a three mile radius of the proposed development,covering a total of acres,of which are wetlands.the ea identifies those permits,and notes that they cumulatively required a total of approximately acres of compensatory mitigation.the corps acknowledges that although c umulative impacts associated with this particular project would be considered minor,when considered in conjunction with,inter alia,historical development and land use practices,the cumulative effects may become major.the corps how such individual projects can collectively cause fragmenting of state wetlands and result in increasing environmental pressures due to development.it notes that without local governments and the general public becoming in land use planning and local watershed management and guiding development from the perspective of environmental stewardship,the potential for environmental impacts to approach a cumulatively significant level exists.furthermore,it acknowledges that this permit covers only the first phase of a project that may have as many as three phases of development.such language would seem to warrant a finding of significance,but instead the corps states,without any exposition,that mitigation for impacts caused by the proposed project,possible future project phases,and all corps permitted projects will remove or reduce e x pected impacts.
as above,we agree with the district court that this bare assertion is simply insufficient to explain why the mitigation requirements render the cumulative effects of this project,when considered with past,present,and foreseeable future development in the project area,including the project other two potential phases.the intervenor argues that one may presume that through the mitigation requirement contained in nepa all permits issued prior to the one under consideration had their respective impacts mitigated to levels of insignificance.we can not accept that presumption as legally and empirically valid,however,because the corps ea provides no rational basis for concluding that when the individually effects of this permit are added to the actual and fill effects of other permits issued to third parties by the corps in the area,that the result will not be cumulatively significant.in so holding,we do not,as bopp asserts,ask the agency to treat the ea as a local planning guide.we simply agree with the district court determination that the ea provides too little information as to the workability of the mitigation measures to conclude that the corps took a hard look at the project,realistically assessed its individual and cumulative environmental effects,and reasonably found that the mitigation measures imposed will reduce those effects to a level.
improper segmentation 
finally,the intervenor challenges the district court determination that this project,the first phase of a possible development plan,constitutes improper segmentation,or piecemealing an attempt by an agency to divide artificially a major federal action into smaller components to escape the application of nepa to some of its segments.save barton creek ass fed.highway,cir.in so holding,the district court identified nothing that rendered the other two phases impracticable,financially unattractive,or generally not feasible,wl at.it held that t he record blaringly suggests that the sole reason that phases ii and iii were eliminated was to facilitate the issuance of the permit so that the project could get underway.id.ultimately,the district court found that the current project represents a piecemealing approach for implementing the totality of the entire project.id.
as a general rule under nepa,segmentation of highway projects is improper for purposes of preparing environmental impact statements.save barton creek,at quoting piedmont heights civic club,moreland,cir.unit b.although the question of piecemealing may arise when dealing with a project,it presents a different problem than that reviewed in the preceding section on cumulative impacts.as we have discussed,an assessment of cumulative effects asks whether a project with individually effects may yet result in significant environmental impacts when those effects are aggregated with the foreseeable effects of other environmentally impacting human activities and natural occurrences.an analysis of improper segmentation,however,requires that where proceeding with one project will,because of functional or economic dependence,foreclose options or irretrievably commit resources to future projects,the environmental consequences of the projects should be evaluated together.fritiofson,at,
to determine whether a single project is improperly segmented into multiple parts,this circuit applies a test that asks whether the proposed segment has logical termini has substantial independent utility does not foreclose the opportunity to consider alternatives and does not irretrievably commit federal funds for closely related projects.save barton creek,at citing piedmont heights,at.it is important to note that projects,for the purposes of nepa,are described as proposed actions,or proposals in which action is imminent.t he mere contemplation of certain action is not sufficient to require an impact statement.fritiofson,at citing kleppe,at.while a cumulative impact analysis requires the corps to include reasonably foreseeable future actions in its review,improper segmentation is usually concerned with projects that have reached the proposal stage.see envtl.def.fund marsh,cir.we have stated that in rare cases a court may prohibit segmentation or require a comprehensive eis for two projects,even when one is not yet proposed,if an agency has egregiously or arbitrarily violated the underlying purpose of nepa.envtl.def.fund,at.
in this case,the current permit allows only the filling and dredging required to construct phase i of the planned development.although the project as originally submitted was a undertaking,the application as eventually approved included only the first stage.the corps cites this decrease in scale as one of the project requirements that reduce the project effects below the level of significance.
the district court did not apply the independent utility test laid out above,but simply stated that considering phase i by itself constituted improper piecemealing because nothing in the record suggested that phases ii and iii were impracticable,financially unattractive,or generally not feasible and that the two phases were almost certainly going to be financially viable in light of the expanding urbanization in tammany parish,wl at.plaintiffs,too,argue that the current project is wrongly piecemealed because phases ii and iii are reasonably foreseeable.while this argument is relevant to whether the corps rationally addressed and mitigated the cumulative impacts,it does not appropriately address the improper segmentation question.
in this respect,we agree with bopp that vieux carre prop.owners,residents,pierce,cir,provides the relevant analogy.in that case,a project was submitted,withdrawn,and resubmitted in a form that included one phase of the original project.id.at.the court held that the project had not been improperly segmented because the future phases remained in the speculative,planning stages.id.at citing envtl.def.fund,at we are here dealing with two projects that are historically distinct,one of which is proposed and the other still in the process of study and design.in that situation,nepa does not yet require the agency to evaluate the environmental impact of the second project.
in the case before us,the record indicates that the three phases have independent i can stand alone without requiring construction of the other two phases either in terms of the facilities required or of profitability.neither plaintiffs nor the district court identify any evidence that construction of phase i irretrievably commits federal funds to construction of phases ii iii or that the future phases have progressed to the proposal stage nor do they identify any evidence suggesting that construction of phase i will foreclose the corps ability to consider various alternatives to construction of either future phase.indeed,phases ii and iii would encompass a far larger quantity of wetlands of their total acreage than phase i which was wetlands.the corps analysis of practicable alternatives to construction of future phases may,as a result,prove far different than its analysis for phase 
on this point,therefore,we reverse the district court judgment.the record before us does not reflect that the corps must have considered the possible future second and third phases as part of the present project in conducting its ea and preparing its fonsi,nor that in failing to do so the corps has arbitrarily violated the underlying purpose of nepa.phases ii and iii are relevant to the ea insofar as they relate to the corps analysis of cumulative impacts.conducting an ea for phase i alone,however,does not offend the prohibition against piecemealing projects in order to avoid nepa requirements.we can not say that the corps has acted arbitrarily in this respect.
iv.discussion of the district court remedy 
as we read the district court judgment,it enjoins the issuance of a dredge and fill permit until an eis is completed.the judgment states only that the district court has enjoined the permit but in the conclusion of its memorandum opinion,the court stated,
the corps acted arbitrarily,capriciously,or abused its discretion by issuing the permit without preparing a full eis as required by nepa.in light of the and irreversible environmental impacts associated with this project,the corp sic action is wholly at odds with nepa.because the permit was issued without an eis in violation of nepa,plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction accordingly the permit issued by the department of the army is hereby enjoined.
both the corps and bopp contend that the district court injunction effectively and erroneously mandated that the corps complete an eis for the proposed project.they argue that the court,instead,should have remanded the case to the corps with instructions to the agency to reconsider whether an ea or an eis is appropriate.
we review a district court decision to issue a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.vrc,llc city of dallas,cir citing alamo water supply city of san juan,cir thomas.of criminal justice,cir.the district court abuses its discretion if it relies on clearly erroneous factual findings when deciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction,relies on erroneous conclusions of law when deciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction,or misapplies the factual or legal conclusions when fashioning its injunctive relief.liberto stauffer biscuit,cir quoting peaches entm t entm t repertoire,cir.
where,as here,a court determines that an agency has acted arbitrarily or capriciously,the apa perm
