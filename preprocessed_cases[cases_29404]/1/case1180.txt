opinion of the court 
the appellant,south south,operates an adult cabaret called moulin rouge,located in atlantic city,new jersey.the club holds a liquor license issued by the city of atlantic city pursuant to various new jersey regulations.one of the club main attractions involves topless dance performances that include sexually explicit dance routines.fearing that these performances may result in substantial financial penalties or loss of its liquor license,south filed a complaint to challenge the constitutionality of a state regulation prohibiting any lewdness or immoral activity on premises.on for summary judgment,the district court denied south request for declaratory and injunctive relief and granted summary judgment in favor of abc director fischer.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court and hold that the regulation,as construed by new jersey courts,is not unconstitutional.
background 
the new jersey legislature has delegated authority over the manufacture,sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state to the new jersey division of alcoholic beverage control the abc and has authorized the director of the abc,currently appellee jerry fischer,to enforce the state rules and regulations related to alcohol.see stat.ann.id.the abc has broad authority in this realm and is statutorily authorized to promulgate rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper regulation and control of the manufacture,sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages.id.
the abc regulation at issue in this case reads,in relevant part,as follows 
a no licensee shall engage in or allow,permit or suffer on or about the licensed premises 
any lewdness or immoral activity 
admin.code a.the abc enacted the regulation to reflect the judicial recognition that lewdness or immoral activity in conjunction with alcoholic beverage consumption can give rise to unacceptable social behavior.reg.june.abc director fischer has also stated in a certification submitted to the district court that the purpose of the regulation is to limit the harmful secondary effects of the combination of alcohol and lewd or immoral activity,including overconsumption of alcohol and inappropriate physical contact between customers and dancers.the new jersey superior court,appellate division,has construed the regulation prohibition of lewd or immoral activity as prohibiting entertainment where the predominant object and natural effect upon the of one portion of the performance is erotic excitation.in re,quoting davis new town tavern,emphasis added 
in may of,the abc cited south for three separate violations of the regulation,which were deemed to have occurred based on an undercover investigation by the state police.though there were alleged violations of other abc rules and regulations,what is important here is that the state police noted three female adult entertainers on south premises engaging in what the police determined to be prohibited activity under the regulation.in one instance police observed an entertainer rubbing her breasts and vagina while onstage.she then proceeded to straddle a patron,pushing her breasts in his face and then rubbing her leg in the patron pelvic area before rubbing his inner thighs with her hands.police also witnessed a second entertainer caressing her breasts and massaging her vaginal area onstage.they then observed that entertainer give a patron a dance during which she straddled him and pushed her pelvic area into his pelvic area to simulate sexual intercourse.finally,a third whom one of the officers received a seen rubbing her breasts and massaging her vagina to simulate the act of masturbation.
upon being cited for these violations,south negotiated a payment to the abc in the sum of in lieu of a suspension of its liquor license after it paid the negotiated fee,and prior to reopening after a renovation,south filed the instant lawsuit,arguing that the regulation is unconstitutional because it proscribes protected forms of expression and fails to make clear what conduct is or is not permitted on the premises of a liquor licensee.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of abc director fischer,holding the regulation to be constitutional this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
south contends that the district court erred in finding the regulation constitutional and granting abc director fischer motion for summary judgment.on appeal it has raised four issues.south claims that the district court erred in rejecting its first amendment,facial challenge to the regulation its claim that the regulation is unconstitutionally overbroad and its claim that the regulation is unconstitutionally vague.in addition,south asserts that the district court erred in permitting the certification of appellee fischer to be used as a limiting statutory construction of the regulation.we address each issue in turn.
first amendment facial challenge 
we begin our analysis of the current state of first amendment protections as they relate to erotic dance in locations with california larue,d,a supreme court opinion with facts similar to those present here.in larue,the california department of alcoholic beverage control had adopted regulations that prohibited the following conduct,among others,on premises 
the actual or simulated touching,caressing or fondling of the breast,buttocks,anus or genitals 
the actual or simulated displaying of the pubic hair,anus,vulva or genitals and 
the permitting by a licensee of any person to remain in or upon the licensed premises who exposes to public view any portion of his or her genitals or anus.
id.at.the supreme court rejected a first amendment challenge to the regulations.as the majority explained,as the mode of expression moves from the printed page to the commission of public acts that may themselves violate valid penal statutes,the scope of permissible state regulations significantly increases.id.paraphrasing united states,d,the court noted approvingly that in that case the extent to which conduct was protected by the first amendment depended on the presence of a communicative element.larue,at.the court then observed that the california regulations prohibited performances that partake more in gross sexuality than of communication.id.at.importantly,the court observed that the regulations did not seek to ban all performances they addressed,but only those performances that take place in establishments licensed by the state of california to sell liquor by the drink.id.
in upholding the constitutionality of the regulations in larue,the court paused to observe that performances such as those proscribed in california are not without first and fourteenth amendment protection.however,the court noted,we would poorly serve both the interests for which the state may validly seek vindication and the interests protected by the first and fourteenth amendments were we to insist that the sort of bacchanalian revelries the california department sought to prevent by these liquor regulations were the constitutional equivalent of a performance by a scantily clad ballet troupe in a theater.id.in closing,the larue court observed that,given the added presumption in favor of the validity of the state regulation in this area that the amendment which repealed prohibition and granted states broad leeway over the regulation of intoxicating liquors requires,we can not hold that the regulations on their face violate the federal constitution.id.
though larue holding remains good law,its reliance on the amendment was later undercut by liquormart rhode island,d.there,the court held that the amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the first amendment.id.at.the liquormart court took care to note,however,that the court analysis in larue would have led to precisely the same result if it had placed no reliance on the amendment.id.at.the court observed that,without regard to states regulatory authority over alcoholic beverages under the amendment,a given state may 
prohibit the sale of alcohol in inappropriate locations.moreover the states inherent police powers provide ampl
