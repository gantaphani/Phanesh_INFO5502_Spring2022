this immigration case presents an issue regarding the standard of review to be applied by an administrative appellate panel.facing deportation,petitioner james amoah turkson turkson asked an immigration judge ij to defer his removal because turkson believed he would be tortured if returned to his native ghana.the ij ruled that turkson would likely face torture in ghana,and therefore deferred turkson removal.the department of homeland security dhs appealed the ij ruling to the board of immigration appeals bia.
on appeal,the bia reviewed all aspects of the ij decision de novo and reversed the ij decision.the bia erred in reviewing the ij factual findings under the de novo standard of review instead of under the clearly erroneous standard prescribed by its governing regulations.we therefore grant turkson petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
material facts and procedural history 
turkson was born in ghana.he was subjected to violence in his native country while distributing pamphlets for the political party of which his father was a leader.to escape the violence,he came to the united states on a false passport in.he later married a united states citizen,and became a permanent legal resident.
turkson committed a number of crimes in the united states.most recently,turkson was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.because of that conviction,dhs initiated proceedings to remove him from the united states.dhs can remove aliens who become aggravated felons under a a iii,or who have a controlled substance conviction under a b i.the parties agree that these provisions justify turkson removal.
an alien subject to removal,however,can contest his removal if he can show that he will likely face torture in his native country.turkson applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and deferral of under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat.the ij found him ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal based on his criminal record but granted deferral of removal under the cat.
the ij made detailed factual findings.he found the testimony of turkson and his brother,regarding brutality in ghana,to be credible.specifically,the ij accepted turkson evidence that,in,government officials had brutally questioned turkson about his political activities.as part of their interrogation,they forced him to walk on his knees and punched him until he lost consciousness.turkson suffered a broken wrist,lacerations requiring stitches,a six inch scar on his back,and a knife wound.
the ij also found that political violence continues to this day in ghana.the political landscape,he determined,is characterized by vigilante violence.prison conditions are harsh.rural areas remain violent and brutal.while cities are less violent,the ij found that this fact would not make it any less likely that turkson would be tortured.throughout ghana,police remain involved in political activity,and continue to use excessive force,characterized by the ij as police brutality.
based on these determinations,the ij found that turkson had been the victim of torture before he left ghana in.the ij also found that it is more likely than not that he would be detained by the police if returned to ghana.further,the ij also decided that it is more likely than not that turkson would be tortured because of the excessive use of force by police officers in ghana.based on these findings,the ij ordered the deferral of turkson removal.
dhs appealed to the bia,which considered de novo whether it was more likely than not that turkson would be tortured upon return to ghana.the bia panel largely disregarded the testimony of turkson and his brother and concluded that turkson would not likely be tortured if returned.the bia therefore vacated the ij ruling,and on october,turkson was removed to ghana.turkson now petitions this court for review of the bia rulings.
ii.the convention against torture and its implementation 
the united states is a party to the cat.under article of the convention,parties agree not to deport a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,adopted.
torture is a term of art under the cat,with a specific legal definition.the cat defines torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.it does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
before removal,aliens are entitled to a hearing before an ij.see generally.in that removal proceeding,the alien may apply for relief under the cat.to warrant cat protection,an alien must prove,first,that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal and,second,that this torture will occur at the hands of government or with the consent or acquiescence of government.c.
while the burden of proof lies with the alien to establish his right to relief under the cat,t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.c.the regulations direct the trier of fact to consider all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture.id.c.if the ij determines that the petitioner is more likely than not to be tortured upon removal,the petitioner is entitled to protection under the cat,either in the form of withholding of removal or deferral of removal.id.c.the petitioner will be granted withholding of removal,unless one of the exceptions requiring a mandatory denial of withholding of removal is triggered id.in that event,the petitioner removal shall be deferred,rather than withheld.id.
dhs or the alien may appeal the ij determination to the bia.either party may appeal a final determination of the bia to a federal court of appeals.a see also.d stating that judicial review of claims for protection from removal under the cat shall only be made as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the farr act.
iii.discussion 
the bia applied the wrong standard of review to the ij factual findings.in doing so,the bia failed to follow its own regulations as well as the case law interpreting those regulations.
because turkson was subject to a removal order by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,our jurisdiction to review the bia order is limited.see a c,a a iii.we review the petition only to the extent that it raises questions of law or constitutional claims.see a c d.
we review the bia legal determinations de novo.hui zheng holder,cir.that review,however,is subject to agency deference pursuant to chevron natural resources defense council.the bia interpretation of its own governing regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,citations omitted.
the bia is the highest administrative tribunal on immigration and nationality matters.before,the bia reviewed all aspects of an ij decision de novo.in,however,the applicable regulations were amended,which changed the scope of review as to the factual findings of an ij.d i ii,f.
d i now states the board will not engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.facts determined by the immigration judge,including findings as to credibility of testimony,shall be reviewed only to determine whether the findings of the immigration judge are clearly erroneous.as to other matters,d ii provides the board may revie
