william darden filed this action under the administrative procedure act against marybeth peters,register of copyrights,seeking to set aside a decision of the united states copyright office denying darden applications for copyright registration.see a e.finding no abuse of discretion in the register refusal to issue a copyright registration for darden works,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the register.
darden created a website called,an online referral service for consumers to locate real estate appraisers throughout the united states.the website features a series of maps that enable a user to find an appraiser in a desired location by pointing to and clicking on the appropriate map.the homepage of features a stylized map of the united states that serves as a link to a separate page displaying a detailed map of any state selected by the user.the state maps,in turn,are divided into counties the consumer can retrieve a list of local appraisers by selecting the appropriate county.
in developing his website,darden hired sean pecor,a web designer,to create the maps.pecor started with a digital census map of the united states,colored the map blue,and added shading to give the map a effect.pecor selected a font to use in labeling the states,and he added labels as well.pecor used the same process for the individual maps of each state.after completing the project,pecor assigned darden any copyright interest he held in the maps and the design of the website.
in may,darden filed an application with the copyright office seeking to register his website,which he titled appraisers dotcom for purposes of the application,as a technical drawing.darden described appraisersdotcom as a derivative work based on us census black and white outline maps and clip art.darden application identified graphics,text,colors,and arrangement as the material that he added to the preexisting work and in which he claimed copyright protection.additionally,darden filed a separate application for registration of the work maps for appraisersdotcom.darden described his maps work as a derivative work that,similar to the appraisersdotcom work,was based on preexisting us census black and white outline maps.he claimed copyright ownership in the additions made by pecor to the preexisting census maps font and color selection visual effects such as relief,shadowing,and shading labeling.
the examining division of the copyright office rejected both applications.with respect to darden claim in the maps themselves,the examiner concluded that the work lack ed the authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.the examiner explained that i n order to be copyrightable,a work of the visual arts must contain a minimum amount of pictorial,graphic,or sculptural authorship and that c opyright does not protect familiar shapes,symbols,and designs or mere variations of typographic ornamentation,lettering,fonts,or coloring.the labeling,relief,shadowing and shading that darden contributed to the preexisting maps,the examiner concluded,are standard elements that do not contain copyrightable authorship.
as for darden application to register his appraisersdotcom web pages as a technical drawing,the examiner first noted that the work does not appear to contain any technical drawing.regarding darden claim for graphics,the examiner determined that a ll of the graphic elements appear to consist only of the preexisting outline maps and some simple colored rectangles and thus the added material was not sufficiently original to warrant copyright protection.darden variations in color were rejected on the same basis.the examiner observed,however,that t he work contains text and perhaps a compilation which can support a copyright claim,if they are original and indicated that darden could pursue registration of an original compilation by filing a new or amended application that omitt ed any reference to technical drawing,graphics,or colors.
darden sought reconsideration by the examining division of the copyright office.with respect to his application for registration of the maps work,darden argued that the maps had a sufficient level of creativity to warrant copyright protection because of the special combination of font and color selection visual effects such as relief,shadowing,and shading labeling and.the information the maps convey could easily be provided in other ways thus,the author should be allowed to protect his creative efforts.in support of his request for reconsideration,darden submitted a written declaration from sean pecor who asserted that,even though he used preexisting census maps as the basis of his work,each map was altered to such a degree that each line on each map is measurably changed from the digital originals obtained from the census.specifically,pecor resized the maps and redrew many of the lines so that during scale down of the maps,the images would not get a chunky look.pecor claims he also created a effect by repeating each outline several bright blue outline slightly askew,one darker outline slightly askew.
darden submitted an amended application for registration of the appraisersdotcom work.the revised application indicated that the nature of authorship was a compilation and arrangement of maps,text,graphics,and data as opposed to a technical drawing as indicated in the original application.darden described the new material in which he claimed copyright as t ext map designs and formats compilation,formating,and arrangement of text,maps,graphics,and listing data.darden made clear that he was asserting no claim in the content of the listing data.
the examining division denied darden request for reconsideration and registration of his copyright claims.the examining attorney explained that 
i n the case of a derivative work,copyright protection covers only the additions or changes appearing in the work for the first time mean ing that the new material must contain a sufficient amount of original and creative authorship to be copyrightable.copyright does not extend to any preexisting or previously registered material w here the new material consists solely of the uncopyrightable elements such as a change of layout,format,size,spacing or coloring,registration is not possible.
the examiner concluded that the changes made to darden maps work amount ed primarily to layout and format as well as de minimis compilation and therefore lacked a sufficient amount of originality and creativity to support a copyright registration.with respect to the appraisersdotcom work,the examiner again suggested the possibility of a registrable claim in only the text and compilation of data but indicated that a new application,revised to limit the claim to text and compilation of data,was required.
darden then sought review of the denial of his applications by the copyright office board of appeals.darden argument was essentially identical to that asserted in his request for reconsideration 
darden is not seeking a copyright on one particular design element of the maps in question,nor is he asking for protection of simple combinations of elements such as familiar shapes,symbols,and designs mere variations of typographic ornamentation,lettering,fonts or coloring.darden requests protection for the overall pictorial expressions of his maps.
darden overall design,his special combination of font and color selection,selection and arrangement of geographic locations such as counties,visual effects such as relief,shadowing,and shading,labeling,and provide the creative spark that make s the maps original and eligible for protection.
darden also presented his own declaration in which he stated that he had received calls from people and companies asking whether i would license our maps for them to use on their web sites demonstrating that people recognize the maps as being unique and proprietary to us.
the board of appeals again affirmed the denial of registration for both the maps and the appraisersdotcom works.with regard to the copyright claim in the maps themselves,the board concluded,as did the examining division,that the maps were merely representations of the preexisting census maps in which the creative spark is utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually nonexistent.internal quotation marks omitted.the board also noted that any marketplace confusion created by the use of darden maps by third parties was irrelevant to the question of whether the maps were copyrightable,as were requests to darden by website browsers for license to use the maps.as for the appraisersdotcom application,the board of appeals affirmed the denial of registration due to the expansive scope of the claim.although the board of appeals endorsed the notion that there could well be copyrightable elements included on the website,darden claim as stated in his registration text,maps,and formatting of an internet web page was simply too broad to warrant protection.
darden then brought this action against the register of copyrights under the administrative procedure act apa,see,seeking judicial review of the decision of the copyright office refusing to register his copyright claim.rejecting darden argument that the decision of the copyright office is subject to a de novo standard of review,the district court concluded that the copyright office did not abuse its discretion in refusing registration,see a,and granted the register motion for summary judgment.
the copyright act provides that all actions taken by the register of copyrights under this title are subject to the provisions of the administrative procedure act.e one routine function of the register is to examine applications for registration to determine if the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter and the other legal and formal requirements of the copyright act have been met.a.if so,then the register must issue a certificate of registration to the applicant,see a if,however,the register determines that the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason,then the register must refuse registration and notify the applicant of the reasons for refusal,b.because the register denial of a copyright registration application is,by the statute plain terms,an action taken by the register under the copyright act,the apa governs judicial review.see e atari games oman,atari i nova stylings,ladd,cir.
the district court concluded that the proper standard of review under the apa is the familiar abuse of discretion standard whereby a reviewing court will set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.this is consistent with the few federal of which were issued by the same the proper review standard under the apa for courts directly reviewing a registration decision.see atari games oman,atari ii oddzon,oman,atari i,at coach,peters,d.see generally melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b,at.
darden does not contest the general applicability of the apa to his claim indeed,he expressly brought this action under the apa.darden contends,however,that the district court incorrectly applied the abuse of discretion standard set forth in section a of the apa.darden suggests instead that section b applies to a challenge of the register denial of a copyright registration application and mandates a de novo standard of review.section b directs that the reviewing court set aside agency actions the court finds to be contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity.b.under the apa,constitutional questions that arise during apa review fall expressly within the domain of the courts.see requiring that t o the extent necessary to decision and when presented,the reviewing court shall interpret constitutional and statutory provisions emphasis added.thus,judicial review of a claim that the agency actions violated a claimant constitutional rights is conducted de novo.see western energy united states dep t of interior,cir.
darden cites no authority even remotely suggesting that any court has ever regarded the agency routine decision to deny registration as having constitutional ramifications for the claimant.darden derives the basis for his argument from article i of the united states constitution which grants congress the power to provide copyright protection to the extent congress sees fit.see const.art.i,cl.granting congress legislative power t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.congress is under no mandate from this clause,however,to provide copyright protection.see silvers sony pictures entertainment,cir as is clear from its text,that clause of the constitution grants no substantive protections to authors.rather,congress is empowered to provide copyright protection.copyright is solely a creature of statute whatever rights and remedies exist do so only because congress provided them.see sony of am.universal city studios,d.thus,as there is no constitutional right to copyright registration,the register refusal to register darden claim can not be contrary to constitutional right as it must be for section b to apply.
darden next contends that because the register decision was based on the agency incorrect resolution of a legal question,whether darden claim lacked sufficient originality to be registrable,the register decision is subject to de novo review.more particularly,darden argues that the register refusal to find sufficient originality in his submitted works despite the extremely low amount of creativity required for a work to be copyrightable,feist publications,rural.serv,d,was an erroneous conclusion that must be set aside under the not in accordance with law provision of section a of the apa.additionally,darden cites various decisions noting,in the context of copyright infringement litigation,that copyrightability is always an issue of law for the court.gaiman mcfarlane,cir see yankee candle bridgewater candle,cir collezione europa hillsdale house,d.
we reject darden argument.essentially,darden is claiming that the register simply reached the wrong result,not that the register applied the wrong legal standard or misapprehended or ignored the controlling legal principles.see turgeau administrative review,cir explaining that under a f ailure to apply the correct legal standard or to provide this court with a sufficient basis to determine that appropriate legal principles have been followed is grounds for reversal internal quotation marks omitted.review under section a is narrow and the reviewing court is not permitted to substitute its own judgment for the judgment of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.rather,the court is to determine whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors,west virginia thompson,cir quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,or whether the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,or entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,motor vehicle,at.see thompson,at.
darden makes no assertion of this kind here he merely argues that the agency should have concluded that the maps and appraisersdotcom works contained the requisite level of creativity,citing feist and other precedents.at every level of internal agency review,however,the copyright office recognized feist as having established the contours of the originality element of a copyright claim.because darden has failed to identify any relevant factor or legal principle that the register failed to consider,the agency decision can not be set aside as contrary to law.
finally,darden argues that the register determination that a copyright claim lacked sufficient originality to warrant registration is subject to de novo review in the context of an infringement action under section a of the copyright act.he contends that de novo review of the copyrightability issue should also apply in the context of apa review for the sake of efficiency and predictability.we can not agree.
congress has afforded disappointed copyright applicants two separate methods of seeking redress for the decision of the copyright office not to register a copyright claim.
