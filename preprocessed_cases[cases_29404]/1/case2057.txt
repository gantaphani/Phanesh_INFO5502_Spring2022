michigan state legislators laura baird and gary peters challenge former interior secretary bruce babbitt approval of gaming compacts between the state of michigan and four indian tribes.baird,a member of the michigan house of representatives,and peters,a michigan state senator,brought suit seeking a declaration that the gaming compacts are invalid and an order directing the secretary to disapprove them baird and peters argue that the compacts approved by babbitt were never properly entered into by the state of michigan because the state legislature followed unconstitutional procedures in considering them.thus,they argue,secretary babbitt could not properly approve the compacts under the indian gaming regulatory act igra,et.on may,the district court granted the secretary motion to dismiss,pursuant to.b and.in granting the secretary motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that peters did not have article iii standing,as a state legislator,but that baird did.with respect to baird,the district court concluded that igra did not include an implied right of action,that baird was not in the zone of interests protected by igra,and thus that baird did not have standing to challenge the secretary action under the administrative procedure act.because we conclude that neither baird nor peters has article iii standing,we affirm the district court granting of the secretary motion to dismiss.
background 
baird and peters contend that the michigan state legislature did not follow procedures required by the state constitution for approval of the gaming compacts at issue.rather than approve the compacts by legislation,which requires that a majority of the members of both the state house of representatives and state senate vote in favor of the measure,see.const.art.iv,the state legislature approved the compacts by concurrent this case,by concurrent resolution cr.passage of a concurrent resolution,however,requires only a majority of votes cast rather than a majority of all members votes.thus,the michigan house of representatives,comprised of members,approved the gaming compacts by a vote of to,with baird voting in the minority.although this vote margin would have been insufficient to enact legislation,it was sufficient to pass cr.in the michigan senate,which has members,cr passed by a vote of to seventeen,with peters in the minority.the senate vote on the concurrent resolution,then,would have been sufficient to pass legislation approving the compacts.
after passage of cr,the gaming compacts were subsequently considered approved when secretary babbitt failed to approve or reject them within days.see d c.the compacts were then published in the federal register and became effective under d b.
ii.analysis 
the threshold issue in this case is whether baird and peters have standing to sue based on their status as state legislators aggrieved by the state legislature use of allegedly unconstitutional procedures.the district court found that baird has standing but that peters does not.peters argues in this appeal that the district court erred in reaching this conclusion,but,for the reasons given below,the district court conclusion regarding peters was correct.in this appeal,baird asserts that the district court properly found that she has standing because of her status as a state legislator,and the appellees have not disputed baird article iii standing.this court,however,is under an independent obligation to examine its own jurisdiction,and standing is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines,city of dallas,d quoting allen wright,d alteration in.because we conclude that baird,too,lacks article iii standing to sue,we do not have jurisdiction to consider the other issues raised in this appeal.
baird and peters argue that they suffered two different injuries as a result of the secretary failure to reject the compacts at issue.first,baird and peters argue that they have been injured by being deprived of the procedural safeguards required by the michigan constitution for the passage of legislation,such as the reading of proposed legislation three times and the requirement that the legislation be in the possession of both houses at least five days before any vote.see.const,art.iv.the district court correctly rejected these claimed injuries as insufficient to give the appellants standing in the present case.these constitutional measures are clearly designed to preclude,hasty legislation and to provide notice to the public of legislation under consideration,anderson oakland county clerk,and not to protect individual state legislators.because of this denial of procedural safeguards,then,baird and peters have,at most,a generalized grievance shared by all michigan residents alike.such a grievance does not give them standing to sue.see schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d s tanding to sue may not be predicated upon an interest which is held in common by all members of the public,because of the necessarily abstract nature of the injury all citizens share.
second,baird and peters argue that their votes were nullified by the state legislature use of improper procedures in enacting the gaming compacts.under certain circumstances,vote nullification may give legislators standing to challenge improper procedures.see raines byrd,d coleman miller.but baird and peters have not suffered a injury sufficient to give them standing in the present case.
the leading case on legislator standing based on vote nullification is coleman miller.in coleman,the supreme court held that a group of kansas state senators had standing to sue when they claimed that their votes had been effectively nullified by the state legislature use of an allegedly unconstitutional procedure.in voting on a proposed constitutional amendment,the kansas state senate had divided evenly,with twenty kansas state senators voting for ratification and twenty against.the kansas lieutenant governor then cast the vote in favor,and the amendment was treated as ratified as a result.see coleman,at.the coleman plaintiffs,including the twenty state senators who had voted against ratifying the amendment,claimed that the lieutenant governor vote had been improper and unconstitutional and thus sought a writ of mandamus to compel state officials to recognize that the amendment had not been properly ratified.see id.the supreme court concluded that the coleman plaintiffs had standing to challenge the procedure,based on the effective nullification of their votes,but held against them on the merits of their claim.see id.at.
the supreme court recently clarified its holding in coleman in raines byrd.raines involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the line item veto act,stat.four senators and two house members brought the suit,claiming that the act would reduce their voting effectiveness on future appropriations bills.see raines,at.the raines plaintiffs relied heavily on coleman suggestion that legislators have a plain,direct,and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.id.at.the raines court rejected this broad reading of coleman,however,holding that the legislators lacked standing because they had alleged no more than the abstract dilution of institutional legislative power.id.at.the court distinguished the facts in raines from those in coleman,stressing that the six raines plaintiffs had not alleged that they voted for a specific bill,that there were sufficient votes to pass the bill,and that the bill was nonetheless deemed defeated.id.at.instead,the raines plaintiffs had simply voted against a bill,their votes were given full effect in that vote,but the bill was passed despite their nay votes.id.in short,the raines plaintiffs complaint was that they had lost a vote and believed that the resulting legislation was unconstitutional,but this was not a sufficient injury to give them standing to sue based on nullification.
the state legislators in coleman,in contrast,had alleged a injury sufficient to give them standing to sue because,had these state senators been correct on the merits,their votes would have been sufficient to defeat ratification.see raines,at.in this context,the raines court emphasized that the twenty kansas state senators in coleman were suing as a bloc.id.at.the raines court summary of coleman indicates that the aggregate nature of the state senators claim was essential to their standing o ur holding in coleman stands at most for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat a specific legislative act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect,on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.id.at.internal cross reference omitted.
for legislators to have standing as legislators,then,they must possess votes sufficient to have either defeated or approved the measure at issue.the present case is thus distinguishable from coleman.in coleman,the twenty state senators who voted against the proposed constitutional amendment would have been sufficient to defeat the measure had the lieutenant governor not voted.thus,through the use of this allegedly improper procedure,the votes of the twenty state senators seeking relief were completely nullified,overridden and virtually held for naught.coleman,at.in the present case,in contrast,the only member of the michigan house of representatives seeking relief is baird.baird claims vote nullification,but her vote alone would not have been sufficient to defeat either the concurrent resolution,which passed despite her nay vote,or legislation to similar effect.the michigan constitution may require a majority of all members votes for legislation to be approved,but it does not require unanimity.raines,at.citing bender williamsport area sch,d.thus,although baird institutional power was diluted through the use of the continuing resolution procedure,she has not suffered an injury that satisfies the stringent requirements for legislator standing set out in raines.similarly,state senator peters vote was not nullified by the concurrent resolution procedure because the vote in the state senate satisfied the constitutional requirement of a majority of all members for the passage of legislation.thus,peters can not argue that his vote was sufficient to defeat the passage of legislation having the same effect as cr.
under raines,however,if baird lawsuit had been joined by other members of the michigan house of representatives whose total votes and would have been sufficient to defeat the necessary legislation,then this group of lawmakers,like the twenty state senators in coleman,would have had standing as legislators based on vote nullification.if,for example,baird had been joined by eight of the fifteen members of the michigan house who did not vote when cr was passed,then their,coupled with the votes actually cast against cr,would have been sufficient to defeat the legislation that baird claims is constitutionally,eight of the,plus nay votes,effectively equals votes against the measure under the michigan constitution requirement that a majority of all votes is necessary to enact legislation 
in sum,baird complaint is not that the compacts themselves are unconstitutional.instead,her complaint is that the compacts would have been defeated,had the constitutionally required procedures been followed,and thus her vote against the compacts was effectively nullified.under raines and coleman,the issue is whether baird can demonstrate that her vote was sufficient to defeat the compacts had the constitutionally required procedure been followed.because baird can not do so,she lacks standing.similarly,state senator peters lacks standing because he can not show that his vote was sufficient to defeat the gaming compacts,had the proper procedure been followed.
iii.conclusion 
because we conclude that neither baird nor peters has article iii standing in the present case,we lack jurisdiction to address the other issues raised in this appeal.for the reasons given above,the district court dismissal of the present case is affirmed.
i concur in the judgment of the majority,but i write separately because i believe that baird would lack standing even if this lawsuit had been joined by other members of the michigan legislature.unlike the majority,i do not believe that baird lack of standing stems from her failure to sue as part of a bloc.rather,her lack of standing is attributable to the fact that her vote on cr was given full effect.although she was on the losing side,her vote was not in any sense nullified.baird complaint is simply that a concurrent resolution was an improper way for the michigan house of representatives to approve the gaming compacts at issue.she contends that she should have received the opportunity to vote on legislation proposing the compacts.according to baird,the secretary of the interior unlawfully endorsed the compacts,without obtaining the necessary approval of the state legislature thereby depriving her of the right to vote on them in the manner prescribed by the michigan constitution.such an injury,however,is insufficient to confer article iii standing,with or without the presence of baird colleagues in this lawsuit.
the foregoing conclusion is consistent with,and mandated by,coleman miller,and raines byrd,d.in coleman,of kansas state senators voted against ratification of a constitutional amendment.the lieutenant governor then cast a vote in favor of the amendment,which was ratified as a result of his vote.thereafter,the members of the kansas senate who had voted against the amendment sought a writ of mandamus from the kansas supreme court to compel state officials to recognize that the legislature had not ratified the amendment because the lieutenant governor should not have been permitted to vote.upon review,the kansas supreme court held that the legislators had standing to bring their mandamus action,but it ruled against them on the merits.the united states supreme court subsequently agreed,holding that the members of the legislature had standing.in reaching this conclusion,the coleman court noted that,if the legislators were correct on the merits,then their votes against ratification were nullified.in relevant part,the court reasoned 
here,the plaintiffs include twenty senators,whose votes against ratification have been overridden and virtually held for naught although if they are right in their contentions their votes would have been sufficient to defeat ratification.we think that these senators have a plain,direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.
t he twenty senators were not only qualified to vote on the question of ratification but their votes,if the lieutenant governor were excluded as not being a part of the legislature for that purpose,would have been decisive in defeating the ratifying resolution.
w e find no departure from principle in recognizing in the instant case that at least the twenty senators whose votes,if their contention were sustained,would have been sufficient to defeat the resolution ratifying the proposed constitutional amendment,have an interest in the controversy which,treated by the state court as a basis for entertaining and deciding the federal questions,is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to review that decision.
coleman,at.
the supreme court subsequently read coleman narrowly in raines,holding that members of congress lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the line item veto act because they had not alleged a sufficiently concrete injury in reaching this conclusion,the raines court read coleman as standing at most for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat or enact a specific legislative act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect or does not go into effect,on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.raines,at.footnote omitted.
after restricting coleman to the proposition set forth above,the raines court reasoned 
it should be equally obvious that appellees claim does not fall within our holding in coleman,as thus understood.they have not alleged that they voted for a specific bill,that there were sufficient votes to pass the bill,and that the bill was nonetheless deemed defeated.in the vote on the act,their votes were given
