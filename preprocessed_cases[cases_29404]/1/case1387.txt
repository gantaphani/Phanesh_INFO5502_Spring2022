just two days before the statute of limitations barred the internal revenue service from assessing additional taxes for,the donnelley corporation claimed refunds for and based on tax credits carried back from.the statute of limitations then expired.after an investigation revealed that the taxpayer had so underreported its income that there was sufficient tax liability to use up all of the credits in that year,the irs denied the refund claim.we agree with the district court that the irs can recalculate tax liability for a year beyond the statute of limitations in order to determine whether excess tax credits can be carried back to previous years to support a refund.
on december,the donnelley corporation filed timely refund claims with the internal revenue service for the and tax years.those refund claims depended on tax credits that donnelley sought to carry back from to create a retroactive overpayment.in particular,donnelley had in excess foreign tax credits that it sought to carry back to and in excess research credits a species of the general business credit that it sought to carry back to.
in response to donnelley refund claims,the irs conducted an audit and found that a large,unrelated deduction claimed by donnelley in was improper.the irs disallowed that deduction and,in,notified donnelley that the agency had calculated,but not assessed,a tax deficiency for of more than million.the irs did not seek to collect donnelley additional tax liability for that year because the statute of limitations for the assessment and collection of additional taxes expired on december,just two days after donnelley filed its refund claim.see a.due to the recalculation of donnelley tax liability,however,the irs asserted that all of donnelley remaining credits could be and must be used up in.as a result,there were no excess credits to be carried back to and,and there was thus no overpayment that would justify a refund.
donnelley did not challenge the disallowance of the deduction.instead,it disputed that the irs could recalculate the amount of the excess credits from.donnelley timely filed suit on its refund claims in the eastern district of north carolina in.the district court subsequently granted the united states motion for summary judgment and dismissed the refund claim.donnelley now appeals.
though donnelley asserts that the irs may not recalculate its taxes to defeat a refund claim for and,we find this claim untenable in light of the supreme court longstanding recognition that the irs may recompute tax liabilities in response to a refund claim.see lewis reynolds.in lewis,the irs timely audited an income tax return and disallowed all deductions except one for attorney fees.despite paying the resulting deficiency,the taxpayer continued to believe that a deduction for state taxes was proper and so sought a refund.id.at.
the irs denied the refund claim because upon further review,the attorney fee deduction,which was larger than the state tax deduction,was in fact improper.though the statute of limitations prevented the irs from actually collecting the resulting deficiency,the irs asserted that the deficiency remained and so the taxpayer was not entitled to a refund.id.
the supreme court agreed.t he ultimate question in a refund case is whether the taxpayer has overpaid his tax.this involves a redetermination of the entire tax liability.id.at quoting lewis reynolds,cir.the court noted that w hile no new assessment can be made,after the bar of the statute of limitations has fallen,the taxpayer,nevertheless,is not entitled to a refund unless he has overpaid his tax.id.thus even when the irs may not collect a deficiency,it may retain payments already received when they do not exceed the amount which might have been properly assessed and demanded.id.
donnelley acknowledges that the rule of lewis is potentially applicable here,but contends that lewis is distinguishable because it only permits the irs to raise issues arising in that same tax year as an offset to the refund claimed.brief of appellant at.under this theory,the irs could challenge a deduction from or,the years for which donnelley claims a refund.the agency could not,however,reexamine whether there were excess credits in to be carried back to and.
this cramped reading of lewis is unpersuasive.tax years are not insular units,and the code often allows taxpayers to shift tax items to other years.see,carryback and carryover of unused business credits c carryback and carryover of excess foreign tax credits.lewis rested on a sensible rationale a n overpayment must appear before refund is authorized,at that sometimes requires looking into other tax years.the tax court too has found that the irs has authority to recalculate all tax years necessary to determine whether there was an overpayment in the year of the claimed refund,so long as it does not assess additional taxes as a prelude to collecting them.see hill comm r,lone manor farms,comm r,aff without opinion cir.
in this case,whether there were overpayments in and hinges on whether donnelley had excess foreign tax and business credits to carry back from.the irs properly acknowledges that lewis does not permit the irs to defend against a refund claim for one year with an unassessable understatement of tax from a different year.brief of appellee at see also philadelphia reading united states,cir taxes fairly due but not properly assessed for one year can not be against refunds due for another year.for example,the irs could not on the authority of lewis rebut donnelley refund claims for and by noting,without more,that donnelley had underpaid its taxes in.but lewis must permit the irs to recalculate tax items from other years when those items are necessary to determine the correct tax in the year of the claimed refund.as the district court noted,any other result would allow a taxpayer to benefit twice from its underpayment.donnelley united states,d.
donnelley attempts to circumvent lewis using this court decision in estate of michael lullo,cir.but estate of michael only confirms the correct understanding of lewis.there,after the taxpayer submitted proof of its entitlement to a tax credit,after it paid all taxes that had been assessed,and after the statute of limitations expired,the irs sought to collect additional taxes.the irs claimed,improbably,that lewis justified its attempt to collect a deficiency.this court was not convinced while lewis does allow the irs to refuse certain refunds,it does not allow the irs collection of any additional sum after the limitations period has expired.id.at internal quotation omitted.estate of michael thus rebuffed the irs attempt to expand lewis well beyond its natural borders.
donnelley,however,strains to read estate of michael to justify its own attempt to escape the force of lewis altogether.estate of michael noted at one point that the statute of limitations not only prevents the irs from assessing these taxes in the future,it extinguishes potential liability for all such taxes.id.at.donnelley would now use this unremarkable statement to hamstring the irs efforts to defend against all sorts of refund claims.in particular,donnelley supposes that all potential liability for additional taxes it might have owed in a liability that in this case would have negated the credits carried back to and to create a refund was extinguished after the statute of limitations expired.on this reading,which would do violence to the supreme court clear holding in lewis,it is irrelevant whether this is a tax refund case or a tax collection case.brief of appellant at.
that is far from what estate of michael held.the expiration of the statute of limitations does extinguish potential liability in the sense that the taxpayer has no obligation to pay any additional taxes that the irs tries to collect.indeed,estate of michael rebuffed the irs improper attempt to collect additional taxes in that case after the statute of limitations had expired.but estate of michael does not stand for the proposition that the irs may not tax years intertwined with a claim for a refund.the opinion repeatedly emphasized the difference between collection and refund,
