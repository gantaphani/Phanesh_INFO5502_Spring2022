opinion of the court 
shawn james allen woodall,a federal prisoner,challenges recently adopted bureau of prison bop regulations that limit a prisoner placement in community confinement to the lesser of ten percent of the prisoner total sentence or six months.woodall appeal from the order of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus presents two important questions.first,may woodall bring this challenge in habeas because we believe that woodall challenge goes to the execution of his sentence,we hold that habeas corpus does lie.second,we must decide whether the new bop regulations run afoul of the bop governing statute and congressional intent.we believe that they do.the governing statute at issue here,b,lists five factors that the bop must consider in making placement and transfer determinations.the regulations,which categorically limit the amount of time an inmate may be placed in a community corrections center ccc,do not allow the bop to consider these factors in full.we will therefore vacate the judgment of the district court,and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
woodall is currently incarcerated at the federal correctional institution at fort dix,new jersey.he was convicted of alien smuggling in the united states district court for the southern district of california and was sentenced on december,to a imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.on september,after pleading guilty to an escape charge under,woodall was sentenced to another six months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.he was released on march,to serve the term of supervised release.
on april,woodall was arrested by california authorities for possession of a controlled substance.at sentencing,woodall represented that his offense was a result of the fact that he was released by the bop on march,with no money,no identification and no assets,into a community where he had no ties whatsoever.on september,the district court for the southern district of california revoked woodall supervised release for the earlier alien smuggling conviction and sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment with no supervised release.the next day,his supervised release was revoked with respect to the escape conviction,and he was sentenced to twelve additional months in prison.the sentence imposed was below the guideline range based on woodall comments as to the situation he found himself in on the streets without any money,and the fact that the government concurs that what happened.see supra note.
significantly,on february,the sentencing judge entered an order amending the sentencing judgment and recommending to the bureau of prisons that woodall spend the last six months of his sentence in a halfway house.the assistant united states attorney on the case urged that placement.woodall now remains in custody with a projected release date of april.while his sentencing judge recommended a halfway house placement for the final of his sentence,woodall was informed by the unit manager at fort dix that because of the bop policy changes at issue in this appeal,he could be placed in a ccc for no more than percent of his total sentence.therefore,woodall would be entitled to no more than eleven weeks of ccc placement.according to the government,woodall will be placed in community confinement on or around january.
woodall thereupon filed a habeas petition pursuant to,arguing that the new bop regulations impermissibly ignored the placement recommendations of his sentencing judge his petition was dismissed by the district court for the district of new jersey on july.the court found that the new bop regulations were a permissive construction of the relevant statutes.the court emphasized that the regulations are entitled to considerable deference and cited lopez davis,d,in support of its decision.this appeal followed 
ii.bureau of prison placement policies and the relevant statutory provisions 
this appeal turns on the interpretation of two statutes.under b,the bop is vested with authority to determine the location of an inmate imprisonment.that statute not only grants the bop placement authority,it lists factors for consideration in making placement and transfer determinations 
b place of imprisonment.the bureau of prisons shall designate the place of the prisoner imprisonment.the bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum standards of health and habitability established by the bureau,whether maintained by the federal government or otherwise and whether within or without the judicial district in which the person was convicted,that the bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable,considering 
the resources of the facility contemplated 
the nature and circumstances of the offense 
the history and characteristics of the prisoner 
any statement by the court that imposed the sentence 
a concerning the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was determined to be warranted or 
b recommending a type of penal or correctional facility as appropriate and 
any pertinent policy statement issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to section a of title.
in designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under this subsection,there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high social or economic status.the bureau may at any time,having regard for the same matters,direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another.
emphasis added.
a more specific provision,c,describes the bop obligation to prepare prisoners for community by,inter alia,placing them in community confinement 
c custody.the bureau of prisons shall,to the extent practicable,assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,not to exceed six months,of the last per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner into the community.the authority provided by this subsection may be used to place a prisoner in home confinement.
prior to december,the bop regularly considered prisoners for ccc placement for up to six months at the end of a sentence,regardless of the total sentence length these practices were entirely routine,and were all but taken for granted by all participants the bop,the probation office,the attorney office,the defense bar,and the judiciary.united states serpa,d,citation omitted.however,on december,the department of justice office of legal counsel olc issued a memorandum concluding that the bop practice of placing some prisoners in cccs for all or significant parts of their sentences was contrary to the bop statutory grant of authority.
the memo concluded that the bop did not have general authority under to place an offender in community confinement from the outset of his sentence or at any time the bop chooses.instead,the memo reasoned that authority to transfer a prisoner to a ccc is derived solely from,and that the statute limits residence in a ccc to the lesser of percent of the total sentence or six months.on december,the bop followed the olc advice and memorialized it.
the first circuit and the eighth circuit found this policy unlawful because it did not recognize the bop discretion to transfer an inmate to a ccc at any time,and therefore contrary to the plain meaning of.see elwood jeter,cir goldings winn,cir.the rationale of these decisions was that the time constraints of c limited only the affirmative obligation of the bop,not the agency discretion to place a prisoner in a ccc for a longer period of time.
in response to decisions such as elwood and goldings,on august,the bop proposed new regulations announcing its categorical exercise of discretion for designating inmates to community confinement when serving terms of imprisonment.while acknowledging the bop general discretion to place an inmate at a ccc at any time,the regulations limit ccc placement to the lesser of percent of a prisoner total sentence or six months,unless special statutory circumstances apply.id.the final rules were published on january,after woodall petition had been filed,and became effective on february.they,of course,apply to this case.
the final ccc designation regulations read as follows 
what is the purpose of this subpart 
a this subpart provides the bureau of prisons bureau categorical exercise of discretion for designating inmates to community confinement.the bureau designates inmates to community confinement only as part of custody and programming which will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for into the community.
b as discussed in this subpart,the term community confinement includes community corrections centers ccc also known as halfway houses and home confinement.
when will the bureau designate inmates to community confinement 
a the bureau will designate inmates to community confinement only as part of custody and programming,during the last ten percent of the prison sentence being served,not to exceed six months.
b we may exceed these only when specific bureau programs allow greater periods of community confinement,as provided by separate statutory authority for example,residential substance abuse treatment program e a,or shock incarceration program c.
emphasis added.
as explained above,the question before us is whether these new regulations are contrary to,or a permissible construction of,congress directives as set out in b.because we believe that the new policy does not allow for full consideration of the factors plainly enumerated in b,we conclude that they are not.
iii.may woodall proceed under 
we must first determine whether woodall may proceed under.though the government wants us to address the merits of woodall contentions,it feels constrained to argue that the district court lacked habeas jurisdiction to consider woodall petition because he is challenging the conditions of his confinement or a routine prison transfer,rather than the fact or duration of his sentence.it cites supreme court and third circuit case law for the proposition that only a challenge to the very fact or duration of a sentence may be challenged in habeas.in response,woodall argues that his claim can be brought under because it arises from the execution of his sentence.
resolution of this issue is far from clear,for there are credible arguments on both sides of this complicated matter.however,we are persuaded by the reasoning of the courts holding that what is at issue here is the execution of woodall sentence.
we have ourselves held that allows a federal prisoner to challenge the execution of his sentence in habeas.this was noted in coady vaughn,cir,where we distinguished from 
f ederal prisoners challenging some aspect of the execution of their sentence,such as denial of parole,may proceed under section.this difference arises from the fact that section,which like section confers habeas corpus jurisdiction over petitions from federal prisoners,is expressly limited to challenges to the validity of the petitioner sentence.thus,section is the only statute that confers habeas jurisdiction to hear the petition of a federal prisoner who is challenging not the validity but the execution of his sentence.
footnote omitted and emphasis added.we reiterated this distinction in united states eakman,cir still,the precise meaning of execution of the sentence is hazy.in attempting to decipher it,we are informed by the language of the second,sixth,ninth,and tenth circuits,all of which have found that prisoners challenging the manner of their imprisonment may proceed under.
for example,in jiminian nash,cir,the second circuit opined a motion pursuant to generally challenges the execution of a federal prisoner sentence,including such matters as the administration of parole,computation of a prisoner sentence by prison officials,prison disciplinary actions,prison transfers,type of detention and prison conditions.id.at citing chambers united states,cir.the ninth circuit has used similar language in distinguishing between and.in hernandez campbell,cir,the court noted that,in the case of a federal prisoner,motions contesting the legality of a sentence must generally be filed under while challenges to the manner,location,or conditions of a sentence execution must be brought pursuant to.
the sixth circuit,in an opinion cited by us in coady,has also found an action under appropriate for an inmate challenge to a transfer cognate to the one at bar.addressing a claim that arose when the bop threatened to move a prisoner from a community treatment center to a more secure facility,the court found appropriate because the manner in which the sentence was being executed was challenged.see united states jalili,cir.in coady,we cited jalili for its proposition that a challenge to the place of imprisonment is properly brought under section.at.similarly,the tenth circuit found a petition under proper where a prisoner challenged his transfer from a wyoming prison to a private texas facility.see montez mckinna,cir such an attack,focusing on where his sentence will be served,seems to fit better under the rubric of.additionally,a number of district courts analyzing the bop regulations or the previous policy have discussed this jurisdictional question and found that a petition is the proper mechanism for relief 
the circuits are not in agreement on this matter,however.the seventh circuit has drawn a different line and apparently would find a petition improper here.in richmond scibana,cir,the court did not address whether the petitioner was challenging the execution of his sentence but did hold that a challenge to the bop policy could not lie in habeas.it emphasized that the petitioner did not present a claim of entitlement to be released.id.at.
we think that the better rule is that of the second,sixth,ninth,and tenth circuits,and of the district courts referred to in note,supra.the approach of these courts is consistent with notions of the plain meaning of the term execution,which is to put into effect or carry out.see webster third new international dictionary.carrying out a sentence through detention in a ccc is very different from carrying out a sentence in an ordinary penal institution.more specifically,in finding that woodall action was properly brought under,we determine that placement in a ccc represents more than a simple transfer.woodall petition crosses the line beyond a challenge to,for example,a garden variety prison transfer.
the criteria for determining ccc placement are instrumental in determining how a sentence will be executed.cccs and similar facilities,unlike other forms of incarceration,are part of the phase of the corrections process focused on reintegrating an inmate into society.the relevant statute specifically provides that a prisoner should be placed in a ccc or similar institution at the end of a prison sentence to afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for into the community.cccs thus satisfy different goals from other types of confinement.we have noted the relatively lenient policies of cccs as compared to more traditional correctional facilities.ccc programs often include an employment component under which a prisoner may leave on a daily basis to work in the community.inmates may be eligible for weekend passes,overnight passes,or furloughs.see united states hillstrom,cir see also united states latimer,cir emphasizing that community confinement is qualitatively different from confinement in a traditional prison.
given these considerations,and the weight of authority from other circuits,especially jalili,we conclude that woodall challenge to the bop regulations here is a proper challenge to the execution of his sentence,and that habeas jurisdiction lies 
iv.the statutory question 
we note at the outset that no court of appeals has addressed the validity of the regulations.the district courts are divided.many have invalidated the regulations on the other hand,several district court opinions have upheld the regulations 
we agree with the reasoning of those courts that have found the regulations unlawful.the regulations do not allow the bop to consider the nature and circumstances of an inmate offense,his or her history and pertinent characteristics,or most importantly,any statement by the sentencing court concerning a placement recommendation and the purposes for the sentence.and yet,according to the text and history of,these factors must be taken into account.the regulations are invalid because the bop may not categorically remove its ability to consider the explicit factors set forth by congress in b for making placement and transfer determinations 
the government argues that the bop appropriately exercised its sweeping authority in categorically declining to consider inmates for ccc placement prior to the last percent or six months of a sentence.it submits that the bop interpretation is entitled to deference under chevron natural res.def.council,d,and that the regulations comport with and clarify congressional intent.it relies on lopez davis,d,for support.the government also maintains that the b factors are nonexhaustive and not mandatory,and that the bop will continue to consider them in placement decisions.it contends that while the bop was not required to consider the factors in promulgating its rules,it did in fact consider the statutory factors in addition to others.we discuss these construction arguments first and then turn to the chevron analysis.
a.the plain meaning and legislative history of b 
section b provides that the bop must consider at least five factors in making placement decisions 
the resources of the facility contemplated 
the nature and circumstances of the offense 
the history and characteristics of the prisoner 
any statement by the court that imposed the sentence 
a concerning the purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was determined to be warranted or 
b recommending a type of penal or correctional facility as appropriate and 
any pertinent policy statement issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to section a of title.
b.yet,under the regulations,these factors can not be fully considered because the amount of time an inmate may spend in a ccc is categorically limited to the lesser of six months or ten percent of a sentence without regard to individualized circumstances.
the government argues that the use of the word may at the beginning of b,rather than shall,is determinative in proving that consideration of the factors is essentially optional.we believe that this narrow reading ignores the context of the statute.see deal united states,d noting the fundamental principle of statutory construction that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.a commonsense reading of the when combined with the legislative clear that the bop is required to consider each factor.may refers to the ability of the bop to make ultimate placement designations,not to the factors.the word may is a full fifty words away from the considerations,and its effect is separated from the factors with a comma.
additionally,the use of the word and before the final factor in the list indicates that congress intended for the bop to weigh all of the factors listed.see lesnick menifee,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in sum,we believe the statute indicates that the bop may place a prisoner where it wishes,so long as it considers the factors enumerated in.
our reading is bolstered by the statute legislative history,which states that the bop is specifically required to consider the b any statement by the court that imposed the it can properly place or transfer an inmate.a report of the senate judiciary committee,accompanying the enactment of,is informative.the report states 
in determining the availability or suitability of the facility selected,the bureau is specifically required to consider such factors as the resources of the facility considered,the nature and circumstances of the offense,the history and characteristics of the prisoner,the statements made by the sentencing court concerning the purposes for imprisonment in a particular case,any recommendations as to type of facility made by the court,and any pertinent policy statements issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to proposed a.after considering these factors,the bureau of prisons may designate the place of imprisonment in an appropriate type of facility,or may transfer the offender to another appropriate facility.
reprinted in,emphasis added.
this language is bop must consider all of the listed factors.the report continues 
the committee,by listing factors for the bureau to consider in determining the appropriateness or suitability of any available facility,does not intend to restrict or limit the bureau in the exercise of its existing discretion so long as the facility meets the minimum standards of health and habitability of the bureau,but intends simply to set forth the appropriate factors that the bureau should consider in making the designations.
id.at emphasis added.the senate report supports the proposition that congress did not intend to limit the bop overall placement discretion to designate the place of a prisoner imprisonment.however,it is also clear that,before exercising that discretion,the bop should consider each of the factors.because the regulations do not allow the bop to consider the factors enumerated in,they are invalid.
lopez davis 
both the government and the district court rely on lopez,at,for the proposition that the bop may categorically exercise its discretion in placement matters,and that it properly utilized that discretion here.in lopez,the supreme court considered and upheld the validity of a bop rule excluding certain inmates from a discretionary program.id.at.the governing statute in that case,e b,provided that the bop may reduce the prison term of an inmate convicted of a nonviolent offense if the prisoner successfully completes a substance abuse program.id.at.the bop implemented a regulation categorically denying early release to prisoners convicted of a felony involving the carrying,possession,or use of a firearm.id.quoting a vi b.in upholding the regulation,the court held that the bop permissibly defined nonviolent offense to exclude inmates who possessed firearms.id.at.the statute gave the bop the ability to offer to some inmates therefore,the court reasoned that it was permissible for the bop to use that discretion to delineate an additional category of inmates who were ineligible for that release.id.at.
in lopez,the statute clearly demonstrated that congress was worried about allowing possibly violent inmates to become eligible for.the bop rules reflected that concern and seemed to provide a way to advance it.the bop can make no such claim here because the regulations do not further the factors in the bop enabling reject them.see pimentel,d at lesnick,wl,at,dist.lexis,at baker willingham,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
in lopez,for example,the bop argued that because congress did not address how the bureau should exercise its discretion,it could categorically exclude certain inmates from eligibility.the court explained that individualized consideration for each particular inmate was not necessary,agreeing with the eighth circuit that t he statute grants no entitlement to any inmate or class of inmates and it does not instruct the bureau to make individual,rather than categorical,assessments of eligibility for inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses.at.citation omitted.the court emphasized that congress left the question unaddressed and has not identified any further circumstance in which the bureau either must grant the reduction or is forbidden to do so.id.at.
here,in contrast,congress specifically delineated factors to be taken into account by the bop in determining where an inmate is placed.worthy of special mention is the recommendation of the sentencing judge.united states district judges take their sentencing responsibilities very seriously and are familiar with the various bop institutions and programs.their recommendations as to the execution of sentences are carefully thought out and are important to them.the significance of this aspect of the sentencing process is highlighted by the acknowledgment of the regional counsel of the bop at oral argument that the bop follows judicial recommendations in approximately percent of all cases.here,however,the requirement that the bop consider a sentencing judge recommendation can not be satisfied without an individualized,inquiry that is impossible under the regulations.
the district court and the government cite the following passage from lopez in support of the argument that the circumstances here were contemplated by the court even if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations,which this scheme does not,the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority.lopez,at.quoting am.hosp.ass nlrb,d.but sentencing recommendations and other individual factors,like those at play in woodall case,are not generally applicable.moreover,congress did appear to express an intent to withhold from the bop the authority to make ccc placements without the guidance of the statutory factors.
in sum,individual determinations are required by b.lopez therefore does not control.while the bop may exercise considerable discretion,it must do so using the factors the congress has specifically enumerated.
c.the bop arguments that the b factors are not mandatory and that it may consider additional factors in placement decisions 
the government argues that the bop may categorically remove consideration of the b factors because these factors are not mandatory.as support,both the government and the commentary accompanying the bop proposed rules stress that the bop can always consider additional factors in making ccc determinations.see.at section b provides a nonexclusive list of factors that the bureau is to consider.we find this argument unpersuasive.the question whether the bop may consider additional factors is separate and unrelated to the question whether it can ignore altogether the very factors delineated by congress in the governing statute itself.neither the bop nor the government has cited a single indication that congress felt the bop could categorically refuse to consider in full one of the factors explicitly enumerated in.
in the commentary accompanying its final regulations,and in response to criticism of the proposed rule,the bop stated that it would continue to evaluate the b factors when making individualized designations to appropriate bureau facilities.fed.reg.the government similarly states that the bop continues to consider the nonexhaustive list when making placement decisions.however,as stated above,it is impossible for each of these factors,particularly the sentencing judge recommendations,to be taken into account in ccc placements under the new regulations.while the sentencing court here recommended six months of halfway house placement,under the regulations,that recommendation can not be considered in full.in fact,no recommendation of a ccc placement exceeding six months or ten percent of a sentence can be considered.it is not enough for the bop to consider the statutory factors only when placing prisoners in must be considered in every placement.
consideration of the statutory factors in promulgating the rules 
the bop has stated,and the district court agreed,that it considered the statutory factors in promulgating the rules.at the bureau has carefully considered all of the factors,as well as the additional considerations that it identified as pertinent.however,while the commentary accompanying the proposed and final rules specifically discusses some of the example prison resources and sentencing commission policy no point does the bop take into account the requirement that it consider the particular circumstances of individual inmates.by definition,particular circumstances can not be considered in promulgating a blanket rule.notably,congress expressed an intent that the bop take into account the sentencing judge recommendation.by its very nature,this requires an individualized determination for each prisoner that the new regulations categorically do not allow.it is simply not possible to consider individualized circumstances in the drafting room before a prisoner even enters the criminal justice system.
chevron analysis 
our review of an agency interpretation of its governing statute is normally subject to chevron deference.this standard of review requires a inquiry 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
chevron,at.
for the reasons stated above,it appears to us that the bop regulations do not meet the first prong of the chevron test.this first prong of chevron asks whether the intent of congress is clear as to the question at issue.here,considering the language of b,and finding support in the statute legislative history,we believe that it is.to be sure,the bop has been granted broad discretion in placement matters.however,e ven for an agency able to claim all the authority possible under chevron,deference to its statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.dynamics land cline,d.here,we are faced with a statute providing that the bop must consider several factors in ccc placement,and a regulation providing that the agency may not consider those factors in full.the conflict between the regulations and the statute seems unavoidable.
however,even assuming the statute is ambiguous,we do not find the regulations to be based on a permissible construction of the statute.see chevron,at.therefore,they can not pass the second prong of chevron.under this second step,we must determine whether the regulation s harmonize with the plain language of the statute,its origin,and purpose.zheng gonzales,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons stated above,taking into consideration the language and purpose of the statute,as well as its legislative history,we find harmony lacking we do not believe that the regulations are a permissible construction because they fail to take into account congress indications that certain individualized a sentencing court be considered in the bop placement and transfer scheme.therefore,the regulations are not reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design.id.at quoting nationsbank of north carolina,variable annuity life ins,d.we thus conclude that even if the bop regulations pass the first prong of the chevron analysis,they fail to meet the second.
of course,chevron and its progeny recognize the wide deference granted to agencies such as the bop in administering their governing statutes,and we are well aware of the expertise of the bureau of prisons in matters concerning prison administration and inmate placement.however,we are also mindful that the bureau can not depart from the clearly expressed intent of congress,including its desire that several factors,one of which is the recommendation of a sentencing judge,be considered in placement designations.to accept the bop argument would be to ignore that intent as embodied in the statute plain language and legislative history.
in sum,while the bop does have the discretion to refuse to place woodall in a ccc for the last six months of his sentence,the exercise of that discretion must be based,at least in part,on the b factors 
f.the dissent temporal limitation arguments 
the dissent argues that the b factors need not be considered by the bop until an inmate transfer is actually considered.we disagree.first,this argument ignores the fact that in promulgating the regulations,the bop did actually consider the qu
