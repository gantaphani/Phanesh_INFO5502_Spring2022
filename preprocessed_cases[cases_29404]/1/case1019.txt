opinion of the court 
george totimeh,a native of liberia,seeks relief from the order of an immigration judge ij that he be removed from the united states.in these consolidated petitions for review,he seeks review of decisions by the board of immigration appeals bia declining to remand or reopen his case and dismissing his appeal we decide whether the bia erred in holding that totimeh conviction under minnesota predatory offender registration statute was a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of the immigration and nationality act ina.we also decide whether the bia abused its discretion in not reopening his case to allow him to supplement the administrative record with evidence regarding when he first was admitted legally to the united states.we grant the petitions,reverse the bia holding regarding totimeh conviction under the predatory offender registration statute,and remand to the bia with instructions to allow totimeh to supplement the record to show that he was legally admitted to the united states in july and to enter an order that he is not removable under a a i of the ina.we thus vacate the order of removal.
facts and procedural history 
totimeh was inspected and admitted to the united states at new york city as a b visitor in july.soon thereafter,he moved to minnesota to attend a university,whereupon his status was changed to an f student.on may,he was granted an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident.
in january,totimeh pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree.in,minnesota enacted a predatory offender registration statute,minn stat,which requires persons to register if convicted of criminal sexual conduct.totimeh complied with the statute requirements for approximately three years,until he moved to a friend apartment without notifying the authorities of this change of address.in april,he pled guilty to failing to comply with the statute registration requirement.
on october,the department of homeland security dhs began removal proceedings against totimeh by filing a notice to appear.the notice stated that he was admitted to the united states on may.dhs alleged that totimeh was removable pursuant to two provisions of the ina based on his conviction,he was removable under a a i,a a i,for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after his date of admission and for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed and based on his conviction,coupled with his conviction,he was removable under a a ii,a a ii,for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.
when totimeh first appeared before the ij,he conceded the factual allegations in the notice to appear,including that he was admitted to the united states in may.he also conceded that his conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude,but denied that his conviction under minnesota predatory offender registration statute was an offense of moral turpitude.
in february,the ij issued an interlocutory ruling in connection with totimeh request for release from dhs custody on bond finding that he was removable under both provisions of the ina cited by the dhs.totimeh admissions indicated that he was removable under a a i for being convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within five years of his admission to the united states.the ij held as well that totimeh conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude and thus he also was removable under a a ii.the latter ruling relied on the bia decision in in re tobar lobo,bia,whereby it concluded that failure to register as a sex offender in violation of california sex offender registration act was a crime involving moral turpitude.
several months later,totimeh asserted for the first time that he was admitted to the united states in july,not may.establishing the july admission would have nullified the ground for removing him that a a i of the ina provided based on his conviction.however,he did not support his assertion with any evidence in the record.therefore,the ij ruled that totimeh had been admitted as a legal permanent resident in may,continued to find him removable under a a i and ii of the ina,and ordered him removed to liberia.
totimeh appealed to the bia.in affirming the ij,it similarly relied on tobar lobo to hold that totimeh was removable under a a ii.it also cited in re shanu,bia,for its holding that the term date of admission includes an adjustment of status and that an adjustment of status qualifies as a date of admission under a a i.thus,per the bia reasoning,even had totimeh offered sufficient proof of his july admission,he still would have been removable under that subsection of the ina because his change in status to a permanent legal resident in may made that a date of admission as well.
after filing his petition for review of the bia decision,totimeh filed a motion with the bia to reopen his case so that he might supplement the record with documentary evidence obtained through a request under the freedom of information act foia,this evidence established his july admission,showing that he was admitted on a b visa on july,and that his status was changed to an f student in december,conditioned on his pursuing a full course of study and completing his studies no later than june.the evidence further showed that,as of september,totimeh was not enrolled in a full course of study.
before it ruled on the motion to reopen,the bia decided matter of alyazji,bia,in which it amended its holding in shanu,explaining that date of admission,as used in a a i of the ina,refers to the single date of admission by virtue of which the alien was present in the united states when he or she committed the crime.id.at.the bia nonetheless found that the evidence regarding totimeh july admission was immaterial to his removability under a a i because his may adjustment of status was the single date of admission relevant to his conviction.thus,though acknowledging alyazji superseded shanu,the bia denied the motion to reopen.
totimeh and the government agree that we must decide whether violating minnesota predatory offender registration statute is a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of a a ii of the ina.if it is not,we then must decide whether,pursuant to the bia decision in alyazji,the period after the date of admission for purposes of a a i of the ina should be calculated based on totimeh may adjustment of status to a lawful permanent resident or his earlier admission date 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the ij has jurisdiction over totimeh removal proceedings under.the bia had jurisdiction to review the ij decision under.it had jurisdiction over the motion to reopen under c.we have jurisdiction under to review the bia final order of removal and denial of the motion to reopen.

iii.crime involving moral turpitude 
whether a conviction under a state law is a crime of moral turpitude calls for a categorical approach,focusing on the underlying criminal statute rather than the alien specific act.jean louis att y,cir quoting knapik,at.we consider what the convicting court must necessarily have found to support the conviction and not other conduct in which the defendant may have engaged in connection wi
