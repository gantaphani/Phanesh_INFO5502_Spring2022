this social security case brings the issue of whether a federal court may condition the amount of its equal access to justice act award of attorney fees on a future grant of attorney fees by the commissioner of social security.the government concedes that congress does not permit the offset.we are persuaded that this concession is compelled by the statutory scheme.
evelyn rice,a former postal clerk,has not worked since february,due to a car accident,and continues to have a variety of musculoskeletal disorders,including fibromyalgia.she filed an application for disability insurance benefits on october,but the commissioner of social security denied it,asserting there were jobs in the national economy that rice could perform.
rice then hired attorney ronald honig under a contingency fee arrangement,whereby rice would pay honig up to of any benefits.specifically,rice would pay over approved social security act fees for work performed before the agency under a and for work performed before a court under b and honig would retain any attorney fee awarded under the equal access to justice act eaja to the extent it was not offset by a b fee.
with honig in her corner,rice sought judicial review in the northern district of texas.after answering rice complaint,the commissioner voluntarily moved to remand,acknowledging error in the administrative process the commissioner had not proven that rice had transferable skills needed to engage in the type of work available to her.pursuant to sentence four of g the district court granted the motion to remand for further proceedings.
under a sentence four remand,the court immediately enters judgment and terminates the civil action as happened with rice,a sentence four remand does not necessarily mean that the claimant will get benefits the district court may remand for a legal error and leave for further agency findings whether benefits are due.however,a party who wins a remand order is a prevailing party,opening the door to an eaja award if the government position was not substantially justified 
the district court granted an unopposed motion for an eaja award of attorney fees in the amount of,plus costs of.the court further ordered that,in the event that rice counsel receives fee awards under for work performed on rice claim,regardless of whether such awards are awarded at the administrative or judicial level,rice counsel shall promptly pay to rice an amount equal to the lesser of the two awards.rice appealed the order insofar as it required her attorney to remit a portion of the eaja award if she won attorney fees at the administrative level under a.
attorneys representing social security claimants can often win fees in two ways.the first type of fee in contingency agreement cases comes out of the claimant benefits congress allows both the commissioner and the courts to award these fees,but treats the two review stages discretely a governs fees for representation in administrative proceedings b controls fees for representation in court.
for contingency fees at the administrative level,the commissioner shall approve the agreement as long as the attorney files it with the commissioner in advance and the fee does not exceed the lesser of of the total benefits or and for contingency fees on judicial review 
whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant,the court may allow a reasonable fee for representation,not in excess of percent of the benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment,and the commissioner of social security may certify the amount to the attorney out of,and not in addition to,the benefits 
this regime recognizes that the commissioner and the courts operate in different spheres.the district court may consider only services in setting allowable fees for representation before it.on the other hand,congress has made it equally clear that the authority for setting fees for representation in agency proceedings rests exclusively with the commissioner.despite this despite sharp disagreement from other courts of circuit interpretation of precludes the aggregate allowance of attorney fees greater than percent of the past due benefits received by the claimant.that is,fees under a plus fees under b can not exceed.that structure is not at issue here.
the second type of attorney fees comes through the eaja,which allows a party prevailing against the united states in court,including a successful social security benefits claimant,to be awarded fees payable by the united states if the government position in the litigation was not substantially justified.in contrast to fees under b,eaja fees are determined not by a percent of the amount recovered,but by the time expended and the attorney hourly rate,capped in the mine run of cases at per hour.because in a sentence four remand the court terminates the civil action,the prevailing party can not receive enhanced eaja payments for work done on the administrative level 
years ago,social security attorneys looking to collect both a contingency fee and an eaja award in the same case found themselves in a pickle,because when a court grants contingency fees under b for a successful judicial challenge,it is a crime for an attorney to charge,demand,receive,or collect for services rendered in connection with proceedings before a court any amount in excess of that allowed by the court.this provision would forbid attorneys from seeking to collect fees awarded under the eaja.recognizing the problem,congress endeavored to harmonize the two types of fees by creating a savings clause 
through an uncodified amendment to the eaja,f ee awards may now be made under both prescriptions,but the claimant attorney must refun d to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.thus,an eaja award offsets an award under section b,so that the amount of the total benefits the claimant actually receives will be increased by the eaja award up to the point the claimant receives percent of the benefits.
the amendment did not provide a savings provision for administrative level awards under a,which also makes it a crime for any person to knowingly charge or collect directly or indirectly any fee in excess of the maximum fee.the maximum fee in contingency cases at the administrative level is the lesser of of benefits or the question is whether an attorney may earn both a a award of attorney fees at the administrative level and an eaja award of attorney fees at the judicial level.
the district court in rice case said no,granting an eaja award,but conditioned it on honig returning to rice an amount equal to the lesser of the eaja award or any subsequent a award made by the commissioner.both rice and the commissioner urge that the court had no authority to order an offset of this kind.we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that it did 
both the social security and equal access to justice statutes treat administrative and judicial review as separate,at first blush,that a administrative fees do not overlap with eaja judicial fees.regarding the social security act,congress designed the administrative and judicial review stages discretely,and the authority for setting a fees for representation in agency proceedings rests exclusively with the commissioner,while t he district court may consider only services in setting allowable b fees for representation before it.
on sentence four remands,as here,the eaja states the district court shall grant eaja attorney fees if the government position before the court had not been substantially justified,and the court derives the fee from work performed only at the judicial level.because these eaja fees can overlap with b because b makes it a crime for an attorney to double collect at the judicial passed the savings clause,which requires the attorney to refund to the client the lesser amount.because judicial and administrative reviews are separate,the parties urge that an eaja award for judicial work can not mix with a fees for administrative work,obviating the need for a savings clause with respect to a 
we agree,noting that the texts of the two criminal provisions adhere strictly to forum lines.section a makes it a crime only to collect more for work done at the administrative level than the maximum fee allowed by the commissioner and b forbids only collecting more for work done at the judicial level than that approved by the court because an attorney can win both a and b fees in the same case congress can have meant nothing else.otherwise,an attorney could collect either a a or a b fee,but not both.as long as the eaja award is not given for work done at the administrative level,no savings clause is needed for a.
while it is clear that the statutes do not require an offset,there remains the question of whether the district court may take into consideration future a attorney fees when setting an eaja award.we hold that it may not,hewing closely to the eaja text.the statute mandates payment of reasonable attorney fees,the amount of which shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished.this statutory standard method of calculation does not allow for consideration of future fees granted at the administrative level,which is independent of the kind and quality of work provided before the federal courts 
no doubt the offset implicated a compelling policy choice,one that persuaded the district court and coincides with the eaja purpose that the amount of the total benefits the claimant actually receives will be increased.if the eaja is supposed to help the claimant pocket a greater portion of her benefits,there is little reason to distinguish between attorney fees taken out of benefits at the administrative or judicial level.on the other hand,the commissioner and,of course,social security lawyers take a contrary policy stance,maintaining that fewer attorneys will represent social security plaintiffs if courts offset eaja fees with a fees.
in the end,we accept,as we must,the choice made by has not left the district courts with sufficient discretion to offset an eaja award of attorney fees with a future a award of attorney fees by the commissioner of social security.
