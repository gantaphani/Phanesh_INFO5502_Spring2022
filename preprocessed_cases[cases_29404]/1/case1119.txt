opinion of the court 
introduction 
these two matters come on before this court on separate petitions for review of decisions and orders of the board of immigration appeals bia brought by jian zhau zheng and zhi yong chen.both petitioners are citizens of the people republic of china from fujian province who currently reside in the united states,and each is married with more than one child born in this country.in both cases the bia rejected the petitioner appeal from an immigration judge denial of his application for asylum,following which each petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion with the bia to reopen his removal proceedings these petitions for review of the denial of the motions for reopening followed.significantly,each petitioner based his motion on allegations that there had been changed circumstances in china from those extant at the time of the denial of his application for asylum.
inasmuch as the two cases concern similar questions of law and of fact and reach this court following almost parallel procedural paths,we will address both petitioners petitions in this consolidated opinion.for the reasons that we will discuss,we will vacate the bia denial of the petitioners respective motions to reopen and remand the matters to the bia for further proceedings.in doing so,however,we make clear that we do not suggest that we disagree with the results the bia reached on the records before it as we predicate our holding solely on procedural deficiencies that we find existed in the bia proceedings.
ii.background 
zheng arrived in the united states on august.he married in new york on january,and he and his wife have three children,the first born on january,the second born on january,and the third born on june.on august,zheng,who was represented by an attorney other than his attorney on this appeal,sought asylum.an immigration judge conducted a hearing on his application on march,but,based on zheng failure to appear at the hearing,denied his request for asylum and ordered his exclusion in absentia.zheng asserts that he did not appear because his attorney did not inform him of the hearing date moreover,he claims that he did not learn of the denial of his request for asylum until september,when an application for renewal of his employment authorization was denied.zheng appealed from the denial of asylum,but on december,the bia denied the appeal as untimely.
on june,zheng filed a motion with the bia to reopen his case on the basis of his changed personal circumstances,namely,the birth of his three children in the united states.he claimed that u nder the current recognized climate of coercive population control in china if he returned to china he would be persecuted for having more than one child.app.at.he did not claim,however,that there had been a material change in circumstances in china with respect to population control between the time that he filed his asylum application and the time of his motion to reopen.on october,the bia denied his motion to reopen and inasmuch as zheng did not file a petition for review of that denial,no court of appeals has reviewed that denial and we,of course,do not review it now.
on august,zheng filed a second motion to reopen his case,contending that he should be granted asylum because of changed circumstances in china by reason of its enhanced enforcement of its population control policies as compared to those at the time that the immigration judge and bia denied his asylum application.moreover,he argued that his counsel had been ineffective during his original asylum proceedings that an immigration judge had dismissed because of his failure to appear for his hearing.zheng submitted several documents in support of his motion as evidence of those changed circumstances and filed a personal affidavit which stated 
in my recent phone contacts with my family and friends in china,i was told that in the past year,the government had increased the use of labor camp,forced abortions and sterilizations.i was also told that a couple is only allowed to have one child.those who resist and violate the new law would not only be forced to undergo abortion operations or sterilization procedures,but also face criminal prosecution pursuant to the population and family planning law.what i heard is consistent with the county sic report on china by the state department.
id.at.zheng further stated in his affidavit 
such persecutions have done irreparable damage to many families of young couples.my neighbor zhou zheng is an example.he and his wife lin,hui ha d their first daughter several years ago,and secretly gave birth to their second daughter.unfortunately,the government family planning officials found out and forced zhou zheng to undergo sterilization immediately on.my neighbor zheng,qun is another victim.after his wife gave birth to a boy and a girl,on feb,zheng,qun was forcibly sterilized by the family planning officials.
id.at.zheng also stated 
i requested my parents to inquire with the villager committee in my hometown.my parents told me that the village officials were already aware that i had two children in the united states.an official letter issued by the villager committee in response to my inquiry stated that i was still considered a citizen of china and had to undergo necessary family planning procedures with in one week once i return to china 
id.at.zheng also submitted what purports to be a letter from changle city shouzhan town people government family planning office changle city letter dated june,which states a lthough you are currently residing in the united states,you are still a citizen of the people republic of china who had three children,and therefore you will definitely be targeted to sic sterilization.id.at.
in addition to his affidavit and the changle city letter,zheng submitted several documents describing what he claims are changed circumstances in china.these documents include two reports by the state department entitled reports on human rights practices country report for and issued in and respectively a state department document entitled consular information consular information sheet dated may,a report entitled commission on report commission report for testimony by john aird to congress concerning china family planning law from september,testimony by harry wu to congress on december,a document entitled population and family planning regulation of fujian province fujian regulation dated july,and two newspaper articles from.inasmuch as these documents did not exist when he filed his original petition to reopen,he could not present any of them with that motion.
on june,the bia denied zheng second motion to reopen his case,and on july,zheng filed the petition now before us to review the bia june,decision and order.
chen arrived in the united states on january,and was married in pennsylvania on may.chen and his wife have two children,the first born on june,and the second born on november.chen sought asylum but on june,an immigration judge denied his application for asylum and ordered his removal.chen appealed,but on july,the bia affirmed the denial.
on march,chen filed a motion to reopen his case based on changed circumstances in china.chen submitted several documents in support of his motion to reopen,including a personal affidavit in which he stated 
t he birth of our children has made my return home more risky and dangerous.in my recent phone contacts with my famil y and friends in china,i was told that in the past year,the government has increased the use of forced abortions and sterilization.those who resist and violate the new law would not only be forced to undergo abortion operations or sterilization procedures,but also face criminal prosecution pursuant to the population and family planning law pfpl.
id.at.he also stated in his affidavit 
my mother related to me several such tragic incidents that happened in my hometown.gang zheng and his wife hua qin have two daughters.they wanted a son very much.unfortunately,on march,the wife hua qin was forced into a sterilization to prevent them from having more children in the future.the same tragedy also happened to jianping lin and his wife.they also have two daughters and wanted a son.however,lin wife was forcibly sterilized in april.
id.at.the affidavit continued 
my parents told me that the village officials were already aware that i had two children in the united states.they also told me that since i do not have legal status in the united states,i was still considered a citizen of china,not an overseas chinese therefore once i return to china,i ha ve to undergo necessary family planning procedures,such as abortions and sterilizations,unless i become an citizen,permanent resident or obtain master or doctorate degrees in the united states.
in addition to his affidavit,chen submitted a letter from his mother,in which she stated 
recently the chinese government has strengthened the enforcement of the population and family planning law pfpl.during the past year,there were a lot of enforced abortions and sterilizations in our hometown.the situation is much worse than before.for example,a resident in our village named gamg zheng has two daughters.he wanted to have a son.however,his wife,hua qin,was forced to undergo an involuntary sterilization on march.secondly,there is a couple in our village,and jianping chen.they have two daughters and also wanted a son.unfortunately,chen was sterilized in april.based on the above incidents,if my son were sent back to mainland china,he would also be involuntarily sterilized and would not have more children in the future because he has already had two sons.
in addition to the affidavit and letter,chen submitted other documents to demonstrate changed circumstances in china since the time of his original application for asylum.several documents are the same as ones that zheng submitted in support of his motion,including the state department and country reports the consular information sheet dated may,the congressional executive commission report for aird september,testimony to congress wu december,testimony to congress and the same two newspaper articles from.but chen also included documents not included with zheng motion a document by the administrative office of the national population and family planning committee,dated march,a document that chen describes as the changle city family planning q a handbook and the congressional executive commission report for.
on june,the bia denied chen motion to reopen his case and on july,chen filed the petition now before us to review the bia decision and order.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
zheng and chen correctly assert that the bia had jurisdiction under c.we have jurisdiction over the present petitions for review pursuant to we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.guo ashcroft,cir.we will not disturb the bia decisions unless they are found to be arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
iv.discussion 
the general criteria governing motions to reopen set forth in c provide that 
a motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.a motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing 
although a motion to reopen must be filed no later than days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened,c,the limitation does not apply if the movant seeks reopening based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered,if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.c ii.
the supreme court has set forth three bases on which the bia can deny a motion to reopen 
first,it may hold that the movant has failed to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought second,it may hold that the movant has failed to introduce previously unavailable,material evidence that justifies reopening,as required by regulation.third,in cases in which the ultimate grant of relief being sought is discretionary asylum,suspension of deportation,and adjustment of status,but not withholding of deportation,the board can leap ahead over the two threshold concerns prima facie case and new explanation and simply determine that even if they were met,the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.
sevoian ashcroft,cir quoting ins abudu,d internal citations omitted.but regardless of which of these multiple bases for denying a motion to reopen that the bia is examining,when considering a motion to reopen the bia must actually consider the evidence and argument that a party presents.abdulai ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the bia rejects the motion to reopen,on an ensuing petition for review a court will uphold that determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.
to qualify for asylum or withholding of removal,an applicant must establish that he has a fear that he will be persecuted if removed to his home country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a,b,b.a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to abort a pregnancy or undergo involuntary sterilization or is subject to persecution for failure,refusal,or resistance to undergo such a procedure shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.a b.
an applicant bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum based on specific facts and credible testimony.a abdille ashcroft,cir.to demonstrate that he has a fear of persecution,an applicant must satisfy three requirements he or she has a fear of persecution in his or her native country there is a reasonable likelihood that he or she will be persecuted upon return to that country and the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to that country as a result of his or her fear.b i.the eligibility threshold for obtaining withholding of removal is higher than that for obtaining asylum as the attorney general must determine that repatriation would threaten the alien life or freedom on account of one of the protected grounds to withhold removal.b.an applicant for withholding of removal therefore must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution if he is removed.senathirajah ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
changed circumstances 
zheng filed his original motion to reopen on june,but the bia denied that motion as untimely on october,and,as we indicated above,we do not review that denial.zheng filed his second motion to reopen,the denial of which has led to these proceedings,on august.although zheng argued in his second motion to reopen that there had been changed circumstances in china from the time that he sought asylum that warranted exception from the limitation pursuant to c ii,the bia concluded that the pending motion does not fall within that time limit exception.app.at.in these proceedings zheng primarily argues that the bia abused its discretion in reaching that conclusion,and we therefore begin our analysis of his case by reviewing that aspect of its decision.
in that decision,the bia stated that w e again find,after considering the arguments and evidence submitted by the applicant,that the birth of the appellant three children in the united states and his marriage do not constitute a change in circumstances arising in the country of nationality which would create an exception to the time and numerical limitations for filing a motion to reopen.id.at.in its decision the bia discussed matter of,i n bia,review denied,shao mukasey,cir.in particular,the bia focused on review of three documents submitted as evidence in that case affidavits by aird the state department country report for and a report by the state department entitled china profile of asylum claims and country conditions,dated may.id.the bia quoted discussion of those reports,and observed that in the bia concluded,based on the profile,that children born overseas are not counted for birth planning purposes when the parents return to china.id.the bia further quoted in stating that if a returnee who has had a second child while outside of china is penalized at all upon return,the sanctions would be fines or other economic penalties.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in our analysis we initially note that although the birth of zheng three children after the denial of his asylum application obviously is a significant factor in this case as the possibility that he might suffer persecution arises from it,the bia characterization of zheng motion to reopen as being based on those births rather than changed circumstances in china is inaccurate.indeed,in zheng brief to the bia in support of the motion,he argued that t hese proceedings should be reopened as the evidence in support of the motion was unavailable at the time of the original hearing,and the evidence documents conditions in china which have arisen since that date.id.at.therefore we will discuss whether the bia abused its discretion in concluding that zheng failed to meet his burden to demonstrate changed circumstances in china.
in li attorney general,cir,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reviewed the bia denial of a motion to reopen an asylum case.the petitioner had submitted several of the documents that zheng and chen have submitted in these cases.in particular,the petitioner in li offered as evidence the state department country reports for and,the commission report,and aird testimony to congress in.id.at.the petitioner in li also submitted her affidavit and that of her mother,the state department country report for,the consular information sheet for,and two unidentified newspaper articles from.id.
in reviewing the bia denial of the motion to reopen the court in li discussed various statements contained in the affidavits describing examples of forcible sterilization from the petitioner hometown.see id.at.the court observed that the petitioner other evidence corroborated her anecdotal evidence of a change in policy in her province and substantiated her fear that local officials in fujian have the incentives and discretion to sterilize women with more than one child.id.in particular,the court referred to statements contained in the state department country report.the court concluded that li evidence of a recent campaign of forced sterilization in her home village,evidence consistent with the conclusion of recent government reports,clearly satisfied the criteria for a motion to reopen her removal proceedings.id.contrary to the bia findings in li as well as in zheng case,the court stated that the c onsular i nformation s heet established that,for some purposes at least,the chinese government considers children of chinese nationals equivalent to children born in china.id.at.
we recognize that,as the court of appeals for the second circuit explained in wang bia,cir,there is an inherent tension in the criteria setting forth the standards for the review of bia decisions that lack detailed discussion 
on the one hand,the bia abuses its discretion if it fails completely to address evidence of changed country circumstances offered by a petitioner the bia should demonstrate that it has considered such evidence,even if only to dismiss it.in so doing,the bia should provide us with more than cursory,summary or conclusory statements,so that we are able to discern its reasons for declining to afford relief to a petitioner.on the other hand,we do not hold that where the bia has given reasoned consideration to the petition,and made adequate findings,it must expressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner while the bia must consider such evidence,it may do so in summary fashion without a reviewing court presuming that it has abused its discretion.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.notwithstanding this tension immigration judges and the bia have a duty to explicitly consider any country conditions evidence submitted by an applicant that materially bears on his claim,and a similar,if not greater,duty arises in the context of motions to reopen based on changed country conditions.guo gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also yang gonzales,cir if an agency makes a finding of fact without mentioning or analyzing significant evidence,its decision should be reconsidered.internal quotation marks omitted.
in zheng case the bia did little more than quote passages from its earlier decision in without alone various statements contained in the record before it that zheng submitted in support of his motion to reopen.indeed,the bia did not mention zheng affidavit,the changle city letter,the consular information sheet from,the commission report for,the fujian regulation from,wu testimony to congress from,or the two newspaper articles.moreover,these documents were not discussed in,the case on which the bia almost exclusively relied.see,i n at.given the bia failure to discuss most of the evidentiary record in zheng case,as well as the conclusions that the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reached in li concerning at least some of the documents in this case,we will vacate the bia denial of zheng second motion to reopen his case and remand the matter to the bia for further proceedings 
equitable tolling 
zheng contends that the time limitations on filing a second motion to reopen should be equitably tolled in his case because his attorney did not inform him of the hearing date on his asylum application and it was that failure that led to the dismissal of the application on march.furthermore,the appeal that the same attorney filed from the denial of the application to the bia was untimely,a shortcoming that led the bia to deny the appeal on december.it might be thought that inasmuch as we are remanding this case to the bia without regard for tolling of the limitations period that zheng equitable tolling contention is moot.we are satisfied,however,that the tolling question is not moot because if zheng prevails on the tolling point he ultimately might obtain a reopening and be granted asylum without showing changed circumstances in china in accordance with c,ii.therefore we consider the equitable tolling argument on the merits.
the bia rejected the equitable tolling contention because it held that zheng lack of diligence in pursuing his asylum claim demonstrated that tolling was not justified.see mahmood gonzales,cir.we agree with the bia.in this regard we point out that zheng acknowledges that he found out in september that his attorney had not advised him of the hearing date on his asylum application and also discovered at that time that his failure to appear at the hearing led the immigration judge to deny his application for asylum.then the bia denied his appeal from the dismissal of his asylum claim because it was untimely on december.yet zheng did not file his original motion to reopen until june,a delay that demonstrates that he was not diligent in pursuing his asylum claim.his lack of diligence can not be gainsaid because he had known for over four years when he first sought to reopen the proceedings that his asylum application had been denied by reason of his failure to appear for his hearing.
furthermore,when he filed his first motion to reopen he did not assert that his attorney at the time of the asylum application had been ineffective,even though he was being represented by an attorney who had not represented him when he filed his unsuccessful asylum application.rather,he based his motion solely on his claim that there ha d been a significant change in circumstances predicated on the birth of his three children after the immigration judge denied his asylum application on march.app.at.moreover,his attorney on his first motion to reopen,on
