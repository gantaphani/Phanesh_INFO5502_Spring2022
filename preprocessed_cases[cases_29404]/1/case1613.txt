the plaintiff,dawson farms,llc,a farm operator,brought suit in the district court against the farm service agency fsa,other agencies of the department of agriculture usda,and the corps of engineers,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.dawson farms alleges that the fsa erroneously determined that dawson farms must return in usda program benefits because of the company wetlands violations and that the agency erroneously intends to withhold future benefits from dawson farms for the same reason.the district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the threshold question in this case is whether e providing that a person shall exhaust administrative appeal procedures before bringing a court action against the secretary of agriculture,his department or his a jurisdictional prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction or merely an element of that action.we hold that section e is not a jurisdictional rule but the codification of a judicially developed requirement,for which there are recognized exceptions and excuses.in this case,the district court correctly determined that the farm operator failed to exhaust administrative appeal procedures,but it erred in concluding that this failure deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction.instead of dismissing forthwith on that basis,the district court was required to next address whether the operator had shown that,under the circumstances of this case,it was excepted or excused from the exhaustion requirement.nevertheless,we affirm the district court result in dismissing the action,because the farm operator has pointed to no basis in the record or reason in law that supports its exception from the requirement of exhaustion of administrative appeal procedures or that excuses its failure to exhaust all such procedures in this case.

the principal issue of law presented in this case is whether e requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite to federal court subject matter jurisdiction or merely codifies the judicially developed principle under which exhaustion of administrative remedies is favored,but may be excused by a federal court under a limited number of exceptions.two of the three circuits that have spoken on the issue have concluded that e is not a jurisdictional prerequisite.see ace prop.and cas.ins.fed.crop ins,cir mcbride cotton and cattle veneman,cir concluding that section e is but see bastek federal crop ins,cir concluding that section e is jurisdictional.taking their cue from the supreme court in weinberger salfi,d,ace prop.and mcbride point out that section e does not contain the sweeping and direct language barring federal court jurisdiction without administrative exhaustion,as did the social security act exhaustion provision in salfi,codified at h.rather,they point out,section e is akin to statutory exhaustion provisions found in statutes like the prison litigation reform act plra,codified at a.we agree with the eighth and ninth circuits that section e is not a jurisdictional prerequisite for the reasons stated below.
factual and procedural background 
dawson farms,llc dawson farms owned land with wooded wetlands in franklin parish,louisiana.at issue are the company two tracts of land,tract henderson place and tract macgruder place.
in,before proceeding to clear this tract,dawson,proprietor of dawson farms,requested that the nrcs survey this tract for wetlands.an nrcs conservationist inspected tract and informed dawson of the presence of wooded wetlands on the tract.dawson was advised during the visit that he would need to contact the corps of engineers for a clean water act permit before manipulating the wetlands areas.the conservationist also told dawson that any manipulation of the wetlands areas without a permit would impact his eligibility for usda benefits.later that month,nrcs notified dawson farms by certified letter of its determination that dawson farms had cleared acres of wooded wetlands,jeopardizing its eligibility for usda benefits.after dawson farms requested reconsideration,an nrcs field visit was conducted.in its reconsideration decision,the nrcs concluded that the conversion had minimal effects,and allowed dawson farms to retain its eligibility.the nrcs rulings identified all the wetland areas on tract.in this same decision,nrcs also advised dawson that any discharge of dredged or fill material in the wetlands areas would require a corps of engineers permit.
as part of a random fsa status review in,the nrcs reviewed the status of tract and found extensive manipulation of the tract wetlands beyond the previously cleared acres.nrcs notified dawson farms of this swampbuster violation in a preliminary technical determination ptd on august.see n.in this ptd,the nrcs advised dawson farms that the determination could be reviewed by a field visit or be submitted to mediation if dawson farms requested either option within days,before september.the ptd also stated that if dawson farms did not so request,the ptd would become final,and that the time for appeal from the ptd would elapse thirty days thereafter,on october.see.on may,the county committee advised dawson farms in a letter that the ptd became final on september.in the same letter,the committee also notified dawson farms that it was,therefore,ineligible for crop benefits from onwards and had thirty calendar days to appeal its decision.the committee listed three appeals options application for reconsideration by the county committee an appeal to the state committee an appeal to the nad.more than thirty days later,on july,dawson farms sought reconsideration by the county committee contending no wetlands were converted to farmland and dawson farms had requested a field visit but was never granted one.in its reconsideration decision,on august,the county committee maintained its position that dawson farms was ineligible for usda benefits and concluded that t he only thing that would be appealable would be the amount of benefits to be returned and not the final determination that wetlands were converted for agricultural production.on august,dawson farms responded by asking the county committee,again,for a reconsideration.
while the foregoing was unfolding,on march,the corps of engineers,pursuant to its concurrent authority under the clean water act,issued a cease and desist order to dawson farms barring any further manipulation of wetlands on tract.the corps of engineers determined that the manipulation of wetlands identified by the nrcs in its status review was a flagrant violation of the clean water act,and recommended the matter to the epa as a case for possible legal action and monetary penalties.see g b see also memorandum between the department of the army and the environmental protection agency,federal enforcement of the section program of the clean water act,at,available at.gov owow wetlands regs enfmoa.html.
in a september,letter,dawson farms attempted to delay the enforcement of the corps of engineers cease and desist order by notifying the corps of engineers that it recently filed an permit application with the corps of engineers.the epa filed an administrative complaint for monetary penalties against dawson farms on november,a regional judicial officer an administrative law judge within the epa,was assigned the case.see,
after dawson filed its answer,but before any hearing had taken place,the epa filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice on february.the epa did not immediately explain the reason for its motion.see d.dawson farms did not oppose the motion.on february,the regional judicial officer issued an opinion that granted the epa unopposed motion to withdraw and dismiss without prejudice.in deciding whether a case should be dismissed without prejudice,the officer considered several factors outlined in united states outboard marine,cir and other circuit cases.he primarily weighed the epa failure to provide a justification for the withdrawal against the lack of prejudice to dawson farms,since the withdrawal occurred only three months after the complaint was filed and dawson farms did not incur significant time or cost in preparing for trial.since the officer found the lack of prejudice outweighed the epa failure to justify the withdrawal,the officer dismissed the complaint without prejudice and notified both sides with a written opinion justifying the case dismissal without prejudice.dawson farms did not appeal the officer decision to dismiss the case without prejudice.
meanwhile,the corps of engineers insisted dawson farms continue with the permit process.dawson farms contended in a letter to the corps of engineers that the epa withdrawal released it from all charges of wetlands violations and obviated any need to continue with the permit process.after the corps of engineers consulted with the epa about dawson farms contention,the epa sent dawson farms a letter on august,providing the reason for its motion for withdrawal.the epa explained that it voluntarily filed its motion for withdrawal,because it wanted to let dawson farms continue the permit process with the corps of engineers.it notified dawson farms that the withdrawal only released dawson farms from possible monetary penalties for its clean water act violations that the epa had authority to impose for egregious violations of the clean water act.since the epa complaint only related to possible monetary penalties under the authority of the epa,the epa notified dawson farms that the epa withdrawal did not affect other agency actions pertaining to the underlying wetlands violations.see g providing the epa authority to impose administrative penalties for clean water act violations based on information from the secretary of the army,who is the administrator of the corps of engineers.dawson farms informed the epa that it continued to dispute the determination that wetlands were converted on this tract.
dawson farms purchased tract in with the intention of clearing the land for farming.prior to clearing the land,dawson farms asked nrcs to inspect the areas it believed might constitute protected wetlands.before the nrcs could inspect the lands,dawson farms proceeded to clear the land relying on an nrcs soil survey,a published map showing the different soils in the area.nrcs eventually inspected the cleared areas and found hydric soils,a wetlands indicator,in the cleared areas on october.nrcs determined that dawson farms cleared some acres of wetlands on tract in violation of the fsa,et.after receiving notice of the violation,dawson farms initially appealed to the county committee in may,but then submitted an application for a good faith determination by the county committee on june.see a allowing individual to apply for a good faith determination,which maintains individual eligibility for usda benefits for up to one year while taking corrective actions.in its application,dawson farms noted that it had cleared lands relying on the nrcs soil survey and carefully tried to avoid potential wetland areas.dawson farms also added that dawson farms do es not plan to dispute the technical determination made by the nrcs team.dawson farms continued,dawson farms is anxious to work with the nrcs to develop a mitigation agreement to restore wetland values according to nrcs requirements.on july,the county committee ruled in dawson farms favor and found that dawson farms acted in good faith without intent to violate.the county committee also informed dawson farms in the ruling letter that a wetland mitigation plan must be developed with nrcs and agreed upon before the exemption from ineligibility under the good faith provisions will apply.in a letter to the nrcs on september,dawson farms acknowledged that i n order to regain eligibility for usda benefits,we were given the choice of two options restore the wetland.establish a mitigation site dawson farms ha s chosen the second option.emphasis added.nrcs responded to dawson farms letter on january,acknowledging that dawson farms had chosen the second option.the letter also listed the requirements for establishing a mitigation site.in april,nrcs and dawson farms signed a mitigation agreement,which defined dawson farms obligations in establishing the mitigation site.
in its wetlands mitigation agreement agreement,dawson farms agreed to implement the agreement within months from the date of signature.dawson farms signed the agreement on june.the agreement notified dawson farms that failure to comply within months may subject dawson farms to loss of refund of usda benefits.see national food security act manual nfsam in september,the corps of engineers notified dawson farms that its conversion of wetlands would also violate the clean water act,but the corps of engineers would issue an permit contingent on the fulfillment of the mitigation agreement.
more than months elapsed without dawson farms fulfilling its obligations under the agreement.dawson farms requested an extension from the usda on march.nrcs notified dawson farms that the agreement was not fulfilled within the required time but nevertheless approved an extension to november.the nrcs notified dawson farms in the letter granting the extension that after november,a s a result of,dawson farms will be subject to loss of usda benefits may have to refund prior usda program benefits.additionally the corps of engineers may decide to pursue penalties under the clean water act.there is no indication in the record that dawson farms ever fulfilled its obligations under the agreement.
this lawsuit 
dawson farms brought this suit on march,against the fsa,nrcs,corps of engineers,and community credit corporation to challenge the withholding of benefits.its complaint seeks an order compelling the named agencies to pay withheld benefits and reverse any restrictions on continued eligibility based on previous determinations of wetlands violations.the defendants filed a motion for dismissal arguing that dawson farms failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction to excuse exhaustion.in its memorandum in opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss,dawson farms argued that it had exhausted administrative remedies and that the government was estopped from arguing that dawson farms had failed to exhaust.the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because dawson farms had not exhausted its administrative remedies.dawson farms appealed and argues that it exhausted all administrative appeal procedures and,in the alternative,that the e exhaustion requirement is and that the circumstances of this case entitle it to be excepted or excused from the exhaustion requirement.

dawson farms did not exhaust all administrative appeal procedures in respect to either tract 
dawson farms first argues that the epa withdrawal of its complaint precludes the defendants as agencies of the federal government from taking administrative actions against the farm operator because of federal wetlands violations.this argument is without merit.only a judicial or administrative judgment or finding on the merits adverse to one agency would bind all related agencies dealing with the same issue.see sunshine anthracite coal adkins.boone kurtz,cir.the epa withdrawal of its complaint is not a judgment or finding on the merits in respect to the wetlands violations,and therefore had no effect on other agency actions.instead,the epa motion for withdrawal was granted and the case was dismissed without prejudice.a dismissal without prejudice has no legal effect and leaves the parties in the same legal position as if no suit had been filed.in re wilson,cir quoting hawkins mchugh,cir.
dawson farms failed to exhaust administrative appeal procedures in challenging the agency determinations of its wetlands conversion violations.in respect to tract,dawson farms did not timely appeal the ptd that concluded wetlands were converted.dawson farms appealed the ptd to the county committee on july,which was significantly past the date october,when the ptd became final and the time for appeal expired.in its decision,the county committee correctly noted that the ptd was no longer appealable at that point in time regarding tract,dawson farms chose to pursue an permit and,and as a condition in its application for a good faith determination,admitted that it would not dispute the determination that wetlands were converted dawson farms concedes that it did not appeal to the nad in respect to any adverse determination that wetlands had been converted on either tract.dawson farms also did not timely appeal any adverse determination in respect to its benefits eligibility even if it did ask for reconsideration at the county committee level for tract,it never appealed from the county committee adverse decision to the final administrative agency within the usda,the nad.the nad itself is composed of two internal appeal levels.appeals to the nad are heard before a hearing officer.the officer conclusions can be appealed to the director of the nad,who is considered the last administrative for all usda actions before judicial review.carpenter produce arnold,cir.because dawson farms never appealed the lower agencies decisions to the nad,and any such appeals now would be untimely,dawson farms failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.see am.airlines,herman,cir e xhaustion requires only that a party seeking review appeal the decision at issue through all available administrative channels.mahon usda,cir since it is undisputed that the plaintiff failed to sign the request for an appeal within the applicable period,we find that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,and is barred from seeking judicial review.
e codifies the judicial doctrine of exhaustion 
the argue that e jurisdictionally bars any action or appeal in a federal court against the secretary or his delegate by a person who has not exhausted all administrative appeal procedures established by the secretary or required by law dawson farms argues,alternatively,that if it failed to exhaust administrative remedies,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and should have excused it from the exhaustion requirement under the circumstances of this case.whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction so as to excuse the exhaustion requirement constitutes a question of law.
accordingly,the threshold issue presented on appeal is whether e is a jurisdictional or jurisprudential requirement for the exhaustion of administrative remedies.if e is a jurisdictional requirement,it deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to consider excusing a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.if the provision codifies a jurisprudential requirement,however,it merely continues the doctrine of judicial restraint,leaving the federal courts with jurisdiction to consider excusing a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see ace,at.
the supreme court in weinberger salfi,d established the standard for determining whether a statutory exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional rather than merely the preservation of a jurisprudential doctrine.in weinberger,the court construed statutory provisions relating to the exhaustion of administrative remedies in the social security act,codified at h,as jurisdictional.importantly,the court described the exhaustion provision in that statute as sweeping and direct and plain from its own language that no federal court action shall be brought unless exhaustion was satisfied.id.at.h explicitly mentions and deprives all forums,including courts,of jurisdiction when administrative remedies are not fully exhausted.id.at.preventing review by any person,tribunal,or government agency unless the exhaustion requirements provided in the statute are fulfilled quoting h.
the split among the circuits 
the eighth and ninth circuits have held that the e exhaustion requirement is jurisprudential rather than jurisdictional in its effect.the second circuit contrary view is that e is a prerequisite to a district court subject matter jurisdiction in a person suit against the secretary,the usda,or any of its agencies,officers or employees.
the second circuit construed e as a jurisdictional requirement in bastek,at citing gleichman usda.the second circuit,following gleichman,concluded that section e statutory language explicitly and clearly requires plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies within the usda before federal courts can have jurisdiction over the claims.the second circuit conclusion that e is jurisdictional results from its conclusion that congress would not have conditioned the right of action on the exhaustion of administrative appeal procedures if it had intended the requirement to have the same effect as a doctrine.see also mcbride cotton and cattle veneman,cir.
by contrast,the eighth and ninth circuits construe e as a statutory codification of a jurisprudential requirement.ace,at mcbride,at.both decisions were issued subsequent to the second circuit decision and persuasively criticize the second circuit analysis ace,at mcbride,at.both decisions concluded that the mere fact that a statutory provision demands exhaustion does not turn the statutory provision into a jurisdictional bar ace,at mcbride,at.according to these decisions,the second circuit thus incorrectly assumed that all statutory exhaustion requirements are jurisdictional.ace,at mcbride,at.as the eighth and ninth circuits note,a statutory exhaustion requirement can be merely a codification of a judicially developed exhaustion requirement that does not necessarily deprive district courts of their doctrinal authority to excuse exhaustion under certain circumstances.mcbride,at ace,at.thus,they concluded,whether a statutory exhaustion requirement is a jurisdictional requirement and not just a codification of the jurisprudential requirement turns on the statutory language itself.ace,at mcbride,at.both decisions extensively analyzed e statutory language and compared the language to similar language in other statutes,most notably the prison litigation reform act plra,a ace,at mcbride,at.all other circuits,including ours,have construed a as a codification of the jurisprudential exhaustion requirement see ace,at.accordingly,the eighth and ninth circuits concluded that e was also only a codification of the jurisprudential exhaustion requirement.ace,at mcbride,at.
the eighth circuit in ace,at,concluded that e,like a,only addresses whether a person should exhaust administrative remedies and does not specifically limit or condition the jurisdiction of the federal courts.its directive is addressed to the individual litigant rather than the court,and it pertains to the time when an action may be brought in federal district court.ace,at.the eighth circuit examined similar language in the plra,which does not mention the federal courts when discussing exhaustion and is also directed towards the individual litigant.id.as the eighth circuit observed,all circuits have found this language in the plra to be a codification of a jurisprudential requirement and not a jurisdictional bar.id.at.wright hollingsworth,cir.analogously,the language in e implies it is also a codification of the jurisprudential exhaustion requirement.
the ninth circuit likewise compared the language in e to two other similar statutory exhaustion provisions,the plra and c which the ninth circuit held to be codified jurisprudential principles in previous cases.like those provisions,the ninth circuit noted that e similarly does not limit the district court subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff claims,because section e does not contain the sweeping and direct language depriving a federal court of jurisdiction.mcbride,at.the ninth circuit,therefore,decided that e exhaustion requirement is jurisprudential.
fifth circuit precedent 
the government cites to three cases from the fifth circuit in support of its argument that the second circuit approach towards section should be followed townsend dep t of justice immigration naturalization,cir,meliezer resolution trust,cir,and taylor treasury dep t,cir.the government primarily relies on dicta in townsend that concluded w hen exhaustion is statutorily mandated,the requirement is jurisdictional.townsend,at see also taylor,at citing to townsend,at.
the three cases relied upon by the government are clearly distinguishable,however,because they dealt with differently worded statutes.in both townsend and meliezer,the statutory provisions at issue,unlike section e,explicitly mention the courts and directly limit their jurisdiction taylor actually undermines the government argument.in taylor,we found no express statutory requirement of exhaustion,because the statutory provision did not expressly require exhaustion of particular administrative remedies the statutory provision plainly does not constitute the clear,unequivocal manifestation of congressional intent necessary to render exhaustion of administrative remedies a jurisdictional prerequisite.at.consistent with taylor,we do not read these fifth circuit cases as following the approach of bastek.we do not read every statutory provision that refers to the exhaustion of administrative remedies as statutorily mandating exhaustion.we read these three cases,and particularly taylor,as efforts to determine when statutory language can be read as mandating exhaustion before federal courts have jurisdiction.taylor requires a clear,unequivocal manifestation of congressional intent necessary to render exhaustion of administrative remedies a jurisdictional prerequisite.id.recent cases establish equally exacting standards for determining whether statutory language should be read as mandating exhaustion.see,premiere network,sbc comm ns,cir interpreting the phrase statutorily mandated to mean textually required.
for these reasons,we agree with the ninth and eighth circuits that one important factor in deciding whether exhaustion is textually required or statutorily mandated is whether the statute explicitly mentions and deprives federal courts of jurisdiction if administrative remedies are not exhausted.here,section e focuses on the individual litigant and does not expressly deprive the courts of jurisdiction if the individual litigant fails to exhaust administrative remedies.in addition,the reasoning behind the eighth and ninth circuits analogy between the plra and e is persuasive.ace,at.we too have construed plra exhaustion requirement as jurisprudential.see hollingsworth,at.therefore,we now join the eighth and ninth circuits in holding that e analogously codifies the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion and is not jurisdictional 
no excuse of administrative exhaustion is applicable 
concluding that section e is a codification of the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion does not end our analysis.we must determine whether excusing the exhaustion of administrative remedies is warranted in this case.see,taylor,at.overcoming the jurisprudential requirement for administrative exhaustion is difficult.as we noted in central states,t hese exceptions to administrative exhaustion apply,howe
