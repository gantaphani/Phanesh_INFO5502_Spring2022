defendants,boyd stevenson coal company boyd stevenson and old republic insurance company old republic,seek relief from an order of the department of labor dol benefits review board holding defendants responsible for the payment of survivor benefits to a miner widow,claimant irene slone,under the black lung benefits act.the parties agree that slone is entitled to survivor benefits.the issue on appeal is whether boyd stevenson and its insurer,old republic,are responsible for payment of these benefits.finding that the decision of the benefits review board is contrary to law,we reverse.
ezra slone,claimant deceased husband,worked as a coal miner for boyd stevenson from to.old republic insured boyd stevenson black lung claims.after leaving boyd stevenson,slone worked as a coal miner for viking mining corporation viking from to.viking insurer for black lung benefit claims was rockwood insurance company rockwood.
ezra slone filed a claim for black lung benefits in,and on february,an alj issued a decision awarding ezra slone benefits.viking,as slone most recent coal mining employer,was designated as the responsible operator along with its insurer,rockwood.however,previously,on june,viking had been automatically terminated as a corporation for failing to file annual reports with the commonwealth of virginia.nevertheless,viking insurer,rockwood,remained in existence.rockwood,therefore,assumed responsibility for covering viking employees black lung claims and began making benefit payments to ezra slone.
on august,a pennsylvania court declared rockwood insolvent,dissolved its corporate existence,and directed the insurance commissioner of pennsylvania to liquidate rockwood.notice was given requiring all claims against rockwood to be filed with the liquidator by august.following rockwood insolvency and pursuant to virginia code annotated sections and,the virginia property and casualty insurance guaranty association vpciga assumed responsibility for insurance claims against the now insolvent rockwood and took up payment of ezra slone black lung benefits until his death on march.
after ezra slone death,his widow and only dependent under the black lung act,irene slone,filed a claim in april for survivor benefits.the office of workers compensation programs owcp approved the award of benefits to slone and initially designated viking as the potentially responsible operator on the claim.after discovering viking termination as a corporation and rockwood insolvency,the director turned to vpciga for payment of benefits.pursuant to a letter dated june,vpciga denied that it was responsible for payment of slone survivor benefits because a ll claims against rockwood must have been filed by august.
the director accepted vpciga argument and designated the next most recent employer,boyd stevenson,as the operator responsible for payment of slone benefits.boyd stevenson and old republic contested liability and the case was transferred to the office of administrative law judges for hearing 
after a hearing and pursuant to a written order issued september,the alj awarded slone benefits and designated boyd stevenson as the responsible operator pursuant to a.the alj determined that because the evidence showed that viking had been dissolved more than eleven years prior to the hearing and rockwood had been liquidated in,viking and rockwood were not currently capable of assuming liability for the payment of continuing benefits,and therefore viking did not meet the definition of responsible operator under a.the alj also concluded that because viking officers had complied with regulations requiring them to obtain and keep insurance while the company was in operation,the officers were not liable individually for payment of benefits.see a,a.the alj accepted,without discussion,the director position that vpciga august,deadline applied to slone claim for survivor benefits.
on appeal,the benefits review board affirmed the decision of the alj.with respect to defendants contention that vpciga was responsible for the payment of slone benefits,the board concluded that vpciga is a statutorily established method of providing prompt payment of covered claims that result from the insolvency of an insurer and because slone claim was filed after august,vpciga was not legally obligated by the blba or state statute to provide insurance coverage to the claimant based on her survivor claim.
on january,boyd stevenson and old republic filed with this court a petition for review of the benefits review board final decision affirming the alj order.
on review,boyd and stevenson and its insurer,old republic,advance two arguments for why the decision of the benefits review board was in error.first,they maintain that federal law requires all insurers and reinsurers to assume full liability for black lung benefits claim payments,and therefore that the blba preempts contrary state laws which limit reinsurers liability through filing deadlines.second,defendants argue that even if rockwood and vpciga are not responsible for payment of slone claim,the director,in accordance with,office of workers compensation programs trace fork coal,cir,failed to investigate whether viking,through an undiscovered successor or through viking former officers in their individual capacity,had the ability to pay survivor benefits.and slone raises another point addressed in her briefs whether virginia law allows vpciga to deny benefit payments to slone based on vpciga position that her claim was not timely filed and whether slone claim is separate and distinct from her husband original claim.
in reviewing a decision of the benefits review board,our review is governed by the same standard the board applies when reviewing an alj decision.walker,office of workers compensation programs,cir.factual determination will be upheld if the record contains substantial evidence supporting the alj decision.walker,at.we review conclusions of law de novo.walker,at.
we need not,and do not,determine whether federal law preempts virginia law or whether the director failed to properly investigate whether viking had the ability to pay slone survivor claim through a successor or its corporate officers or even whether old republic is the responsible operator under the black lung act.rather,our review of the applicable contract provisions and principles of insurance law leads us to conclude that vpciga is obligated by virginia law to pay slone survivor claim.
the virginia general assembly created vpciga to provide prompt payment of covered claims to reduce financial loss to claimants or policyholders resulting from the insolvency of an insurer.ann.the general assembly directs that the provisions governing vpciga shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose under.ann.vpciga is obligated to pay a covered claim for policies issued by an insolvent insurer.ann.a.a covered claim is defined as 
an unpaid claim,including one for unearned premiums,submitted by a claimant,which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of a policy covered by this chapter and issued by an insurer who has been declared to be an insolvent insurer.
while plaintiff claim for survivor benefits clearly falls within this definition,vpciga seeks to limit its liability through statutory language stating 
a covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the guaranty association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer.
the statutory notice sent by the liquidator to persons insured following rockwood insolvency states as follows 
filing of claims 
if you are a claimant of rockwood and are currently receiving workers compensation benefits,you need not file a proof of claim form with the liquidator.all known claims will be forwarded directly to the proper association for handling.please note that the association may require you to complete certain forms in order to continue your benefits.any submissions for new claims should be presented to the statutory liquidator.
