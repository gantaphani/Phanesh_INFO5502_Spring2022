opinion of the court 
fatouma camara camara petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia or the board denying her application for asylum under the immigration and nationality act ina or the act,et.because substantial evidence does not support the bia conclusion that camara did not suffer past hence does not have a fear of future will remand 
camara was born in abidjan,ivory coast,in.she is a muslim and a member of the dioulla ethnicity.her father,camara mamadi mamadi,was a founding member of the rally of the republicans rdr political party.the rdr was a political party in opposition to the government of the ivory coast at the time of the events relevant to this case.
on or about october,a group of men,dressed in black and armed with rifles,came to camara home in abidjan.camara,her mother,and her father were at the home when the armed camara refers to in her testimony as the death squad arrived.the men accused mamadi of supporting rebel forces and hiding weapons on the rebels behalf.after searching the home but finding no such weapons,they nevertheless seized mamadi and took him away by force.while leaving with mamadi,they threatened to return to make camara and the rest of her family disappear like mamadi.since that moment,neither camara,her family,nor the rdr has had any contact with mamadi 
after waiting a few days for her father to return home to abidjan,camara,along with the remaining members of her family,traveled to man,ivory coast,to stay with her father brother.on or about november,rebels attacked man and clashed with forces loyal to the government although civilians were targeted in the attack,neither camara nor her family was harmed.
on or about january,camara moved to guinea,where her mother left her in the care of a relative.camara new guardian in guinea severely abused camara,both physically and emotionally,by subjecting camara to female genital mutilation fgm beating camara with a whip in response to camara refusal to participate in an arranged marriage and forbidding camara from leaving the guardian residence.sometime in november,camara escaped from her residence in guinea and hid briefly at a friend home.on or about december,camara flew to john kennedy international airport jfk in new york.
to put these events in context,we provide a short summary of the recent history that gave rise to them on september,a rebellion against the ivory coast government began in three ivorian cities abidjan,bouake,and korhogo.many supporters of the rdr joined the rebel forces.the government encouraged and relied upon civilian militia groups to combat the rebels according to human rights watch,these civilian militias constituted a lightly veiled mechanism to intimidate and abuse members of the political opposition and those who,by virtue of their religion,ethnicity,nationality were thought to oppose the government most notably muslims,northerners,and west african immigrants mostly from burkina faso,niger,mali,and guinea.
the rebels were unable to capture abidjan,and the city became a central location of the conflict between civilian militia groups and those perceived to be rebels or muslims.even after the armed conflict officially ended in january,the militias continued to commit human rights abuses against muslims and others perceived to be opponents of the ruling regime.
camara was detained immediately upon her arrival in new york on or about december.on january,she was granted,and passed,a credible fear interview with an asylum officer on january,camara was served with a notice to appear nta in immigration court in elizabeth,new jersey,charging that she was subject to removal.on january,camara submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,and her case was assigned to an immigration judge ij.
in the immigration court,camara argued that she was entitled to asylum because she faced past persecution and had a fear of future persecution for reasons enumerated in a a the ij denied camara petition and found,inter alia,that camara alleged past persecution in guinea was irrelevant to her asylum claim because camara is a citizen of the ivory coast,and any persecution claimed by camara must be from the country of nationality camara herself did not sustain any mistreatment in the ivory coast because her suffering in the ivory coast was the type of suffering similarly experienced by others who live in a area where civil war is in place no objective evidence was presented that camara father was abducted on account of his ethnicity or religion and there was no objective evidence to support a finding that camara fear of future persecution on account of her religion or ethnicity is objectively reasonable.the ij concluded that,despite various outbreaks of disputes and unrest between these ethnic groups the evidence as a whole is not inclusive sic that the respondent would be mistreated or harmed if removed to ivory coast solely on account of her ethnicity,and that therefore camara did not qualify for asylum or withholding of removal.the ij also held that because it could not conclude that the respondent would more likely suffer torture in her country by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official acting under color of law,camara was not eligible for relief under the convention against torture.
on june,camara timely filed an appeal with the bia challenging the ij denial of her asylum petition.on august,the board dismissed petitioner appeal,holding,inter alia,that petitioner persecution in guinea is irrelevant to her asylum application even assuming arguendo that camara account of her father abduction was entirely credible and that his captors were centrally motivated by his ethnicity or religion,their mistreatment of petitioner did not amount to past persecution and camara has not shown that she obtained such notoriety amongst government officials in the ivory coast that she would be singled out by them for persecution.therefore,the bia concluded,conditions in the ivory coast do not indicate that camara has a fear that returning to the ivory coast will result in persecution on account of her ethnicity or religion.
on september,camara moved for reconsideration by the bia.the bia denied that petition on november.in that opinion,the bia held that the facts of konan attorney general of united states,cir,involved significantly more severe harm than the harm camara suffered when government officials came to her house and that therefore camara experiences during her father arrest did not constitute persecution.the bia also rejected camara argument that she was a member of a persecuted social group consisting of her family.
on september,camara timely filed a petition for review of the bia august,final order of removal.she has not filed a petition for review of the bia denial of her motion to reconsider.
