opinion of the court 
at issue before the court is the decision of an administrative law judge alj constituting a final order of the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc or commission,which upheld two violations of the osh act but reclassified them as.the secretary of labor,in,contends that the alj erred in this reclassification of the violations.trinity industries,in,argues that the alj erred in affirming the violations at all.for the following reasons,we will grant the petition in and deny the petition in.
this action was tried on stipulated facts before the alj.in brief,in,trinity purchased a foundry,which had been constructed prior to,in mckees rocks,pennsylvania.at that time,trinity had work done on the pusher furnace,which required removing a brick wall and inner insulation blanket.trinity believed that any asbestos that had been present was removed.trinity also believed that any new insulation installed at that time would be.given these beliefs,in,trinity,in preparing to have work done on the same pusher furnace,did not conduct tests to determine if asbestos was present.it hired a contractor,to complete the work on the furnace.after work commenced,a trinity employee noticed that an insulation blanket which had been placed in a dumpster appeared to contain asbestos.work stopped and testing revealed that the insulation contained amosite asbestos,which was later confirmed by tests conducted by the occupational safety and health administration osha.
osha issued a citation to trinity alleging violations of k i,for failure to determine the presence,location,and quantity of material presumed material at the work site,and k ii a,for failure to notify prospective employers bidding for work whose employees reasonably can be expected to be exposed to areas containing asbestos containing material acm or presumed asbestos containing material pacm.it characterized these violations as serious.
the alj found that the cited asbestos standard,which applies to c onstruction,alteration,repair,maintenance,or renovation of structures,substrates,or portions thereof,that contain asbestos,a,applies in this situation.as the stipulated facts established that trinity did not test for asbestos and did not notify plibrico of its presence,the alj ruled that trinity violated both sections of the regulation for which it was cited.the alj,however,reclassified the violations as other or,because,according to the alj,the violations could not be deemed serious pursuant to k as the secretary had not met her burden of showing any significant exposure to asbestos.the alj vacated the proposed penalty.
both parties appealed.the oshrc did not direct the case for review.as such,the decision of the alj is deemed the final order of the oshrc.see j.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
pursuant to the administrative procedure act,a,this court may set aside the legal conclusions of the alj if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.see bianchi trison chao,cir.the court must defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous administrative statute.reich sabia,cir see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in those instances in which the secretary of labor interpretation differs from the interpretation of the oshrc,the court must defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation.reich,at see also martin oshrc,d.
osha cited trinity for two violations of the osh act.the regulation at issue,applies,in part,to construction and maintenance involving asbestos.id.a.the regulation requires building owners to test for asbestos at the worksite and communicate the results of those tests to employees and prospective employers bidding for work.the testing,id.k i,and notification,id.k ii,provisions are those at issue in this case.pursuant to the regulation,the thermal system insulation and surfacing materials of buildings constructed prior to are presumed to contain asbestos and are deemed presumed asbestos containing material pacm.id.b.tests done in accordance with the regulation can be used by the building owner to rebut the presumption that such materials actually contain asbestos.id.k.
the first issue to be addressed is the alj reclassification of trinity violations as.pursuant to k,a serious violation shall be deemed to exist in a place of employment if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists unless the employer did not,and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence,know of the presence of the violation.the alj ruled that the secretary had failed to meet her burden of showing that a serious violation had occurred because there is no evidence to show any significant exposure to asbestos.trinity agrees,arguing that the secretary must present evidence either that there is a substantial probability that serious disease or death could result from this isolated exposure,or that overexposure to asbestos was typical of the employee job.trinity br.at.we disagree.
it is that,pursuant to k,when the violation of a regulation makes the occurrence of an accident with a substantial probability of death or serious physical harm possible,the employer has committed a serious violation of the regulation.bethlehem steel oshrc,cir emphasis added.the substantial probability portion of the statute refers not to the probability that an accident will occur but to the probability that,an accident having occurred,death or serious injury could result.power oshrc,cir,even in those cases in which an accident has not occurred or,in fact,is not likely to occur,cal.stevedore ballast oshrc,cir see also phelps dodge oshrc,cir usery hermitage concrete pipe,cir.
trinity violated the statute by failing to test for asbestos and notify of the results.given this failure,and its employees could not adequately prepare for the job or arrange for protection to guard against the threat of asbestos exposure.this is the failure which forms the basis for the violations,and not the subsequent exposure suffered by employees.as such,the question is whether,as a result of the failure to test and notify,it was possible that an accident could occur in which it was substantially probable that death or serious physical harm would result.see,phelps dodge,at secretary of labor miniature nut screw,bna oshc secretary of labor,bna oshc.given that the violations made it possible that workers could unwittingly stumble into large amounts of asbestos without adequate protection,there was no need to show that employees suffered any actual exposure to asbestos,much less the significant exposure that the alj required,in order for the secretary to show that a serious injury could result.given the detrimental health effects that can result from exposure,june,the failure to test for asbestos in those situations in which it is presumed to be present and,given the failure to test,the concomitant failure to communicate the results of any tests is unquestionably a serious violation.we will therefore grant the secretary petition and remand for consideration of the proper penalty to be assessed.
we turn,then,to trinity arguments that the citation should have been dismissed altogether because the exposure was limited to employees of,as opposed to its own employees,and because it did not have knowledge of the presence of asbestos.we reject both arguments.
first,trinity argues that,pursuant to the supreme court ruling in nationwide mutual insurance darden,d,the term employee must be understood in the context of the conventional relationship so as to preclude liability when the affected workers are not actually employees of the employer.therefore,according to trinity,it could not be cited for a violation here,as the exposed workers were employees of.trinity draws further support from the commission recent decision in secretary of labor summit contractors,wl,in which it ruled that the secretary use of the worksite doctrine in construction cases was precluded by a regulation limiting her authority to an employer and his employees.see a.we find neither case controlling or particularly persuasive.
