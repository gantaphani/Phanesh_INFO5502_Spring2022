teodulo petitions this court for review of an order from the board of immigration appeals bia denying his request for administrative closure and dismissing his appeal.we deny the petition.
a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on or about july.on november,pleaded guilty in texas state court to possessing more than fifty pounds and less than pounds of marijuana.he received deferred adjudication and was placed on probation for ten years.on january,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause,charging as being deportable because he was an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation and an aggravated felony.
appeared before an immigration judge ij and denied all of the factual allegations and charges of deportability.the ij found all of the factual allegations and charges to be true,determined that was ineligible for any type of relief,and ordered him deported.the bia agreed with the ij that was deportable based upon his controlled substance violation but held that was not deportable as an aggravated felon.however,in,the bia administratively closed the proceedings pending the publication of a new regulation by the attorney general to implement a procedure,known as repapering,for terminating deportation proceedings for certain lawful permanent residents.
in,the bia reinstated the proceedings against at the request of the ins.the bia then dismissed appeal from the ij order.in the order of dismissal,the bia agreed with the ij that was deportable because of his controlled substance conviction and also because he was an aggravated felon.the bia further determined that was ineligible for discretionary relief under former immigration and nationality act ina c.
filed a federal habeas corpus petition challenging the bia findings,and his petition was consolidated with other similar petitions.the district court denied the consolidated petitions,and all of the petitioners appealed.this court dismissed the claims challenging the bia decision and affirmed the dismissal of the petitioners habeas petitions.however,the supreme court vacated this court opinion and remanded for further proceedings in light of lopez gonzales on remand,this court vacated the district court judgment as to and remanded the matter to the bia for further consideration in light of lopez.
on remand,the department of homeland security dhs withdrew the aggravated felon charge but maintained that conviction of a controlled substance offense rendered him both deportable and ineligible for discretionary relief under former ina c.requested that his case be administratively closed pending issuance of the repapering regulations or,in the alternative,that his case be remanded so that he could apply for suspension of deportation under former a.he also argued that the timing of the proceedings and the combination of provisions applicable to him violated his rights to equal protection and due process.the dhs opposed request for administrative closure.
the bia denied request for administrative closure on the ground that such a request could not be granted if opposed by either party.the bia determined that was ineligible for suspension of deportation and that it lacked jurisdiction to consider facial constitutional challenges.accordingly,the bia dismissed appeal.filed a timely petition for review in this court.
under the transitional rules of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira this court lacks jurisdiction to review the final order of removal against however,this court retains jurisdiction to consider arguments to the extent he raises constitutional claims or questions of law we review questions of law de novo but accord deference to the bia interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the bia interpretation is incorrect.
argues that,despite the dhs opposition to administrative closure,the bia should have administratively closed his case to await the repapering regulations because the denial was unfair to him and because the dhs opposition was unjustified and contrary to internal dhs policy.the bia held in in re that a case may not be administratively closed if opposed by either of the parties.because the dhs opposed the administrative closure,the bia had no discretion to administratively close the case accordingly,the bia properly denied request for administrative closure and his alternative request for an abeyance 
also contends that the bia denial of his request for administrative closure and the timing of his deportation proceedings each resulted in the violation of his due process rights.to the extent that also argues that the bia erred by misconstruing his as applied constitutional claims as facial challenges,any error was harmless because the bia lacked jurisdiction to consider those challenges 
however,as noted,this court has jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues.to establish a substantive due process violation,a plaintiff must first both carefully describe that right and establish it as deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.if the right is so deeply it is subject it to more exacting standards of review.if it is not,we review only for a rational basis.additionally,t his court has long held that a liens enjoy some constitutional protections,regardless of their status,but it has also long held that this protection is limited by congress broad powers to control immigration.
asserts that,as a lawful permanent resident,he has a fundamental liberty interest in being able to reside with his children and work in the united states.we have previously rejected a similar argument in a related context.in malagon de fuentes gonzales the petitioner,a lawful permanent resident and mother of four united states citizens,was convicted of theft of property in a welfare fraud and subsequently left the country for a day on return to the united states,the ins charged her as an arriving alien inadmissible under the ina on appeal from an order of removal,the petitioner argued that her liberty interests in staying in the united states and being with her children were violated we affirmed,holding that the petitioner had no right to be admitted to the united states and,therefore,the government needs only a rational basis to enforce a law that bars her admission.because congress s choice to disfavor the admission of aliens who have committed offenses is not irrational,this court held that the petitioner predicament d id not constitute a deprivation of substantive due process.
similar to the petitioner in malagon de fuentes,does not have a fundamental liberty interest in being able to live and work in the united states congress choice to disfavor the retention of aliens who have been convicted of controlled substance violations is not irrational.therefore,substantive due process claim fails.
further asserts an equal protection claim.he argues that the bia refusal to close his case administratively impermissibly differentiated him from lawful permanent residents who have received the benefit of administrative closure,and that the results of his deportation proceedings would have been different had the timing occurred according to three alternative scenarios.
alleges that his case is the only known instance in which the bia refused to administratively close a case to await the repapering regulations when unusually adverse factors did not exist.although cites to various cases in support of that assertion,none of the cited cases specifically involves the bia granting administrative closure to a lawful permanent resident to await the repapering regulations in the face of dhs opposition.in fact,the bia recently noted in an unpublished decision that it has never administratively closed a case for the purpose of repapering over the objection of the dhs.has failed to show that the bia decision regarding administrative closure in his case was different from the bia decisions in other cases involving lawful permanent residents in which the dhs opposed administrative closure.has therefore failed to establish an equal protection claim on this
