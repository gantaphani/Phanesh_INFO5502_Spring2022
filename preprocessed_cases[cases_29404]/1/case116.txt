though clouded by an airline disaster and claims of a government,this case ultimately turns on a relatively straightforward question must the government release certain information plaintiff appellant thomas stalcup brought this freedom of information act foia suit against the central intelligence agency cia,seeking two documents from an investigation into the crash of twa flight.stalcup also sought the names of the eyewitnesses interviewed during the investigation.the district court rejected stalcup requests,concluding that foia permitted the agency to withhold the material.because we agree with each of the district court conclusions,we affirm its decision to grant summary judgment for the cia.
on july,twa flight exploded in and crashed eight miles south of long island,new york.pursuant to its obligations under a,the national transportation safety board ntsb launched an investigation into the tragedy.the board quickly arrived at three possible explanations for the crash a bomb,a missile,or a mechanical failure.
given the possibility of criminal or terrorist activity,the fbi joined the probe.a central component of the bureau task was to interview eyewitnesses.many of the individuals who were interviewed described a streak of light rising up to the plane just before the explosion.given the consistency of that narrative,the fbi asked the cia to analyze the accounts and explore the likelihood of a missile strike.
the cia reviewed the eyewitness reports along with raw flight and radar data.it concluded that the eyewitnesses had not seen a missile soaring towards the plane but,instead,had observed the burning aircraft in various stages of dismantling.on march,the cia passed this analysis along to the fbi,which ultimately reached the same conclusion.in november,the cia publicized these results in a video entitled twa flight what did the eyewitnesses see 
as new data emerged,the cia continued its work.for instance,in it produced a page draft report analyzing new radar tracking data analysis of radar tracking.at that time,it also created an page draft report assessing the plane flight path dynamic flight simulation.both documents contained recommendations to the agency about how the newly acquired data should impact the analysis.in,the cia relayed this new evaluation to a group studying the eyewitness accounts.
on august,the investigation,which had been the largest and most expensive in the ntsb history,reached its terminus.the board adopted the cia assessment of the eyewitness accounts and concluded that a mechanical explosion in the center wing fuel tank had caused the crash.the ntsb distributed a final report detailing these findings.
a decade later,theorizing that the cia was covering up that the true cause of the crash was a missile strike,stalcup sent the cia a letter requesting copies of all data,images,video,documents other information related to or a product of the cia involvement in the twa flight investigation.he also asked for the technical analysis briefing twa flight all eyewitness documents,reports,videos,images,audio provided to the cia and any and all correspondence regarding the cia analysis of the eyewitness evidence.
the cia first disclosed documents that it had previously released in response to a similar foia request.unsatisfied with the cia response,stalcup brought this foia action.the complaint,filed in the district of massachusetts,asked the court to order the cia to disclose additional material.as the litigation progressed,the cia provided stalcup with documents,a dvd,documents,and fourteen documents created by other agencies.the agency also filed a vaughn index with the court detailing its redactions and withholdings.
nonetheless,stalcup demanded more.he requested unredacted versions of the analysis of radar tracking document only the technical data,graphs,and certain headings were initially provided the dynamic flight simulation analysis only the headings had been released and the names of the eyewitnesses interviewed by the fbi.
in due course,the cia moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the court concluded that the agency had properly withheld the requested documents under the deliberative process exemption of the law,b hereinafter exemption,and had appropriately redacted the eyewitness names pursuant to the law enforcement exemption of the act,b c hereinafter exemption c.the court also rejected stalcup contentions that disclosure of the information was required in light of alleged government misconduct.finally,the court concluded that the cia had performed an adequate search in response to the foia request.this timely appeal followed.

exemption the deliberative process exemption 
exemption of foia,the deliberative process exemption,permits an agency to withhold or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.it thus generally exempts from disclosure documents containing work product,correspondence,or material that is otherwise privileged in the civil discovery context.nlrb sears,roebuck.the government carries the burden of establishing the applicability of the exemption and must show that the withheld material is an inter or intraagency uncontested issue here that the document is deliberative and that it is predecisional.providence journal,at.
the government asserts that it properly withheld the analysis of radar tracking and the dynamic flight simulation under the exemption.stalcup,however,contends that the documents are neither deliberative nor predecisional.though the analysis intersects at times,the two criteria are distinct prongs and must be examined separately.
to satisfy the deliberative element of the exception,a document must reflect the of the consultative process.petroleum info.dep t of interior,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.more specifically,the document must i form an essential link in a specified consultative process,ii reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency,and iii if released,inaccurately reflect or prematurely disclose the views of the agency.providence journal,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.conversely,a document consisting only of compiled factual material or purely factual material contained in del
