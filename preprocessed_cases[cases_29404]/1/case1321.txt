in his petition for review,gurpinder othi seeks to reverse the order of the board of immigration appeals the board affirming the immigration judge ij order that othi be removed to india.a lawful permanent resident lpr of the united states,othi was deemed an inadmissible arriving alien upon his return from a day overseas trip.othi argues that he did not seek admission and therefore was not subject to removal proceedings when he returned to the united states from abroad.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition for review and affirm the board decision.
othi is a native and citizen of india who gained lpr status when he entered the united states in.in,othi was arrested and convicted of theft.two years later,he was arrested and convicted of possession of cannabis.and in,othi was found guilty of murder,receiving a year prison sentence.
othi had travelled to india in early to get married,and he returned there in december to visit his new wife.on january,after days outside the country,othi returned to the united states.upon inspection at the airport of entry,a border agent referred othi for secondary inspection when his name appeared on a watch list.border agents obtained othi criminal record during that secondary inspection,and he admitted his prior arrests and convictions.
the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against othi on january.the notice to appear alleged that othi was an arriving who was removable on three grounds his prior conviction for a crime of moral turpitude,see u.a a i i his prior conviction under a law relating to controlled substances,see id.a a i ii and his prior convictions of two or more crimes having aggregate sentences of five years or more,see u.a b.the notice specifically cited othi theft,marijuana,and murder convictions.
othi challenged the removal proceedings on several grounds,but only one concerning his status as an arriving alien is raised on appeal.in particular,othi argued that he was not an arriving alien because he never intended his trip abroad to meaningfully interrupt his permanent residence.in support,othi cited rosenberg fleuti,d,which construed a prior version of the statute defining admission,a.under fleuti,lprs were permitted to take innocent,casual,and brief trips abroad without having to seek readmission.id.at.in addition,othi alleged that a removal premised on his status violated his due process rights.
the ij ultimately found that othi was removable as an arriving alien and rejected his argument.relying on the text of the applicable statute,a c v,and a decision of the board holding that fleuti had been statutorily superseded,in re collado munoz,the ij deemed othi an arriving alien.after denying othi request for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility,the ij ordered him removed from the united states.
othi appealed to the board,arguing again that he was not an arriving alien because his departure was innocent,casual and brief under fleuti.he also repeated his argument that removal violated his due process rights.
the board was unconvinced.congress,the board observed,had amended the statute at issue in fleuti in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira of.in the board view,lprs who commit offenses like those committed by othi are always treated as arriving aliens under the new statute and subject to removal.the board further noted that all the federal circuit courts that had considered the fleuti issue had unanimously affirmed the board viewpoint.consequently,the board rejected othi fleuti argument,as well as his constitutional claims,and affirmed the ij order of removal.
othi then filed a timely petition for review to this court.we have jurisdiction to review the order of removal under.
in considering othi petition for review,we must first determine how iirira applies to him and whether the supreme court earlier decision in fleuti impacts that analysis.the board determined that fleuti had been statutorily superseded,and we review that legal conclusion de novo.see leiba holder,cir.we review factual findings for substantial evidence,which exists unless the record would compel any reasonable adjudicator to conclude the contrary.viegas holder,cir.and where,as here,the board has adopted and supplemented the ij decision,we review both rulings and accord them appropriate deference.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
before iirira passage,united states immigration law established two types of proceedings in which aliens could be denied the hospitality of the united states deportation hearings and exclusion hearings.vartelas holder,d internal quotation marks omitted.exclusion hearings were held for certain aliens seeking entry to the united states,and deportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had already entered the country.id.practically speaking,the distinction between aliens seeking entry and aliens not seeking entry was significant,as different substantive and procedural rules applied in each context.see landon plasencia,d describing differences between the proceedings.exclusion proceedings,for instance,were considered more summary than deportation hearings.martinez attorney of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for purposes of our review,it is sufficient to recognize that t hose physically present in the country.had advantages over those seeking entry.lezama garcia holder,cir.
given the important differences between exclusion and deportation,aliens including lprs often argued that they were not seeking entry when returning from a trip abroad.for example,in united states ex rel.volpe smith,the supreme court concluded that a resident alien who briefly travelled to cuba sought entry and was therefore excludable upon his return.id.at.volpe strictly construed entry to cover any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the united states whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one.id.at.following that decision,cases in the lower courts applying the strict reentry doctrine to aliens who had left the country for brief visits were numerous.fleuti,at.
in the immigration and nationality act ina of,congress defined entry as any coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession,whether voluntarily or otherwise.a.notwithstanding this statutory codification of the volpe principle,congress included in the act a special exception for lprs who did not intend to leave the country 
a n alien having a lawful permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as making an entry into the united states for the purposes of the immigration laws if the alien proves to the satisfaction of the attorney general that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or in an outlying possession was not voluntary.
this not intended language in the former section a was the subject of the supreme court decision in fleuti.in light of congress apparent effort to ameliorate the severe effects of the strict entry doctrine,the court concluded that congress did not intend entry to cover an lpr return from an innocent,casual,and brief trip abroad because such trips were not meaningfully interruptive of the alien permanent residence.fleuti,at.fleuti further identified several relevant factors that might indicate whether the trip was meaningfully interruptive,including its length,the purpose of the visit,and whether the alien had to procure any travel documents in order to make his trip.id.
although the court had originally granted certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the statute as applied to fleuti,the court decision was solely a matter of statutory interpretation.id.at w e have concluded that there is a threshold issue of statutory interpretation,the existence of which obviates decision here as to whether ina a is constitutional as applied to respondent.in short,the court specifically declined to address a constitutional basis,as opposed to a statutory basis,for its decision.
in,congress made major changes to immigration law via iirira.william gonzales,cir.among other things,congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as removal.vartelas.at.congress also excised the word entry from the statute,replacing the concept with admission.see id.perhaps most importantly for our purposes,the new statute eliminated the presumption that any return from a trip abroad requires an lpr to seek admission or,under the old parlance,seek entry.under iirira,a n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states is not treated as one seeking admission unless one of six statutory conditions is met.see a emphasis added in othi case,the critical exception is subsection v,which applies to aliens who have been convicted of crimes of moral turpitude or crimes related to controlled substances.id.a c v,a.these iirira changes became effective on april.see iirira,a,stat.
even though iirira merged deportation and exclusion proceedings,aliens seeking an admission and aliens not seeking an admission are still treated differently.now,as before,the immigration laws provide two separate lists of substantive grounds,principally involving criminal offenses,for deportation and.judulang holder,d.these two lists are sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent.see also nancy morawetz,the invisible border restrictions on short term travel by non citizens,geo.immigr,describing the gap between rules of deportability and rules of inadmissibility.for purposes of the case at bar,by arguing that he never sought admission,othi is effectively seeking the benefit of the more list of grounds for deportation.
with this statutory and caselaw background in focus,we now turn to the issue in this case,an issue of first impression in our circuit that issue is whether section,as amended by iirira,still allows for the analysis of an alien intent under fleuti when determining whether the alien is seeking an admission for purposes of removal proceedings.
we begin,as always in deciding questions of statutory interpretation,with the text of the statute.see united states ashford,cir.unless congress indicates otherwise,we give statutory terms their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states powell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to determine a statute plain meaning,we not only look to the language itself,but also the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.country vintner of,llc gallo winery,cir 
the statute reads,in relevant part,that a n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien falls into one of six categories.a c emphasis added.one of the six categories,for example,applies to aliens who have been absent from the united states for a continuous period in excess of days.id.a c ii.in other words,an alien absent for continuous days is not regarded as seeking an admission by virtue of that absence,but an alien absent days is so regarded.the pertinent category here,though,is the statutory category that applies to aliens who have committed certain offenses,which include the offenses for which othi was convicted.id.a c v.
noting the statute shall not unless language,othi argues that iirira left the fleuti doctrine in place.in his view,the statute as amended by iirira only lists instances in which an alien may be regarded as seeking an admission,not when an alien must be so regarded.assuming this permissive approach,and given that the statutory text does not directly mention fleuti,othi maintains that he may still invoke the fleuti doctrine to avoid a finding of admission.
othi reading of iirira has,however,been rejected by all the courts of appeal considering the issue.while the circuits have all reached the same result,they have done so in different ways.
the first and fifth circuits concluded that iirira plain language ended the fleuti doctrine.see de vega gonzales,cir w e find the statute plain on its face.malagon de fuentes gonzales,cir the plain language of the statute does not allow for the exception found by the court in fleuti.likewise,the seventh,tenth,and eleventh circuits seemed to find the statute unambiguous,even though those courts did not expressly rely on the statute plain language.see poveda att y,cir iirira altered the law for permanent residents who returned to the united states after an innocent,casual,and brief excursion abroad.tapia ashcroft,cir the physical presence requirements under the iirira does not include the innocent,casual,and brief standard.rivera jimenez immigration naturalization,cir finding that fleuti analysis was irrelevant in light of the iirira special rules relating to continuous physical existence 
taking a different tack,the second,third,and ninth circuits found that the statutory language was ambiguous,but nonetheless determined that congress had impliedly repealed the fleuti doctrine.see vartelas holder,cir,vacated on other grounds by,d camins,at tineo ashcroft,cir.
we now join our sister circuits and hold,based on the plain text of the statute,that the fleuti doctrine did not survive iirira enactment.
under section a,an alien is any person not a citizen or national of the united states.under this broad definitional class of noncitizens,lprs are included within the ambit of all aliens,and all aliens are deemed to seek admission upon their lawful entry into the united states.id.a a.an lpr would therefore be deemed admitted into the united states whenever entering the country from abroad because they are definitionally part of the broad statutory class of aliens unless congress otherwise exempts them elsewhere in the statute.
congress did just that in section a c.there,congress provided that a n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states.id.a c emphasis added.thus,lprs are generally exempt from the statutory classification of all other aliens for purposes of an admission designation.had congress stopped there,othi argument would have merit as an lpr,he would be considered under the plain terms of the statute exempt from the admission definition.
however,congress did not stop there and limited the lpr exemption in specific and clear terms principally by creating exceptions to the lpr exemption.relevant here,the general exemption from admission applies to all lprs unless the alien has committed an offense identified in a of this title.id.a c v emphasis added.othi falls within this category of lprs because he indeed committed offenses enumerated in section a.so rather than benefiting from the general exemption granted to lprs,aliens like othi fall back into the general class of aliens and are treated as all other aliens for admission purposes.
under the plain language of the statute,othi is excluded from the exemption granted to lprs from admission status.he is therefore treated as seeking admission into the united states,just as are all other aliens entering the country.accordingly,upon his entry into this country from india on january,othi was seeking admission into the united states and was subject to removal because of his criminal history.
because congress has spoken clearly and without reservation,no further analysis is required.the plain meaning of the statute settles the issue at controversy.see ignacio united states,cir a bsent an ambiguity in the words of a statute,our analysis begins and ends with the statute plain language.
othi argues in opposition that the shall not unless statutory construction has been read as permissive when used in some other statutes.although another context in another statutory setting might permit a different reading,it has no effect on what congress plainly stated in iirira.see caraco pharm,novo nordisk,d the meaning of the phrase ultimately turns on its context.as an lpr who has committed the statutorily enumerated offenses,othi is categorically excluded from claiming the status of other lprs as to whether he was seeking admission upon entry into the united states
