this appeal presents the discrete question of whether malicious destruction of property under massachusetts law qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude cimt.we conclude that it does and therefore deny the petition for review.
facts background 
joao palmeira da silva neto palmeira is a native and citizen of brazil.he entered the united states without inspection in with his wife,maria,who is also a brazilian citizen.together,the palmeiras had two children,who are both united states citizens.eventually,the palmeiras separated.on january,maria invited palmeira to a new year party at her house.despite the fact that maria had a restraining order against him,palmeira attended the party.he got drunk at the party and,after initially leaving,quickly returned to maria house,wishing to speak with her.when his wife would not open the door,palmeira kicked it open once inside the home,he broke some glass and apparently threw some furniture.police officers were dispatched to maria house for a report of a disturbance,and palmeira was arrested at the scene.
palmeira admitted to sufficient facts to support a finding of malicious destruction of property under.laws ch,with the unfortunately incorrect understanding that doing so would not cause him immigration problems.he was sentenced to eleven months of probation and an anger management program,both of which he completed.on january,the district court in brockton,massachusetts dismissed all charges against palmeira nonetheless,the department of homeland security dhs took palmeira into federal custody and instituted removal proceedings against him.
before the immigration court in boston,palmeira applied for cancellation of removal,which is a form of discretionary relief,the granting of which allows a alien,otherwise removable,to remain in the united states.ayeni holder,cir see also b.the immigration judge ij denied palmeira application,finding that he had not established that his removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his united states citizen children.b d.palmeira appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which granted the appeal and remanded the case to the ij for consideration of additional evidence that palmeira had provided regarding his wife mental health and her ability to care for their children in his absence.the bia also directed the ij to make a finding as to whether palmeira could qualify as a person of good moral character for purposes of cancellation of removal,given his conviction for malicious destruction of property.id.b b see also id.f,a a i i.
on remand,the ij focused on whether palmeira conviction for malicious destruction of property prevented him from qualifying as a person of good moral character,finding that question to be.she concluded that malicious destruction of property under massachusetts law is a cimt and that palmeira was therefore statutorily barred from establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal.palmeira appealed to the bia,which issued an opinion agreeing with the ij conclusion but offering its own reasoning.palmeira then filed a timely petition for review with this court,challenging the bia determination that malicious destruction of property under.laws ch,qualifies as a cimt.
ii.discussion 
though we lack jurisdiction to review the agency discretionary or factual determinations regarding an individual application for cancellation of removal,see a b hasan holder,cir,we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law,a d.the parties agree that palmeira petition for review raises a question of law that falls within our jurisdiction.
where,as here,the bia has rendered a decision with its own analysis of the question at issue,our review focuses on the bia decision,not the ij.v√°squez holder,cir.we review the bia legal conclusions de novo,but we afford chevron deference to the bia interpretation of the immigration and nationality act ina,including its determination that a particular crime qualifies as one of moral turpitude,unless that interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.idy holder,cir see also maghsoudi ins,cir.
we begin with an overview of the meaning and import of the phrase crime involving moral turpitude.in order to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal,an applicant must,among other things,have been a person of good moral character during the ten years immediately preceding his application b b.the applicant can not demonstrate good moral character if he was convicted of a cimt during that period.see id.f,a a i i.
the term moral turpitude first appeared in a federal immigration statute in.cabral ins,cir.congress has never defined the phrase,but we have found that t he legislative history leaves no doubt that congress left the term crime involving moral turpitude to future administrative and judicial interpretation.id.at.we have adopted the bia definition of a cimt as conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general,or,in other words,an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong and is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.maghsoudi,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also,matter of silva trevino,a finding of moral turpitude under the ina requires that a perpetrator have committed the reprehensible act with some form of scienter.
the relatively amorphous nature of the moral turpitude definition has led to a patchwork of different approaches to the cimt analysis among the circuit courts.silva trevino,at.in silva trevino,the attorney general ag responded to that patchwork by attempting to establish a uniform framework for ensuring that the ina moral turpitude provisions are fairly and accurately applied.id.under the first step of the ag framework,the adjudicator must determine whether the crime at issue categorically involves moral turpitude by examining whether there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the criminal statute would be applied to reach conduct that does not involve moral turpitude.id.at quoting gonzales duenas alvarez.if that categorical approach does not resolve the issue,the adjudicator must then apply a modified categorical approach,by examining the record of conviction to determine whether it evidences a crime that in fact involved moral turpitude.id.if the modified categorical approach is not conclusive,under silva trevino,an adjudicator should proceed to a third step,which involves examining evidence beyond the formal record of conviction.id.
our approach to the cimt analysis has been generally consistent with the first two steps of the silva trevino framework,though we have not specifically applied the realistic probability test we have begun by looking to the inherent nature of the crime of conviction,as defined in the criminal statute,to determine whether it fits the cimt definition.idy,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.if it does,we have said that our inquiry may end there.id.if,however,the face of the statute is insufficient for us to make a determination,if the statute contains both crimes that involve moral turpitude and crimes that do not then we may look to the record of conviction the indictment,plea,verdict,and sentence.id.
the criminal statute at issue here reads as follows 
whoever destroys or injures the personal property,dwelling house or building of another in any manner or by any means not particularly described or mentioned in this chapter shall,if such destruction or injury is wilful and malicious,be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or by a fine of three thousand dollars or three times the value of the property so destroyed or injured,whichever is greater and imprisonment in jail for not more than two and years or if such destruction or injury is wanton,shall be punished by a fine of fifteen hundred dollars or three times the value of the property so destroyed or injured,whichever is greater,or by imprisonment for not more than two and years if the value of the property so destroyed or injured is not alleged to exceed two hundred and fifty dollars,the punishment shall be by a fine of three times the value of the damage or injury to such property or by imprisonment for not more than two and months provided,however,that where a fine is levied pursuant to the value of the property destroyed or injured,the court shall,after conviction,conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the value of the property so destroyed or injured.the words personal property,as used in this section,shall also include electronically processed or stored data,either tangible or intangible,and data while in transit.
laws ch.the statute punishes both wanton destruction of property and malicious destruction of property.under massachusetts law,wanton destruction of property requires only a showing that the actor conduct was indifferent to,or in disregard of,probable consequences.commonwealth armand.malicious destruction of property,on the other hand,consists of conduct that is both willful and malicious.see,commonwealth morris.willful means intentional and by design.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.malicious means that the intentional acts were done out of cruelty,hostility,or revenge toward the owner of the property,even if the defendant did not know who the owner was.id.at.
as we review the bia conclusion that malicious destruction of property under massachusetts law is a cimt,we have no case law directly on point to guide us the government points to in the matter of m,bia,in which the bia found that a conviction for malicious destruction of property under oregon law qualified as a cimt.in that case,the petitioner had slaughtered another man hogs with an axe.id.at.the bia emphasized that the oregon statute require d a motive manifested by the elements of malice and wantonness.id.at.drawing on that language,the government reads matter of m as standing for the broad principle that destruction of property is always a cimt where a showing of malicious intent is required.but matter of m predated the categorical approach the bia thus ultimately looked at the particular facts of the petitioner crime and determined that it was base,vile,and depraved.id.today,under the categorical approach,we must examine only the inherent nature of the criminal statute the particular circumstances of the defendant acts and convictions are.maghsoudi,at.because the bia holding in matter of m was dependent upon the facts of that case,and the bia was not purporting to decide that malicious destruction of property categorically involves moral turpitude,we find matter of m to be of limited value.
against that backdrop,we turn to the bia decision in this case.the bia began by applying the categorical approach and determined that.laws ch,is a divisible statute,because it punishes both malicious and wanton destruction of property.the bia found that wanton destruction of property is not categorically a cimt,because it may be done with indifference or recklessly.the bia then moved to the modified categorical approach,examined palmeira record of conviction,and determined that his conviction was of the malicious variety a finding that palmeira does not contest.because,under massachusetts law,a malicious act must be done with a state of mind of cruelty,hostility or revenge,morris,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,the bia agreed with the ij that malicious destruction of property is a cimt.the bia cited two of its cases standing for the proposition that an analysis of an alien intent is critical to a determination regarding moral turpitude.in re fualaau,bia see also matter of franklin,bia among the tests to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.
the bia analysis could certainly have been more thorough,but the agency did not reach an unreasonable conclusion.idy,at.palmeira primary argument on appeal is that there is no requirement under.laws ch,that the defendant have malice toward the owner of the property nor toward any other person,and hostility toward an inanimate object is not enough to render a crime morally turpitudinous.massachusetts case law,however,directly contradicts palmeira claim.the massachusetts courts have required evidence of an act by design hostile to the owner even if unknown of the property,meaning that the defendant need not know the owner identity but must be motivated by cruelty,hostility,or revenge toward an individual,not just an inanimate object.morris,at finding insufficient evidence to establish that the defendant was motivated by hostility,cruelty,or vengeance toward the property owner see also,commonwealth tawfik,p,wl,at,finding that the defendant charged acts were committed with the requisite malice because they were motivated by hostility toward the property owner commonwealth mcgovern,finding sufficient evidence that the defendant destructive acts were hostile to the owner of the property.a mindset of cruelty,hostility,or revenge toward an individual satisfies the vicious motive or corrupt mind requirement of the cimt definition.maghsoudi,at.
of course,in order to qualify as a cimt,malicious destruction of property must also involve an act that is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong.id.this statute,unlike others we have examined in the cimt context,does not require any risk of physical harm to another person,which can render conduct inherently reprehensible.see idy,at reckless conduct under new hampshire law is necessarily reprehensible because its definition includes an aggravating factor serious bodily injury nguyen reno,cir assault in the second degree under connecticut law is a cimt because it requires serious physical injury maghsoudi,at indecent assault under massachusetts law is a cimt cabral,at being an accessory after the fact to voluntary murder under massachusetts law is a cimt.nor does the crime involve fraudulent conduct.see jordan de george,the phrase crime involving moral turpitude has without exception been construed to embrace fraudulent conduct.but palmeira has given us no reason to doubt the bia conclusion that an intentional,destructive act committed with malice that is to say,out of cruelty,hostility,or revenge toward an individual is necessarily reprehensible and thus satisfies the cimt definition.maghsoudi,at.
indeed,the cases palmeira has cited as involving acts that do not,in his opinion,rise to the level of a cimt only underscore the reasonableness of the bia decision.in mcgovern,the defendant broke into a parking lot booth,was observed tearing it apart,and caused extensive damage,including breaking a window,knocking in a door,pulling electrical wiring off the ceiling of the booth,and throwing various items onto the street.at.in commonwealth cimino,the defendant went on a shooting round,during which he and a group of his friends took turns shooting a bb gun at and thereby breaking the windows of seventeen parked cars,id.at.because the defendant and his accomplices had deliberately aimed the bb pistol and hit their targets,the court found the crime wilful and malicious.id.at.the conduct at issue in mcgovern and cimino could reasonably be classified as morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong.maghsoudi,at see also idy,at.
one can certainly argue that destroying property,even with an evil mindset,is not necessarily base,vile,or depraved behavior,or the sort of crime that should render an individual deportable.but that determination is not ours to make on a de novo basis we must defer to the bia conclusion that a crime involves moral turpitude if that conclusion is neither arbitrary nor contrary to law.idy,at.malicious destruction of property in massachusetts requires gratuitous,excessive violence purposefully designed to intimidate and overpower,or destructive acts that were by design and hostile to the owner of the property,whoever that may have been.commonwealth redmond,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.that is a high bar the bia conclusion that such conduct necessarily implicates moral turpitude was neither arbitrary nor contrary to law.idy,at.
iii.conclusion 
we find no particular satisfaction in our conclusion today.it is unfortunate that palmeira admitted to sufficient facts to support a finding of malicious destruction of property under the misapprehension that doing so would allow him to avoid the very immigration consequences that he now faces.there is also,as the bia recognized,a real potential for hardship in this case,given that palmeira has two united states citizen children who may soon be separated from their father.but because the bia conclusion was a reasonable interpretation of the ina,we deny palmeira petition for review.id.
the police report states that the foyer and kitchen floor of maria house were covered in glass when the arresting officers arrived.during his removal hearing,palmeira testified that he slapped some glasses or bottles on a table,causing them to fall and break,though the police report suggests that there was glass in the door that shattered when palmeira kicked it in.the police report states that the foyer and kitchen floor of maria house were covered in glass when the arresting officers arrived.during his removal hearing,palmeira testified that he slapped some glasses or bottles on a table,causing them to fall and break,though the police report suggests that there was glass in the door that shattered when palmeira kicked it in.
on april,palmeira filed a motion with the state court to vacate his conviction.palmeira has not mentioned that motion in his brief on appeal we therefore can only assume that it has not been granted.on april,palmeira filed a motion with the state court to vacate his conviction.palmeira has not mentioned that motion in his brief on appeal we therefore can only assume that it has not been granted.
