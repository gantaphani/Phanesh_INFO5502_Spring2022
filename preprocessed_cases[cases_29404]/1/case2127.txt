angie ortega brought this action for a declaration of nationality pursuant to a.the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion,and ortega appealed.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the government commenced removal proceedings against ortega in september during the proceedings,ortega claimed as a defense her status as a national of the united states.on april,while removal proceedings were pending,ortega filed a form application for certificate of citizenship.the chicago office of the former immigration and naturalization service ins denied the application twelve days later,without a hearing.ortega appealed the denial of her application to the office of administrative appeals aao.
on may,day after ortega filed her administrative appeal with the immigration judge ij terminated the removal proceedings with prejudice.the ij determined that she had established that she acquired citizenship through her united states citizen father alfredo ortega pursuant to g of the immigration and nationality act,ex.the government did not appeal the ij decision.
on february,the aao denied ortega administrative appeal with respect to her application for a certificate of citizenship.on march,ortega counsel filed a motion to reconsider and to reopen with the aao,which brought to the aao attention the evidence presented to,and ruling of,the ij.the aao,however,returned ortega fee and motion on april,and directed her to submit her request to the local district office that made the original decision.ortega her motion with the local district office on april,with this motion,she included a letter explaining that she originally had submitted her filing within the window provided in,but mistakenly had sent it directly to the aao.
over four years later,on august,the aao denied ortega motion as untimely.see,ex.c.in rejecting ortega motion,the aao first noted the requirement,under,to file a motion within thirty days.it then observed that,b y the applicant counsel own admission,the instant motion was sent erroneously to the aao on march,and was not properly filed with the chicago district office until april,almost two months after the issuance of the aao decision.the aao determined that the motion ortega had filed was not a motion to reopen according to the aao,the motion did not state new facts to be proved because the proceedings before the immigration court predated the aao decision in this matter.the aao continued,stating 
the instant motion is instead,at best,a motion to reconsider.a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy.a motion to reconsider a decision on an application or petition must,when filed,also establish that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision.whereas a i provides that a late motion to reopen may be excused in the discretion of cis where it is demonstrated that the delay was reasonable and was beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner,the regulations do not provide any discretion to accept an untimely motion to reconsider.as the instant motion constitutes,at best,a motion to reconsider,the aao can not consider whether the delay in filing it was reasonable or beyond the applicant control.the motion must therefore be rejected as untimely.

ortega then instituted this action in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on february.the complaint sought a declaration of nationality pursuant to a,which is set out in its entirety in the following discussion.the government moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to grant relief under a.see at.it argued that,
s ince the plaintiff first asserted her claim to citizenship during her removal proceedings,her status as a national arose by reason of,or in connection with removal proceedings.thus,under the plain language of the statute,th e district court d id not have jurisdiction to consider plaintiff claim of citizenship in this case.
id.at quoting a.
the district court granted the government motion.relying on the decision of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in department of homeland security,cir,the district court held that ortega had raised her claim of citizenship in removal proceedings prior to the time that she filed her application for citizenship.consequently,the issue of plaintiff citizenship arose by reason of,or in connection with her removal proceeding.at quoting a.
ortega timely appealed.
discussion 
our disposition of ortega appeal depends upon the meaning of a.therefore we start,as we must,with the language of the statute.see autry nw.premium,cir observing that the starting point in any case involving the meaning of a statute is the language of the statute itself internal quotation marks and citations omitted.section a of title states 
if any person who is within the united states claims a right or privilege as a national of the united states and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency,or official thereof,upon the ground that he is not a national of the united states,such person may institute an action under the provisions of section of title against the head of such department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the united states,except that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person status as a national of the united states arose by reason of,or in connection with any removal proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or any other act,or is in issue in any such removal proceeding.an action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the united states for the district in which such person resides or claims a residence,and jurisdiction over such officials in such cases is conferred upon those courts.
a emphasis added.
the government maintains that the plain meaning of a requires dismissal of ortega claim.it first observes that it was o nly upon initiation of removal proceedings that ortega assert ed citizenship.appellee br.accordingly,the government concludes,it is beyond question that ortega status arose by reason of,or in connection with her removal proceeding.id.
the government also notes that its position finds support in case law,specifically the fifth circuit decision in.in that case,rios,like ortega,had filed an application for citizenship while removal proceedings were still pending.as in ortega case,rios application was denied by the district director.and in both cases,after removal proceedings were terminated,the aao denied the petitioners appeals of the denial of their applications.when rios subsequently instituted an action under a,the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,and the fifth circuit affirmed.the fifth circuit concluded that the text of the statute supported the government position that the district court lacked jurisdiction.id.at.it explained that 
t he exception applies to claims of nationality raised in removal proceedings.it is the context of how the particular issue of citizenship arose rather than the mere timing of events that determines the applicability of a.the exception precludes jurisdiction over rios citizenship claim because his claim arose by reason of,or in connection with his removal proceeding the issue of rios citizenship that forms the basis of his claim here originates,at the least,in connection with the removal proceedings.
the application process is,as rios argues,a proceeding separate from the removal proceedings.but a does not apply depending on whether the proceedings are separate rather,it applies when the particular citizenship issue arose in the removal proceeding.that is,the exception
