westmoreland coal company,challenges an administrative law judge alj decision,affirmed by the benefits review board the board,to award black lung benefits to westmoreland former employee,jarrell cochran.because the award of benefits is supported by the record and accords with applicable law,we must deny westmoreland petition for review.
the black lung benefits act the act,et,entitles former coal miners totally disabled by pneumoconiosis commonly called black lung disease to benefits.the act implementing regulations define pneumoconiosis as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.a.

a claimant under the act can establish pneumoconiosis with the aid of a regulatory presumption of pneumoconiosis,id.a,or with evidence including,biopsies,and medical opinions from physicians exercising sound medical judgment,notwithstanding a negative,id.t o determine whether a preponderance of all of the evidence establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis,aljs must consider all the relevant evidence together.island creek coal compton,cir.
for at least sixteen years between and,cochran worked in west virginia coal mines,most recently for westmoreland.at the mines,cochran had various jobs above and below ground working as a roof bolter,mechanic,shuttle car operator,general laborer,and truck driver.cochran also has a history of smoking,approximately one pack of cigarettes per week for twenty years.
in february,cochran filed this claim for black lung benefits the department of labor awarded benefits,payable by westmoreland,and westmoreland requested a formal hearing before an alj.
in november,the alj conducted a hearing on cochran claim.and in may,the alj issued a detailed decision awarding cochran benefits.the alj found that the evidence failed to establish that cochran suffers from clinical pneumoconiosis but did establish that cochran suffers from legal pneumoconiosis.regarding this legal pneumoconiosis finding,the alj chose to credit rasmussen medical opinion over the opinions of george zaldivar and kirk hippensteel,explaining that the latter two primarily concentrated on explaining why the miner did not suffer from clinical pneumoconiosis which does not preclude legal that their conclusions were inconsistent with the scientific evidence set forth in the preamble of the act implementing regulations.further,the alj found that cochran is totally disabled as a result of his pneumoconiosis,and thus awarded cochran black lung benefits.
westmoreland appealed to the board,and in june,the board concluded that the alj permissibly used the preamble to evaluate conflicting medical opinions about the cause of cochran disability and that substantial evidence supported the alj ultimate finding of legal pneumoconiosis accordingly,the board affirmed the alj decision and order awarding benefits.westmoreland now petitions this court for review.
in black lung benefits cases,this court review of the board order is limited.harman,at internal quotations omitted.we review whether substantial evidence,such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,consolid.edison of nlrb.supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the board and alj are rational and consistent with applicable law,harman,at internal quotations omitted.as long as substantial evidence supports an alj findings,w e must sustain the alj decision,even if we disagree with it.id.quoting smith chater,cir.we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for that of the alj but rather must defer to the alj evaluation of the proper weight to accord the evidence,including conflicting medical opinions.id.quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,westmoreland argues that the evidence derived from rasmussen testimony was insufficient to support the alj finding of legal pneumoconiosis the alj failed to consider all the relevant evidence by improperly discounting certain expert opinions and the alj erroneously interpreted the preamble to create an irrebuttable presumption of pneumoconiosis.we address each argument in turn.
we turn first to westmoreland contention that rasmussen testimony was insufficient to support the alj finding of legal pneumoconiosis.specifically,westmoreland compares rasmussen testimony here to his testimony in another black lung case,united states steel mining,director,office of workers compensation programs,cir jarrell,in which this court found that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support an award of benefits.
in jarrell,the alj had awarded survivor benefits to a claimant relying solely on rasmussen testimony that i t is possible that the coal miner death could have occurred as a consequence of his pneumonia superimposed upon his chronic lung disease,including his occupational pneumoconiosis and occupationally related emphysema and i t can be stated that the coal miner occupational pneumoconiosis was a contributing factor to his death.id.at,emphasis added.this court reversed,holding that the mere possibility of causation was insufficient to support finding a nexus between a claimant pneumoconiosis and his death.
here,by contrast,rasmussen did not testify that coal mine dust or cigarette smoke could be the cause of cochran respiratory impairment.nor did he testify that he did not know or could not tell whether coal mine dust contributed to cochran respiratory impairment.rather,rasmussen testified that both coal mine dust and cigarette smoke were causes,affirmatively asserting cochran coal mine dust exposure must be considered a significant contributing factor to his what should be described as overlap syndrome and that he does have at least legal pneumoconiosis,caused in significant part by coal mine dust exposure.
rasmussen stated that the effects of coal mine dust and cigarette smoke exposure are independent,but additive,with those smokers or who are exposed to the greatest amount of dust exhibit ing the greatest impairment.and as the alj correctly explained,the act does not require that coal mine dust exposure be the sole cause of a claimant respiratory impairment.see b defining arising out of coal mine employment as significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coal mine employment see also consolidation coal swiger,app x,cir affirming award of black lung benefits in case in which experts found that claimants disability was caused in part by smoking and conceded that it was difficult to differentiate between the effects caused by smoking and the effects caused by coal mine dust.
given rasmussen expert opinion,the alj conclusion that cochran is due in part to coal mine dust exposure was supported by substantial evidence.thus,the board did not err in affirming the alj finding of legal pneumoconiosis.
westmoreland also argues that the alj erred by improperly discounting the opinions of zaldivar and hippensteel in favor of rasmussen.specifically,in deciding to credit rasmussen opinion over zaldivar and hippensteel,the alj stated that 
much of the pertinent dispute between these medical experts centers on the etiology of the miner emphysema.in this particular regard,the opinions of hippensteel and zaldivar are inconsistent with the scienti
