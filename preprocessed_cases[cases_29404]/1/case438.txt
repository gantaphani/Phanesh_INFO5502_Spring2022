on february,the board of immigration appeals bia ordered that andley bobby boakai,a native and citizen of liberia,be removed from this country because he had not met his burden to show he was eligible for relief under the convention against torture cat.more than a year later,boakai filed with the bia an untimely motion to reopen his case on the ground that he had been provided ineffective assistance of counsel.the bia rejected the motion to reopen as untimely filed without reaching the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.boakai now seeks review of the bia orders denying cat relief and reopening.he argues that we must order the bia to consider the motion to reopen on the merits,and that this consideration will compel a finding of ineffective assistance,in turn requiring the bia to reopen the case and perhaps ultimately to grant him cat relief.
concluding that we lack jurisdiction to review any of the issues boakai has presented,we deny the petition for review.
boakai entered the united states on a visitor visa in and later was granted temporary protected status,see,because of unstable conditions in liberia.in may,more than a year after his temporary protected status expired,boakai was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and armed assault with intent to murder he was sentenced to seven to ten years imprisonment.removal proceedings were commenced against him on the ground that he was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.see id.a f id.a a iii.
by virtue of his conviction and sentence,boakai was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.see id.b a ii and b i rendering aggravated felons ineligible for asylum id.b b rendering aggravated felons sentenced to at least five years imprisonment ineligible for withholding of removal.he conceded removability and applied only for relief under the cat.after hearing testimony,an immigration judge ij concluded that boakai had met his burden for cat protection.
for reasons not relevant here,the bia remanded the case to the ij.the ij found for a second time that boakai had met his burden for cat protection,and the government appealed.boakai had notice of the government appeal to the bia and filed a pro se brief.his former counsel did not file a brief.
in the february,order,the bia vacated the grant of cat relief and ordered boakai removed.the bia found that boakai had failed to meet his burden under the cat,in part because the state department country profile for liberia indicate d that supporters of and office holders in the former liberian regime can generally now return to liberia without harm.
boakai did not then file a petition in this court for review of the february,bia removal order.nor did he file a motion to reopen with the bia within the ninety days allowed.see c.rather,he filed a pro se habeas corpus action in the district court that court appointed present counsel on october.
on april,more than six months after present counsel appointment and more than a year after the bia removal order,boakai,through counsel,filed a motion to reopen before the bia.the motion argued that the cat issue should be reopened because boakai had been deprived of effective assistance of counsel in that his attorney did not file a brief with the bia seeking to uphold the ij order boakai motion to reopen did not acknowledge that it was filed late,nor did it present any argument that the lateness should be excused,thus likely waiving the argument before this court.see xu gonzales,cir.
in its august,order denying the motion to reopen,the bia noted that t he respondent does not even acknowledge that the motion is untimely.it nonetheless assumed,in boakai favor,that he was relying on equitable tolling to excuse his missing a filing deadline.the bia correctly noted that if the equitable tolling doctrine is available at all the petitioner must first show that he has acted with due diligence.jobe ins,cir en banc.the bia held 
such due diligence is not present here.the respondent acknowledges that he received notice of our earlier decision in march.current counsel was appointed to represent the respondent in october.however,the pending motion was not filed until april.there is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here.the pending motion is,therefore,denied.
internal citations omitted.the bia thus never reached the merits of the ineffective assistance of counsel issue 
in the wake of the bia decision on the motion to reopen,boakai filed another habeas petition in the district court.that petition was transferred to this court pursuant to the real id act of,div.b,c,stat,codified at note requiring district courts to transfer existing habeas cases involving challenges to final administrative order s of removal to the court of appeals,which is to treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review.in his briefs to this court,boakai argued that the purported ineffective assistance of counsel requires that this court order the bia to reopen proceedings he also said the bia abused its discretion when it failed to consider his untimely motion to reopen on the merits.boakai focused on the latter claim at oral argument.
petitioner first obligation is to establish that this court has jurisdiction.the court also must itself address the question of its own jurisdiction,even when petitioner fails to address the point adequately global naps.dep t of telecomms.energy,cir.
under id act law,we lacked jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.a c.under that regime,we clearly would have lacked the power to review both the initial bia order denying cat relief and the bia denial of the motion to reopen the real id act altered the landscape,granting limited jurisdiction to courts of appeals over petitions for review from aggravated felons who have been denied cat relief.under the new provision,the courts of appeals have jurisdiction if such petitions raise constitutional claims or questions of law.see real id act a a iii,stat.at codified at a d see also enwonwu gonzales,cir.on these facts,however,that limited jurisdictional grant does not help boakai.
review of denial of motion to reopen 
the narrow issue before us is whether,assuming arguendo that equitable tolling is available,boakai challenge to the bia decision not to grant such tolling presents a question of law within the meaning of the real id act.the answer is plainly no.boakai does not question the legal standard for equitable tolling.the only issue he raises before us is one of fact.see niehoff maynard,cir holding that equitable tolling determinations involve a mixed question of law and fact,but that to the extent the district court decision as to tolling hinges on factual determinations,appellate review proceeds as it would for a pure question of fact.the bia relied on a factual determination that boakai had not exercised due diligence,and boakai simply disagrees,arguing that he did in fact exercise due diligence.we have no jurisdiction to review this sort of challenge to a denial of a motion to reopen 
review of denial of cat claim 
there is also no jurisdiction to review boakai challenge to the bia order denying relief under the cat.that is because boakai challenge to the denial of cat relief rests wholly on his ineffective assistance claim.the ineffective assistance claim,because it was not timely presented,was never ruled on by the bia,and so boakai has not exhausted the issue.hernandez reno,cir.both before and after the real id act,this court lacks jurisdiction over a claim if the alien has not exhausted all administrative remedies as to that claim d.the tenth circuit,on nearly identical facts,also held that there was no jurisdiction.galvez pi√±eda gonzales,cir refusing to consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim after an untimely attempt to raise the issue with the bia because untimely filings with administrative agencies do not constitute exhaustion of administrative remedies.
because the ineffective assistance claim is not before us,as to the cat issue we are presented with no constitutiona
