arthur held,a longtime coal miner and smoker,sought benefits under the black lung benefits act,et,from his former employer consolidation coal company consol.an administrative law judge granted held benefits,concluding that he had established the existence of pneumoconiosis by the weight of medical opinion evidence.the benefits review board affirmed and consol petitioned for review.because the alj failed to weigh all the relevant evidence together,as required by our decision in island creek coal company compton,cir,and because the alj gave undue weight to the opinion of held treating physician,tsai,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
for at least years,arthur held had occupational exposure to coal mine dust.he also has a cigarette smoking history of pack per day for at least years.held retired from coal mine employment in and filed his first application for federal black lung disability benefits.an alj denied his application and he took no further action concerning the claim.
held filed a new application for benefits on march.consol was identified as the responsible coal mine operator.the parties stipulated to a material change in condition and the alj conducted a hearing.
the alj first noted that held could not establish pneumoconiosis under either subsection a or a of because there was no biopsy evidence and no applicable presumptions.the alj then considered the evidence,which consisted of chest that had been examined by numerous physicians.only of the readings,by physicians,were positive for pneumoconiosis.readings,by multiple physicians,were negative.the alj concluded that the most recent evidence was in conflict and thus he could not find that the miner established cwp coal workers pneumoconiosis through evidence alone.
the medical opinion evidence was also in conflict.tsai,jaworski,and garson opined that held had developed a totally disabling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a result of both his exposure to coal dust and his smoking history.renn,morgan,and fino testified that held health problems resulted from his smoking history,and not his exposure to coal dust.the alj credited the opinions of tsai,jaworski,and garson,discredited the opinions of renn,morgan,and fino,and concluded that held had established the existence of pneumoconiosis by the weight of medical opinion evidence.after determining that held had satisfied the other elements necessary for a black lung claim,the alj awarded benefits to held,which were to commence from the month in which held filed his claim.consol appealed to the board,which affirmed.consol now petitions for review in this court.
we review the board order by undertaking an independent review of the record to determine whether the alj findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence.island creek coal company compton,at.de novo review applies to the legal conclusions of the board and alj.id.at.
consol argues that the alj should have weighed all relevant evidence of pneumoconiosis together.a provides four ways in which a claimant can establish the presence of pneumoconiosis.the regulation states,in relevant part,that 
a a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis may be made as follows 
a chest conducted and classified in accordance with may form the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis 
a biopsy or autopsy conducted and reported in compliance with may be the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis 
if the presumptions described in,or are applicable,it shall be presumed that the miner is or was suffering from pneumoconiosis.
a determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician,exercising sound medical judgment,notwithstanding a negative,finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in 
in island creek coal company compton,we were presented with the issue of whether aljs could consider evidence adduced under each of the four subsections of section a in the disjunctive.we rejected the board argument that if the evidence relevant to one subsection supported a finding of pneumoconiosis,other evidence bearing on a different subsection could be ignored.instead,we decided that the proper method is to weigh the different types of evidence together to determine whether a preponderance of all of the evidence establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis.compton,at see id.concluding that the plain meaning of b requires the weighing of all relevant evidence together rather than merely within discrete subsections of a.
in its opinion in this case,the alj stated that the third circuit had held that evidence under each of the four methods of establishing the disease must be considered together.citing penn allegheny coal williams,cir.having outlined the proper approach,the alj proceeded to ignore it.at no point in its opinion did the alj weigh the evidence from the different subsections of section a against one another.and the board,in reviewing the alj,only considered whether the alj finding was supportable under section a 
the alj failure to weigh all the evidence together raises precisely the concern expressed in compton that the existence of pneumoconiosis could be found even though the evidence as a whole clearly weighed against such a finding.at.while there was not a perfect consensus as to the evidence,the vast majority of readers over time had found the results to be negative.see readings are negative,by multiple physicians,all of whom are,and either in radiology or internal medicine,or both.moreover,those physicians who gave negative readings had,as a group,far more impressive credentials than those who rendered positive readings.see id.of the physicians who gave a positive reading,only were,was an,and had unknown qualifications.if the alj had properly balanced the evidence against the medical opinion evidence,which was itself mixed,its conclusion may well have been different thus,as we did in compton,the proper course for this court is to vacate the alj decision and remand to allow the alj to weigh all of the relevant evidence together.
consol also objects to the alj treatment of tsai.specifically,consol asserts that the alj erred by inflating tsai credentials and by giving him special deference based solely on his status as held treating physician.tsai was held treating physician for ten years.the alj noted that,as a treating physician,generally tsai opinion would ordinarily be entitled to more weight.the alj proceeded to accord tsai opinion a great deal of weight,because he had conducted ten annual examinations of held.
the alj treatment of tsai was inconsistent with the law.in grizzle pickands mather and,cir,we clearly stated that n either this circuit nor the benefits review board has ever fashioned either a requirement or a presumption that treating or examining physicians opinions be given greater weight than opinions of other expert physicians.id.at see also compton,at an alj may not discredit a physician opinion solely because the physician did not examine the claimant.that statement is still true today.thus,while tsai opinion may have been entitled to special consideration,it was not entitled to the great weight accorded it by the alj.
the alj treatment of tsai also deviated from the facts of this case.the alj listed tsai among the physicians with the best credentials.see of the six physicians providing post reports,tsai,jaworski,renn,and fino have the best credentials,with garson and morgan,although having impressive credentials,falling a tier below.jaworski,renn,and fino were all who had specialty training in pulmonary medicine.while tsai is board certified in internal medicine,he has no specialty training in pulmonary medicine and has no special radiological training reading.his credentials do not compare to the other top physicians,and the alj should not have listed him among them as having comparable credentials.even were it permissible to accord a physician opinion greater weight simply due to his treating status,which it is not,treating status would still be irrelevant when considering the relative credentials of the various physicians 
conclusion 
for the forgoing reasons,we vacate
