pamela terrell appeals the tax court order dismissing her petition for lack of jurisdiction.the tax court found it lacked jurisdiction because terrell filed her petition more than ninety days after the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner sent her a notice of final determination notice.terrell argues that because the commissioner did not send the notice to her last known address,as required by e,this court should find her petition timely as it was filed within ninety days of the internal revenue service irs mailing the notice to her correct address.
the irs was on notice that its address on file for terrell was incorrect,because the united states postal service usps had already returned three of the irs prior mailings to terrell as undeliverable.the irs thus had a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to search for her correct address,but failed to do so before sending the notice.the notice sent on april,was,therefore,not sent to her last known address,and became null and void when it was subsequently returned as undeliverable.terrell ninety days began to run only after the irs the notice to her correct address on may.because terrell filed her petition with the tax court within ninety days of the may notice,her petition was timely.accordingly,we reverse the ruling of the tax court and remand for a determination of the petition merits.
factual and procedural background 
after receiving an assessment for over in unpaid taxes,terrell filed a request for innocent spouse relief form dated september,with the irs.she listed her address on her request the north richland hills address.soon after filing the form,she moved to a new address the dallas address.terrell claims that she submitted a change of address form to the usps,but the record contains no evidence of this apart from terrell declaration.
on december,the irs mailed a confirmation of receipt of form to the north richland hills address,but usps returned the letter to the irs as undeliverable on january.on february,the irs mailed two preliminary notices of determination denying relief.the preliminary notices informed terrell that she had thirty days to request a review of the determination from irs appeals.on february,usps returned the preliminary notices to the irs as undeliverable.
after the irs did not receive a request to review the determination from terrell,it mailed the notice on april,to the north richland hills address,denying relief and stating that terrell had ninety days to petition the tax court for review.on april,terrell filed her tax return,listing the dallas address as her current address.on may,the notice was returned to the irs as undeliverable.after receiving the returned notice,the irs searched its database,found the dallas address,and the notice to that address on may.the notice the irs sent to the dallas address was identical to the one sent on april,and also listed april,as the date of determination of terrell claim.terrell admits that she received the notice in.terrell filed a petition with the tax court on july.
the commissioner moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction because terrell had not filed it within ninety days after april.terrell responded that the limit began to run only in when she actually received the notice,or,in the alternative,that the tax court should exercise its equitable power to allow her petition.after a hearing,the tax court dismissed terrell petition for lack of jurisdiction.
the tax court found that,as a court of limited jurisdiction lacking general equitable powers,it was barred from hearing terrell claim because her petition fell outside the limit of e.it held that terrell had not carried her burden of demonstrating that the notice was not sent to her last known address.the tax court found that the irs acted with reasonable diligence to ascertain her last known address,because,after the usps returned the first notice,the irs searched its database,found terrell current address,and a copy of the notice.the tax court therefore found that terrell had to file her petition by july,and because she did not file the petition until july,it lacked jurisdiction.terrell timely filed this appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review this court has jurisdiction to review final decisions of the tax court under a.
this court appl ies the same standard of review to decisions of the tax court that it appl ies to district court decisions.green comm r,cir citing arevalo comm r,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo.id.citing arevalo,at.clear error exists when this c ourt is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.id.citing streber comm r,cir.
iii.discussion 
terrell argues that the irs did not mail the notice to her last known address,because the irs failed to conduct a reasonably diligent search for her address before mailing the notice.she asserts that her petition period did not begin until she received the notice,making her petition timely and giving the tax court jurisdiction 
our inquiry into these claims proceeds in two parts.first,we must determine whether the irs failed to exercise reasonable diligence in locating terrell correct address and thereby failed to send the notice to her last known address as required by e.second,if we find that the irs failed to exercise reasonable diligence and the notice was therefore not sent to her last known address,we must determine the date on which terrell petition period started in order to assess whether the tax court had jurisdiction over her petition.
validity of the april,notice 
an individual who requests innocent spouse relief may petition the tax court and the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine the appropriate relief available not later than the close of the day after the date the irs mails,by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer last known address,notice of the secretary final determination of relief available to the individual.e a.although there is a dearth of cases interpreting,the tax court and the parties correctly cite to analogous cases from irc and concerning the irs sending tax deficiency notices see estate of cowart nicklos drilling,i dentical terms within an act bear the same meaning.in both and,the tax court has no jurisdiction over a taxpayer petition if it is not filed before the deadline.
in order to have jurisdiction to hear a taxpayer petition,e requires that the taxpayer request review within ninety days of the irs sending notice to the taxpayer last known address.e a.the tax court jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.ferguson comm r,cir.however,whether the irs properly sent notice to the taxpayer last known address,thereby starting the response period,is a question of fact that we review for clear error.ward comm r,cir.
l ast known address is a term of art and refers to that address which,in light of all relevant circumstances,the irs reasonably may consider to be the address of the taxpayer at the time the notice of deficiency is mailed.mulder comm r,cir emphasis added citing brown comm r.this court has interpreted mulder as standing for the rule that absent a subsequent,clear and concise notification of an address change,the irs is entitled to consider the address on the taxpayer most recently filed return as the taxpayer last known address.pomeroy united states,cir citations omitted.this rule,however,does not dispense with the requirement that the irs must use reasonable diligence to determine the taxpayer address in light of all relevant circumstances.when the irs knows or should know at the time of mailing that the taxpayer address on file may no longer be valid because of previously returned letters,reasonable diligence requires further investigation.see mulder,at finding no due diligence where two letters posted shortly before the notice were returned undelivered and the notice itself was neither delivered nor returned see also pomeroy,at given that the two returned letters put the irs on notice that the taxpayer had changed his address,the irs in mulder should have done further investigation prior to sending the deficiency notice
