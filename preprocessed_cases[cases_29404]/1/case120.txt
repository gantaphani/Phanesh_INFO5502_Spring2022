when federal statutes are conditioned upon the prior exhaustion of administrative remedies,time limits are often an essential part of the regulatory scheme.in this case,the plaintiff managed to trip over not one,but two,of these temporal benchmarks.accordingly,the district court dismissed his complaint.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
inasmuch as this appeal follows the granting of a motion to dismiss,we draw the relevant facts from the plaintiff complaint.see jorge rumsfeld,cir.although none of these facts has been tested in the crucible of trial,we assume their accuracy.we draw additional facts from documentation incorporated by reference in the complaint.see id.at.
in august of,giovanni rivera díaz,who had been recruited by caribbean temporary services cts,embarked on new employment with humana health plans of puerto rico,humana.the plaintiff odyssey at humana would prove to be his supervisor,solciré cardona,orchestrated his ouster roughly six weeks later.the plaintiff attributes this adverse employment action to disability discrimination and retaliation,alleging that cardona repeatedly mocked his diabetes and mental conditions.
according to the complaint,the means to cardona end was a rigged test.the plaintiff says that his colleagues were given the answers to the test in advance,but he was not.this artifice ensured that the plaintiff would post a comparatively low score.when the test results predictably conformed to this devious design,humana cashiered the plaintiff.the denouement occurred on september,the day after the examination the plaintiff was given his walking papers.
the next stop for the plaintiff was the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.there,less than two weeks after his firing,the plaintiff charged humana with discriminating against him on account of his disability the first charge.after six and months,the eeoc notified the plaintiff that it was terminating its processing of his charge and that he had the right,during the next ninety days,to initiate a civil action based on the first charge.a copy of this letter the first letter was simultaneously sent to the plaintiff attorney.it explicitly warned that a failure to file suit within ninety days would result in the loss of any right to bring a suit based on the first charge.
this warning went unrequited.although the plaintiff filed a new administrative charge the second charge against humana some two months after the first letter issued,he did not sue.consequently,the period lapsed.
the second charge covered the same time frame as the first charge and reiterated the original claim of disability discrimination.withal,it added a new twist the second charge limned a claim for retaliation a subject not mentioned in the first charge.the second charge requested the prompt issuance of a letter without further investigation.the eeoc obliged,transmitting such a notice the second letter within two months of the filing of the second charge.
less than a month after the transmittal of the second letter but over four months after the transmittal of the first letter the plaintiff repaired to the federal district court.he sued humana,cardona,and cts,asserting claims of discrimination and retaliation under the americans with disabilities act of ada,see a,a,and supplemental claims under puerto rico law 
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that both of the plaintiff ada claims flouted separate statutory time limits.the district court agreed.the discrimination claim,it held,should have been but was not brought within ninety days of the plaintiff receipt of the first letter.see rivera díaz humana health plans of,wl,at.the retaliation claim suffered from a different infirmity the second charge,on which it was premised,had been filed too late with the eeoc.see id.accordingly,the court dismissed both federal claims with prejudice and,without a jurisdictional anchor,declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.id.at see c.
the plaintiff moved for reconsideration,beseeching the district court to apply equitable tolling to save his untimely claim.relatedly,the plaintiff argued that his filing of the second charge with the eeoc within ninety days of his receipt of the first letter was the functional equivalent of an agency reconsideration of the first charge.the district court disagreed,explaining that the plaintiff should have presented these arguments in his opposition to the motion to dismiss,but had failed to do so.see rivera díaz humana health plans of,wl,at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
because the plaintiff principal assignments of error rest on the premise that his efforts to exhaust his administrative remedies should be deemed timely,we begin with an overview of the exhaustion process.
claims of employment discrimination and retaliation under the ada are subject to the procedural requirements of title vii of the civil rights act of,to.see a,c loubriel fondo del seguro del estado,cir.under this procedural regime,litigation is not a remedy of first resort for either discrimination or retaliation cases.jorge,at internal quotation mark omitted.rather,a plaintiff must first exhaust his administrative remedies.this task embodies two key components the timely filing of a charge with the eeoc and the receipt of a letter from the agency.id.
the first component contemplates the filing of an administrative charge within either or days of the offending conduct,depending on the particular jurisdiction in which the charged conduct occurs.see bonilla muebles alvarez,cir.the shorter of the two periods is the general rule.mohasco silver,see e.the longer period is available only in deferral jurisdictions,in which a state or local agency has authority to grant or seek relief from the allegedly illegal practice.e see mohasco,at.
with respect to most charges of discrimination,puerto rico is a deferral jurisdiction in which the longer filing period applies.see bonilla,at.but with respect to claims of retaliation,the commonwealth department of labor is empowered only to grant or seek relief for charges stemming from an opposition to sexual harassment.see.this case has nothing to do with sexual harassment.consequently as the parties agree the day window applies with respect to the plaintiff retaliation claim.see e.an unexcused failure to meet this deadline forecloses recourse to the courts.see jorge,at.
the second component is equally straightforward.upon receiving a letter,a putative plaintiff has ninety days to file suit.see loubriel,at.failure to do so creates a temporal barrier to the prosecution of an ada claim.see id.
with this primer in place,we turn to the dismissal of the first charge.as the district court explained,the plaintiff received the first letter on april,but did not file suit until september.this was well after the period for filing suit had expired.
the plaintiff does not gainsay this time line but,rather,notes that the filing period is not jurisdictional and is subject to equitable tolling.see irwin dep t of vets.affairs.in his view,the period should have been tolled until the issuance of the second letter.
for their part,the defendants initially characterize any tolling argument as waived because the plaintiff waited until his motion for reconsideration to proffer it to the district court.while it is true that matters that are raised for the first time in a motion for reconsideration are usually deemed waived,see,dillon select portfolio serv g,cir,everything depends on context.in this instance,we need not explore the context in exquisite detail as the plaintiff contention plainly fails on the merits.
we review a district court refusal to apply equitable tolling for abuse of discretion.see abraham woods hole oceanographic,cir.generally,equitable tolling attaches only when a claimant misses a filing deadline because of circumstances effectively beyond her control.bonilla,at.the doctrine is to be employed sparingly and should be reserved for exceptional cases.see id.at.
the court below did not abuse its discretion in holding that this case does not fit within those narrow confines.the plaintiff identifies no circumstance
