the united states coast guard appeals the district court rejection of its interpretation of the regulatory scheme governing the issuance of coastwise endorsements to vessels.intervenors seabulk energy transport,and seabulk petroleum transport,collectively seabulk also appeal.we find that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine over the district court ruling on the issue appealed by the coast guard because it would bind the agency on remand.on the merits,we hold that the district court erred in rejecting the coast guard interpretation of its own regulations.we further find that the district court erred in ordering seabulk to provide security during the course of these proceedings.the judgment of the district court is therefore reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.
in its role as the federal agency with the power to administer the vessel documentation laws,the united states coast guard regulates the issuance of certifications to vessels that participate in nautical trade between points in the united states,also known as coastwise trade.this responsibility includes overseeing a network of intersecting federal statutes that govern vessel specifications and safety and that also seek to protect the economic interests of shipyards.the earliest statute on point,the jones act,was enacted in and restricts the coastwise trade to vessels built in the united states and owned by citizens.formerly at app.in and,congress passed and then amended the second proviso to the jones act,which was intended to shore up the act protections for shipyards,stat.second proviso currently codified as amended at b and a,stat.amendment.the jones act and its second proviso govern the coast guard issuance of certifications that license vessels for coastwise trade coastwise endorsements.
in addition to these general statutory provisions,the oil pollution act of opa provides that all oil tankers in the coastwise trade must be equipped with double hulls by a specified date.a.absent a double hull,vessels are not eligible to operate in united states waters.a.among the vessels that needed to be brought into compliance with the requirements of opa was the seabulk trader the trader,a tanker owned by seabulk and used exclusively in the coastwise trade.in order to conform to opa,the trader needed a double hull installed,and seabulk sought to conduct the work on the hull in china.however,under federal law,in order to maintain a coastwise endorsement a vessel must not be rebuilt outside the united states.pursuant to coast guard regulations,g,seabulk submitted a request to the agency for a preliminary determination of whether the work it proposed to undertake on the trader would constitute a foreign rebuilding and therefore disqualify the vessel from maintaining its coastwise endorsement.seabulk also requested a determination of whether proposed alterations to the vessel ballast tanks would violate the port and tanker safety act of.based upon the information seabulk provided,the coast guard issued a preliminary determination that the work would not constitute a foreign rebuilding or a prohibited foreign installation of required ballast tanks.
following that issuance,the trader did undergo work in china,which consisted of the construction of an internal hull that would provide the vessel with a full double hull and reconfiguration of the vessel ballast tank system.in total,the work constituted of the trader steelweight.at.after completion of the work,seabulk applied for and was granted a coastwise endorsement for the trader.at.
in considering whether the trader could maintain its coastwise endorsement following the work on its hull,the coast guard applied the federal regulation created to implement the second proviso.the regulation sets out a comprehensive scheme for determining whether work done in a foreign shipyard constitutes a foreign rebuilding.work can constitute a foreign rebuild if it consists of either the addition of a major component to a vessel hull the major component test or the construction of a considerable part of the hull the considerable part test.
in applying the regulation,the coast guard determined which test applied to the work done on the trader by assessing whether the added steel composed a separable component before its addition,in which case it would be assessed under the major component test,or was not a discrete separable component,in which case it would be assessed under the considerable part test.this parsing between separable and inseparable additions the distinction was therefore integral to the agency interpretation of both the major component and the considerable part tests.
the coast guard concluded that while the work on the trader hull brought it under the auspices of the jones act,the construction did not qualify as a foreign rebuild under the applicable administrative regulations.ruling that the installation of the inner hull on the trader did not consist of the addition of a separable component,the coast guard assessed the installation of the inner hull under the considerable part test.because the added portions of the hull did not exceed the threshold of added steelweight set forth in the administrative regulation,b,the coast guard determined that the trader had not been rebuilt foreign and therefore could be issued a coastwise endorsement.
appellees,the shipbuilders council of america shipbuilders,brought suit in the district court to challenge the coast guard issuance of a coastwise endorsement to the trader.shipbuilders contended that the tanker was no longer eligible to operate in the coastwise trade because the work done in the chinese shipyards constituted a foreign rebuild of the ship in violation of the second proviso of the jones act,b and included a foreign installation of segregated ballast tanks in violation of the port and tanker safety act of.seabulk,as the owner of the trader,intervened in the district court action.
in the district court,shipbuilders challenged the coast guard grant of the coastwise endorsement as arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,and contrary to law under the administrative procedure act.the coast guard claimed that the district court had no jurisdiction over the jones act claim because the language of the statute was so broad as to preclude meaningful judicial review.the district court disagreed,finding that the language of the jones act did not preclude the court review.the district court then addressed the two determinations by the coast guard that the trader was not rebuilt foreign and that it did not improperly have segregated ballast tanks installed in a foreign shipyard.
the district court declined to give deference to the coast guard stated rationale for not applying the major component test to the work on the trader,finding that deference was not warranted because the analysis employed by the agency was not grounded in the language of the statute and the regulation merely restated the language of the statute and thus the coast guard could not claim the greater deference usually given to an agency interpreting its own regulations.finding that the coast guard interpretation of the major component portion of the regulation was not persuasive,the district court struck it down.
the district court did defer to the agency interpretation of the considerable part test.however,it found the coast guard application of its interpretation to the trader to be arbitrary and capricious.the district court determined that the agency did not provide an adequate explanation for its finding that the trader was not rebuilt foreign under the considerable part test.the steelweight of the work performed meant that whether the trader was rebuilt foreign was a question left to agency discretion,b,but the agency provided no reasons for its ultimate conclusion.
the district court also considered the third question of whether the agency ruling on the installation of the trader segregated ballast tanks should be upheld.again declining to defer to the agency,the district court concluded that the agency interpretation of the statute was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.however,that holding was not dispositive,because the court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence in the record concerning the actual work on the trader to allow for a determination of whether the coast guard issuance of a coastwise endorsement could be upheld.all three questions were therefore remanded back to the agency for further proceedings.
in addition,the district court instructed the coast guard on remand to revoke the trader coastwise endorsement,citing a lack of support for issuance of the endorsement in the record.at.the revocation was based upon the district court legal conclusions concerning the agency application of the major component and considerable part tests,which are necessary predicates to any analysis of the record.
before conducting any further proceedings,the coast guard appealed to this court.seabulk,which had intervened in the case below,also filed a notice of appeal.
the initial question in this case concerns the scope of our jurisdiction on appeal.under federal law,an appellate court may only review a final order of a lower court.however,the collateral order doctrine recognizes an exception to final order limitation for certain decisions of the district court that i conclusively determine the disputed question ii resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and iii are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d quotations omitted.the circuits that have considered the question have uniformly held that a decision of a district court remanding a case to an agency for further consideration does not qualify as an appealable collateral order.occidental petroleum sec,collecting cases.however,most circuits have also made an exception to this blanket rule when it is the federal agency itself that brings an appeal.courts permit the agency to appeal because the agency is bound on remand by the standard articulated by the district court and so would not have a chance to appeal from any further judgment,making the district court determination effectively unreviewable by the agency on remand.id.at collecting cases.
this circuit has followed suit,reviewing collateral orders that remand cases to agencies if a district court order remanding a case to an administrative agency will be effectively unreviewable after a resolution of the merits.highlands conservancy,norton,cir quoting hanauer reich,cir colvin sullivan,cir the district court remand order was a final judgment,allowing appeal under.where a district court order would be effectively unreviewable by an agency on remand,the order is a final decision for purposes of.norton,at.
an agency appeal of a district court decision makes that decision final for the purposes of and permits a reviewing court to properly exercise its jurisdiction over the matter.in this case,seabulk seeks to bring a broader challenge to the district court decisions,arguing that in addition to the court holding on the major component test,we should review the considerable part determination and the segregated ballast tank determination.the coast guard specifically does not challenge the district court rulings on those points,having determined that such issues will be addressed on remand to the agency.appellant br.at.we find that review of those issues,not raised by the agency or related to the agency appeal,exceeds the scope of our jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.
seabulk also raises a challenge to the revocation order issued by the district court.seabulk br.at.this challenge falls outside the limited scope of the agency appeal in this case.the coast guard appeals only the district court ruling that the agency improperly applied the major component test in determining that the trader was not rebuilt foreign.see appellant br.at.the coast guard did not include the revocation order in its statement of the issues on appeal,appellant br.at,and therefore the agency has not properly raised this issue before us.
we need not reach the question of whether such an order could be appealed by a party other than the agency,because the order itself is not final and therefore not properly subject to review under the collateral order doctrine.our precedent indicates that,when the agency appeals,our jurisdiction encompasses the district court determinations that are both binding on the agency and would be essentially unreviewable in a later court proceeding.norton,at holding that where the district court ruled on a decision of the agency made as the exercise,by delegation,of the agency power,the entire decision was within the circuit court jurisdiction upon appeal by the agency.the revocation order is premised upon the district court finding that the agency had not provided sufficient reasons to support its issuance of a coastwise endorsement because the agency remains free to evaluate the trader eligibility on remand using the correct legal standard,the revocation order is not final and therefore can not be reviewed under.
under law,a vessel becomes ineligible for a coastwise endorsement,and therefore ineligible to participate in the coastwise trade,if significant work is performed on the vessel in a foreign shipyard.the statute requires that when a ship is rebuilt,the entire rebuilding,including the construction of any major component of the hull or superstructure,be done in the united states.construction that violates this provision invalidates the vessel eligibility for a coastwise endorsement because the vessel is no longer deemed to have been built in the united states.see a.
administrative regulations implementing the jones act state that a vessel is rebuilt foreign when any considerable part of its hull is built upon or substantially altered outside of the united states.this is assessed under two tests set forth in the regulation.the major component test qualifies a vessel as rebuilt foreign if a major component of the hull or superstructure not built in the united states is added to the vessel.a.the considerable part test qualifies a vessel as rebuilt foreign if the work performed abroad constitutes more than percent of the vessel discounted lightship weight.b.a vessel may,but need not,be deemed rebuilt foreign by the agency if the work constitutes between and of the discounted lightship weight.b.
in its analysis,the coast guard ruled that the work done on the trader should not be evaluated under the major component test because the installation of the steel to form the inner hull did not constitute a separable major component of the ship.analyzing the work under the considerable part provision of its regulation,the agency found that the trader was not rebuilt foreign under and was thus entitled to retain its coastwise endorsement.the district court,in assessing the coast guard determination,accorded the agency interpretation of the implementing regulation only skidmore deference.this standard gives respect to an agency determination where the form and content of the ruling gives it power to persuade.skidmore swift.finding the reasoning unpersuasive,the district court declined to uphold the agency interpretation as a permissible construction of the regulations implementing the jones act.because we find that the district court erred in its application of the skidmore standard,we reverse its holding on this point.
for purposes of our review,when agency action is at issue,we generally review the agency action from the same position as that of the district court.fisherman dock,brown,cir.in this case,we therefore apply the administrative procedure act apa and seek to determine,as did the district court,whether on the administrative record the agency action was in violation of the apa provisions.id.
the district court found that the coast guard interpretation of the major component provision,holding that it applied only to separable components,was offered only in informal opinion letters.because the district court held that the distinction was not present in either the statutory language or the administrative regulations,it accorded only skidmore deference to the agency interpretation.at.under th
