in this action for disability ltd benefits pursuant to an employee benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,plaintiff diane moon appeals the district court denial of her motion for judgment on the administrative record.the district court held that the final decision of defendant unum provident corporation unum to uphold the termination of moon disability benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.we disagree and reverse.
background 
unum is moon disability insurer.moon insurance plan the plan is sponsored by her employer,borgess medical center borgess.moon and unum agree that the plan vests unum with discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.the plan defines disabled as follows 
you are disabled when unum determines that 
you are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury and 
you have a or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury.
at the outset,we note that this appeal concerns only the first requirement of this definition.
moon worked in a clerical capacity in the admitting department at borgess.her title was business associate and her duties included typing,filing,and some writing.on june,moon was admitted to borgess as a patient due to the onset of various incapacitating symptoms associated with hypertension,unusually high blood pressure.the symptoms included severe chest pains.the primary diagnoses,as reported in a clinical resume prepared by doctor stephen reagan,were atypical chest pain chronic stage iii hypertension and hypertensive emergency.in addition,moon was diagnosed with a history of hypertensive emergency and hypertensive crisis.the clinical resume observed t his is a woman with a history of frequent admissions to the hospital for chest pain,who presented to the emergency room with acute onset of left sided atypical and typical features of acute coronary disease.reagan consulted doctor robert lapenna,moon hypertension specialist,and the two agreed on june,that after nearly a week in the hospital,moon could be discharged.however,the conditions of discharge were that moon receive vna home care and a prompt followup with her primary care physician,stacy watson,with whom reagan discussed the case.id.
chronic hypertension and the related severe chest pains it caused were not moon only health problem.since,she had suffered from thumb pain.in september,moon primary care physician,watson,described moon thumb existed in both severely limiting her activity.
after her hospitalization in late june,moon condition did not improve.watson determined that moon was not able to return to work and on september,moon filed a claim with unum for long term disability benefits.the claim form cited uncontrolled hypertension as the reason for moon inability to work.in the physician statement portion of the claim form,watson explained that moon suffered from severe labile hypertension and,secondarily,from bilateral thumb pain which severely limit s her activity.watson further expressed concern about moon excessively high blood pressure and advised that moon could not exert herself by climbing stairs or remaining active for hours without frequent resting.id.at.finally,watson prohibited moon from lifting more than pounds and engaging in strenuous activity with any prolonged walking.id.
on the basis of watson diagnosis and instructions,unum granted moon claim,citing a disability onset date of june.in its december,letter,granting moon claim,unum did not explain whether it granted benefits because of the hypertension,the thumb pain,or both.on september,unum reversed course and terminated moon benefits as of august.in a letter to moon,unum asserted that according to its reviewing physician,there is no medical data to support restrictions and limitations preventing you from returning to work in your own occupation.in reaching this conclusion,unum relied on its own review of moon medical records,including reviews performed by a clinical consultant and by physicians employed by unum.
specifically,unum reviewing physician,steven feagin,reported that t here is nothing presented to objectively support impairment that would produce limitations or necessitate restrictions from light work activities.feagin cited an august,exercise study in which moon demonstrated what feagin described as poor exercise tolerance for her age.id.nevertheless,feagin concluded that moon performance still equates to sustained light work on a basis.id.feagin further noted that according to moon cardiologist,janos gellert,moon did not have a cardiac problem.however,in a june,letter to watson,gellert specifically lists as a risk factor the fact that moon has hypertension which is not easy to control.regarding moon thumb pain,feagin concluded that there was no objective basis to view moon as unable to work with accommodations.
after her ltd benefits were terminated,a michigan worker compensation hearing officer granted moon worker compensation benefits,finding that moon bilateral thumb pain rendered her unable to do the and writing that was a necessary component of her job in the borgess admitting department.
in october,moon filed an administrative appeal of unum termination of her ltd benefits.in the appeal letter,watson urged unum to reconsider,concluding moon is essentially disabled,and because of her ongoing medical problems,is absolutely not able to return to work.despite multiple cardiac,radiological,and other evaluations,a source for her extremely labile and symptomatic hypertension has not been determined.medication is only moderately effective in controlling this and,in essence,she is not able to hold down a full time job.in fact,she is unable to do most of her daily activities around the house because of the hypertension causing chest pain and.to this letter,watson attached medical records from cardiologist robert lapenna,who had examined moon in september,and from watson herself,who had examined moon in march and june.watson records establish that moon severe hypertension did not show a likelihood of abating.in addition,watson patient chart notes reflect that moon suffered bouts of depression,for which watson prescribed,and sharp fluctuations in blood pressure.lapenna records establish that moon had typical exertional angina,but her coronary arteries were functioning normally lapenna recommended that cardiac rehabilitation proceed.lapenna,however,did not suggest that moon was able to work.
as it had with respect to moon initial claim,unum assigned feagin the task of reviewing moon appeal submissions.on november,feagin reported that his prior impressions are unchanged and reinforced by appeal submissions.feagin reasoned that moon records disclosed no objective evidence of cardial pulmonary or hypertensive impairment producing limitations or necessitating restrictions that would preclude regular sustained sedentary or light work endeavors.id.on the basis of feagin review and report,unum denied moon appeal on november.beginning on february,and continuing through may,moon,through counsel,submitted new medical evidence to unum,including evidence adduced at moon worker compensation hearing and at a social security benefits hearing moon prevailed on her social security claim and began receiving disability benefits from the social security administration in may.feagin again was charged with reviewing moon case.and again feagin concluded that moon had failed to present any objective evidence to support her claim that she was unable to work.specifically,feagin observed it is of note that the deposition of watson reveals rather unorthodox opinions with respect to the impact of hypertension on work capacity.
the deposition to which feagin referred was testimony watson gave at moon social security hearing.watson testified there that she was moon primary treating physician and had treated moon for severe hypertension.watson explained that with respect to moon bilateral thumb pain,she would defer to james smith,who was the specialist treating moon for that condition.watson testified that moon suffered from labile hypertension,which she described as blood pressure that goes up and down i t fluctuates and is mostly uncontrolled.in watson view,the labile hypertension had a significant impact on moon ability to work on an ongoing basis.specifically,watson explained moon labile hypertension is unable to be controlled.we can find no other underlying etiology causing it that we can treat.she on multiple medications,but,yet,she still has fluctuations of very high blood pressure that cause severe headaches,even chest pains.she really not able to function being up on her feet like going to the grocery store for any prolonged length of time because of this blood pressure problem.watson determined that moon should sit or stand for not more than one or two hours out of an day.watson reached this conclusion on the basis of routine blood pressure checks performed between and by watson and other doctors,see,which demonstrated dangerously elevated blood pressure levels.
due to these dangerously high blood pressure levels,watson insisted that moon spend most of her time reclined.watson repeatedly asserted that watson could not work.when asked is there any way in your mind that a person could work with this blood pressure,watson responded no.watson further explained that the level of stress at moon job was essentially irrelevant because moon blood pressure fluctuated dramatically wherever she happened to be.finally,watson laid out her reasoning under questioning 
question let suppose that her hands were no problem,that the stuff that smith been treating her for was any issue.would you or would you not think that solely on the basis of her blood pressure,she was disabled from regular,employment no matter how light,no matter how simple 
answer yes.
q you would 
q just to give you some examples,one of the jobs that social security uses is what called a security monitor.you watch closed circuit tvs and,if you see something on the tv like an intruder or something,you call the authorities.you got to be there six or eight hours,but,literally,all you doing is watching tv.do you think she could do that 
a again,just a sitting position for her can make her blood pressures rise to the point where she has significant side effects,and,i do believe that she could sit for a period.
q even with standard breaks and a lunch and that sort of thing 
a even with those,i do believe so.
q okay.and,your opinion then is that this has been the case since,i think you said,december of,is that right 
q is there anything else that you can think of that would help a judge understand the nature of this problem and why it disabling that we have covered 
a in her case,we do know why she has this.we have tried every means possible to get it under control,and,although the medication that we have can help alleviate some of those side effects,in and of itself,the medication can cause side effects such as sedation,confusion,so,no matter what we do with her,even if we treat what we can treat,which is not completely effective,she gets side effects from what we use to treat her as well.
q okay.anything else you can think of to add,doctor 
a i think this lady really would like to work if she could.she really does have a strong work ethic,and,she wants to provide for her son.she just simply is not physically able no matter what she has tried,and,she been willing to undergo any tests we have asked her to undergo,and,we simply ca determine a cause for her problem.
the social security administrative law judge alj found that moon allegation of intractable and debilitating labile hypertension with chest pain is credible.further the alj concluded moon impairment prevents her from sitting,standing,or walking for prolonged periods or concentrating upon tasks moon is unable to perform her past relevant work.id.
despite watson detailed testimony and the alj findings,feagin concluded that moon second appeal submissions presented no new objective information.feagin rejected watson conclusion that moon was unable to perform light sedentary work.specifically,feagin found no reason to conclude that moon could not stand or sit because,in contrast to watson formulation that moon blood pressure typically increased when she was sitting or standing,one typically sees higher pressures in the supine position.feagin relied upon an examination of moon performed by mark at the request of borgess,the defendant in moon worker compensation proceeding.feagin points out that a blood pressure measurement taken by in the may,examination reflects a higher blood pressure level in the supine position than in the sitting position.thus,feagin concluded that the social security alj was therefore flawed in his acceptance of the unsupported contention that the hypertension prevented prolonged sitting,standing,or walking.feagin was similarly unswayed with regard to moon bilateral thumb pain.feagin report for unum did not mention that in the discussion section of his may,report,stated diane has chronic severe hypertension,which has been refractory to multiple medications.please note hypertension means high blood pressure and should not be equated with emotional anxiety or tension.she is apparently intolerant of calcium channel blockers,which cause flushing.her blood pressure control is not optimal the blood pressure currently is not well controlled almost one year following her last day of work which implies her occupation is not causing the hypertension.
based on feagin determinations,unum upheld its termination of moon ltd benefits by letter dated july.just over two months later,on september,moon filed a complaint in the western district of michigan under erisa,et.moon moved for judgment on the administrative record.after hearing arguments on april,the district court denied the motion and affirmed unum final decision upholding the termination of moon ltd benefits.moon then filed this appeal.
ii.standard of review 
in an erisa benefits case,we review de novo a district court decision to deny a motion for judgment on the administrative record,spangler lockheed martin energy,cir.the general rule is to review a plan administrator denial of erisa benefits de novo.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.however,where,as is the case here,a plan vests the administrator with complete discretion in making eligibility determinations,such determinations will stand unless they are arbitrary or capricious.id.our review is confined to the administrative record as it existed on july,when unum issued its final decision upholding the termination of moon ltd benefits,wilkins baptist healthcare,cir holding that the district court and the court of appeals are limited to reviewing the administrative record as it existed when the plan administrator made its final decision.if the administrative record so limited can support a reasoned explanation for unum decision,the decision is not arbitrary or capricious.williams int l paper,cir.
nevertheless,merely because our review must be deferential does not mean our review must also be inconsequential.while a benefits plan may vest discretion in the plan administrator,the federal courts do not sit in review of the administrator decisions only for the purpose of rubber stamping those decisions.as we observed recently,t he standard does not require us merely to rubber stamp the administrator decision.jones metropolitan life ins,cir citing mcdonald life ins,cir.indeed,d eferential review is not no review,and deference need not be abject.mcdonald,at.our task at all events is to review the quantity and quality of the medical evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.id.in performing that task with respect to moon case,we conclude that the record can not support a reasoned explanation for unum decision.see williams,at.
iii.discussion 
moon primary claim for ltd benefits is based on severe labile hypertension.watson cited bilateral thumb pain as a secondary debilitation and the parties make passing reference to the thumb pain issue in their briefs,but it is clear that our focus must be on moon hypertension.in any event,as we explain below,unum offered a reasoned explanation for terminating moon benefits to the extent they related to her thumb
