factual background 
alvarado was a permanent resident on a conditional basis due to her marriage to an american citizen,melecio villafranco.ordinarily,removal of the residency condition would require that the spouses file a joint petition.however,alvarado and villafranco separated,and he was unwilling to file a joint petition in fact,he completed an affidavit requesting withdrawal of his alien relative petition soon after their.to avoid deportation to her native country of mexico,alvarado was charged with establishing entitlement to a hardship waiver to excuse compliance with the joint filing requirement.in order to qualify for a hardship waiver under the good faith prong,alvarado had to prove that her marriage was entered into in good faith and that she was not at fault in failing to meet the statutory condition.see c b the central question considered by the immigration judge and later,the bia was whether alvarado and villafranco intended to establish a life together at the time they were married that is,whether,at the time of their union,they married in good faith.
at a hearing before an immigration judge,alvarado,her daughter,and a testified,and she presented documentary evidence to satisfy her evidentiary burden.alvarado explained that in august of,she fled to the united states with two of her children to escape an abusive relationship in mexico.alvarado initially moved in with her sister in corpus christi,texas,and was soon joined by her son.she met villafranco in when both lived in the same apartment complex.she became friends with villafranco,and he would often drive her to run errands and buy groceries.alvarado would share dinner with villafranco.villafranco assisted alvarado with the purchase of her house in.although villafranco was approximately years older than alvarado,she came to think of him as more than a friend.
when villafranco proposed marriage in,she did not hesitate to accept.although alvarado and villafranco were married on october,alvarado divorce from her first husband was not finalized until.her status was adjusted from a visitor to a permanent resident on a conditional basis on june,based upon her marriage to villafranco.
during their marriage,alvarado lived with villafranco,they bought groceries together,had meals together,and went to church together weekly.they held themselves out to be,and considered themselves to be,husband and wife.alvarado testified that villafranco moved in with her in and left her house in.alvarado stated that she outwardly professed her love for villafranco and did indeed love him.alvarado showed affection for villafranco publicly,holding his hand and kissing him.initially,alvarado felt affection towards villafranco.however,she contends that her feelings changed when villafranco began to drink heavily and acted inappropriately toward her daughter and her daughter friend.alvarado testified that she did not agree to marry villafranco for the purpose of obtaining immigration papers.
the government attempted to impeach alvarado testimony,over objection,with an affidavit executed by villafranco.in that document,villafranco stated,among other things,that he did not begin living with alvarado until and that she told him upon their separation that she did not love him.on,alvarado admitted that villafranco slept in his own bedroom while she slept in a bedroom with her daughter.
catalina chavez,a of alvarado,testified that she often saw villafranco take alvarado to and from work.chavez also stated that alvarado had surgery in and that villafranco accompanied alvarado to the hospital during this time.chavez explained that she had observed alvarado and villafranco hold hands and be affectionate with each other,and she considered them to be married.
gladys enriquez,alvarado daughter,testified that she recalled villafranco being a nice man who would drive her to school and drive her mother to work.enriquez stated that villafranco assisted the family in fixing the house and that villafranco was always there.enriquez also testified that villafranco was a drunk and acted inappropriately toward one of her friends.enriquez did not remember alvarado showing physical affection towards villafranco,but suggested that such affectionate conduct would be out of character for her mother.enriquez was approximately eleven years old when villafranco moved out of the house.
alvarado submitted several documents as exhibits,including a declaration of marriage,dated october,a divorce decree,dated december,seven affidavits from friends and attesting to the bona fide nature of the marriage applications for life insurance which reflect that alvarado and villafranco were designated alvarado hospital records indicating a designation of villafranco as spouse and emergency contact,and documenting his conduct explaining medical procedures to his wife internal revenue service receipts reflecting alvarado and villafranco status as married filing jointly utility bills for alvarado home sent to villafranco attention a school enrollment form for alvarado daughter naming villafranco as emergency contact a record of a cemetery plot purchased by villafranco using alvarado home address a written affidavit by alvarado and a letter from one of alvarado daughters discussing the marriage and its dissolution.
the government did not present any testimony at the hearing but submitted,ostensibly for impeachment purposes,the february affidavit executed by villafranco.there was no indication that villafranco was unavailable to testify.
on march,the ij issued an oral decision granting alvarado a good faith waiver to the joint petition requirement.after summarizing the evidence before him,the ij concluded that alvarado testimony was candid,specific,plausible,consistent with supporting documentation,internally consistent,and unembellished.the ij found that the testimony of alvarado,enriquez,and chavez was credible and that alvarado established that her marriage to villafranco was bona fide.the ij observed that the only evidence that cast doubt upon villafranco and alvarado good faith was the affidavit executed by villafranco.accordingly,the ij granted alvarado petition to remove the conditions on her residence.
the government filed an appeal with the bia.the government argued that,based on alvarado testimony,the evidence showed that she did not intend to establish a life together with villafranco.the government pointed to the affidavit testimony that alvarado and villafranco slept in separate bedrooms and that villafranco lived with alvarado for only one year.the government also argued that the circumstances surrounding the preparation of alvarado immigration papers specifically,that alvarado son assisted her were suspicious.
