ij decision 
on november,the ij issued an oral decision denying petitioner any relief.while finding that petitioner testimony about his experiences in cambodia was generally credible,the ij stated he needed to consider whether the facts,as related by respondent chreng,satisfied the elements in the definition of refugee.the first question was whether or not the events described by the respondent amount to past persecution.although finding that the petitioner had run into violent or potentially violent situations in connection with his political activities,the ij held that petitioner involvement in the september and,demonstrations did not show persecution,as the violence was not directed at him personally for the purpose of changing his political beliefs or punishing him.rather,the police were acting to break up a demonstration and regain public order.
however,chreng also described being arrested at his home following a speech in support of his political party and being detained for three days.in addition,chreng described a police search for him for the purpose of arresting him for what can only be described as a political motive based on the information the court has.the ij,therefore,said,the court is inclined to give the respondent the benefit of the doubt on the issue of past persecution and will so find.the ij went on to state that having found past persecution,that creates only the presumption of a fear of future persecution and the burden has shifted to the government to show a change of conditions that would rebut that presumption emphasis supplied.
the ij discussed and credited the department of state country conditions report for cambodia.according to the ij,this court notes that the situation in cambodia has changed significantly,in a political sense,from the situation that existed when the respondent was involved in politics four years ago.the ij quoted from the report section on human rights practices for the year that the government did not coerce or forbid membership in political organizations.political parties normally were able to conduct their activities freely without government interference the ij also quoted from a later section of the report describing the elections in which,for the first time,local level elections were held for the purpose of electing commune councilors for communes in cambodia.the ij noted that the sam rainsy party had won seats across those communes,and that while the people party was again victorious,they were required to share power with the other parties in all but of those communes.according to the report,the transfer of power to the newly elected councilors was smooth.the ij concluded on the basis of this report and for other reasons,the court finds that the government has successfully rebutted the presumption of a fear of future persecution.
while finding the government had successfully rebutted the presumption,the ij went on to note that when arrested and held by the government for three days in june of he chreng was not beaten or tortured and admittedly encountered no problems.the ij continued although the government was looking for him allegedly to arrest him in november of,there is no way of telling whether he would have been mistreated in connection with that arrest or whether the government had any legitimate basis for that arrest.the respondent did not stick around to find out so it is not just the report on country conditions that would support the conclusion that there is not an adequate basis to find objectively a fear,but there is also the fact that respondent,in personal persecution terms,was not treated in such a way as to suggest he would be tortured or killed because of his connection to the sam rangsi sic party.
the ij then stated,having made these findings,the court makes the further finding that the respondent chreng has not met his burden with regard to his eligibility application for asylum.accordingly,that application for asylum is hereby denied.the ij went on to
