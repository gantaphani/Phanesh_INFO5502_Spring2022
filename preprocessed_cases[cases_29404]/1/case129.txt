lucia maria bolieiro was the respondent in lengthy removal proceedings involving her reentry into the united states after her mandated removal.these proceedings culminated in her filing of a motion to reopen with the immigration judge ij that raised due process and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.after that motion and a subsequent motion to reconsider were both denied,she appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.relying on a set of regulations known collectively as the bar,d,b,the agency concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain her motion and dismissed her appeals.
in perez santana holder,cir,which we issue in conjunction with this opinion,we hold that the bar conflicts with the unambiguous language of the motion to reopen statute.see c a.as a result,the agency regulation,in the circumstances applicable to this petition for review,can not preclude bolieiro from vindicating her statutory right to seek reopening of her removal proceedings.although the government seeks to distinguish bolieiro case on the basis that her motion was filed outside the deadline set forth in the motion to reopen statute,the agency denials of perez santana and bolieiro petitions ultimately rest on the same basic rationale the bar prevents the agency from entertaining their motions to reopen.
under rules governing agency review,we are unable to substitute an alternative basis for the agency conclusion and therefore can not distinguish the two cases on the grounds the government now advances.thus,our holding in perez santana compels us to grant bolieiro petition,and we remand for further proceedings before the agency.
bolieiro removal proceedings have followed a long and winding road through the immigration system.this appeal,however,requires knowledge of only a relatively narrow set of facts.we briefly recount them.
factual background 
in,bolieiro entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident lpr.after living in the country for many years,she pled guilty to a controlled substance offense in new hampshire superior court on january.the next year,on april,immigration and naturalization services ins initiated deportation proceedings against her although the record of the initial phases of these proceedings is less than lucid,it seems that bolieiro appeared before the ij and expressed her intent to seek discretionary relief under former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina.see c,repealed by illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,title iii,b,stat.bolieiro was informed that she should file her application for relief by august,and the ij continued her case until december.
bolieiro never filed the application.on september,the ij found her deportable based on the record of her controlled substance conviction,and also deemed her request for c relief abandoned because of her failure to file her application by the prescribed deadline.mailed to her home address,the order of deportation was later returned to sender because bolieiro had moved without leaving a forwarding address.
despite the deportation order,bolieiro remained in the united states.she asserts that she became a confidential informant for immigration and customs enforcement ice in,and was placed under an order of supervision.she also claims that she married a citizen in who was abusive towards her.she reports that she is now divorced from this person.on january,she was arrested for domestic assault.this case brought her to the attention of immigration authorities once again and removal proceedings were initiated against her.
on february,bolieiro filed a motion to reopen before the ij,with the assistance of counsel.the motion was denied without prejudice because of its failure to conform with substantive and evidentiary requirements,and the ij directed bolieiro to refile a proper motion,accompanied by the appropriate fee and supported by an affidavit.
on march,bolieiro submitted another motion.the motion raised a variety of due process and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.the motion also contended that she was eligible for various forms of relief,including her abandoned application for c relief.the ij denied the motion on several grounds,including,inter alia,that the motion was untimely that she had failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for c relief and that she had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.after the ij denied her motion,bolieiro was deported from the united states on june.
sometime afer her removal,bolieiro reentered the country without authorization.after ice received a tip from a confidential source,federal agents arrested her on may.on june,she was indicted by a federal grand jury for unlawful reentry in violation of.she pled not guilty to this charge,and subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment.on february,the district court granted the motion and dismissed all charges against her.see united states bolieiro,d,wl,
recent proceedings before the agency 
with the aid of new counsel,bolieiro moved to reopen her proceedings before the ij on december.this motion raised a number of arguments,including that the conviction that was the basis of her removal had been vacated on constitutional grounds her former counsel had provided ineffective assistance and her deportation order was issued in violation of due process.the motion sought to reopen her proceedings pursuant to the motion to reopen statute.in the alternative,bolieiro appealed to the agency sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.in a supplemental filing,she further asserted that she was eligible for relief under the violence against women act vawa because she was a victim of domestic abuse.the filing noted that she had filed a with citizenship and immigration services uscis,an agency within the department of homeland security,as a precursor to obtaining relief under vawa.see part,infra.on january,the ij denied bolieiro motion,citing the bar and the bia opinion in matter of armendarez mendez,bia.see also d,b.based on those authorities,the ij concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion.the ij further rejected bolieiro due process arguments.petitioner filed a motion to reconsider with the ij on february,which was denied in a summary order.
bolieiro appealed both the denials of her motion to reopen and her motion to reconsider to the bia.during this time,uscis approved her vawa,thereby fulfilling a prerequisite for bolieiro to obtain relief under vawa.on may,the bia dismissed the appeals.the bia agreed with the ij that bolieiro motion must be denied for lack of jurisdiction,citing our prior opinion in pena muriel gonzales,cir,and the regulation.the bia did not expressly distinguish between the general provisions of the motion to reopen statute,and the special rule governing motions to reopen filed by individuals seeking relief under vawa,despite the fact that those provisions impose different requirements.the bia also concluded that due process did not require the reopening of petitioner proceedings in order to address the vacatur of her criminal conviction,because the denial of her motion would not result in a gross miscarriage of justice.see matter of c,bia.
after the bia dismissed her appeal,bolieiro timely petitioned for our review.

bolieiro motion to reopen and the applicability of the post departure bar 
timeliness 
bolieiro argues primarily that the bar conflicts with the plain language of the motion to reopen statute,c a.our opinion in perez santana exhaustively addresses that issue.there,we hold that the bar can not be used to preclude a noncitizen from vindicating his statutory right to a motion to reopen,slip op.at.we will not repeat the analysis that led to that holding here 
but bolieiro case contains a wrinkle not present in perez santana.the instant motion to reopen seeks vacatur of a removal order that was entered almost twenty years before the motion was filed.the motion to reopen statute contains a temporal limitation the motion to reopen shall be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.c c i.focusing on this provision,the government contends that there is no conflict between the immigration statute and the attorney general regulation,where bolieiro motions were untimely.the government suggests that because of its tardiness,bolieiro motion falls outside of the statute scope and thus ha s no statutory footing.accordingly,the argument goes,the motion must be construed as an appeal to the agency sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings at any time.see a the board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.id.b analogous regulation for ijs.
because the agency power to reopen proceedings sua sponte is not codified in statute and operates purely as a creature of agency discretion,see matos santana,at,the government further contends that even if the bar can not prevent a noncitizen from filing a motion to reopen pursuant to the statute,the agency retains the ability to apply the bar to any motion that falls outside the statute.several of our sister circuits have adopted this rule,despite also holding that the bar can not be applied to noncitizens invoking their statutory reopening rights.compare perez santana,slip op.at collecting circuit opinions,with ovalles holder,cir holding that bar may be applied to untimely motion to reopen,since such motion invokes statutory provisions that offer him no relief see also desai att y,cir stating that previous holding that bar conflicted with motion to reopen statute does not extend to cases like this one,where neither that statutory right nor congressional intent is implicated zhang holder,cir stating that agency retains the authority to limit that jurisdiction and define sua sponte reopening contours through,among other things,the departure bar.
whatever the merits of this argument,we can not address it here.under principles of administrative law,we must accept or reject the agency decision based on the rationale the agency provides.see wiratama mukasey,cir citing sec chenery.while alternative grounds for affirming the agency decision may be evident in the record,a court may not substitute its own rationale to justify the agency conclusion.see pina mukasey,cir stating that because the bia did not address that issue,we may not conduct our own de novo inquiry citing ins ventura.thus,the proper way to handle an agency error in the ordinary circumstance is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.ventura,at quoting.power light lorion.this principle is known as the ordinary remand rule.see castaneda castillo holder,cir.
here,the bia dismissal of bolieiro appeal was premised on its application of the bar,as the government acknowledged at oral argument.in applying the bar,however,the bia did not make a distinction between timely and untimely motions to reopen.instead,the agency enforced the blanket rule that all such motions were barred after the alien departure from the united states.in support of this conclusion,the agency cited b,which is the version of the bar applicable to motions before the ij,as well as the bia precedent opinion in matter of armendarez mendez.neither the regulation nor matter of armendarez mendez distinguishes between timely and untimely motions.the suggestion that bolieiro motion stands on different statutory footing than a timely motion appears nowhere in the bia analysis,or in the authorities it relied upon to dismiss her appeal if the agency wishes to articulate a more nuanced basis for rejecting her motion based upon her motion untimeliness,it may do so,but we decline to supply that basis on the agency behalf.see halo gonzales,cir a reviewing court must judge the propriety of administrative action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency,and that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.second alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
to sum up,in the companion case of perez santana,we reject the proposition that the bar precludes a noncitizen who has departed the country from vindicating her statutory right to seek reopening.as we have explained,given the basis for the bia decision in this case,bolieiro and perez santana cases both present the same issue whether the bar can prevent a noncitizen from invoking his or her statutory right to file a motion to reopen.we have concluded that it can not.because we must evaluate the agency refusal to consider bolieiro petition upon the grounds that it has proffered,and because the agency refusal to consider her motion rested on the same rationale as its refusal to consider perez santana,our holding in perez santana compels us to grant bolieiro petition as well 
this holding should not be construed as a judgment on whether bolieiro motion should be granted.we say only that the agency ground for refusing to consider her motion does not withstand scrutiny.on remand,if the agency offers an alternative basis for refusing to consider her motion,we will evaluate that basis if and when the case returns to us.
equitable tolling 
we do wish to correct a misapprehension on the part of the government because it will be important on remand.contrary to the government assertions,bolieiro motion does not seek to invoke the agency sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings,but rather her statutory right to seek reopening.although she acknowledges that the motion was filed more than ninety days after the entry of bolieiro order of deportation indeed,almost twenty years after,she contends that the time deadline should be equitably tolled in order to permit her to file a motion to reopen.equitable tolling applies as a matter of fairness where a party has been prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising her rights.iavorski ins,cir first alteration in original quoting johnson nyack,cir.by excusing tardiness,the doctrine permits a party to invoke the right that she would otherwise be unable to access.in other words,by contending that equitable tolling should excuse the untimeliness of her motion,bolieiro argument is directed at her statutory right to file a motion to reopen,not the agency sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.see singh holder,cir if an alien qualifies for equitable tolling of the time numerical limitations on a motion to reopen,the motion is treated as if it were the one the alien is statutorily entitled to file.ortega marroquin holder,cir to fall within the scope of the statute,ortega must show that the filing deadline is subject to equitable tolling,thereby excusing its lateness.
thus,bolieiro does in fact seek a statutory foothold for her motion to reopen.this is not to say that bolieiro attempt to invoke the statute will be successful,as we have not yet decided whether equitable tolling applies to the statute deadline,despite multiple opportunities to do so.see,romer holder,cir neves holder,cir it is also not clear that bolieiro would be entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline,even assuming that the deadline could be tolled.see jobe ins,cir en banc setting forth test used to determine entitlement to equitable tolling.but the government fails to engage with her argument when it contends that her motion necessarily falls outside the statute simply because it is untimely.the agency should not make a similar error on remand.romer,at remanding case for failure to consider applicability of equitable tolling and observing that agency ignore d romer argument,ignore d arguably applicable law,and cross ed the line from merely deficient to plainly arbitrary.
bolieiro vawa claims 
bolieiro also sought to reopen her removal proceedings under certain statutory provisions specific to survivors of domestic violence,due to the abuse she had suffered at the hands of her former citizen husband.under vawa,such individuals may seek unique versions of adjustment of status and cancellation of removal.both of these forms of relief offer a pathway for bolieiro to obtain lawful permanent resident status.see a permitting survivor of domestic violence to petition on her own behalf,otherwise known as,for adjustment of status id.b setting forth requirements for vawa special rule cancellation see also hamilton holder,cir discussing vawa cancellation ochoa artega att y,fed.app x,cir describing vawa processes different procedural requirements govern motions to reopen to the extent that the noncitizen seeks to obtain relief under vawa.if the motion seeks to reopen proceedings so that the movant can obtain relief under vawa,a ny limitation on the deadlines for filing a motion to reopen shall not apply.c c iv i.the provisions also require that the movant be physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion.id.c c iv iv.
noting that she was within in the united states when she filed her motion to reopen under the special rule,bolieiro argues that the bar is therefore inapplicable to her motion to the extent it seeks relief under vawa.the government responds that bolieiro was physically present in the country only because she had reentered unlawfully after having been deported.considering bolieiro motion,the government maintains,would unjustly reward her for violating the law,and the statute should not be read to permit such a result.the government also contends that bolieiro is ineligible for relief under vawa,and that her petition should be denied due to futility.
the bia did not address any of these arguments,instead citing the bar as its basis for refusing to consider bolieiro motion.the bia opinion did not even mention the motion invocation of both the general provisions of the motion to reopen statute,as well as those specific to individuals seeking vawa relief.the agency therefore failed to examine whether bolieiro motion,to the extent it seeks reopening to obtain relief under vawa,may stand on different footing from her invocation of the reopening statute general provisions.having already decided that remand is warranted,we need not dive into this vawa thicket.instead,we simply add those issues to the list of arguments that the agency may consider on remand.see campbell holder,cir s ince the board did not reach these issues,neither do we.guta tolossa holder,cir where a question is best resolved by the agency in the first instance,or is left primarily in the agency hands by statute,and the agency has failed to address that question,we generally must remand.
urging us to deny the petition nonetheless,the government invokes the rare circumstances exception to the ordinary remand rule,contending that bolieiro has no viable avenues to relief and that the outcome of her proceedings is foregone.see ventura,at t he proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.emphasis added see also hussain gonzales,cir declining to remand case to bia b ecause the result of a remand to the board is a foregone conclusion such that remand would amount to nothing more than a mere formality.we offer no judgment on the contours of this exception here,except to say that this case falls beyond them.the government futility arguments rely on complicated legal and factual issues that have been neither ventilated adequately before us,nor addressed by the agency.although we are not yet in a position to evaluate the merits of the government contentions,we can not say that bolieiro attempts to obtain relief are doomed.these circumstances counsel strongly in favor of remand.
for the reasons stated,we grant the petition for review,vacate the order of the bia,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

as an additional justification for the bar validity,the government contends that the regulation is a categorical exercise of discretion,reflecting the agency judgment possibly unreviewable that it should not consider motions to reopen filed by noncitizens who have left the country.setting aside the fact that the agency itself has not relied on this rationale to justify the bar,an exercise of discretion,categorical or otherwise,must remain consistent with the agency statutory authority.as our opinion in perez santana explains,the agency does not have the power to prevent a noncitizen from exercising a right granted by the statute plain language.stated differently,c asting the bar as categorical exercise of discretion does not cure the fact that it contravenes clear congressional intent.contreras bocanegra holder,cir en banc.as an additional justification for the bar validity,the government contends that the regulation is a categorical exercise of discretion,reflecting the agency judgment possibly unreviewable that it should not consider motions to reopen filed by noncitizens who have left the country.setting aside the fact that the agency itself has not relied on this rationale to justify the bar,an exercise of discretion,categorical or otherwise,must remain consistent with the agency statutory authority.as our opinion in perez santana explains,the agency does not have the power to prevent a noncitizen from exercising a right granted by the statute plain language.stated differently,c asting the bar as categorical exercise of discretion does not cure the fact that it contravenes clear congressional intent.contreras bocanegra holder,cir en banc.
