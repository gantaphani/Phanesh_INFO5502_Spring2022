opinion of the court 
jose cruz,a citizen of the dominican republic,was ordered removed from the united states based on his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude,as defined by the immigration and nationality act ina.the new jersey superior court subsequently vacated the conviction supporting cruz removal order,and cruz sought to reopen his immigration proceedings.the board of immigration appeals bia denied his motion to reopen on the grounds that it was untimely and this petition for review followed.
normally,we could easily affirm a discretionary decision of the bia denying a motion to reopen based upon untimeliness.in this case,there is no question that cruz filed his motion out of time.nor is there any question that the bia treated cruz motion to reopen as a routine one in which the only issue was lateness.we find,however,that the current situation presents anything but a normal motion to reopen that lends itself to a straightforward analysis.
cruz motion to reopen is based on a single argument because his conviction has been vacated,he is no longer subject to removal for committing a crime involving moral turpitude.the bia has adopted,and we have previously upheld,specific guidelines for considering whether an alien remains convicted under the ina even after a court has vacated the alien conviction.pinho gonzales,cir in re pickering,bia.in cases where the bia has found an alien conviction vacated for purposes of the ina,it has routinely considered this fact to be an exceptional situation that provides the basis for granting a motion to reopen sua sponte,without regard to the timing of the filing.curiously,in this case,the bia did not refer in any way to the distinctive aspect of cruz motion,namely,that a court had vacated his conviction.nor did it refer to pickering,let alone conduct an analysis under it as to whether cruz remained convicted under the ina.
we conclude that the bia should not have ignored the question of whether cruz is still removable by virtue of his vacated conviction.furthermore,we are not certain that we can address this issue ourselves because,under the ina,our jurisdiction to review a final order of the bia is restricted when an alien is removable by virtue of a conviction for moral turpitude.a c.thus,the scope of our jurisdiction depends on whether cruz remains removable due to his vacated conviction.this case includes a further analytical wrinkle because the government contends that,even if cruz is not convicted for immigration purposes,and our jurisdiction therefore not limited by a c,we lack the power to review the bia unfettered discretion to decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte.this last argument presents an additional layer of difficulty,but it is one that we ultimately need not explore.
our jurisdiction is the threshold issue in this case,and it is one beyond which the bia opinion,by virtue of its failure to consider whether cruz remains convicted for immigration purposes,prevents us from moving.without the bia view as to whether cruz still has the requisite conviction under the ina for his removal,we can not determine our own jurisdiction.principles of administrative law require us to remand this case to the bia to give it the opportunity to apply pickering in the first instance and to decide,based on the outcome of this analysis,whether it should exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen cruz case.nonetheless,we write precedentially because we believe our analysis to be instructive.
facts and procedural history 
jose cruz is a native and citizen of the dominican republic who became a lawful permanent resident of the united states on june.on september,cruz was arrested in union county,new jersey for promoting prostitution.he pled guilty to the offense in and was sentenced to two years of probation,which he served without incident.
near the end of,cruz traveled to the dominican republic to visit his family.upon his return to the united states at newark international airport on march,immigration officials placed cruz in removal proceedings,charging that he was inadmissible due to his conviction.because there was no question that promoting prostitution is a crime of moral turpitude under the ina,or that cruz had been validly convicted for this offense,the immigration judge ij ordered cruz removed from the united states at a merits hearing on january.the sole basis for the removal order was cruz conviction.cruz timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.
less than a month after the ij issued its removal order,cruz filed a petition for relief in new jersey superior court.cruz alleged that the attorney who represented him in his criminal proceedings provided ineffective assistance of counsel.specifically,cruz claimed that his attorney failed to advise him that a guilty plea could lead to his deportation,though he was fully aware of cruz status as a of the united states.moreover,cruz alleged that his attorney did not suggest that he apply for new jersey intervention program pti,though he was aware that,as a offender charged with a nonviolent offense,cruz would have been a good candidate for the program.
pti permits criminal proceedings to be postponed while a defendant completes a rehabilitation program.at the completion of this program,the charges against the defendant are dropped.admission into pti does not require the defendant to make an admission of guilt.see pinho,at outlining the details of pti.thus,pti provided cruz with a way of resolving the criminal charges against him without the adverse immigration consequences of a guilty plea.cruz petition for relief requested that his guilty plea and sentence be set aside so that he could apply for admission into pti.
on april,the superior court denied cruz application for relief,finding that cruz attorney had not provided ineffective assistance of counsel.the court believed that not pursuing pti was a strategic decision,not a failure on the part of cruz attorney.furthermore,because evidence showed that the union county prosecutor would have blocked cruz admission into pti even if he had applied,the court found that cruz could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel allegedly deficient performance.cruz appealed this decision to the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey.however,on april,before cruz appeal was decided by the new jersey courts,the bia affirmed without opinion the ij removal order.
on june,two months after the bia upheld cruz removal,the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey affirmed the trial court denial of relief.though the appellate division concluded that cruz received deficient representation during his criminal proceedings,it denied his ineffective assistance claim because cruz could not show he was prejudiced by his counsel deficiency.the court concluded that it was highly unlikely that cruz would have been admitted into pti in,given the policies of the union county prosecutor office when cruz was convicted.thus,the outcome of cruz criminal proceedings would have been the same,even if cruz attorney performed competently.
though cruz lost his appeal in the appellate division,he hoped that the acknowledgment by a new jersey appellate court that he received substandard representation would convince the new union county prosecutor that he deserved to be admitted into pti.cruz was correct,and the prosecutor,who was different from the county prosecutor in office when cruz was convicted,agreed to support cruz application for pti.in a july,letter,the union county prosecutor office informed the pti program that it backed cruz admission to the program.this letter alluded to three different reasons for why cruz should have his conviction vacated and should be admitted into pti he never had the opportunity to apply for pti before,due to his attorney deficient representation cruz behaved well during his probation and in the time since and he was scheduled to be deported cruz was subsequently admitted into pti and,on september,a judge in the superior court of new jersey vacated cruz guilty plea and conviction,subject to cruz successful completion of the pti program 
immediately after his conviction had been vacated,cruz requested a stipulation from immigration and customs enforcement ice to reopen his proceedings before the bia.ice denied this request on february,and,eight days later,cruz filed a motion to reopen his proceedings before the bia.among the materials that cruz provided the bia in support of his motion were a copy of the new jersey superior court order vacating his conviction,a copy of his brief before the appellate division of the superior court,the july,letter,referred to above,from the union county prosecutor office in support of cruz pti application,and an affidavit dated october,in which an assistant prosecutor in union county stated that her decision to approve cruz for pti was based strictly on the merits of his case.cruz argued that his conviction had been vacated based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,namely,his attorney deficient representation.cruz contended that,under pickering,this meant that he was no longer convicted under the ina and therefore no longer removable.consequently,his proceedings should be reopened in the interest of justice and as a matter of due process.
the bia denied cruz motion on may.its order stated,in pertinent part 
we find that the present motion must be denied because it is untimely.the motion was due on or before may,but it was not filed until february,so that it is more than months late.see c requiring motions to reopen to be filed generally within days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered.
we also find that the respondent has not demonstrated eligibility for any of the regulatory exceptions to the time and number restrictions on motions to reopen.see c.finally,we do not find that sua sponte reopening is warranted for any reason.see matter of,bia see also matter of,bia.
app.cruz timely petitioned for review of this decision on may.
ii.legal framework 
under the ina,conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude constitutes grounds for an alien removal from the united states.see a a i i a ny alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible and therefore ineligible to be admitted to the united states.id.a c establishing that an individual lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude is deemed to be a person seeking admission to the united states when reentering the country.where an alien conviction for such a crime is later vacated,the question that arises is whether the alien nevertheless remains convicted for purposes of the ina.see a a defining conviction under the ina.
the bia has established that when a court with jurisdiction vacates an alien conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,the alien no longer has a conviction under the ina.however,if a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings,such as for rehabilitation purposes or to avoid immigration hardships,the alien remains convicted for immigration purposes.in re pickering,at.we have previously upheld this distinction,finding it to be a reasonable interpretation of the ina.pinho,at.in pinho,we also established a categorical test for the bia to apply in determining whether an alien is convicted for immigration purposes under pickering 
to determine the basis for a vacatur order,the agency must look first to the order itself.if the order explains the court reasons for vacating the conviction,the agency inquiry must end there.if the order does not give a clear statement of reasons,the agency may look to the record before the court when the order was issued.no other evidence of reasons may be considered.
an obvious consequence of pickering is that a conviction that is vacated for immigration purposes may not provide the basis for an alien removal.a motion to reopen is the proper means for an alien who has been ordered removed due to a conviction to challenge his removal after that conviction is vacated.see ins,cir granting motion to reopen where conviction that supported petitioner deportation had been vacated based on defects in underlying proceedings ins,cir noting the bia position that the proper way to attack deportation based upon a subsequently vacated conviction is in a motion to reopen.without this procedural tool,an alien could be removed even after he is no longer convicted for immigration purposes,a result that would conflict with the central holding of pickering.although the government did not bring this to our attention,our research has revealed that the board has routinely been willing to overlook the untimeliness of an alien motion to reopen when a conviction supporting a removal order is vacated and urged to be invalid under pickering 
iii.discussion 
congress has explicitly granted federal courts the power to review any final order of removal under a.implicit in this jurisdictional grant is the authority to review the denial of a motion to reopen any such final order.patel united states attorney general,cir chow ins,cir.there are,however,certain situations in which provisions of a limit or eliminate our jurisdiction to review denials of motions to reopen.durant ins,cir assaad ashcroft,cir dave ashcroft,cir patel,at.
for example,if an alien is removable for having committed one of the offenses enumerated in a c,we lack jurisdiction to review a denial of a motion to reopen,except to the extent that it raises constitutional claims or questions of law.a c d mcallister attorney general,cir where a c applies,factual or discretionary determinations fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals entertaining petitions for review.sukwanputra gonzales,cir.two predicate facts are required for a c to apply.first,the petitioner must be an alien.second,the petitioner must be removable by reason of having been convicted of one of the offenses enumerated in a c.papageorgiou gonzales,cir.
the government contends that both factual predicates for the application of a c are present in this case because cruz is an alien and he was ordered removed for committing a crime of moral turpitude.since the bia decision to deny a motion to reopen is a discretionary determination that we review for abuse,borges gonzales,cir,the government argues that a c divests us of jurisdiction to review the bia decision.to the extent that we have jurisdiction under a d to review for constitutional or legal error,the government claims that cruz has raised no colorable legal issues in his petition for us to consider.
cruz concedes that,because he is an alien,the first predicate fact required to apply a c is present in this case.he contends only that the second factual predicate for the application of a c,that he is removable by reason of having been convicted of an enumerated unsatisfied.cruz argues that he is no longer removable for having committed an offense enumerated in a c because the new jersey superior court vacated his conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.
in order for us to decide whether a c limits the scope of our jurisdiction here,we must determine whether cruz remains removable by virtue of his vacated conviction.we would analyze this issue under the standards set forth in pickering and pinho.if we conclude that cruz is still convicted for immigration purposes,and therefore removable under the ina,we would review only the colorable legal or constitutional issues that cruz raises.a d.if,however,we find that cruz is no longer convicted under the ina,a c would not restrict our jurisdiction at all.
unfortunately,the bia opinion frustrates our ability to reach any conclusion on this issue.the bia decision gives no indication that the board considered whether cruz remained convicted for immigration purposes after the new jersey superior court vacated his guilty plea and conviction.the bia did not analyze whether cruz conviction was vacated due to procedural or substantive defects in the underlying criminal proceedings nor did it address whether the superior court vacated his conviction for rehabilitative purposes or to avoid the immigration consequences.the bia did not cite pickering
