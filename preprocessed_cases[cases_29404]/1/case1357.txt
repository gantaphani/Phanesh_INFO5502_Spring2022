the telecommunications act of the act requires that a local government denial of a request to place personal wireless service facilities be supported by substantial evidence,and not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.c b i ii c b iii.in this case,the board of supervisors of fairfax county,virginia the board rejected the application of new cingular wireless at t to build an foot telecommunications tower in a residential neighborhood,a decision which at t later challenged in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.the district court determined that substantial evidence undergirded the board decision,and that the board ruling did not effectively prohibit wireless services under the act.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
under the applicable fairfax county,virginia the county zoning ordinance,telecommunications facilities may be located in residential zoning districts only by special exception.see zoning ordinance,a.where,as here,a party seeks to build a telecommunications facility in a residential neighborhood it must submit a special exception application to the board.it is the board denial of such an application that is at issue here 
in addition to a special exception application,a party seeking to build a telecommunications tower that is not shown on the county comprehensive plan must submit a zoning application to the county planning commission.see.after determining whether the application substantially conforms to the county comprehensive plan,the planning commission makes a recommendation to the board,which can overrule the planning commission decision.id.while the planning commission made a recommendation that the board approve at t zoning application in this case,the board did not rule on that matter,and it is not at issue here.to provide a complete picture of the facts underlying this dispute,however,we note below the findings of both the planning commission and the board.
at t,contending that it could only provide limited and wireless services in the county fort hunt area,submitted a special exception application to the board and a zoning application to the planning commission to determine whether its proposal substantially conformed to the county comprehensive plan.the proposed facility,consisting of a foot tall storage shed and an foot tower disguised as a tree the tree monopole,was to be erected behind a masonic lodge in an otherwise residential neighborhood,approximately one hundred feet from nearby residences.

pursuant to zoning ordinance,the board may approve a special exception application only when the proposed facility is harmonious with and would not adversely affect the use of neighboring properties furthermore,the county policy plan,which comprises a portion of the comprehensive plan,states that new telecommunications facilities should be located on properties that provide the greatest opportunity to conceal the telecommunications facilities,and designed to provide the least visual impact on residential areas pol.plan obj.b i,set forth in br.of appellant at.
the board held a public hearing,and,based on its consideration of community opposition and the aforementioned zoning regulations,among other things,denied at t special exception application.in its ruling the board described the facts upon which it based its determinations that at t proposal did not conform to the county comprehensive plan or the standards for approval of a special use exception under the zoning ordinance 
the proposed facility is proposed to be located at a distance of only approximately feet from two of the neighboring residences e xisting vegetation on the proposed site is minimal on the northern and western sides of the building,there are concrete pads.on the eastern end of the proposed site there are a few trees and a small,grassy area with dense brush.otherwise,the remainder of the proposed site is paved with asphalt the proposed facility would extend feet above the closest tree.there are some existing trees located on adjacent property but those trees average only approximately feet in height the tree monopole clearly towers above the neighboring trees further,the proposed supplemental vegetation would not reach a sufficient height to minimize the visual impact of the proposed facility members of the community signed a petition opposing the proposed site and approximately community members attended a meeting to discuss their opposition to the proposed site.based on the addresses provided on the petition and meeting sheet,these community members live within approximately a radius of the proposed site the board took this community opposition into consideration as one of the many factors it considered

the fairfax board reached a reasonable decision under subsection b iii to deny at t application on the basis of a determination that the proposed telecommunications facility was not in harmony with the local zoning ordinance and the county comprehensive plan,that community residents were understandably opposed to the construction of a telecommunications tower in the middle of a residential area,and that the proposed treepole facility would be highly visible at the proposed site and would depress local property values.
