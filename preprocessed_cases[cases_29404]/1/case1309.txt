dickenson russell coal company dickenson coal was cited by the secretary of labor for violating the federal mine safety and health act of,see,stat,by failing to report an injury at its roaring fork mine within ten days of its occurrence.dickenson coal contested the citation on the grounds that bates contracting and construction,bates,a contractor that supplied miners to work the roaring fork mine,had already reported the incident.an administrative law judge alj rendered a summary decision in the secretary favor,and the federal mine safety and health review commission the commission declined to exercise discretionary review of the alj decision.dickenson coal now petitions this court for review.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition.
in,perceiving an urgent need to provide more effective means and measures for improving the working conditions and practices in the nation coal or other mines in order to prevent death and serious physical harm,c,congress significantly strengthened federal regulatory oversight of the mining industry by enacting the federal mine safety and health act the act,see donovan dewey,d t he mine safety and health act applies to industrial activity with a notorious history of serious accidents and unhealthful working conditions and is specifically tailored to address those concerns.passage of the act followed a series of tragic mining accidents from which congress concluded that the regulatory scheme had proven too weak and that a major regulatory overhaul was necessary.big ridge,fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir 
pursuant to the act,the secretary of labor,acting through the mine safety and health administration msha,see,established mandatory health and safety standards for the protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other mines,a.to ensure compliance with these mandatory safety and health standards,the act prescribes regular mine inspections by the msha,the frequency of which depends upon the type of mine being inspected.for underground mines,such as the roaring fork mine,the msha is required to conduct inspections four times annually.see a.in the event the msha finds a violation of the act or of any mandatory health or safety regulation,it must issue a citation to the operator of the mine and order that corrective action be taken.see a providing that the secretary shall issue citations for violations of msha regulations and specify a reasonable time for abatement.the act defines a mine operator as any owner,lessee,or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a coal or other mine or any independent contractor performing services or construction at such mine.d.the msha is further empowered in certain instances to issue an order of withdrawal requiring mining operations to cease until compliance is achieved,see b,d id.a,and to assess civil penalties against an operator who has been found in violation of the act or msha safety standards,see a.
despite the substantial regulatory oversight granted to the secretary,however,congress intended that primary responsibility for ensuring safe working conditions lie with the operators and the miners.e see myers united states,cir placing primary responsibility upon msha inspectors to maintain safe working conditions would be manifestly unreasonable and unjustified i n light of the clear congressional purpose to ensure that the primary responsibility for safety remains with the mine owners and miners.to that end,the act imposes several affirmative duties upon mine operators,including the duty to notify the msha of any accident occurring in any coal or other mine,j the duty to investigate any accident to determine its cause and establish measures to prevent a recurrence,see d and the duty to maintain and make available to the msha records of any such accident,see d.
our focus in this appeal is upon an operator duty to report accidents to the msha.see j.pursuant to the act,the secretary adopted implementing regulations the part regulations establishing a system governing an operator statutorily required duty to report accidents,injuries,and illnesses occurring in its mine to the msha.see part.as mandated by these regulations,
each operator shall report each accident,occupational injury,or occupational illness at the mine.the principal officer in charge of health and safety at the mine or the supervisor of the mine area in which an accident or occupational injury occurs shall complete or review an msha mine accident,injury,and illness report form the operator shall mail completed forms to msha within ten working days after an accident or occupational injury occurs 
a emphasis added.accordingly,any person or entity qualifying as an operator under this regulation was required to report within days accidents or injuries occurring at the operator mine by filing an msha form the part regulations include their own definition of the term operator that is identical to the statutory definition except that it does not expressly include independent contractor within the meaning of operator.see c as used in part operator means a ny owner,lessee,or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a coal mine.there may be multiple operators engaged simultaneously at a single mine even though only one of them owns the mine.see speed mining,fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir.
part reporting requirements serve both enforcement and administrative purposes.the local msha district office uses the form to determine whether to conduct an investigation of the operation.see a.the national msha office of injury and employment information compiles information from the reports to determine incident rates for every operator,see c,and identifies operators in need of greater regulatory supervision.
dickenson coal is the of the roaring fork mine,an underground coal mine in southwestern virginia.it is undisputed that dickenson coal is an operator subject to the reporting requirements under the act and the regulations.see d a.bates contracting is a temporary labor agency that supplied miners to work at the roaring fork mine.on may,charlie wood,an employee of bates,was installing roof bolts when a portion of the coal roof fell and struck him on the elbow.the parties stipulated that wood accident resulted in a reportable occupational injury within the meaning of e although wood was an employee of bates,he was under the control and supervision of personnel from dickenson coal on the day of his occupational injury.there were no bates employees at the roaring fork mine who were supervising or could have supervised wood work.
on may,bates,rather than dickenson coal,submitted a form reporting wood occupational injury to the msha.bates form identified roaring fork as the mine name,provided the proper msha identification number for the roaring fork mining operation,and included its own contractor identification number.dickenson coal,however,did not file a form or otherwise report wood injury.dickenson coal claimed that its policy at the time was not to report occupational injuries or illnesses suffered by an employee of an independent contractor like bates.
on july,the msha issued a citation to dickenson coal for failure to timely report an occupational injury and file a form as required by a.the issuing msha inspector was aware that bates submitted a form but nonetheless found that dickenson coal was liable for failing to report the injury the msha also proposed a civil penalty for the citation.dickenson coal subsequently abated the citation essentially by the form submitted by bates with slight alterations 
dickenson coal contested the citation before the commission.see d,the secretary moved for summary disposition in light of the undisputed facts that dickenson coal is an operator under the act and part regulations and that wood suffered an occupational injury under e.the secretary argued that dickenson coal position that it was not required to report an injury to an independent contractor employee was contrary to the plain language of the regulation,which requires e ach operator to report each occupational injury.a.in response,dickenson coal argued that bates also qualified as
