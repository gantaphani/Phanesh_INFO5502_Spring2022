marilyn mitchell,kevin bale,and susan boorstein appeal the district court grant of summary judgment,dismissing without prejudice their petition to vacate an arbitration award under the railway labor act rla for the following reasons,we affirm the district court,concluding that boorstein failed to exhaust her procedural remedies and that mitchell and bale lack standing to bring a petition under the rla.
facts and proceedings 
background 
the plaintiffs are flight attendants for continental airlines,continental.as such,their employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba between continental and international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam.the cba provides a system of procedures for the resolution of employment grievances,ultimately requiring that unresolved grievances be resolved by final and binding arbitration before a systems board of adjustment the board,as is permitted by the rla.in addition,the cba specifies that the iam shall serve as the exclusive bargaining representative for all flight attendants.
under the cba,continental flight attendants accrue various types of seniority,each of which is classified as either competitive or.continental is required to post competitive seniority dates biennially.flight attendants have thirty days after each such posting to challenge the accuracy.competitive seniority is not at issue in this case seniority is,though.
continental is not required to post seniority dates for its flight attendants.rankings include pay seniority,vacation seniority,and and seniority.instead of posting lists of seniority periodically,they are communicated in other,more discrete ways.
boorstein had been employed as a continental flight attendant since november,when in,she learned that her seniority date had been changed from her date of hire to a subsequent date in.she also learned that her company service date had been unfavorably changed when,on her thirtieth anniversary with continental,she received a cake of the type customarily given to flight attendants with only twenty years of service.boorstein alleges that,after she inquired into the unfavorable adjustments,her seniority status was again adjusted adversely.boorstein never filed a grievance against continental and never sought to resolve her dispute through arbitration before the board.
mitchell began her employment with continental in january,and began flying the next month.in,mitchell seniority date was retroactively adjusted without her knowledge as a result of leave that she had taken years earlier the next year,mitchell also discovered that her vacation seniority date was different and less advantageous than previously indicated.throughout and,mitchell repeatedly contacted and questioned continental personnel regarding the accuracy of her seniority dates.she alleges that her questioning led to even greater unfavorable adjustments.
unable to resolve her inquiries satisfactorily,mitchell contacted iam in.after prolonged discussions,iam eventually permitted mitchell to file a grievance against continental,in which she contended that her seniority dates had been subjected to unfair,adverse adjustments.that was in may.her grievance was denied following a and a hearing.
bale joined continental as a flight attendant in july.in,he discovered that his vacation seniority date was less advantageous than his records indicated it should have been.bale periodically inquired into the discrepancy between and.he was eventually informed that his vacation seniority date had been adjusted for leaves that he had taken between and.
in august,bale filed a grievance,complaining of unfair and unequal adjustment of seniority.in june,bale filed a second grievance,complaining that continental violated the cba by including managerial employees at the level of director or above in the system seniority list.both of these grievances were denied following a and a hearing.
involvement of iam 
a stamped,and then signed and dated notice appears in the upper,corner of both mitchell and bales grievances,in which each attendant acknowledged i hereby authorize the international association of machinists,with full power of attorney,to represent me in all stages of the grievance procedure in the presenting and settling of this grievance.after mitchell and bale grievances were denied by continental,they were referred to arbitration before the board,which consisted of one iam representative,one continental representative,and one neutral chairperson.as the iam had previously learned that several other flight attendants seniority dates had been unfavorably adjusted without their knowledge,it presented with those of mitchell and bale the grievances of four flight attendants in a arbitration hearing before the board in february.
prior to this hearing being held,mitchell and bale had received numerous notices of the hearing dates and locations,the hearing date having been postponed and rescheduled numerous times.in addition,both mitchell and bale met with iam representatives in,and mitchell attended a second preparatory meeting in february.
when the hearing was finally convened in february,mitchell participated in person and bale participated by telephone.both mitchell and bale allege that,immediately before the hearing,iam informed them that it would not be representing them,so they would have to represent themselves.both claim that they thus were ambushed into putting on their own,admittedly deficient,pro se case.
in may,the board rendered its arbitral decision and award the award.the board first decided that it lacked jurisdiction over matters arising before the date that the cba was formed,april.it then concluded that continental had failed to maintain a careful record of when an individual returned to work from a leave of absence for purposes of his or her seniority and that a djustments were made for periods of inactivity taken by some individuals when they returned to work,but not for others.after acknowledging continental failure to maintain careful records and declaring that it was unable to examine all of the individual employment records of the more than flight attendants employed by continental,the board prescribed the following procedure to be used by flight attendants retrospectively challenging their seniority dates and for continental use in making future adjustments 
f or retroactive adjustments that occurred within the last two years,flight attendants may protest such adjustments in their seniority dates which occurred more than a year after the event which triggered the adjustment.they may do so within days of the date on which this award is rendered,and the parties shall have the joint obligation of informing all flight attendants of this decision for the future,the company shall have a period of one year from the date on which they first were notified by the company to file a protest.
in the award,the board also decided that its ruling would apply to bale grievance and provided the iam and continental an opportunity to resolve his grievance amicably based on the rules set forth in the award denied as untimely those grievances relating to individuals holding managerial positions at the director level and higher as untimely and denied mitchell grievances because the adjustments were made contemporaneously and in order to retain seniority one must be on the list of company employees and to accrue seniority one must be in the active service of the company and be receiving pay for such service.finally,the board retained jurisdiction over all disputes arising based upon this decision including questions regarding remedy.
continental and iam then issued a joint notice to all flight attendants,informing them of the existence of the award,its terms and conditions,and the deadline for filing claims pursuant to the award.in october of that year,after negotiations between bale and continental proved unsuccessful,the board issued a second arbitral award,finding that the seniority adjustments of which bale complained were actually made in september,outside the timeframe for claims that can be submitted under the award.the board,therefore,denied bale grievance.
