sierra club,clean air and water,and community association collectively the petitioners,are appealing the environmental protection agency epa final action at.may,codified at pt,which they contend contravenes the clean air act caa.the final action approved the state implementation plan sip submitted by the state of texas for the arthur beaumont area and extended the ozone attainment deadline for that area.petitioners also are appealing the epa determination that no additional control measures were required in the beaumont area to satisfy the statutory requirement for implementation of reasonably available control measures racm.the epa final action is affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
factual and procedural background 
regulatory background.
the caa establishes a comprehensive program for improving air quality throughout the nation.under the caa,the epa is charged with identifying air pollutants that endanger the public health and welfare.id.the epa also is charged with formulating national ambient air quality standards naaqs,which specify those pollutants maximum permissible concentrations in the ambient air.id.in,the epa promulgated a naaqs for ozone,which still remains at parts per million based on a average.see.
under the caa,states must adopt sips specifying emission limitations applicable to pollution sources in order to maintain and enforce each naaqs.a.sips are submitted to the epa,which may approve,conditionally approve,or disapprove the sips in full or in part.id.k.significantly,the caa has a provision that requires sips to contain provisions regulating emissions that contribute significantly to nonattainment in,or interfere with maintenance by,any other state with respect to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.id.a d i i.in addition,as noted in the challenged final action,the epa has interpreted a a as incorporating a similar requirement that an upwind area be prohibited from contributing significantly to nonattainment in a downwind area within the same state.see.
under,ozone attainment areas are classified according to the severity of air pollution.the classifications are marginal,moderate,serious,severe,or extreme.a e.each classification has a specified date for attainment of the ozone naaqs and the programs that states must adopt in their sips to attain the naaqs by reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides,which are precursors to the formation of ozone.id.under the caa,the following dates were established for the naaqs to be achieved november,for marginal areas november,for moderate areas november,for serious areas november,for severe areas november,for areas and november,for extreme areas.id.a.under section a,the state may apply for two attainment date extensions that the epa can approve if it makes specific determinations regarding air quality and state compliance with sip requirements.
in addition,all nonattainment area plans must provide for implementation of all reasonably available control measures racm as expeditiously as practicable.id.c.the epa must review each submitted plan.id.k.if the plan is approved,in whole or in part,the approved provisions become federally enforceable.id.if the plan is not approved,or is determined to be incomplete,the state may be subject to sanctions and eventually federally imposed clean air measures.id.c.
b.the extension policy at issue in this case.
on march,the epa issued a notice of interpretation of the caa entitled extension of attainment dates for downwind transport areas.in this extension policy,the epa interpreted the caa as allowing for the extension of attainment dates for ozone nonattainment areas classified as either moderate or serious and that are downwind of areas that transport ozone and interfere with their ability to attain required ozone levels.id.at.according to the epa,it was seeking to harmonize the attainment demonstration and attainment date requirements for downwind areas affected by transport both with the graduated attainment date scheme and the schedule for achieving reductions in emissions from upwind areas.id.at.
in the extension policy,the epa explained that an area attainment date would be considered for extension if it has been identified as a downwind area affected by transport from either an upwind area in the same state with a later attainment date or an upwind area in another state that significantly contributes to downwind nonattainment has submitted an approvable attainment demonstration with any necessary,adopted local measures,which indicates it will attain the naaqs no later than the date that the reductions are expected from upwind areas under the final nitrogen oxides sip call the statutory attainment date for upwind nonattainment areas has adopted all applicable local measures required under the area current classification and any additional measures necessary to demonstrate attainment,given that the reductions occurred as required in upwind areas and will implement all adopted measures as expeditiously as practicable,but no later than the date by which the upwind reductions needed for attainment will be achieved.id.
if an area satisfies the above guidelines,it would not be reclassified or if it failed to attain by its original attainment date under section b.the reasoning for this is that the epa concluded that congress did not intend for downwind areas to be penalized by being forced to compensate for transported pollution by adopting measures that are more costly and onerous which will become superfluous once upwind areas reduce their contribution to the pollution problem.id.at.nevertheless,downwind areas are still responsible for implementing local controls sufficient to bring about attainment,except for the transported pollution.id.
epa application of the extension policy to the beaumont area.
the beaumont area is classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment area.see.therefore,under a,its original attainment date was november.however,as a result of the pollution traveling from the upwind area of,the epa applied its extension policy that resulted in a new attainment date of november,for the beaumont area.this date coincides with the area november,attainment date.the epa established the new attainment date for the beaumont area after concluding that,based on extensive modeling submitted by the state of texas,it will not reach the required attainment level unless the area also attains necessary ozone standards.id.at.in other words,requiring local reductions in the beaumont area earlier than the area attainment date would not accelerate attainment in the beaumont area because of the area pollution contributions and the need for upwind emissions reductions.
petitioners now appeal the epa application of the extension policy to the beaumont area.petitioners also appeal the epa determination that c does not compel the implementation of any additional control measures beyond those already contained in the beaumont area attainment demonstration sip.
ii.standard of review 
this court role in reviewing the adequacy of the epa final action is governed by the administrative procedure act.section provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see also texas office of pub.util.counsel federal communications comm n,cir macktal united states dep t of labor,cir.
iii.discussion 
whether the epa acted consistently with the caa in granting an extension of the statutory date for meeting federal standards for ozone air pollution in the beaumont area and in approving a sip for the area based on that extension.
the epa argues that it did not abuse its authority by implementing its extension policy.the epa asserts that its interpretation of the caa is the best way to reconcile the act provisions.according to the epa,when considering all of the caa pertinent language,congress clearly did not intend the unduly restrictive and punitive reading that petitioners urge on this court.the epa argues that its interpretation of the caa was necessary to fill a statutory gap to avoid unfairly burdening downwind areas by forcing them to adopt more stringent local controls for the purpose of compensating for another area transported pollution.
in support of its argument,the epa notes that congress has provided extensions to nonattainment areas such as in cases of international border areas under section,which spares ozone nonattainment areas that demonstrate they suffer from pollution from outside of the united states from being to a higher ozone classification.under section h,the caa authorizes the epa to designate certain isolated ozone nonattainment areas as rural transport areas,which allows them to be subjected to less stringent control requirements.in addition,j provides that when a nonattainment area fails to demonstrate attainment by the applicable deadline,a state within that area may be relieved of statutory sanctions if the state would have been able to make such demonstration but for the failure of one or more other states within the control area.section a of the united states code authorizes the adjustment of an area original classification based on factors including transported pollution.furthermore,under a d i i,sips must contain adequate provisions prohibiting pollution that contribute s significantly to nonattainment in any other state.and,section provides states the opportunity to petition the epa for relief from interstate pollution.
the epa concedes that when the amendments to the caa were passed,congress did not expressly specify similar relief for other areas,including for downwind cities that are unable to achieve attainment as a result of upwind cities within the same state.the epa,however,maintains that congress did not fully address all issues of ozone transport at the time the caa was amended in because there was a lack of understanding concerning the issue.according to the epa,it was not until the that a sufficient understanding of the complex ozone transport problem began to be achieved as a result of the ozone transport assessment group otag,an organization with the mission to assess and recommend strategies to address ozone transport.thus,the epa insists that a reasonable understanding of ozone transport was not achieved until well after the beaumont area attainment deadline.ultimately,the epa asserts that it was reasonable for it to conclude that the area impact on the beaumont area ability to attain the ozone standard indicated that the caa transport and attainment provisions did not function as congress envisioned.
petitioners,however,contend the epa abused its authority by defeating the express statutory reclassification requirements of the caa and extending the ozone attainment deadlines for the beaumont area based on pollution transport,and by approving the sip as adequate based on the extension.according to petitioners,because the beaumont area failed to achieve attainment of required ozone levels,it should have been reclassified from moderate with an attainment date of november,to either serious with an attainment date of november,or severe with an attainment date of november.see.petitioners further maintain that under the caa,reclassification would require that an incremental increase in the mandatory control strategies be imposed on the beaumont area sip in exchange for any extended attainment date.see d and b a.
this court is guided by chevron,nrdc,d,in evaluating the epa interpretation of the caa.the first step under chevron is to inquire whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if congress has spoken to the issue,this court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress and that is the end of the matter.id.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,this court must move to chevron second step.id.at.under the second step,this court must defer to the epa interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.furthermore,as this court has stated,the epa decision will be reversed only if it was arbitrary,capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.texas office of pub.util.counsel,at citing chevron,at.see also.
petitioners correctly point out that the supreme court has stated i t is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.city of chicago environmental defense fund,d internal quotations omitted.petitioners contend that the caa numerous provisions addressing the issue of pollution transport and extensions of attainment dates clearly indicates that congress fully understood the issue at hand and intended not to authorize the epa to extend attainment dates as it did in this case.petitioners conclude,therefore,that under step one of chevron,the question of whether an attainment date extension is permissible based on air pollution transport has been resolved by the statute and that is the end of the matter.chevron,at.
we agree with the petitioners.the plain terms of the caa preclude an extension of the sort the epa granted in the present case.as the petitioners correctly point out,the caa specifies when the epa may extend attainment deadlines to account for upwind emissions that jeopardize an area ability to achieve attainment without requiring reclassification of the area.for example,the caa provides 
any state that establishes to the satisfaction of the administrator that such state would have attained the national ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date,but for emissions emanating from outside of the united states,shall not be subject to the provisions of section a or of this title or section of this title.
b emphasis added.furthermore,the caa provides for certain nonattainment areas to be exempted from the attainment deadlines by authorizing the epa to designate those areas as rural transport areas,which allow those areas to be treated as marginal areas.id.h.this designation,however,is limited to a area that does not include,and is not adjacent to,any part of a metropolitan statistical area or,where one exists,a consolidated metropolitan statistical area,id.h,and whose oxides of nitrogen emissions do not make a significant contribution to the ozone concentrations measured in the area or in other areas.id.h.as the circuit aptly stated in a recent case similar to this one we can not but infer from the presence of these specific exemptions that the absence of any other exemption for the transport of ozone was deliberate,and the agency attempt to grant such a dispensation is contrary to the intent of congress.sierra club epa.see also,sierra club epa,cir.
we note that nrdc,upon which the epa heavily relies,is inapposite to the present case.in nrdc,the circuit affirmed the epa grant of two deadline extensions.the first deadline extension concerned the submission of enhanced inspection and maintenance sips.nrdc,at.under the caa,congress provided that states be given a period after guidance promulgation to bring their sips into compliance with the enhanced performance standard.id.however,the epa failed to meet its november,deadline for providing guidance,which made it impossible for states both to have the benefit of this lead time and to meet their november,enhanced submission deadline.id.the court noted that w hile the caa is very specific about the consequences of a state failure to meet the submittal deadline,the act is silent on what should occur if the agency misses its guidance deadline.id.because congress statutory scheme provided that the states comply in all respects with the epa guidance,the court concluded that a deadline extension was necessary for the states to have a full year to do so.id.
the second deadline extension in nrdc concerned the caa requirement that states encompassing nonattainment areas submit sips or sip revisions addressing the application of reasonably available control technology ract to stationary emission sources of nitrogen oxides by november.id.however,the epa concluded that photochemical grid modeling was the only reliable tool to justify an area wide exempt
