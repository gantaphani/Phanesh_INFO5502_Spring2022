michael bonds petitions for review of the drug enforcement administration dea decision denying rick quinn waiver application that would have allowed medical plaza pharmacy mpp to hire bonds.because we hold that limits petitions for judicial review to those litigants with article iii standing and who are also arguably within the zone of interests of the controlled substances act csa we find that bonds lacks standing to challenge the agency final decision.accordingly,we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.

scope of judicial review under the controlled substances act 
the csa judicial review provision provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision of the attorney general may obtain review of a ll final determinations,findings,and conclusions of the attorney general under this subchapter.the government contends that the csa judicial review provision requires,at a minimum,two standing components,one constitutional,which is based on article iii provision for judicial review of a case or controversy and the other prudential specifically,the government argues that bonds lacks standing because he fails to meet the prudential standing requirements.it contends that bonds is not a person aggrieved under the csa because the alleged injury does not fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the csa bonds is not an or waiver applicant and bonds can not raise the legal rights of a third party.bonds asserts that he meets the prudential standing requirements because he is a person aggrieved under the csa judicial review provision.
the phrase person adversely affected or aggrieved is a term of art used in many statutes to designate those who have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision,within the agency or before the courts,office of workers comp.programs newport news shipbuilding dry dock,d.we have not yet addressed the scope of the term person aggrieved under.because congress could have,through,expanded judicial reviewability to litigants who do not meet the prudential standing requirements,we look to the act to determine whether congress intended the prudential standing doctrine to apply to suits brought under the csa.see of cmty.orgs.for reform now fowler,cir.however,we recognize that congress legislates against the background of the prudential standing doctrine,which applies unless it is expressly negated.bennett spear,d.
in drafting the csa,congress did not expressly expand judicial review to litigants not meeting the prudential standing requirements moreover,in the context of the judicial review provision in the administrative procedure act apa,the supreme court,in newport news,suggested that to be a person aggrieved,the litigant must show at the outset of the case,that he is injured in fact by agency action and that the interest he seeks to vindicate is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.id.at.citation omitted.
the circuit applied newport news,and also reached our conclusion regarding the standing requirements under.in pdk laboratories united states drug enforcement administration,the court stated 
in view of the interpretation of statutes applicable to other agencies containing language identical to,we hold that if pdk has article iii standing,which no one doubts,and if its interests are arguably within the zone of interests c regulates,which we believe they are,pdk is a person aggrieved within meaning and is entitled to prosecute its case in court.
citing newport news,at.therefore,according to pdk laboratories,the term person aggrieved merely requires that the litigant have article iii standing and prudential,arguably be within the zone of interests.we agree with the circuit application of newport news to.accordingly,because we find that the background understanding of person aggrieved includes both the constitutional and prudential limits on standing,we hold that limits petitions for judicial review to those litigants with article iii standing and who are also arguably within the zone of protected by the csa.
whether bonds is a person aggrieved under.
because we conclude that bonds meets the article iii standing requirements our inquiry is whether bonds has prudential standing.in deciding whether a litigant has prudential standing,we must identify what interest the litigant seeks to assert and then decide if that interest is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute.under the zone of interests test,we liberally construe congressional acts to favor a plaintiff standing to challenge administrative actions.this is not to say,however,that all plaintiffs affected by a regulation or order have standing to sue corrosion proof fittings envtl.prot.agency,cir citation omitted in cases where the plaintiff is not the subject of the contested regulatory action,the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit suit.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
section b of the csa expressly indicates that the interest protected by the regulation registration requirement is the public interest in the legitimate use of controlled substances and to inhibit the pernicious consequences to the public health and safety of illegitimate use.b provides 
b the attorney general shall register an applicant to distribute a controlled substance in schedule i or ii unless he determines that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent with the public interest.in determining the public interest,the following factors shall be considered 
maintenance of effective control against diversion of particular controlled substances into other than legitimate medical,scientific,and industrial channels 
compliance with particular state and local law 
prior conviction record of applicant under federal or state laws relating the manufacture,distribution,or dispensing of such substances 
past experience in the distribution of controlled substances and 
such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.
because the language of the csa specifically states that the act is meant to protect the public from the deleterious effects of the illegitimate use and distribution of controlled substances,and does not mention the employment rights of pharmacists,bonds desire to be employed by mpp is not arguably within the zone of interests protected by the csa.
moreover,the supreme court,on several occasions,has acknowledged that,in drafting the csa,congress intended to protect the public from the deleterious effects of the illegitimate use and distribution of controlled substances.for example,in gonzales oregon the court recognized that congress drafted the csa to combat drug abuse and control legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances,d.additionally,in gonzales raich,the court noted that congress found that t he illegal importation,manufacture,distribution,and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health a
