factual and procedural background 
a native and citizen of colombia,acosta is years old and currently resides in boston,massachusetts.he is married to a united states citizen and is a stepfather to her two children.in june,acosta sought to register permanent residence or adjust status before the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis.in support of his application,he submitted evidence that he was legally admitted to the united states in miami,florida,on august,when he was thirteen years old.this evidence included his visa and form i 
in august,uscis denied his application on the basis that his visa and form i were fraudulent.that same day,acosta was placed in removal proceedings upon receiving a notice to appear nta from the department of homeland security dhs as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.before the ij,acosta argued that he need not show that his documents are authentic to prove that he was admitted to the united states.rather,the bia has interpreted admitted to include situations where an alien physically presents himself for questioning and makes no knowing false claim to citizenship even though he volunteers no information and is asked no questions by the immigration authorities.matter of quilantan,bia.emphasizing his young age at the time of his alleged admission in,acosta asserts that he was unaware that his documents were fraudulent.
acosta evidence 
acosta appeared twice for hearings before the ij,in july and october.to support his argument that he was admitted to the united states,acosta submitted affidavits from himself,his father,and his uncle,and acosta testified during the july hearing.at the hearing,he explained that he had entered the united states,at the age of thirteen,on august.according to acosta testimony,his uncle and primary caretaker at the time,julio césar acosta salinas julio césar,had obtained a visa and passport for him.julio césar later escorted acosta to the airport in medellín,colombia.there,julio césar met with a man identified in julio césar affidavit as the travel agent responsible for providing acosta travel documents acosta testified that he then bid farewell to his uncle and met a female airline attendant who accompanied him onto the plane.during this process,he at no point had possession of his passport rather,the airline attendant was responsible for his travel documents.julio césar affidavit largely corroborates this testimony.
acosta stated that he landed in miami that afternoon.upon arrival,the airline attendant escorted him to an immigration official and gave the official acosta documents for inspection.acosta was not questioned by the official,who communicated with the airline attendant instead.another airline attendant then accompanied acosta on a flight from miami to boston,massachusetts acosta stated that,after he landed in boston,his father,omar alberto acosta salinas acosta,who was residing in massachusetts at the time,greeted him at the airport.acosta testified that the flight attendant held his travel documents on the second flight and gave these papers to his father upon their arrival.acosta,affidavit is consistent with this testimony.
acosta avers that he has not left the united states since his arrival in.acosta testified that he first learned that his travel documentation was fraudulent when he met with uscis to discuss his application for permanent residence.following the hearing before the ij,acosta submitted a supplemental memorandum indicating that he took a favorable polygraph examination that corroborated his account of being inspected and admitted to the united states in miami in august.
b.the government evidence 
the government sought to show that acosta was not admitted to the united states in through the testimony of two expert witnesses,robert murray,an enforcement officer with united states customs and border protection,and heather hoover,a forensic document examiner.
murray testimony 
murray testified that he searched dhs systems and found no record of acosta original form i,which would suggest that the document was not lawfully issued.he explained that,typically,after an alien is admitted to the united states,his form i is sent to a centralized processing center and manually entered into the system.he also acknowledged that a form i could be lost before being entered into the system 
reviewing acosta visa,murray determined that the visa number was valid but that it was associated with a different individual who entered the united states in november.when asked how acosta name and biographical information were transposed onto the visa,murray reasoned that the visa may have been washed,a process by which biographical data is removed from the visa and new data reprinted.based on his analysis of acosta visa and his understanding of dhs systems,murray attested that he did not believe there is any plausible way that acosta could have used this visa to be inspected or admitted to the united states.
murray also reviewed a may visa application for acosta created in bogotá,colombia,and submitted to the state department.the record reveals that the application was refused on may.on direct examination,murray stated that,to the best of his knowledge,acosta would have needed to be present in colombia in to apply for the visa.on,however,murray conceded that he did not know whether a old individual would have been required to appear in person to apply for a visa in.
hoover testimony 
hoover testified that the admission stamps on acosta form i and passport were counterfeit based on an analysis of the ink.she noted that the stamp typically used on form i should flash under ultraviolet light and that the stamp on acosta form had no such ultraviolet reaction.similarly,hoover explained that the stamp on acosta passport,when viewed under ultraviolet light,suggested that the fluorescing feature of this stamp was simulated by brushing or placing a substance on top of the stamp impression to give it the appearance of fluorescing.
hoover also attested that acosta visa was a genuine visa that had been modified.the visa number,which is impressed into the paper,was unaltered.the original biographical information,however,would have been imprinted in black toner ink which rests on top of the document rather than being absorbed into the paper.accordingly,visas such as acosta are susceptible to being washed.using an infrared light,hoover could detect previous entries under acosta information.based on this analysis,hoover testified that acosta biographical data had been printed onto the visa after the previous information was erased.
c.the ij and bia decisions 
the ij determined that acosta had failed to establish that he is lawfully present in the united states following a prior admission.c.the ij acknowledged that acosta testimony was corroborated by the affidavits of acosta,and julio césar.but he declined to give any weight to acosta polygraph examination and noted an internal discrepancy between acosta testimony and affidavit whereas acosta testified that julio césar had met a gentleman outside the airport,he made no mention of this individual in his affidavit.
ultimately,the ij was persuaded by the government argument that acosta was not admitted to the united states.he credited the government evidence that acosta visa had been used to enter the united states in november,which suggests that acosta could not have used this visa to enter the united states three months earlier,in august.the ij also acknowledged a report submitted by hoo
