the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the prior opinion,chicago bridge iron,ftc,cir,is withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted 
chicago bridge and iron company,a dutch corporation,and its united states subsidiary,chicago bridge and iron company,collectively,petitioner or,petition for review of an order of the federal trade commission commission to divest assets acquired from moines,pdm,a pennsylvania corporation,used in the business of designing,engineering and building cryogenic storage tanks.the commission ruled that acquisition of these assets on february,would likely result in a substantial lessening of competition or tend to create a monopoly in the relevant markets in violation of section seven of the clayton act,and section five of the federal trade commission act.we deny the petition for review.
before the acquisition,both and pdm designed,engineered,and constructed industrial storage tanks in the united states for liquified natural gas lng,liquified petroleum gas lpg,and liquid atmospheric gases,such as nitrogen,oxygen,and argon,as well as thermal vacuum chambers tvcs for testing aerospace satellites.the two firms were the dominant suppliers of the products in these four relevant united states markets.before,they had a virtual duopoly in those markets.between and,they were the only builders of lng tanks in the united states.between and the acquisition,they were the only builders of lng tanks for import terminals,and they built all but of the lng tanks constructed in the united states.in the lpg tank market,between and the acquisition,all but two of the projects were awarded to and pdm.in the tank market,the only other significant competitor,graver tank,left the market in,leaving as the dominant firm now in that market.in the tvc market,and pdm were the only firms that had built any large,tvcs in the united states since.
on february,acquired all of pdm assets relating to these four markets for approximately million.prior to the acquisition,the commission notified that it had significant antitrust concerns about the acquisition and was conducting an investigation on october,the commission issued an administrative complaint charging that acquisition of those assets of its principal competitor,pdm,violated section of the clayton act,and section of the federal trade commission ftc act.an administrative law judge alj held an evidentiary hearing,issued an initial decision,concluding that had violated both acts and ordered a divestiture of the assets.after briefing,argument and a de novo review of the record,the commission issued a final order affirming the alj determination of liability and issuing a modified divestiture order.
in its order,the commission adopted the alj decision with some modifications.noting that the relevant product and geographic markets are undisputed,the commission affirmed the alj determination that the acquisition effects must be assessed in each of the united states markets for lng,lpg,and tanks,and for tvcs,at.finding that sales of the relevant products had been sporadic,the alj rejected the traditional method of measuring market concentration with the index hhi on an annualized basis,at.nonetheless,based on the bidding history in each market,the alj found that the acquisition resulted in an undue accretion of market power in that could not be constrained by timely entry of new competitors.id.the commission disagreed with the alj complete disregard for the hhi,stating that,because and pdm had been the only competitors in the relevant markets for the past two decades,it was appropriate to analyze their sales data over an extended time frame,at.using the hhis accordingly,the commission concluded that the resulting market concentration established a prima facie case that the acquisition violates section of the clayton act and section of the ftc act,at.furthermore,the commission found an independent reason for a prima facie case of presumptive illegality in the qualitative evidence showing that the acquisition left as the only major player in each of the relevant markets,the views of customers with knowledge that and pdm were the only lng tank suppliers and that the acquisition substantially harmed competition and pdm own documents confirmed that they focused almost exclusively on each other in assessing competition and paid little or no attention to other companies,at.
the commission also found that evidence of high entry barriers necessarily strengthened the effects of the acquisition,at.in addition to customer testimony and behavior in past lng project awards,the commission cited reasons that entry into the relevant markets is exceedingly difficult and can not be achieved in a timely fashion the composition in lng tanks requires a specialized construction skill set lng tanks require sophisticated engineering,trained supervisors,knowledge of local labor markets,as well as specialized procedures and proprietary techniques,at.additionally,the ferc regulatory and approval process is complicated and potentially time consuming customers expect significant experience in builders of lng tanks that takes a number of years to gain,at.thus,the commission concluded that dominance in the relevant markets gives it a virtually insurmountable advantage over newly entering competitors.accordingly,the commission decided that the entry and expansion in the relevant markets are not likely to replace the competition lost through the acquisition or to sufficiently constrain in a timely manner,at.
did not contend that the acquisition would lead to enhanced efficiencies benefitting competition.rather,it argued that the evidence of high market concentration and entry barriers was rebutted by evidence of recent actual and potential entry into three of the four markets.on examining the record evidence,however,the commission affirmed the alj finding that the purported new entry is insufficient to constrain,at.three identified by as new entrants lacked sufficient experience to compete effectively with.none had built an lng tank in the united states.at the time of trial,none had won a lng tank bid while had won six contracts during that period.customers with upcoming lng projects were not aware of the alleged new entrants.the commission concluded that although the new entrants had taken a step toward competing in the united states by partnering with united states construction firms,they can not likely restore the competition lost as a result of acquisition of pdm relevant assets in the foreseeable future,at.
the commission ruled that acquisition of these assets would likely result in a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant markets in violation of section seven of the clayton act,and section five of the federal trade commission act,at.the commission expanded the divestiture remedy,ordering to divide its cryogenic business into two separate entities new and new pdm equally capable of competing in the four markets 
contends that the commission applied incorrect legal standards in shifting burdens of proof and persuasion applied incorrect legal standards related to the petitioner actual and potential entry defense found,without substantial evidentiary support,that failed to rebut the government prima facie case and abused its discretion in its remedial order.
this court reviews the commission factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard.c jim walter ftc,cir.substantial evidence is evidence that provides a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.diamond drilling marshall,cir.we review de novo all legal questions pertaining to commission orders.ftc.fed of dentists,d.
section of the clayton act prohibits acquisitions,including mergers where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country,the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,or to tend to create a monopoly.see united states philadelphia bank,d the statutory test is whether the effect of the merger may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country.internal quotations omitted see also brown shoe united states,d the use of these words may be means that the bill,if enacted,would not apply to the mere possibility but only to the reasonable probability of the prescribed sic effect.the words may be have been in section of the clayton act since.the concept of reasonable probability conveyed by these words is a necessary element in any statute which seeks to arrest restraints of trade in their incipiency and before they develop into restraints violative of the sherman act.a requirement of certainty and actuality of injury to competition is incompatible with any effort to supplement the sherman act by reaching incipient restraints.quoting,sess,cong.and news,see generally ftc heinz,citing,at.
the commission correctly applied the legal standards of burdens of proof and persuasion 
first challenges the commission application of the legal standards for production of evidence and persuasion.
the framework for deciding clayton act section actions first requires the government to establish a prima facie case that an acquisition is unlawful.see heinz,at citing united states baker hughes.typically the government establishes a prima facie case by showing that the transaction in question will significantly increase market concentration,thereby creating a presumption that the transaction is likely to substantially lessen competition.id.once the government establishes the prima facie case,the respondent may rebut it by producing evidence to cast doubt on the accuracy of the government evidence as predictive of future effects.id.finally,if the respondent successfully rebuts the prima facie case,the burden of production shifts back to the government and merges with the ultimate burden of persuasion,which is incumbent on the government at all times.baker hughes,at ftc.health,cir kaiser aluminum chem.ftc,cir.
contends that the commission conclusion that failed to rebut the government prima facie case was reached by erroneously subjecting to a burden of persuasion rather than switching the burden of production back to the government after offered its rebuttal evidence.we disagree and,instead,conclude that the commission reasonably found that the evidence produced by simply failed to rebut the government prima facie case.as occurs in most cases,the government introduced all of its evidence at once.in addition to making a prima facie case based on concentration numbers and a detailed examination of competitive conditions in each market,the government presented evidence that all relevant markets are difficult to enter.the government evidence not only established its prima facie case that acquisition likely would have effects it also served as a redoubt against evidence that actual or potential entry of new competitors would offset the merger substantial lessening of competition.the commission expressly decided that,based on the totality of the evidence,had not rebutted the government prima facie case.from our review of the record and the commission opinion,we conclude that the commission decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the commission did not improperly place the burden of persuasion upon.
primarily relies on baker hughes as the authority for the framework within the context.the ninth and eleventh circuits interpret baker hughes language as describing a flexible framework rather than an rule.the ninth circuit in olin ftc distinguishes baker hughes by holding that the commission does not need to switch burdens back to the government if the government addresses the rebuttal evidence in its prima facie case in other words,based on an assessment of the rebuttal evidence in light of the prima facie case,the commission can determine that the respondent company rebuttal does not satisfy its burden of production and therefore decline to switch the burden of production back to the government,cir.the ninth circuit writes 
the clearest reason why baker hughes does not control here is that the commission responded to the company rebuttal,whereas in baker hughes the government did not.in the present case,the commission pointed to evidence indicating why olin viability argument should fail.the commission is able to do this because it is olin burden to rebut a prima facie case of illegality.
id.citations omitted.we believe the same situation applies in this case.the government prima facie case addresses why the rebuttal evidence is not sufficient and construal of the rebuttal evidence is not credible therefore the commission can conclude burden of production on rebuttal is not satisfied without having to formally switch the burden of production back to the government.the eleventh circuit in.health,approves baker hughes general framework but concludes,in accord with the ninth circuit,that,in practice,evidence is often considered all at once and the burdens are often analyzed together.at.the eleventh circuit writes 
conceptually,this shifting of the burdens of production,with the ultimate burden of persuasion remaining always with the government,conjures up images of a tennis match,where the government serves up its prima facie case,the defendant returns with evidence undermining the government case,and then the government must respond to win the point.in practice,however,the government usually introduces all of its evidence at one time,and the defendant responds in kind.this is particularly true when the government seeks a temporary restraining order or,as here,a preliminary injunction and,thus,time is of the essence 
see also baker hughes,at calling the distinction between the burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion always an elusive distinction.ftc butterworth health,wl,cir,unpublished calling baker hughes framework somewhat artificial.the ninth and eleventh circuit interpretations of the baker hughes framework accommodate the practical difficulties in separating the burden to persuade and the burdens to produce.the flexible approach allows the commission to preserve the prima facie presumption if the respondent,fails to satisfy the burden of production in light of contrary evidence in the prima facie case.
then challenges the order by contending the commission imposed an onerous burden of production that approximates a burden of persuasion.the commission must determine whether the defendant has come forward with sufficient evidence to rebut the government prima facie case but the government continues to bear the burden of persuasion even after it has made out a prima facie case through statistical evidence the defendant is not required to present a defense upon which he bears the burden of proof in the sense of ultimately persuading the trier of fact that he is entitled to relief.see automatic canteen of am.ftc.vanity fair paper mills,ftc,cir see also kaiser aluminum,at.the burden of production is the obligation to come forward with evidence of a litigant necessary propositions of fact.el se.transp.auth.septa,cir.under the burden of production,even if the respondent produces evidence,the court must credit the evidence and the evidence must justify the rebuttal arguments the respondent espouses.baker hughes,at see also id.at noting the rebuttal evidence should discredit the data underlying the initial presumption in the government favor.in other words,the commission can judge whether the nexus between the rebuttal arguments and the proffered evidence is plausible so as to satisfy the burden of production as a matter of law.see,olin,at.health,at.we therefore read the commission opinion as deciding whether respondent rebuttal arguments and evidence plausibly and justifiably show that the statistics give an inaccurate account of the acquisition possible effect on competition in the relevant market so as to satisfy its burden of production as a matter of law.id.at.under the flexible approach,the commission can decide this in light of any argument in the prima facie case that may undermine the rebuttal evidence.olin,at.
nevertheless,the commission can not impose too exacting a standard that might approach a burden of persuasion,which would require a party to convince the factfinder at trial that a litigant necessary propositions of fact are indeed true.el,at.however,the commission has some discretion to decide if the respondent proffered evidence justifies its arguments in rebuttal.see,olin,at finding a rebuttal argument not plausible in light of the proffered evidence see also united states marine bancorporation,d appellees introduced no significant evidence emphasis added ftc staples,to meet its burden,the defendants must show that the statistics give an inaccurate prediction of the proposed acquisition probable effect on competition.in addition,if a government prima facie case anticipates and addresses the respondent rebuttal evidence,as in this case,the prima facie case is very compelling and significantly strengthened.op.at complainant counsel have established a strong prima facie case.under these conditions,the respondent burden of production on rebuttal is also heightened.baker hughes,at the more compelling the prima facie case,the more evidence the defendant must present to rebut it successfully.by carefully examining the rebuttal evidence in light of strong and relevant contrary evidence in the prima facie case,the commission did not unjustifiably impose a heavy burden on to clearly disprove future effects.baker hughes,at noting that a burden to clearly disprove future effects is too onerous a standard for judging the burden of production.
analogous with the situations in olin and baker hughes,the commission here never identified the exact standard used in assessing whether the respondent rebuttal satisfied its burden of production in this case.olin,at.neither the government nor the commission urges an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the respondents.the commission reasonably found,based on substantial evidence,that somewhat ineffectual evidence did not rebut the government stalwart prima facie case.id.at automatic canteen,at.we,therefore,do not find improper in this case based on the foregoing,the commission properly applied the correct legal standards in concluding that has not rebutted complainant counsel prima facie case,at.
the commission properly analyzed the potential entry defense and had substantial evidence to conclude that potential entry evidence was insufficient to rebut the prima facie case 
a.the commission applied the correct legal standard for analyzing the potential entry defense 
also argues that the commission addressed the incorrect analytical question concerning the extent of potential entry necessary to counteract any effects.argues that the correct legal standard should have been if there was a supracompetitive price increase,entry would be sufficient to counteract such an increase.see,cargill,monfort of colorado,d in evaluating entry barriers in the context of a predatory pricing claim,however,a court should focus on whether significant entry barriers would exist after the merged firm had eliminated some of its rivals,because at that point the remaining firms would begin to charge supracompetitive prices,and the barriers that existed during competitive conditions might well prove insignificant.instead,according to,the commission considered only whether there was already entry sufficient to constrain from raising prices.mischaracterizes the commission analysis.the commission not only addressed whether existing entry is sufficient to constrain from raising prices but also used existing entry and the history of entry as evidence in determining whether future entry would be able to counteract a merger effects,such as a supracompetitive price increase.see united states general dynamics,d thus,companies that have controlled sufficiently large shares of a concentrated market are barred from merger by of the clayton act,not because of their past acts,but because their past performances imply an ability to continue to dominate with at least equal vigor.see also brown shoe,at.o nly a further examination of the particular structure,history,and probable provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive effect of the merger.ftc tea,cir.in this case,the commission clearly concluded that 
the history of these markets reveals that they have not been characterized by easy entry and expansion and have been dominated by and pdm for decades the evidence strongly suggests that this dynamic would have continued absent the merger,and and pdm own strategic planning documents predicted that the merged firm would dominate the relevant markets.thus,to determine whether the entry suggest s is likely to restore competition lost from the merger,the commission must determine whether a has occurred in the markets so as to render inapplicable the competitive conditions that have held for so long.based on the evidence,the commission conclude s that such is not the case and that the entry and expansion alleged by and pdm are not sufficient to constrain conduct in the foreseeable future.
at see also,at the commission conclude s that these new entrants do not confront with competition sufficient to constrain it from raising prices.the commission also clearly stated in light of these assertedly low entry barriers,then argue s that potential entrants either already constrain or can be expected to enter the market in the event of anticompetitive price increased by we reject arguments,at.thus,the commission concludes that if supracompetitive pricing existed,the new entrants would be insufficient to counteract exact legal standard proposes.
b.there is no structural change in the markets to indicate that the potential for future entry would be any greater than the minimal entry of the past 
also argues that the evidence of potential entry can be distinguished from the history of actual entry because structural changes in the market create a tendency toward stronger competition.see baker hughes,at citing united states int l harvester,cir.as we stated in fort worth fed.sav.loan ins.
congress provided the commission authority for arresting mergers at a time when the trend to a lessening of competition was still in its incipiency.application of this standard requires not merely an appraisal of the immediate impact of the merger upon competition,but a prediction of its impact upon competitive conditions in the future.
cir internal citations and quotations omitted.bald assertion does not rebut the government strong prima facie evidence.as we discuss later,the government provides substantial evidence of barriers to entry and substantial evidence that they will continue to exist in the near future.thus,the commission relies on substantial evidence for its prediction that no sea change in market structure distinguishes current market conditions from the history of market conditions.op.at.does not provide sufficient evidence in its rebuttal that potential entrants will overcome these entrenched barriers to and encourage stronger competition even if there are supracompetitive prices.as the commission concludes in short,the evidence in the lpg market demonstrates no more than two minor competitors submitted bids after the acquisition.we are not,however,persuaded that and represent a in the market sufficient to overcome the contrary evidence,at.
the continued existence of high entry barriers distinguishes this case from stearns airport equipment,fmc,cir in this case,the government can point to viable specific barriers to foreign firms that did not sufficiently rebut.these high barriers to entry will prevent sufficient entry to counteract supracompetitive pricing.of course,for a potential entrant or the threat of a potential entrant to act as a competitive constraint on incumbent firms,least for that be easy.baker hughes,at.the government in its prima facie case identifies substantial evidence of special industry conditions that would block and continue to block foreign entrants despite supracompetitive prices not found in the fmc or baker hughes cases where barriers to entry were low.see fmc,at 
c.the commission use of the words parity and on par does not imply the application of an incorrect legal standard 
also argues that the commission burdened petitioner with a novel and onerous entry standard,requiring new entrants to enter on par with in order for entry to be sufficient to counteract the acquisition effects.misconstrues the commission opinion by interpreting the commission use of the words on par or parity to mean the commission required new entrants to be equal to.see,at.instead,reading the use of on par or parity contextually,the commission is simply commenting on the high barriers of entry that prevent the new entrants from ever competing with on an equal footing.id.at while new suppliers appear to have gained or are seeking to gain a toehold in the market,they are not on equal footing with,and their modest progress can not restore the vibrant competition that once existed.see also id.at.for example,the commission refers to the fact that united states customers would not rate the new entrants as having a reputation on par with that of and therefore would not treat them similarly such an observation has nothing to do with applying an onerous entry standard but is merely an observation buttressing the conclusion that reputation is a potential barrier to entry,at.we read the equal footing language to mean that new entrants would be unable to compete at a level able to constrain price increases and not so literally to mean that new entrants must be equal to in competitive power.
other courts have generally concluded that for entry to constrain supracompetitive prices,the entry has to be of a sufficient scale adequate to constrain prices and break entry barriers.see united states visa usa,d,entry must be timely,likely,and of a sufficient scale to deter or counteract any anticompetitive restraints.rebel oil,at barriers may still be significant if the market is unable to correct itself despite the entry of small rivals.oahu gas,pac,cir united states falstaff brewing,d the existence of an aggressive,well equipped and well financed corporation engaged in the same or related lines of commerce waiting anxiously to enter an oligopolistic market would be a substantial incentive to competition which can not be underestimated.see also dep t of justice and fed.trade comm n,horizontal merger guidelines,at entry must be timely,likely,and sufficient in magnitude,character and scope to deter or counteract the anti competitive effects of concern.merger guidelines we read the commission opinion to suggest that entry would not be at a sufficient scale capable of competing with and piercing the barriers to entry.see,at the actual or potential entrants in this market also appear vastly overmatched by,at t he testimony of these customers does not demonstrate that they are adequate replacement for the competition that has been lost.emphasis added,at e ntry pointed to by is insufficient to constrain.emphasis added.therefore,the commission applied the correct legal standard and rightfully concluded that potential entrants would not be of a sufficient scale to compete on the same playing field as and thus would be unable to constrain the likely effects.
the commission relied on substantial evidence for its factual findings 
under the substantial evidence standard,o ur task is not to reweigh the evidence but only to determine whether there is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.gibson ftc,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.contrary to contentions,the commission did not clearly discount the merits of arguments and did not make its decision before it considered any contrary conclusion.ftc,cir.in,the commission explicitly ignored obvious eleventh circuit precedent supporting the respondent arguments.at.in this case,the commission did not ignore obvious precedent to reach an unjustified decision.the commission carefully examined and discussed various arguments.we therefore find attempt to analogize this case to is without merit.
in respect to its argument that the commission did not rely on substantial evidence for its factual findings,challenges the commission opinion on three grounds a the government proffered hhi statistics were misleading predictors of probable future competitiveness in the markets b the commission finding of nearly insurmountable entry barriers ignores rebuttal evidence to the contrary and c the commission finding that customers have no real alternatives to.
a.the proffered hhis can be used as indicators of probable future competitiveness 
the hhis are just one element in the government strong prima facie case.market concentration figures should be examined in the context of the entire prima facie case.see heinz,at.here,the prima facie case establishes without dispute that the two dominant,and often only,players in these four domestic markets are merging.this indisputable fact bolster s the government market concentration figures.see id.where the hhi exceeds,and the merger produces an increase in the hhi of more than points,the merger guidelines create a presumption of adverse competitive consequences.see merger guidelines.at see also united states loew,cir ftc cardinal health,d.the increases in hhis in this case are extremely high.hhi increases of for the tank market,for the lpg tank market,for the lng tank market,and for the tvc tank market are predicted.an hhi of denotes a complete monopoly.see areeda hovenkamp,at.hhis for the four markets are for,for lpg,and for the lng and tvc markets.
now urges us to disagree with the commission rejection of the alj conclusion that the hhis were unreliable because the hhis relied on sporadic sales data,which would generate unreliable market share data.we may scrutinize the hhi statistics more carefully when the commission conclusion differs from the alj,as in this case.see,at.the commission agrees with the alj that the use of hhis based solely on sales from the period is unreliable,and therefore extended the sales data time period to a period.when sales data are sporadic,a longer historical perspective may be necessary.the department of justice and federal trade commission merger guidelines which describe the standards applied by the government in exercising its prosecutorial discretion in the realm,note,t ypically,annual data are used,but where individual sales are large and infrequent so that annual data may be unrepresentative,the department of justice and the commission may measure market shares over a longer period of time.merger guidelines.at,at areeda hovenkamp,at noting that averaging over a significantly long period of time is a solution,albeit an imperfect solution,to lumpy sales statistics.regardless,the commission adequately explained why it chose an extended period the extended period provided more data points,which averages out the fluctuations and chance outcomes and presents no evidence that a structural change affected the market,and thus the same market conditions persist in the as the period,except the period has additional data points.see,at,llc.
in any event,places too much weight on the hhis as a dispositive measure of market concentration when other indicators of the market structure and history of the market clearly bolster what the hhis already rivals are limited and and pdm are the only two firms with any market power in these markets.see ftc warner communications,cir concluding that concentration statistics merely provide a meaningful context within which to address the question of the merger competitive effects.citing dynamics,at.see also ftc ppg,noting that the use of the hhis rests upon the theory,that,where rivals are few,firms will be able to coordinate their behavior,either by overt collusion or implicit understanding,in order to restrict output and achieve profits above competitive levels.the commission also provided evidence of high entry barriers and customers perception of differences between and potential entrants.see infra section.iii.these circumstances justify a conclusion of high market concentration.see,reynolds tobacco cigarettes cheaper,cir concluding that when the market is concentrated the index exceeds,new entry is difficult if not impossible,and customers perceive quality differences among brands,a finding of high market concentration is justified.we do not see a problem with using the hhis as part of this totality of circumstances that indicate this acquisition potential effects.see baker hughes,at.
in addition to its challenge of the selection of the time period,also argues that the sporadic nature of the sales data undermines all evidence of market power.in baker hughes,at,the circuit did conclude that a small number of sales of an esoteric product may suggest concentration statistics are misleading.in lockheed martin boeing,d,the court dismissed monopolization claims for the satellite launch services for the government market,because the sales data was limited to two launch contracts.we agree that reliance on very limited data,such as two data points may undermine an entire prima facie case.however,we find this to be a very limited exception,such as the extreme situation in lockheed martin,because the academic literature has not accepted any broad conclusion that small markets are all per se problematic.see areeda hovenkamp,at see also ftc food town stores,cir the fact that the markets in which the firms compete may be small is irrelevant under the clayton act,and does not affect the legality of the merger.
in contrast,for three of the four markets here,the data underlying the hhi for market concentration is not nearly as sparse as that in lockheed martin.for the lng market,from to the acquisition date,nine lng tank plants were i won five and pdm won four,at.out of all lng plants in the united states,and pdm constructed all but six of them the six were constructed by a now competitor.id.at.for the lpg market,out of the eleven lpg tank projects awarded in the united states between and,won five and pdm won four,at.from to the acquisition,tanks were constructed and and pdm built of these tanks.id.at.the third major player,accounting for of those tanks,went out of business in.id.at.this history provides substantial evidence for discerning a trend towards increased market concentration.however,for the same reasons as in lockheed martin,we conclude that the evidence in the tvc market is too sparse and sporadic for that market hhi statistics to be a reliable factor.lockheed martin,d at.the tvc market hhi statistic relies on only one tvc tank project and another proposed project within the period,at.even without the hhi,we find substantial evidence,as did the alj,to support the commission conclusion that the acquisition has a pronounced effect in the tvc market sufficient to establish the prima facie case.the government produced evidence that and pdm were the only two competitors in the market since.see,at.the government also provided ample other evidence to establish its strong prima facie case,such as customer testimony,history of the market,and and pdm internal documents.see,at.
we find that the record contains substantial evidence to support the commission finding that the hhis are not completely irrelevant in three of the four markets.instead of ignoring hhis,we agree with the commission that they should be viewed with caution and within the larger picture of trends and market structure.see brown shoe,at.trends in the market and the government other evidence favor what the hhis also indicate the proposed merger will substantially lessen competition.even excluding the hhis,the government other evidence independently suffices to establish a prima facie case in all markets,including the tvc market.
merger guidelines 
also contends the commission committed reversible error because the commission failed to follow the merger guidelines.at.argues the commission,in contravention of the merger guidelines,did not credit the field of potential entrants with an equal likelihood to win bids but instead identified as a dominant player and a likely winner in all bid competitions.
argument is without merit.misconstrues the language it cites in the merger guidelines the merger guidelines.at,simply state w here all firms have,on a basis,an equal likelihood of securing sales,the department of justice and the federal trade commission will assign firms equal market shares.under this rule,in order to apply an equal number of market shares to the field of competitors,as urges,the competitors,on a basis,must have an equal likelihood of securing sales.the commission relied on substantial and overwhelming evidence that there is no equal likelihood to secure bids given the high entry barriers,because of reputation and control of skilled crews.see infra section.iii.
commission rejection of rebuttal arguments,alleged market entry and low entry barriers,is supported by substantial evidence 
evidence has little probative weight if it is manipulable,and evidence in this case is reasonably viewed as manipulable.
we agree with that evidence may be useful in determining the possibility that new entrants would counteract the effects of an acquisition.whether evidence is admissible depends on the nature of the evidence.dailey,at.nevertheless,there are significant reasons why evidence probative value may be limited.the supreme court has so concluded by noting 
t he probative value of evidence was found to be extremely limited,and judgments against the government were in each instance reversed in part because too much weight had been given to postacquisition events.the need for such a limitation is obvious.if a demonstration that no anticompetitive effects had occurred at the time of trial or of judgment constituted a permissible defense to a divestiture suit,violators could stave off such actions merely by refraining from aggressive or anticompetitive behavior when such a suit was threatened or pending.
general dynamics,at.see also alberta gas chemicals du pont de nemours and,cir.the probative value of such evidence is deemed limited not just when evidence is actually subject to manipulation,but rather is deemed of limited value whenever such evidence could arguably be subject to manipulation.see vendo,cir the evidence in this case is the type which can not arguably have been subject to the defendant deliberate manipulation,nor is it likely that the market was less competitive after the acquisition than it would have been otherwise.emphasis added hosp.of am.ftc,cir evidence that is subject to manipulation by the party seeking to use it is entitled to little or no weight.emphasis added.argues that its evidence is probative,because there is no evidence manipulated the evidence.we disagree.any discussion concerning alleged manipulation of evidence is irrelevant,because the evidence probative weight is lessened if it is arguably subject to possible manipulation.the commission was correct to hold that evidence subject to manipulation was the correct standard when deciding whether evidence is probative.see,at t he price reductions cited by the respondents occurred well after the complaint in this case issued and are the type of evidence that is wholly manipulable.the evidence is arguably manipulable because the existence of actual and potential entry sufficient to constrain effects is based on the purported success of these entrants in the bid markets.could refuse to bid or negotiate with draconian terms in the immediate aftermath of the acquisition so as to permit entrants to win a few bids so as to bolster the market appearance of competitiveness 
ii.evidence of actual entry 
using evidence,argues that,foreign competitors have made significant inroads into the four markets and won several bids.therefore,argues this rebuttal evidence shows how actual entrants can constrain effects.however,the government contends this evidence of actual entry that relies on in its brief is outside the administrative record and hence outside the scope of our review.the evidence in question includes bidding on the hackberry project past the preliminary stages in fact,the brief quotes verbatim passages from evidence attached to motion to adduce that we denied.the evidence in question also includes the bids regarding the cheniere corpus christi and sabine pass and certain other outstanding bid competitions golden pass lng and washington gas.cites to its petition for reconsideration filed with the commission below when discussing this evidence.
assuming arguendo that the evidence should be considered,it does not alter or affect our decision only one piece of this evidence would possibly be relevant to our decision,and this evidence of one successful entry by a foreign company does not affect the substantial evidence upon which the commission based its decision and our decision to deny petition.prime example of actual entry is dynegy hackberry project,which was awarded to a foreign firm,skanska,at the outset,but then awarded to another foreign firm,ihi.argues that this is evidence that lost two chances to work on the large hackberry project.inaccurately characterizes the evidence.the commission noted that this evidence was for the whole lng port,and there was supposed to be a separate bid for the tank work as a.at.as for the freeport lng project,after learning that it was not awarded the entire project,withdrew from any participation in the project,which might have yielded some tank work as a.id.at.the only bid possibly lost on the merits was lng tank work in the sabine pass project.this single instance is not enough to undermine the commission conclusion that the rebuttal evidence of actual entry was not sufficient.the evidence also shows that was awarded three contracts for lng tanks in addition to the five commitments before the record closed.at.the proffered evidence tends to reflect that actual entry into lng market was marginal at best.
iii.did not rebut evidence of high entry barriers,so a potential entry theory fails 
in the alternative,if the evidence of actual entry is not admitted,contends these large foreign firms are potential entrants that may constrain the effects.argument is without merit.a potential entrant ability to constrain market power is used in contexts when there is an ease of market entry.see united states marine bancorporation,d e ase of entry on the part of the acquiring firm is a central premise of the doctrine.fmc,at if barriers in an industry are low,new entrants into the industry will appear when the monopolist raises its prices.the mere existence of potential entrants does not by itself rebut the nature of an acquisition.the potential entry must face low enough barriers for a threat of potential entry to be likely.therefore assertions that potential entry may meaningfully constrain market power turns on the existence of low or no entry barriers.see reazin blue cross blue shield of kansas,cir thus,we agree with the district court that it properly focused the jury attention on barriers to meaningful which could inhibit anticompetitive conduct.citing united states waste,cir yamaha motor,ftc,cir noting that an alleged potential entrant must have a substantial likelihood of ultimately producing deconcentration of that market or other significant procompetitive effects quoting marine bancorporation,at.
we will,therefore,consider potential entry argument in concert with evidence regarding the barriers to entry.contends the commission conclusion that failed to rebut the three main barriers to entry offered in the government prima facie case,regulatory and technical expertise,and access to local labor and trained supervisors,is not based on substantial evidence.based on the substantial evidence standard,as long as the commission derives a reasonable inference from the evidence that failed to rebut the prima facie case,we defer to the commission findings.see gibson at.
we agree with that general reputation alone is not an effective barrier to entry.am.prof l testing,harcourt brace jovanovich legal prof l publ ns,cir see also fmc,at.however,unlike fmc and am.prof l testing,the government presents something more than just generalized reputation as a market entry barrier.instead,what the government presents as reputation is reputation for particular traits.see advo philadelphia newspapers,cir w e do not question the judgment of other courts of appeals that in other market contexts reputation is a significant barrier to entry.citing thompson metro,cir philips windmere,see also united tote.at.advo concludes that reputation evidence could be considered a market barrier if there is some limiting principle.id.at.the government presents its reputation evidence in a limited fashion reputation is considered in this case as a proxy for experience and success in building lng projects in the united states,foremost an understanding of regulations,labor force,and.is therefore able to distinguish its brand within the industry as the foremost and now only domestic expert.compare,at,with dimmitt agri,cpc int l,cir when a seller possesses an overwhelmingly dominant share of the market,however,and differentiates its product from others through a recognized and extensively advertised brand name,thereby enabling the seller to control prices or unreasonably restrict competition,then monopoly power may be found to exist.quoting borden,ftc,cir.therefore,the commission has substantial evidence for its determination that the reputation for expertise and experience in building tank projects in the united states is a barrier to entry,and thus the potential entrants international reputation evidence offered in rebuttal is inapposite.
the commission presented substantial evidence that domestic reputation was critical to the bidding process in this industry,which failed to rebut the commission showed that a the bidding evaluation process takes into account the bidders experience and history with various projects,see op.at b customers testimony acknowledging reputation,including domestic reputation,as important for choosing bidders,see op.at,and c the industry requires highly sophisticated and specialized construction work and credits reputation and an established brand name,because brand names have a track record with highly specialized and skilled local crews,see op.at.therefore,we find the commission presented substantial evidence that reputation in this specific industry context is a barrier to entry and that failed to rebut this evidence.
regulatory and technical experience 
also challenges the commission conclusion that regulatory experience with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is a barrier to entry.ability to do ferc work is a component of the bidding proposal and,in its own advertising materials,advertises ferc familiarity with and its respect for.op.at.ferc expertise can be analogized to other technical prerequisites to doing business in a market that are considered barriers to entry.see united states syufy,cir it is well known that some of the most insuperable barriers in the great race of competition are the result of government regulation.rebel oil,at noting that one main source of entry barriers is legal license requirements.reazin blue cross blue shield of,aff,cir,cert.denied,d recognizing as an entry of barrier the clout with kansas hospitals,which defendant itself recognizes.united states blue bell,recognizing familiarity with setting up the business as a barrier to entry atl.richfield,at recognizing technical expertise as a barrier to entry.there is strong prima facie evidence from one customer that a lack of ferc experience is a and a reason to award contracts,at.while we agree with that owners are responsible for filing applications and other outside consultants are available,the fact remains that as part of the bidding process,customers select lng tank builders depending on whether they would be able to help with the highly technical application process as a component of a whole lng tank building project.does present evidence that one foreign firm successfully guided a huge project towards ferc compliance.we can not conclude that this single instance is production of sufficient evidence to rebut the commission finding on this issue however,even if it were,it is not sufficient evidence to rebut the commission general conclusion that high entry barriers exist in these markets based on the findings concerning the other two barriers.
c.the control over the specialized labor force 
control of essential or superior resources is a recognized barrier to entry.image technical,eastman kodak,cir.employee skill levels required for a firm to be successful can be considered a barrier to entry.see in re ibm peripheral edp devices antitrust.here,the government presents specific evidence that employee skills in cryogenic tank construction is a limited resource significantly captured by.see,at.controls highly specialized supervisory crews resulting in quicker turnaround construction time and bids.id.has also developed specialized and proprietary welding techniques and trained crews with those techniques.id.at.as the commission notes,does not present sufficient rebuttal evidence that potential entrants would be able to develop comparable techniques and train sufficient numbers of supervisory personnel to effectively compete.
we find that the commission conclusion that evidence does not rebut the strong prima facie case for at least two high entry barriers is a reasonable inference from the evidence presented.
rejection of rebuttal evidence that sophisticated customers have meaningful alternatives to is supported by substantial evidence 
in the proceedings below,argues that because customers in these markets are large and sophisticated consumers,they would be able to constrain the effects by altering the bid process and searching for alternatives.assuming arguendo the rebuttal evidence for sophisticated customer defense is part of the administrative record,still has not produced sufficient evidence to rebut the government prima facie case based on evidence that large and sophisticated customers continue to choose for contracts without any bidding,and that has utilized its market power to force contracts by choosing not to participate in bidding.see at.in other words,there is no history nor other indication that customers who formerly relied on and pdm for tank design,engineering,and construction services will undertake to perform them on their own.the absence of such evidence,together with the lack of evidence of adequate entry of competitors,undermine the basic premise for this defense.in this respect,this case is unlike baker hughes,which relies on heavily,where there were ample available alternatives for customers in a market with low entry barriers.at internal citations omitted id.at because the defendants also provided compelling evidence on ease of entry into this market,we need not decide whether these findings,without more,are sufficient to rebut the government prima facie case.in addition,unlike in baker hughes,pricing data for the four markets are mostly confidential from,and thus buyers are generally unable to ascertain whether is imposing supracompetitive prices on any particular bid weakening buyers ability to demand competitive prices.see united states country lake foods,at.therefore customers have imperfect information and a weak bargaining position that is compounded by the lack of meaningful alternatives.certain powers held by the customer that would favor a sophisticated customer defense are listed in united states.such powers are not present here.under,the conditions include the customers ability to 
a refus e to reveal the prices quoted by other suppliers and the price which a supplier must meet to obtain or retain business,creating uncertainty among suppliers.
b swing large volume back and forth among suppliers to show each supplier that it better quote a lower price to obtain and keep large volume sales.
c delay agreement to a contract and refusing to purchase product until a supplier accedes to acceptable terms.
d hold out the threat of inducing a new entrant into hfcs production and assuring the new entrant adequate volume and returns 
none of the factors apply to the present situation,in which a buyers can not compare past bids not only because they are mostly confidential,but also because each project is unique b as we noted earlier,the market has had only two dominant players,pdm and,so buyers can not now swing back and forth between competitors to lower bids c instances of pressuring customers to offer contracts by withdrawing its bid and success at obtaining contracts undermine any argument that buyers have the ability to pressure in contract negotiations and d no buyer can assure that a new entrant has adequate volume and returns for meaningful entry into the market as there is no evidence that buying power is sufficiently concentrated.
in addition,courts have not considered the sophisticated customer defense as itself independently adequate to rebut a prima facie case.although the courts have not yet found that power buyers alone enable a defendant to overcome the government presumption of,courts have found that the existence of power buyers can be considered in their evaluation of an case,along with such other factors as the ease of entry and likely efficiencies.cardinal health,d at see also areeda hovenkamp,at.moreover,the economic argument for even partially rebutting a presumptive case,because a market is dominated by large buyers,is weak.see id.at concluding that it would be inappropriate to give formal recognition to buyer concentration and related factors in the ordinary run of merger cases.we therefore agree with the commission that evidence of sophisticated customers does not carry the burden for producing evidence sufficient to rebut the commission prima facie case.
the commission did not abuse its discretion in issuing its remedy provisions 
a.the remedial provisions are not overbroad nor punitive 
argues that the commission remedial provisions are overbroad and punitive.we review the commission remedial mandates for abuse of discretion.jacob siegel ftc.a ll doubts as to the remedy are to be resolved in the commission favor.united states dupont de nemours,d.the commission is clothed with wide discretion in determining the type of order that is necessary to bring an end to the unfair practices found to exist.ftc lead,d.it has wide latitude for judgment and the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.id.internal quotations omitted.
in this case,the commission ordered a divestiture of assets to create a competitor,new pdm,capable of competing on an equal footing.see,at.objects to this remedy,because it would require divestment of pdm water division and potentially other assets the government argues that though the assets are unrelated to the construction of cryogenic tanks,they are necessary to enable the separate entity to compete with on an equal footing.total divestiture is not necessarily inappropriate even though the antitrust violation found relates to but one aspect of the company thus acquired,especially where,as here,total divestiture is deemed necessary to restore effective competition.okc ftc,cir.total divestiture here does not appear to be a remedy that has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.toys r us,ftc,cir quoting siegel,at.here,the violation is the acquisition of a previously viable and independent entity capable of competing on an equal footing.the commission divestiture of the water plant division along with the cryogenic tank division is consistent with and relevant to creating a viable competitor,because the water department provides a consistent revenue stream to complement sporadic tank sales.compare olin,at,with op.at.we should be clear to note that the order does not create,as so misconstrues,two competitors of equal size.instead,the remedy only mandates the entities be capable of competing for an equal share of the market similar to the situation.at.therefore,as the commission concluded when the petitioner raised similar arguments below,the new and new pdm consist of two competitors capable of competing on an equal footing in the relevant businesses as was the situation before the acquisition,at.this means the new pdm only has to become an entity equally capable of competing in the future the order does not intend to be split into two equal halves.id.instead,the order carefully devolves discretion to and a monitor to determine how assets must be divided to effectuate the order and its general remedial purpose.op.at w e have included a provision that allows the exclusion of the water assets if the acquirer and monitor trustee both find them unnecessary.accordingly,as we read the commission order,and the moni
