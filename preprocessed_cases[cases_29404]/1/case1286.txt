bonnilyn mascio appeals the social security administration denial of her application for supplemental security income benefits.because we conclude that the administrative law judge erred by not conducting a analysis,by ignoring without explanation mascio moderate limitation in her ability to maintain her concentration,persistence,or pace,and by determining mascio residual functional capacity before assessing her credibility,we reverse and remand.
mascio alleges that she is disabled from severe degenerative disc disease,carpal tunnel syndrome,and adjustment disorder in,an administrative law judge alj found that mascio was not disabled,but the district court reversed and the case was remanded to a second alj for another hearing and disability determination.the second alj found that mascio was not disabled from march,to november,mascio lost her administrative appeal and filed a complaint in the district court,which granted the commissioner motion for judgment on the pleadings and upheld the denial of benefits.this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court decision on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.korotynska metro.life ins,cir.we will affirm the social security administration disability determination when an alj has applied correct legal standards and the alj factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.bird comm r of soc.sec,cir.mascio does not dispute the alj factual findings but argues that the alj made four legal errors by not conducting a analysis not including mascio concentration,persistence,or pace limitation in his hypothetical to the vocational expert determining mascio residual functional capacity before assessing her credibility and not applying the great weight rule to mascio subjective claims of pain.
before turning to mascio arguments,we provide an overview of the sequential evaluation that aljs use to make disability determinations.
the social security administration regulations describe the process in detail.see a.to summarize,the alj asks at step one whether the claimant has been working at step two,whether the claimant medical impairments meet the regulations severity and duration requirements at step three,whether the medical impairments meet or equal an impairment listed in the regulations at step four,whether the claimant can perform her past work given the limitations caused by her medical impairments and at step five,whether the claimant can perform other work.
the first four steps create a series of hurdles for claimants to meet.if the alj finds that the claimant has been working step one or that the claimant medical impairments do not meet the severity and duration requirements of the regulations step two,the process ends with a finding of not disabled.at step three,the alj either finds that the claimant is disabled because her impairments match a listed impairment or continues the analysis.the alj can not deny benefits at this step.
if the first three steps do not lead to a conclusive determination,the alj then assesses the claimant residual functional capacity,which is the most the claimant can still do despite physical and mental limitations that affect her ability to work.id.a.to make this assessment,the alj must consider all of the claimant medically determinable impairments of which the alj is aware,including those not labeled severe at step two.id.a.
the alj then moves on to step four,where the alj can find the claimant not disabled because she is able to perform her past work.or,if the exertion required for the claimant past work exceeds her residual functional capacity,the alj goes on to step five.
at step five,the burden shifts to the commissioner to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the claimant can perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy,considering the claimant residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience.id.a v c.the commissioner typically offers this evidence through the testimony of a vocational expert responding to a hypothetical that incorporates the claimant limitations.if the commissioner meets her burden,the alj finds the claimant not disabled and denies the application for benefits.
in this case,at step one,the alj determined that mascio had not been working.at step two,he found that mascio had four severe impairments degenerative disc disease,carpal tunnel syndrome,adjustment disorder,and a history of substance,alone or together,met the regulations duration requirement.at step three,he decided that mascio impairments did not meet or equal any of the impairments listed in the regulations.
the alj then found that mascio had the residual functional capacity to perform light work,except that she was further limited to chang ing between sitting and standing every minutes option only occasional climbing,balancing,bending,stooping,crouching or crawling no more than frequent fingering no exposure to hazards such as unprotected heights or dangerous machinery and,due to her adjustment disorder,only unskilled work.at step four,he concluded that mascio could not perform her past work based on her residual functional capacity.finally,at step five,he found that mascio could perform other work and therefore was not disabled.
with this background in mind,we turn to mascio contentions of error.
mascio first argues that the alj erred in assessing her residual functional capacity because he did not conduct a analysis.we agree that,on the facts of this case,the alj failure to perform this analysis requires remand.
mascio argument rests on social security ruling which explains how adjudicators should assess residual functional capacity.the ruling instructs that the residual functional capacity assessment must first identify the individual functional limitations or restrictions and assess his or her abilities on a basis,including the functions listed in the regulations ssr,july.only after that may residual functional capacity be expressed in terms of the exertional levels of work,sedentary,light,medium,heavy,and very heavy.id.the ruling further explains that the residual functional capacity assessment must include a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each conclusion,citing specific medical facts,laboratory findings and nonmedical evidence,daily activities,observations.id.at.
mascio contends that the alj did not follow these procedures.the commissioner responds that mascio argument is moot because the alj found at step four that mascio could not perform her past work.we,however,find the commissioner argument unconvincing because aljs clearly use the residual functional capacity finding at steps four and five.see id.at see also id.at at step of the sequential evaluation process,w ithout a careful consideration of an individual functional capacities to support a residual functional capacity assessment based on an exertional category,the adjudicator may either overlook limitations or restrictions that would narrow the ranges and types of work an individual may be able to do,or find that the individual has limitations or restrictions that he or she does not actually have.emphasis added.
alternatively,the commissioner urges us to join other circuits that have rejected a per se rule requiring remand when the alj does not perform an explicit analysis.see,cichocki astrue,cir per curiam citing cases from the sixth,seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits.we agree that a per se rule is inappropriate given that remand would prove futile in cases where the alj does not discuss functions that are irrelevant or uncontested.id.but declining to adopt a per se rule does not end our inquiry.in that regard,we agree with the second circuit that r emand may be appropriate where an alj fails to assess a claimant capacity to perform relevant functions,despite contradictory evidence in the record,or where other inadequacies in the alj analysis frustrate meaningful review.id.we find this to be such a case.
here,the alj has determined what functions he believes mascio can perform,but his opinion is sorely lacking in the analysis needed for us to review meaningfully those conclusions.in particular,although the alj concluded that m
