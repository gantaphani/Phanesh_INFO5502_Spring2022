opinion of the court 
this is an appeal of the federal aviation administration approval of a significant expansion of philadelphia international airport.disputing the faa air quality analysis,collectively tinicum allege violations of the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the consistency provision of the airport and airway improvement act,a.because we find the federal aviation administration decision was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,we will deny the petition for review.
philadelphia international airport phl is the primary commercial airport for the philadelphia region and the ninth busiest airport in the united states.since,phl has been among the ten most delayed airports in the national airspace system and has contributed to delays at airports throughout the united states.the delays arise from inadequate airfield capacity at phl.the airport runways are too short,too close together,and too few.
aware of these shortcomings,the city of philadelphia,which owns and operates phl,commenced in a study of airport facility needs.the study found that,in its current configuration,delays at phl would increase from an average of over ten minutes per operation in,which the faa considers severe,to over nineteen minutes per operation in.the faa warns that delays of this magnitude lead both passengers and airlines to avoid an airport.to forestall these mounting delays and the consequent loss of airlines,the city sought faa approval to expand phl by extending two existing runways and constructing a new runway.
after receiving the city proposal in,the faa decided to prepare an environmental impact statement eis in accordance with nepa.the phl expansion project was designated high priority and slated for expedited environmental review under the aviation streamlining approval process act,and an executive order prioritizing national transportation infrastructure projects,exec.order.to comply with this national policy priority,the faa collaborated with the city of philadelphia,the environmental protection agency epa,and several other interested federal and state agencies to develop a streamlining agreement that established agency roles,milestones for agency actions,and a dispute resolution procedure.
as part of the process,the faa developed an air quality analysis protocol,which set out the scope,models,and procedures for its air quality analysis.it circulated a draft of the protocol for input from interested parties in and finalized the protocol in.in september,having completed the studies called for in the protocol,the faa published a,page draft eis.in relevant part,the draft set forth the procedures used to analyze the project air quality impacts and the results of that analysis.it also incorporated by reference a draft air quality technical report,which further detailed the methodologies and data underlying the faa analysis.
to assess the project air quality impacts,the faa conducted a detailed emissions analysis of two potential project alternatives build alternatives a and b and a third alternative of not undertaking the project the alternative.in a table known as an emissions inventory,the faa estimated the total emissions of six air pollutants under the two build alternatives for each of the thirteen years of construction.the faa calculated the future impact of the project on phl operational emissions by comparing predicted total emissions under the build and alternatives in two years,and to obtain a more detailed assessment of operational air quality impacts,the faa conducted dispersion modeling,an analytical technique that converts an emissions inventory into estimates of outdoor concentrations of pollutants at particular locations.
in november,the epa submitted comments on the draft eis citing alleged data omissions in the faa analysis.the faa considered and responded to each of the epa comments in the final eis,issued on august.some of the faa responses described revisions to the air quality analysis it had adopted based on epa comments.others explained the faa decision to stand by its chosen analytical approach.
appended to the final eis was the faa general conformity determination,a formal determination under the clean air act and related regulations that the project would not interfere with pennsylvania compliance with national air quality standards.in that document,the faa summarized its findings operational emissions,airport emissions after project completion of volatile organic compounds voc,nitrogen oxides nox,fine particulate matter of less than micrograms,and sulfur dioxide would be below the de minimis thresholds established by epa regulations construction emissions of and would be below the de minimis levels construction emissions of nox would exceed the de minimis thresholds in certain years,but the city of philadelphia would be required to apply airport emission reduction credits to bring those emissions below the threshold and voc emissions would exceed de minimis levels during certain years of construction,but the city would be required to fully offset those emissions by acquiring and applying emission reduction credits 
the publication of the final eis concluded the nepa process,but agency discussions on the air quality studies continued.on september,the epa again submitted comments on the faa study design.after several weeks of dialogue,some differences of opinion remained.on december,the faa published its record of decision,which approved the expansion project and delineated the faa reasons for approval.the record of decision included a finding that the project was reasonably consistent with existing plans of public agencies for development of areas surrounding the airport,as required by the consistency provision of the airport and airway improvement act,a.
phl lies on the boundary between the city and county of philadelphia on the east and tinicum township,delaware county,on the west.the expansion project calls for the acquisition of land to the west of the airport and will result in the displacement of a number of residences and businesses in tinicum township.
tinicum petitioned for review of the record of decision,which constituted final agency action subject to review under the administrative procedures act apa.see.we review the faa action under the apa arbitrary and capricious standard.a requiring that a reviewing court hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.we confine our review to the administrative record upon which the faa record of decision was based.see dep t of health human,cir citing citizens to overton park,volpe,d 
the faa conducted the air quality analysis at issue to meet the overlapping requirements of nepa and the clean air act.nepa is a procedural statute that does not mandate particular substantive results.dep t of envtl.prot.nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.nepa procedural requirements aim to ensure that an agency consider s every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action and inform s the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.id.at quoting baltimore gas nrdc,d internal quotation marks omitted.

the clean air act establishes a joint federal and state program to limit air pollution by setting national ambient air quality standards naaqs.see.the epa sets the naaqs for specified pollutants,including sulfur dioxide,carbon monoxide,ozone,lead,nitrogen dioxide,coarse particulate matter of less than ten micrometers in diameter,and fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter.each state then must adopt and submit to epa for approval a plan called a state implementation plan sip to meet the national standards.federal agencies,in turn,must ensure that their actions conform to the applicable sip.c.epa regulations set forth specific requirements for this conformity determination.agency actions that will result in emissions below the de minimis levels set by epa regulations do not require a formal conformity determination.see b.
because the epa is charged with administering and implementing the clean air act and has significant responsibilities under the national environmental policy act,tinicum urges us to defer to its comments on the faa air quality analysis under chevron res.def.council,d.we extend chevron deference to an agency action if congress intended the action to carry the force of law.swallows holding,comm r of internal revenue,cir.in urging deference here,tinicum misapprehends the epa role in commenting on the faa environmental impact statement.ceq regulations require the lead agency,the faa in this case,to o btain the comments of any federal agency that has jurisdiction or special expertise or is authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards,including the epa here.a.the epa and other relevant agencies then review and comment on the eis.responding,the lead agency may modify the alternative action it has reviewed develop and evaluate new alternative actions supplement,improve,or modify its analyses make factual corrections or e xplain why the comments do not warrant further agency response a.and if,in its review of an agency action,the epa determines that it is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or welfare or environmental quality,the clean air act directs the epa to refer the matter to the council on environmental quality.b.significantly,the epa did not do so here.
under this statutory and regulatory framework,the epa comments do not carry the force of law and do not warrant deference.see mercy catholic med.ctr.thompson,cir noting that chevron deference is inapplicable to agency interpretations rendered in opinion letters,policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines.as the circuit noted in similar circumstances,the faa does not have to follow the epa comments slavishly it just has to take them seriously.citizens against burlington,busey.accordingly,we review whether the faa gave sufficient consideration to the epa comments.
citing the epa comments,tinicum alleges five technical errors in the faa air quality analysis that purportedly render its environmental review inadequate under nepa.each allegation pertains to a category of data excluded from the faa analysis.while additional data might enable a more detailed environmental analysis,nepa does not require maximum detail.rather,it requires agencies to make a series of decisions based on the significance and usefulness of additional information.coalition on sensible transp.dole.with this in mind,we review the faa air quality analysis,considering each of the alleged technical defects.
the faa divided its analysis of the project air quality impacts into two time periods the construction period and the operational period.in its study of construction period emissions,the faa compiled an emissions inventory that detailed,for each year of construction,all emissions of sulfur dioxide,nitrogen oxides nox,volatile organic compounds vocs,and fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter.the inventory included anticipated emissions from construction vehicles and equipment,asphalt paving,fugitive dust,the vehicles of commuting construction workers,and additional aircraft emissions due to delays caused by construction.the faa compared total emissions against the de minimis emissions levels set by the epa conformity regulations under the clean air act and found that during the construction period emissions of and would be below the de minimis thresholds set by epa regulations.but the faa also found that emissions of voc would exceed the de minimis threshold in the fifth,sixth,and eighth years of construction and that emissions of nox would exceed the threshold in the second,fifth,and sixth years.accordingly,the record of decision calls on the city of philadelphia to acquire and apply emissions credits to fully offset voc and nox emissions during those particular years.
citing an epa comment,tinicum claims that nepa required the faa to go further and model the dispersion of these construction period emissions to show how they would affect local ambient concentrations of pollutants in the area.we disagree.as the faa explained,aside from emissions of two pollutants over short periods of time,emissions levels during construction would fall below the de minimis thresholds defined by the epa conformity regulations.those levels have been set to reflect activities that by definition could not threaten a state attainment of the goals in its sip.envtl.def.fund.meanwhile,the emissions of two pollutants that would exceed de minimis thresholds for a short period of time would be fully offset by emissions credits for reductions in emissions at phl and elsewhere.moreover,the faa approach to construction emissions was consistent with the air quality analysis protocol agreed to by the faa and the epa.for these reasons,the faa decision to stop short of dispersion modeling for the construction period was not arbitrary or capricious.
we reach the same conclusion in our review of the faa analysis of operational emissions upon completion of the project.to evaluate operational emissions,the faa prepared an inventory of anticipated airport emissions for the years and.using the anticipated emissions under the alternative as a point of comparison,the faa found the expansion project would initially decrease operational emissions by significantly reducing the time that delayed aircraft spent waiting and taxiing on congested runways.five years after project completion,emissions of certain pollutants would increase slightly relative to the alternative as airlines made use of additional runway capacity.significantly,the faa determined that any increase in emissions would fall well below the de minimis thresholds.although this finding was sufficient to satisfy the conformity regulations,the faa decided to conduct dispersion modeling of the project operational emissions to better analyze and disclose the project ongoing impact on ambient concentrations of air pollutants.
the epa commented that this modeling did not include nearby sources of and suggested that this omission conflicts with epa guidance on air quality modeling but the faa had already demonstrated that the project impact on operational emissions was de minimis,and no modeling at all was required under the conformity regulations.see.further,in its response to the epa,the faa noted that the dispersion modeling it had conducted was intended to assess the project impact on ambient concentrations near phl.because the project would not affect emissions from nearby sources,adding those sources to its dispersion model would not help assess that impact.
the epa also questioned the faa decision not to model the effect of building downwash,the tendency of buildings to
