after nearly years of coal mine employment,dallas owens became totally disabled because of breathing difficulties,and in april,he filed a claim for black lung benefits.an administrative law judge alj found that owens claim triggered the rebuttable presumption for benefits under c,available to miners who are totally disabled and have worked years or more in underground coal mines,and that mingo logan coal company,owens former employer,failed to rebut the presumption.the alj therefore awarded benefits to owens,and the benefits review board affirmed.
on appeal,mingo logan contends that the alj and the board applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating whether it had met its rebuttal burden,erroneously limiting it to the two methods that the text of the statute specifies are the only means by which the secretary may rebut the presumption.see c providing,the secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that a such miner does not,or did not,have pneumoconiosis,or that b his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.mingo logan contends that limiting it to these two methods of rebuttal violated not only the clear language of c,which makes the rebuttal limitations applicable to the secretary,but also the supreme court holding in usery turner elkhorn mining,construing the statute to place no limitations on the means by which an employer may satisfy its burden on rebuttal.
both owens and the director of the office of workers compensation programs argue that even though the statute does not,by its terms,limit employers to the two specified methods of rebuttal,logic does,and therefore the alj and the board articulated the correct legal standard.
we do not reach mingo logan challenge to the standard announced by the board to rebut the c presumption of entitlement to benefits,because we conclude that the alj did not in fact apply rebuttal limitations to mingo logan,and the board affirmed the alj analysis.because we also find that mingo logan other challenges to the alj factual findings lack merit,we affirm the board award of benefits.accordingly,we deny mingo logan petition for review.
owens worked in west virginia coal mines for close to years,beginning in,and he spent the last of those years working in coal mines as an electrician for mingo logan coal company.he stopped working in when he developed difficulty breathing,a problem that got worse with time.in april,owens filed a claim under the black lung benefits act,which awards benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.see et.the statute implementing regulations define the term pneumoconiosis to include not only those diseases medically recognized as pneumoconiosis clinical pneumoconiosis,but also any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment legal pneumoconiosis.a.a claims examiner found that owens was eligible for benefits and ordered mingo logan to pay him a month.mingo logan contested the award and requested a formal hearing with an alj.the hearing was conducted on december.
at the hearing,owens testified about his employment history and his breathing problems,for which he had been prescribed oxygen.he also testified that he had smoked about a quarter of a pack of cigarettes a day when he was in his late teens and early twenties but that he had not smoked since.in addition to owens testimony,the parties introduced various forms of medical evidence concerning his condition,including conflicting interpretations of two chest and three ct scans the results from pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas studies notes of observations from two of his treating physicians,maria boustani and oscar figueroa,indicating that owens had pneumoconiosis and conflicting medical opinions from three physicians,rasmussen offered by the director,george zaldivar offered by mingo logan,and kirk hippensteel offered by mingo logan,all three of whom agreed that owens was totally disabled by a pulmonary impairment but disagreed as to its diagnosis and cause.rasmussen diagnosed owens as having both clinical pneumoconiosis and interstitial fibrosis and opined that both conditions were attributable to owens exposure to coal mine dust.zaldivar diagnosed owens with idiopathic interstitial fibrosis or,in his words,an interstitial fibrosis of undetermined cause,but unrelated to coal mining.hippensteel essentially reached the same conclusion,opining that owens type of lung disease is a disease of the general public unrelated to his prior coal mine dust exposure and that he would be just as impaired by the same pulmonary problem had he never worked in a coal mine.
in october,the alj awarded owens benefits.she concluded that because owens had more than years of underground coal mine employment and because the evidence established that he was totally disabled by a respiratory impairment,the rebuttable presumption of c arose that he was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.the alj also found that mingo logan did not rebut that presumption.in this respect,the alj considered seven interpretations of two chest,giving more weight to the readings that interpreted the films as positive for pneumoconiosis based on the physicians relative qualifications.the alj also gave greater weight to rasmussen opinion as to the cause of owens disability than to the opinions offered by zaldivar and hippensteel,emphasizing that rasmussen opinion was better supported by the objective medical evidence and the opinions of two pulmonary experts who treated owens,while zaldivar and hippensteel chose to totally eliminate consideration of owens years of coal dust exposure as a potential environmental factor in the development of his interstitial fibrosis.the alj therefore concluded that the preponderance of the best documented and reasoned evidence of record establishes the presence of clinical and legal pneumoconiosis.she also found that zaldivar and hippensteel diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial fibrosis was not sufficient to establish a cause of owens disability other than coal workers pneumoconiosis.she concluded,at bottom,that mingo logan failed to rebut the c presumption.
the benefits review board affirmed by a decision and order dated october.the board concluded that the alj findings were supported by substantial evidence and that the alj properly explained her finding that the positive readings outweighed the negative readings and properly found that rasmussen opinion was better documented and reasoned than the opinions of zaldivar and hippensteel.
mingo logan filed this petition for review,challenging both the legal standard applied to its rebuttal evidence,as well as the sufficiency of the analysis and the evidence.
owens died on july,but his widow continues to pursue his claim on behalf of his estate.
mingo logan contends that the alj and the benefits review board applied the wrong legal standard in assessing whether it rebutted the presumption established by c.under c,if the miner shows that he worked years or more in underground coal mines and that he suffers from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment,a rebuttable presumption arises that the miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.in the absence of credible rebuttal evidence,the miner would then be entitled to benefits.
in its opinion affirming the alj award of benefits,the board stated that mingo logan could rebut the c presumption only by showing either that owens did not have pneumoconiosis or that his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,his coal mine employment.in support of this statement,the board cited the statutory language the secretary may rebut such presumption only by establishing that a such miner does not,or did not,have pneumoconiosis,or that b his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.c.
mingo logan argues that the board improperly applied to it the rebuttal limitations of c even though the plain text shows that those limitations apply only when the secretary seeks to rebut the presumption.see usery turner elkhorn mining,i t is clear as a matter of statutory construction that the provision limitation on rebuttal evidence applies only to the secretary and not to an operator seeking to avoid liability.by applying the rebuttal limitations to it,mingo logan argues,the board denied it the chance to rebut the presumption with evidence that pneumoconiosis did not substantially contribute to owens total disability.
owens and the director of the office of workers compensation program contend that the standard announced by the board was appropriate even if the statutory language does not directly apply to the employer,because the methods of rebuttal articulated in c are the only logical methods by which the presumption can be rebutted.in short,they argue that the statute rebuttal limitations are actually not limitations at all.
while the dispute over the correct rebuttal standard could affect whether a miner receives benefits,in this case we conclude that mingo logan was not in fact restricted in the evidence it offered in rebuttal,and the alj did not apply the rebuttal limitations in considering the evidence.rather,the alj analyzed whether mingo logan presented credible evidence to rebut any aspect of the miner claim covered by the presumption.
the black lung benefits act awards benefits to miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.a,a,a,a.this language defining when benefits are available is the same as the language defining the scope of the presumption created by c.to establish an entitlement to benefits,a claimant must show that he has pneumoconiosis,in either its clinical or legal form that the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment that he is totally disabled by a pulmonary or respiratory impairment and that his pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.d,c.pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause of the miner disability if it i h as a material adverse effect on the miner respiratory or pulmonary condition or ii m aterially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment.id.c.
relating these claim elements to c presumption,when a miner proves years of coal mine employment and element,i,the total disability element,a rebuttable presumption arises that the miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.thus,with this provision,the miner presumptively satisfies claim elements the existence of pneumoconiosis,pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment,and pneumoconiosis caused the total disability.although mingo logan argues that the alj limited its ability to rebut the presumption by applying to it the rebuttal methods applicable only to the secretary,the record in fact shows that the alj did no such thing.rather,the alj considered all of the evidence that mingo logan presented and found that it did not rebut any of the three elements covered by the presumption.
specifically,as to element the presence of pneumoconiosis,the alj considered mingo logan evidence,together with the evidence presented by owens,and concluded,i find that the preponderance of the best documented and reasoned evidence of record establishes the presence of clinical and legal pneumoconiosis.as to element that pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment,the alj pointed to another rebuttable presumption,as stated in b,which establishes this element if the miner had at least years of coal mine employment.she then concluded that because mingo logan ha d not presented evidence to rebut the presumption,owens ha d established the presence of pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.and finally as to element that pneumoconiosis caused the total disability,the alj understood that the presumption could be rebutted by the employer.the alj considered the causation evidence submitted by both sides and concluded that mingo logan has failed to establish that owens respiratory disability is due to a condition other than pneumoconiosis.the alj thus effectively rejected the evidence offered by mingo logan to rebut element by showing that pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing cause of owens total disability.
in affirming the alj,the benefits review board recited the alj holding,explicitly referring to the alj conclusion that mingo logan did not rebut element 
the administrative law judge also found that employer failed to establish that claimant does not have clinical or legal pneumoconiosis,or that claimant total disability was not due to pneumoconiosis.consequently,the administrative law judge found that employer failed to rebut the presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis at section c of the act,c.
emphasis added.while the board then summarized its affirmance by referring to the sentence in c that addresses how the secretary may rebut the presumption,it nonetheless proceeded to address substantively the alj factual findings and evaluation of the evidence and affirmed them.
in short,while the benefits review board purported to subject the employer to the rebuttal methods applicable to the secretary in c,it concluded in substance that no aspect of the presumption was rebutted,affirming the alj finding that mingo logan failed to show that owens had only mild pneumoconiosis that did not substantially contribute to his total disability.accordingly,because the record shows that c two methods of rebuttal did not affect the board disposition of this case,we need not address mingo logan claim that restricting employers to those methods improperly raised its burden on rebuttal.
on the merits,mingo logan contends that,in concluding that it had not rebutted the c presumption,the alj failed to consider the medical evidence in its entirety and failed to provide an adequate rationale in support of her conclusions,resulting in a decision that falls below the minimum threshold required by the administrative procedure act apa.specifically,it argues that the alj did not adequately explain her weighing of the chest evidence that she improperly discounted the medical opinions of zaldivar and hippensteel and that rasmussen opinion,combined with owens treatment records,was insufficient to support the alj finding of legal pneumoconiosis.
our review of these matters assesses whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the board and alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.harman mining,office of workers comp.programs,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.as part of determining whether substantial evidence supports the alj factual determinations,we must address whether all of the relevant evidence has been analyzed and whether the alj has sufficiently explained his rationale in crediting certain evidence.milburn colliery hicks,cir.but we must also be mindful that the alj,as the trier of fact,is charged with making factual findings,including evaluating the credibility of witnesses and weighing contradicting evidence.doss,office of workers comp.programs,cir.
with respect to mingo logan contention that the alj failed to provide adequate explanation under the apa for her weighing of the chest evidence,the apa does require aljs to include a statement of findings and conclusions,and the reasons or basis therefor,on all the material issues of fact,law,or discretion presented on the record.c a.an adequate explanation,however,can be a succinct one,lane hollow coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir,and the apa duty of explanation is satisfied as long as a reviewing court can discern what the alj did and why she did it,harman,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
