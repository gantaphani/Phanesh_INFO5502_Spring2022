narricot industries,narricot,petitions this court for review of a decision and order entered against it by the national labor relations board the board.see narricot,the board decision.the board decision affirmed,with modification,the rulings made by an administrative law judge the alj in a decision the alj decision that is attached to the board decision.the board has in this court for enforcement of the board decision.this matter presents two issues for our consideration whether the board decision was properly issued by a quorum and,if so,whether the board decision deserves enforcement on the merits.because,as explained below,we answer both of those questions in the affirmative,we deny narricot petition for review and grant the board for enforcement.
narricot,a georgia corporation,is engaged in the business of manufacturing and dyeing narrow textile fabrics used to construct vehicle seatbelts narricot has maintained a manufacturing facility in boykins,virginia,since the early,and the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america,carpenters industrial council,local the union,has represented the production and maintenance employees at the boykins facility since.the most recent collective bargaining agreement cba covering the boykins bargaining unit employees was executed in february and remained in effect until october.by agreement of the union and narricot,the union representation of the production and maintenance employees was extended to also cover employees who work at narricot satellite facility in murfreesboro,north carolina.although the most recent cba did not provide for a wage increase,it provided for a overtime premium for working in excess of hours in a week.
the international textile group itg,a textile group that owns various mostly nonunion textile plants throughout the world,acquired the boykins and murfreesboro facilities in early.after learning of the acquisition,the union met with itg representatives.by letter dated july,the union notified narricot that it desired to negotiate a new or modified cba and proposed dates for the parties negotiations.bargaining sessions were conducted on july,august,september and,and september.union representative jason weitzel believed,based on the progress of the negotiations,that the parties could have reached an agreement during the next scheduled bargaining session on october.that session never occurred,however,due to narricot withdrawal of recognition from the union on september,effective october,the termination date of the parties last cba.
narricot predicated the withdrawal of recognition on its receipt of a decertification petition signed by a majority of bargaining unit employees.as of october,there were approximately bargaining unit at the murfreesboro facility,and the rest at the boykins facility.the decertification petition was signed by,or,of the bargaining unit employees.following its withdrawal of recognition of the union,narricot made a number of unilateral changes,that is,it did not negotiate or bargain with the union prior to making them.on november,narricot eliminated the overtime premium provided for in the last cba and implemented the first employee wage increase in four years.in addition,effective january,narricot made changes to the fringe benefit programs for bargaining unit employees.
the union filed various unfair labor practice charges against narricot in october and january,and the board issued a consolidated complaint and notice of hearing in february.the consolidated complaint alleged the following that narricot violated a of the national labor relations act the act,a,by promising employees increased benefits if they removed the union as their bargaining representative that narricot further contravened a by soliciting employees to sign the decertification petition,by providing unlawful assistance to employees in the circulation of the petition,and by soliciting employees to separately withdraw from union membership and revoke dues checkoff authorizations and that narricot violated a of the act,a,by withdrawing recognition from the union and by thereafter unilaterally implementing changes in wages,benefits,and other conditions of employment for the bargaining unit employees.
in late february,the alj conducted a trial on the consolidated complaint.by the alj decision of may,the alj concluded that narricot had engaged in multiple unfair labor practices,and recommended an order requiring narricot to,inter alia,cease and desist from such practices including its refusal to recognize and bargain with the union and to rescind all unilateral changes to unit employees wages and other conditions of employment.narricot filed exceptions to the alj decision,and the parties submitted briefs to the board.
by the board decision of january,the board,acting through a quorum,affirmed,with modification,the alj decision,and it adopted,also with modification,the recommended order.the board explained that it 
has considered the decision and the record in light of the exceptions and briefs and has decided to affirm the judge rulings,findings,and conclusions,as modified herein,and to adopt the recommended order as modified.as discussed below,we agree with the judge that narricot violated section a of the act by withdrawing recognition from the union and that an affirmative bargaining order is the appropriate remedy for this violation.
board decision footnotes omitted.the board also specifically affirmed the alj ruling that narricot contravened a by soliciting employees to resign their union membership and to revoke their dues checkoff authorizations.id.at.narricot subsequently petitioned this court for review of the board decision,and the board for enforcement thereof.we then granted a motion to intervene made by shirley mae lewis and henry vaughan the interveners,bargaining unit employees who had supported the decertification petition effort.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to e and f of the act,e f.
the first question before us is whether the board decision was properly issued by a quorum.as explained in the board decision,
e ffective midnight december,members liebman,schaumber,kirsanow,and walsh delegated to members liebman,schaumber,and kirsanow,as a group,all of the board powers in anticipation of the expiration of the terms of members kirsanow and walsh on december.pursuant to this delegation,chairman liebman and member schaumber constitute a quorum of the group.as a quorum,they have the authority to issue decisions and orders in unfair labor practice and representation cases.see b of the act.
board decision the quorum question is one of statutory interpretation of b of the act,b.in reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute,we first determine whether the statute is ambiguous or,instead,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.snell island snf llc nlrb,cir citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.accordingly,we begin our analysis with the text of the statute.
under a of the act,the board consists of five members,who serve staggered,terms.see a.section b provides that 
t he board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.
id.b.thus,b contains three provisions that are pertinent here a delegation provision,allowing the board to delegate any or all of its powers to a group a vacancy provision,providing that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the authority of the remaining board members to act and a quorum provision,providing that three members constitute a quorum of the board,but with an exception providing that two board members constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the delegation provision.
in this case,four members of the board delegated all of the board authority,consistent with b delegation provision,to a group in december.when the term of one of those three members expired,the remaining two members constituted a quorum of the group,empowered to act with all of the board powers in light of the vacancy and quorum provisions.under the plain and unambiguous text of b,therefore,the designated group was empowered to act with a quorum.two of our sister courts of appeals have recently reached the same conclusion,as did the department of justice office of legal counsel in a written opinion on which the board relied.see new process steel,nlrb,cir the plain meaning of the statute supports the nlrb delegation procedure.ne.land,nlrb,cir quorum requirements,memorandum from edward whelan iii,principal deputy assistant attorney,office of legal counsel,available at wl.
the circuit has reached a contrary conclusion,reading b as creating distinct quorum requirements for the board and designated groups.see laurel baye healthcare of lake lanier,nlrb.that court thus concluded that the phrase except that is present in the statute only to indicate that the delegee group ability to act is measured by a different numerical value.id.at.in the court view,the board quorum requirement of three members must be satisfied at all times,regardless of whether the board authority is delegated to a group of its members.id.quoting b.we disagree with this view,concluding that it is based on an overly narrow construction of the modifying phrase that directly follows the quorum requirement except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the delegation pro vision.b emphasis added.the statutory phrase except that ordinarily introduces an exception.had congress desired to write the statute as the circuit reads it,it would have simply omitted the words except that from b.the statute would then contain two independent quorum clauses,one applicable to the board and the other to groups.as it is,however,b contains a quorum requirement applicable at all times,except where the board has delegated its authority to a group.because the board made such a delegation in this case,we see the circuit reading of the statute as unpersuasive 
we also reject narricot contention that the group of three created by the board in late december automatically ceased to exist and thus could not transact business through a purported quorum once member kirsanow ceased being a member of the board itself.reply br.of pet r.narricot theory is inconsistent with two provisions of b.first,narricot reading of b would turn the quorum provision on its head.if the loss of one member of a group automatically caused the group to cease to exist,then a quorum would never suffice.the statute,however,expressly provides for a designated group to act with only two members.see,nlrb,cir deeming decision by quorum to be binding where one member of group resigned on day of board decision.moreover,narricot theory is entirely inconsistent with b vacancy provision,which specifies that a vacancy in the board or,necessarily,a group acting with the full powers of the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.b.in sum,we are satisfied that,in the underlying proceedings,the remaining two members of the group designated by the board were empowered to act with the full powers of the board.
the second question before us is whether the board decision should be enforced on the merits.importantly,t he function of striking a balance between the conflicting interests of employers and employees to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility,which the congress committed primarily to the board,subject to limited judicial review.nlrb truck drivers local union,d.in enforcement proceedings such as this,we are always obliged to defer to the board where it has chosen between two fairly conflicting views,even if we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.smithfield packing nlrb,cir quoting universal camera nlrb.we have recognized that the board legal rulings are entitled to deference when they are rational and consistent with the act and the board own precedent.nlrb air contact,cir.finally,we treat the f indings of fact made by an alj and affirmed by the board as conclusive,so long as they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,nlrb,cir quoting e.and we have characterized substantial evidence as relevant evidence that a reason able mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.see nlrb peninsula hosp.med,cir.
narricot petition for review and the board for enforcement present four issues whether the board properly concluded that narricot provided unlawful assistance to the decertification effort whether the board adequately analyzed the causal connection between narricot unlawful assistance and its withdrawal of union recognition whether the board rightly determined that narricot improperly solicited employees to resign from the union and whether the remedy ordered by the board was proper.we assess these issues in turn.
first,the board determined that narricot withdrawal of recognition from the union contravened a of the act because narricot had engaged in unfair labor practices prohibited by a as the board recognized in these proceedings,an employer can justify its withdrawal of recognition from an incumbent union if it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the union had,in fact,lost majority support at the time the employer withdrew recognition.board decision quoting levitz furniture.here,the board observed,narricot relied solely on the decertification petition as objective proof of the union actual loss of majority support.id.however,when an employer engages in conduct designed to undermine sup port for the union and to impermissibly assist a decertification effort,the decertification petition is considered tainted and will not provide the employer with a basis for withdrawing recognition.id.citing sfo inn,llc.
as the board characterized the alj decision,t he judge found that narricot provided unlawful assistance to the decertification effort in violation of section a of the act,which tainted the petition,invalidating it as evidence of the union loss of majority.board decision.the alj therefore concluded that narricot violated section a of the act by withdrawing recognition based on the unlawfully tainted petition.id.the board agreed with this conclusion based on the following evidence of unlawful assistance in the petition effort.id.
as detailed by the judge,both human resource manager kris potter and supervisor eric hayes actively participated in the decertification process.after employee henry vaughan asked for information about how to oust the union,potter prepared a decertification petition,gave it to vaughan,and told him that about signatures were needed.potter also gave copies of the petition to employee shirley lewis and to intern anja baumann,directing them to return the signed petitions to him.in addition,after giving baumann a list of unit employees,potter told her that about signatures were needed on the petition.at the end of each day that she solicited signatures,baumann returned copies of the petition to potter pursuant to his instructions.according to baumann,potter would express approval and tell her that he needed more signatures.finally,supervisor hayes told employee willie mitchell that employees would receive a pay raise if the union were decertified and that mitchell could sign a copy of the petition on the desk in hayes office.
id.at footnotes omitted.according to the board,t his conduct is sufficient proof that narricot officials provided more than the permissible ministerial aid in the initiation and circulation of the decertification petition.id.at footnote omitted.
in these circumstances,the board found it unnecessary to reach certain additional findings made by the alj.the board,for example,found no need to rely on the alj finding that misspellings on the decertification petition indicated that narricot had attempted to disguise its role in the decertification effort,or to assess the alj finding that baumann was acting as narricot agent in the decertification effort.see board decision.additionally,the board specifically rejected certain findings made by the alj,including that potter made unlawful wage and promises to baumann and that supervisor tim beals unlawfully failed to remove a copy of the petition from the employee break room.aside from these specific modifications,however,the board adopted the remainder of the alj findings.see id.at specifying that the board decided to affirm the alj rulings,findings,and conclusions,as modified herein,and to adopt the recommended order as modified footnote omitted.
narricot challenge to the board decision is predicated,in part,on its contention that the alj findings adopted by the board are insufficient to establish that narricot went beyond providing ministerial aid to the decertification effort.see states optical,w hile an employer does not violate the act by rendering what has been termed ministerial aid,its actions must occur in a situational context free of coercive conduct.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted whether conduct constitutes more than ministerial aid turns on whether the preparation,circulation,and signing of the petition constituted the free and uncoerced act of the employees concerned.mickeys linen towel supply,internal quotation marks omitted.whether the employer conduct was actually coercive,however,is immaterial,provided that the particular conduct would have a reasonable tendency in the totality of the circumstances to intimidate.nlrb transpersonnel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and whether particular conduct tends to coerce or intimidate is a question essentially left to the specialized experience of the board,and we must show respect for the board findings.id.
we can not say,in light of the record as a whole,that the board lacked substantial evidence to find that narricot conduct in this case crossed the line beyond mere ministerial assistance.narricot contends that both this court and the board have recognized that m erely providing accurate information upon request of the employee,even for sample language,does not constitute conduct that would tend to coerce or intimidate.transpersonnel,at see,deciding that employer drafting of decertification petition constituted lawful ministerial aid.
the board decision,however,reflects that it adopted findings by the alj that narricot engaged in conduct extending beyond mere ministerial aid.for example,the board adopted the alj finding that both human resource manager kris potter and supervisor eric hayes actively participated in the decertification process.board decision.more specifically,a fter employee henry vaughn asked for information about how to oust the union,potter prepared a decertification petition,gave it to vaughn,and told him that about signatures were needed.id.footnote omitted.the board also found that potter gave copies of the petition to employee shirley lewis and to intern anja baumann,directing them to return the signed petitions to him.id.and,without being asked to do so,potter gave baumann a list of unit employees,and told her that about signatures were needed on the petition.at the end of each day that baumann solicited signatures,she returned copies of the petition to potter pursuant to his instructions,at which point potter expressed his approval and told baumann that more signatures were needed.in addition,the board observed that supervisor hayes told employee willie mitchell that employees would receive a pay raise if the union were decertified and that mitchell could sign a copy of the petition on the desk in hayes office.id.at 
moreover,the alj findings of were appended to the board decision and expressly affirmed by the board unless specifically modified,see board decision other specific details of potter conduct.for instance,after baumann signed the petition,vaughan suggested that baumann speak with potter if she were interested in helping collect signatures.baumann then met with potter,advised him she had just signed the petition,and told him that she was interested in learning about what she had signed.baumann was from germany and did not understand how unions function in the united states.potter responded that there was a union at the facility and that it cost narricot money,he gave baumann a blank copy of the petition and a list of employee names,and he told baumann that the cba was expiring in october and about signatures were needed on the petition.baumann then solicited employee signatures before,during,and after her work hours,and was paid overtime for time spent doing so.when one employee asked baumann how the employee could remove her signature from the petition,baumann advised the employee that she would have to talk with potter because he had the petitions.see board decision.
the board relied on this cumulative evidence in ruling that narricot conduct exceeded mere ministerial aid.see board decision member schaumber does not pass on whether the mere provision of an employee list to facilitate the collection of signatures on a decertification petition would constitute unlawful assistance.he finds the violation based on the cumulative evidence cited above.given that the board ruling was predicated on the combined effect of narricot conduct,we are obliged to examine the record as a whole.viewed in that context,the board decision is supported by substantial evidence,and it is rational and consistent with the act and the board own precedent.
second,the board concluded that,because the objective value of the decertification petition was tainted by narricot unlawful participation therein,it was unnecessary to pass on whether the petition was tainted under the standards set forth in master slack.board decision citing sfo inn,at.in master slack,the board recognized that an employer can not rely on a decertification petition if there is a showing that prior,unremedied unfair labor practices caused or had a meaningful impact on employee disaffection.see at.in short,there must be a causal relationship between the unlawful conduct and the decertification petition id.outlining four factors for determining causation.
narricot contends that the board adopted an entirely new standard for this case when it ignored its longstanding requirement of a causal connection between the unfair labor practices committed by the employer and the union decertification effort.br.of pet r.the board asserts,however,that it was not,in these circumstances,required to analyze causation under master slack,because that decision only applies to cases that do not primarily involve the employer direct assistance or participation in the decertification effort.br.of respondent citing cases.
in master slack,the board established a rule intended to ensure a causal link between decertification efforts and other unfair labor practices distinct from any unlawful assistance by the employer in the actual decertification petition.compare sfo inn,at bypassing causation analysis where employer engaged in unlawful conduct connected with decertification effort,with nlrb williams,cir applying master slack causation test to determine if decertification decision was tainted by antecedent unlawful conduct.thus,where,as here,the unfair labor practices identified by the board are directly related to the decertification effort,the board need not make a specific causation finding under the master slack test.see glasser.of livonia,llc,d,explaining board precedent that sfo inn stands independent from master slack and its causation test.again,we must uphold the board legal rulings when they are rational and consistent with the act.put simply,narricot has not demonstrated that the board analysis failed to satisfy that deferential standard.thus,the board did not err in analyzing the connection between narricot unfair labor practices and the decertification petition underlying its withdrawal of recognition from the union 
third,the board also affirmed the alj ruling that narricot contravened a when it solicited employees to resign their union memberships and to revoke their dues checkoff authorizations.see board decision.narricot actions were prompted by inquirie
