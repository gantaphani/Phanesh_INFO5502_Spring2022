carlyle leslie owen dale petitions this court for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia upholding his order of removal under a f for being convicted of an aggravated felony a crime of violence.dale contends that the bia incorrectly interpreted new york law in determining that his guilty plea to attempted assault under new york penal law in new york state court was necessarily a plea to either subsection or,both of which he concedes are crimes of violence,rather than subsections and,which are not.the government does not contest dale characterization of the bia legal error,but argues only that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia decision because dale failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to bring a motion for reconsideration to the bia.we hold that this court does have jurisdiction to review the decision and that the bia legal conclusion was in error.
factual and procedural history 
dale,a jamaican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the united states,pleaded guilty to attempted assault in the first degree in violation of new york penal law mckinney.the department of homeland security dhs later instituted removal proceedings,charging him as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.the immigration judge ij found that dale was removable as charged.the bia affirmed the ij decision,and dale petitioned for review.this court remanded the case to the ij on the government request because dale conviction record did not specify which of the four defined by dale pleaded to in his attempt conviction.
the bia in turn remanded to the ij.the ij found that because the indictment charged dale with a violation,dale must have pleaded guilty to an attempted violation of a crime of violence constituting an aggravated felony.accordingly,the ij ordered him removed.see c a a b.dale appealed that decision to the bia,contending that dhs did not meet its burden of proving that he was convicted of an aggravated felony where there was no evidence in the judgment specifying which subsection of he violated,as not all subsections of define aggravated felonies.
the bia did not address the ij determination that the indictment was sufficient to imply a conviction under that subsection,nor did it specifically address dale claim that the government failed to produce any evidence that he had been convicted under the actual subsection charged in the indictment.the bia instead concluded sua sponte that,as a matter of law,dale must have been convicted under either subsection or subsection of.the bia reasoned that only these two subsections contain a mens rea requirement that could support attempt liability.accordingly,it determined that new york courts would not have permitted dale to plead guilty to subsections and because attempted reckless assault and attempted felony assault are legally impossible crimes.the bia then dismissed his appeal,finding it unnecessary to determine whether dale was convicted under subsection or,as either constituted a crime of violence warranting dale removal from the united states.
dale remains in the united states pursuant to an order by this court staying removal.he filed a timely petition for review with the second circuit,and his petition was subsequently transferred to this court.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction to review the bia removal order is governed by of the immigration and nationality act.section a c generally prohibits review of any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.however,the real id act grants us jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d.the question whether a past conviction constitutes an aggravated felony is a purely legal one,which we review de novo.patel mukasey,cir.
we review only an order of the bia,not the ij,unless the ij decision has some impact on the bia decision.mikhael,cir citation omitted.because the bia adopted only the ij ultimate conclusion and not its reasoning,we review only the decision of the bia.
iii.discussion 
dale argues that the bia committed legal error in concluding that his guilty plea to attempted assault under was necessarily a plea to subsection or both of which constitute crimes of opposed to subsection or which do not.he concedes that new york law does not allow a conviction by a jury for an attempt crime where the principal crime has a mens rea requirement of recklessness or less,but he argues that new york courts routinely permit defendants to plead guilty to hypothetical or legally impossible crimes.see,people foster,finding no due process violation where a defendant pleaded guilty to a hypothetical crime people griffin.the government filed no response to this allegation of legal error on the part of the bia.it argues only that dale failed to exhaust administrative remedies because he did not file a motion for the bia to reconsider whether new york courts permit guilty pleas to legally impossible crimes.we turn first to the issue of jurisdiction.
jurisdiction.
the government argues that dale failed to exhaust administrative remedies where he admits that he did not file a motion requesting that the bia reconsider its conclusion that dale was convicted of an aggravated felony under subsection or of.under its theory,dale challenge to the bia interpretation of new york law must necessarily be considered an unexhausted issue because the bia reached its conclusion sua sponte,in absence of any argument from dale as to whether new york courts permit pleas to hypothetical crimes.dale concedes that he could have filed a discretionary motion to reconsider under,but he asserts that his failure to do so does not deprive this court of jurisdiction.he argues that his allegation of bia error is not a new issue,but merely a more specific formulation of the issue raised in his brief to the the ij committed legal error in finding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony.he also contends that such a motion would be redundant where the bia has already addressed and ruled upon the same issue he now brings before the court.
it is that j udicial review of a final removal order is available only if the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right.salinas gonzales,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also d.although an alien is not required to verbatim the precise arguments presented to the bia,an alien nevertheless fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.id.citing wang ashcroft,cir.
to determine whether dale was required to file a motion for reconsideration,we must discern whether dale allegation of bia error presents a new issue that the bia never had a chance to consider.a motion for reconsideration is not generally required to challenge an error in the bia opinion,but our recent decision in omari holder recognizes that such a motion is a jurisdictional prerequisite where petitioner asserts a wholly new ground for relief arising only as a consequence of some error in the deportation proceedings.omari,cir.there,we distinguished this situation from general allegations of error in bia proceedings,explaining that 
if a party disagrees with the bia resolution of an issue previously raised before the bia,there is no need to reargue that issue in a motion for reconsideration.but where the bia decision itself results in a new issue and the bia has an available and adequate means for addressing that issue,a party must first bring it to the bia attention through a motion for reconsideration.
utilizing this distinction,we considered whether a petitioner raised a new issue where he argued,for the first time on appeal,that the bia made its own factual findings instead of properly deferring to those of the ij.id.we determined that the allegation of impermissible,by definition,was a new issue stemming from the bia act of decisionmaking,one that neither party could have possibly raised prior to the bia decision.id.at.because this particular grou
