resident aliens who commit aggravated felonies typically are removed from the united states.a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.petitioner mamush afeta afeta is an ethiopian national whose most recent convictions were for two counts of felony theft,two counts of attempted car theft,and two counts of destruction of property.he seeks to evade the natural consequence of his crimes deportation by claiming that he automatically became a citizen as a minor when his mother was naturalized.see a repealed.finding no error in the board of immigration appeals bia interpretation of the relevant statute,we deny the petition.
in,the united states admitted petitioner afeta years old at the time and his parents into this country as refugees.his parents ceased living together in december,and petitioner afeta father returned to ethiopia soon thereafter.petitioner afeta mother became a naturalized united states citizen in.petitioner afeta was years old at the time.
in,the circuit court of montgomery county,maryland convicted petitioner afeta of auto theft,possession of marijuana,and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.two years later,in august,the circuit court of montgomery county,maryland convicted petitioner afeta of two counts of felony theft,two counts of attempted auto theft,and two counts of destruction of property.he was sentenced to ten years in prison with five years suspended.
in,the united states immigration and naturalization service ins ordered petitioner afeta removed from the united states.as grounds for removal,the ins relied on a a iii alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a a ii alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.
petitioner afeta appealed his removal to the board of immigration appeals bia,asserting that he became a united states citizen by operation of law when his mother was naturalized in.the bia disagreed and denied his appeal by order dated january.this petition followed.
this court may conduct only a limited review of final orders of removal issued by the bia.while congress has prohibited direct review of a bia removal order,a c courts of appeal possess limited jurisdiction to review factual determinations that trigger the provision specifically,whether petitioner is an alien,and whether he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.soliman gonzales,cir quoting ramtulla ashcroft,cir.since there is no dispute over petitioner afeta history of convictions,the only issue for review is whether petitioner became a united states citizen by virtue of his mother naturalization in.
as discussed in greater detail below,the bia answered this question by applying the derivative citizenship provisions of a repealed,which apply when only one of two living parents becomes naturalized.the bia interpreted the statute as requiring that the minor alien parents have taken formal judicial steps to end their marriage at the time of naturalization.we must give this interpretation deference.because section a does not speak unambiguously to the precise question at issue,our inquiry under chevron is simply to ask whether the bia position is based on a permissible construction of the statute.asika ashcroft,cir quoting chevron natural res.def.council,d.courts of appeal must apply chevron principles of deference when confronted with questions about an agency construction of the statute which it administers.ins,d quoting chevron,at.w e are bound by chevron to defer to the bia construction so long as it is reasonable.asika,at.
before its repeal,section a specified certain situations that conveyed automatic citizenship on children born outside of the united states to alien parents.they are 
the naturalization of both parents or 
the naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the parents is deceased or 
the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation and if 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized under clause of this subsection,or the parent naturalized under clause or of this subsection,or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a repealed emphasis added.section does not define the term legal separation.
in administrative hearings before the bia,petitioner afeta argued that a conveyed automatic citizenship upon him because his parents were legally separated when his mother was naturalized in.he relied then and now on a written separation agreement that first appeared in.
this written separation agreement was incorporated into his parents maryland judgment of absolute divorce.the separation agreement is dated december,and is signed by bizunesh shibeshi petitioner mother and merga afeta petitioner father.the agreement provides that t he parties mutually and voluntarily separated on december,with the intent and purpose of ending the marriage and to live separate and apart without cohabitation and in separate abodes.the written agreement states that upon separation,petitioner father agreed to transfer his ownership interest in the house and provide petitioner mother with sole legal custody of the children.in return,petitioner mother agreed to refinance the home in her name only.the agreement was not notarized and does not reflect the presence of any witnesses.it was not filed with or adopted by any court prior to the parents divorce in 
the bia concluded that petitioner did not receive derivative citizenship upon his mother naturalization in because only judicially recognized marital separations are considered legal for the purposes of section a.the bia based its decision on its previous construction of the statute as well as the decisions of two courts of appeal.see infra.out of an abundance of caution,the bia also reviewed maryland law and concluded that it did not suggest a contrary construction of the statute.because the voluntary separation agreement produced by petitioner afeta was not a formal judicial document,the bia held that it did not constitute a legal separation as that term was used in a.
petitioner contends that the bia interpretation of the statutory term legal separation is incorrect because maryland law does not require a judicial order in order for a separation agreement to become legal.petitioner reasons that because maryland courts will enforce voluntary separation agreements as a species of contract,the bia must recognize his parents as legally separated as of the purported date of their agreement,december.
petitioner reliance on maryland law is misplaced.congress did not incorporate state substantive law into section a.when congress chooses to make such an incorporation,its language is quite clear.for example,the federal government controls certain properties that lie within the boundaries of various states yet fall under the sole legal jurisdiction of the united states military bases.in governance of these properties,congress has clearly stated that 
w hoever is guilty of any act or omission which,although not made punishable by any enactment of congress,would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the state in which such place is situated,shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.
a.no such inclusive language appears in section a.by contrast,section a merely speaks of legal separation without any reference to the state in which the alien resides.
the definition of the statutory term legal separation is well recognized in united states jurisprudence.see nehme,at performing review of states and territories that define or provide legal separation provisions that contemplate a judicial decree.with the exception of one easily distinguishable case discussed below,the bia decision in this case concurs with the board prio
