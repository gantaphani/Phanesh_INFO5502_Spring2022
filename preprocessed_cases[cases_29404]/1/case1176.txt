congress changed the applicable interest rate for the calculation of pension plans payments to retirees.hercules later amended its pension plan to match the changed interest rate,but that amendment resulted in a lower payment to charles stepnowski,who retired several months after the amendment.to determine whether hercules amendment was valid,we decide whether the commissioner of the internal revenue service extended the deadline for this amendment.we hold that the commissioner did so,and that hercules amendment was timely and valid.we therefore affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
stepnowski worked at hercules from to december.he participated in hercules retirement plan,which allows participants to take a payment upon retirement.this payment is the equivalent of of the retiree expected lifetime monthly pension benefits.pension plan of hercules,sched,art.vii.the amount is calculated using the federally prescribed mortality table and a specified interest rate.id.
hercules has a plan under the employee retirement income security act of,et.it was established in and uses the calendar year as its plan year.hercules made amendments to the plan in october 
the amendments to hercules plan changed the interest rate used to calculate payments.for payments made on or after january,the amount is calculated using the interest rate on treasury securities.pension plan,sched,art.vii.a.the treasury rate took the place of the interest rate published by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc 
interest rates bear an inverse relationship to amounts a higher interest rate results in a lower payment,and vice versa the treasury rate has historically been higher than the pbgc rate,he retired after january,after the amendment stepnowski payment was lower than it would have been had hercules kept the pbgc rate 
in february,hercules requested a determination from the commissioner that its pension plan met all of the statutory qualification requirements.in march,stepnowski sent the commissioner a letter contending that the amendment precluded the hercules plan from so qualifying.in march,the commissioner issued hercules a favorable determination letter on the plan.stepnowski then filed a petition in the united states tax court for a declaratory judgment that the hercules plan was not qualified.
the tax court held in favor of hercules and the commissioner,stepnowski comm r,wl,and stepnowski appeals 
ii.discussion 
statutory and regulatory background 
section a of the internal revenue code describes the qualification requirements for pension plans.only qualified plans are tax exempt under a.one of the requirements in a is that,except as provided in section,the plan must pay out a vested participant accrued benefit in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity.a a.section allows plan participants to waive these annuity payments in favor of a cashout that is,a payment of the participants annuity benefits.see id.a.
plan participants can therefore choose to take a payment of the present value of their annuity,and e governs the determination of that amount.specifically,e a i provides that the present value of a participant benefits shall not be less than the present value calculated by using the applicable mortality table and the applicable interest rate.
the applicable interest rate is a statutorily defined term.before,it meant the pbgc interest rate.tax reform act of,b,stat.in,congress changed the definition in e a ii ii it now means the annual rate of interest on treasury securities.the change was made as part of the retirement protection act of,which was itself part of the uruguay round agreements act,tit.vii,subtit.f,a,stat.
elsewhere in the code lurks,which controls vesting standards a plan can not be qualified unless it satisfies this section.a,a.specifically,d known as the provision blocks plan amendments that decrease participants accrued benefits.see id.d a see also id.d b a plan amendment which has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits.
as noted,because the treasury interest rate is generally higher than the pbgc rate,the normal result is a lower payout as happened here.once the retirement protection act changed the statutory rate,plan amendments following that change could have been in danger of triggering the provision.congress accordingly provided that a participant accrued benefit shall not be considered to be reduced in violation of section d merely because the benefit is determined in accordance with section e a,as amended by this act.retirement protection act d,stat.at.the department of the treasury followed suit,providing that plan amendments replacing the pbgc rate with the treasury rate were not cutbacks.reg.e d iv 
does treasury regulation e d i contain an amendment deadline 
stepnowski unhappiness with the treasury rate,as compared to the pbgc rate,is ultimately due to an act of congress.he can not complain that hercules amended its plan to match the statutory interest rate,so he is forced to argue about when hercules amended the plan.stepnowski concedes that hercules could have amended the plan without penalty on or before december,but he claims that the treasury regulations imposed that date as a deadline on such amendments and that it was not extended.
the regulation at issue is reg.e d i,which provides that a prospective plan amendment that changes the interest rate or the mortality assumptions used for the calculation merely to eliminate use of the pbgc interest rate,or the applicable mortality table,with respect to a distribution form described in paragraph d of this section,is not a cutback if it is adopted by december.
stepnowski therefore argues that paragraph d i requires amendments like hercules to be in place on or before december.the commissioner the tax court the december deadline did not apply to the hercules amendment.both parties arguments turn on whether the phrase with respect to a distribution form described in paragraph d of this section modifies mortality table alone or both interest rate and mortality table.the distribution form described in paragraph d is a nondecreasing annual other words,not a payment like in hercules plan.thus,if the phrase modifies both mortality table and interest rate,this provision does not apply to amendments like hercules.
the debate is between the rule of construction and its grammatical corollary.the rule generally holds that qualifying words,phrases,and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding and not to others more remote.united states hodge,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the corollary rule of grammar generally states that,where there is a comma before a modifying phrase,that phrase modifies all of the items in a series and not just the immediately preceding item.see,elliot coal mining,cir th e use of a comma to set off a modifying phrase from other clauses indicates that the qualifying language is to be applied to all of the previous phrases and not merely the immediately preceding phrase.sur.midland bank,cir see also kahn lucas lancaster,lark int l,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by sarhank group oracle,cir bingham,united states,cir 
but neither of these aids in construction is dispositive they serve only as guides.moreover,the only other sentence in paragraph d i fails to use this grammatical a situation where the modifying phrase almost certainly applies to all three elements in a series our confidence in paragraph d i correct comma placement is thereby diminished.thus we express no opinion on whether the deadline applied to hercules.but our subsequent analysis makes clear that,even if there were a deadline imposed,the commissioner extended it.so the question of whether there was a deadline need not be answered here.
c.if there was a deadline for amendments,was it extended 
for this analysis,we assume without deciding that a deadline was imposed for plan amendments replacing the pbgc rate with the treasury rate.we thus face two questions.first,did the commissioner extend that dead
