juan fernando restrepo restrepo,a native and citizen of colombia,asks us to review a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for cancellation of removal under section b of the immigration and nationality act ina.after carefully considering restrepo claims,we deny his petition for review.
background 
restrepo entered the united states on or about september,as a visitor with permission to remain in the country until march.restrepo overstayed his visa and,in,married his wife,maría,a fellow colombian national.in the ensuing years,the couple settled in the united states and had two children.
according to restrepo,by,all was not well between the couple restrepo was unfaithful and maría discovered his infidelity.restrepo soon moved out of the family home in pawtucket,rhode island and moved in with his sister.
in february,restrepo father petitioned for an immigrant visa form i on restrepo behalf.restrepo father filed his petition under section a b of the ina,a b,which permits unmarried sons or unmarried daughters of an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states to obtain a visa.the petition was approved on september,despite the fact that restrepo and maría,though separated,were still married at the time.
restrepo and maría finalized their divorce just one month later,in october.that same month,maría married carlos ríos ríos,a citizen.subsequently,ríos filed an immigrant visa petition for maría and she eventually attained lawful permanent resident lpr status as ríos spouse.
at some point in,maría and restrepo ostensibly reconciled their differences.in,the couple had a third child,though maría and ríos were still married at the time.maría eventually divorced ríos in september and remained with restrepo thereafter,remarrying him on march.
also in september,restrepo who still held the immigrant visa that he obtained in september filed to adjust his status to that of lpr.the relevant paperwork,it seems,raised bureaucratic eyebrows on may,the department of homeland security denied restrepo request for adjustment and revoked his immigrant visa once it determined that,since restrepo was still married to maría in september,he was ineligible for the visa at the time his father filed an immigrant visa petition on his behalf.the government set restrepo removal proceedings in motion on the same day.
restrepo conceded removability,but applied for cancellation of removal under ina b and voluntary departure under ina.see.over the next few years restrepo submitted evidence in support of his application for cancellation,including letters and affidavits prepared on his behalf.restrepo and maría also testified at hearings held before an immigration judge ij in july and february.
the ij denied restrepo application for cancellation of removal on february.in denying restrepo application,the ij found that restrepo had failed to show that he was a person of good moral character while living in the united states,see b b,insofar as facts did not suggest that his divorce from maría was anything other than a sham to enable him to adjust status on the basis of the visa petition that his father had submitted for him.explaining her reasoning,the ij noted that restrepo had a third child with maría while she was married to ríos and underscored her belief that maría had given conflicting information about her reasons for divorcing ríos.most critically,the ij expressed grave concerns about the fact that restrepo remarried maría,by then an lpr,less than two months before his petition for adjustment of status was denied and his visa revoked.the ij found this timing disturbing and significant because neither the letters nor the affidavits that various people submitted to support restrepo application for cancellation of removal mentioned that he was divorced and later remarried.the ij also noted that one of restrepo daughters,who testified at his hearings,did not mention having suffered emotional problems as a result of the divorce.additionally,the ij noted that although testimony suggested that restrepo was an avid churchgoer,his pastor was unaware that restrepo and maría were divorced and did not remarry for over four years after they began living together again.
going further,the ij also concluded that restrepo and maría had provided false testimony before the immigration court to the extent that they stood by their claims that they divorced for legitimate reasons not related to obtaining immigration benefits.the ij cited the timing of the purported marital falling out and divorce,the fact that the couple separated just before restrepo father filed a visa application on his behalf and maría marriage to ríos,a citizen,shortly thereafter as supportive of her conclusion.the ij also noted that maría remembered peculiarly little about her marriage to ríos and could not show that she ever lived with him.in light of the significant disruption that restrepo removal would cause on his family,the ij stated that she might have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt if restrepo had come clean as to the true immigration status motives behind the couple divorce.ultimately,however,the ij explained that she could hardly overlook the fact that restrepo not only engaged in a sham divorce,but also offered false information in his adjustment filings and in his testimony to the court.accordingly,the ij determined that,as a person lacking good moral character,restrepo was statutorily barred from obtaining either cancellation of removal or voluntary departure.
restrepo appealed and the bia affirmed the ij decision on may.see in re juan fernando restrepo,no.b.may.the bia noted that it was required to accept the ij factual determinations unless they were clearly erroneous.see d i bia will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge unless the determination is clearly erroneous.the bia then recounted the evidence the ij used to buttress her decision and concluded that it was sufficient to affirm her conclusions regarding restrepo lack of good moral character.
ii.discussion 
cancellation of removal and our authority to review restrepo petition 
under b,the bia may grant cancellation of removal if the petitioner establishes certain requirements.see toribio chávez holder,cir.specifically,cancellation may issue if an alien a has resided in the united states for a continuous period of ten years b has been a person of good moral character during such period c has not been convicted of certain offenses and d has established that removal would result in exceptional and unusual hardship to a qualifying family member.id.it is the second of the eligibility factors requiring an alien applying for cancellation of removal to show that he has been a person of good moral character while residing in the united states for an uninterrupted period that is important to restrepo petition 
the regime that congress has set in place narrowly defines our authority to review a petition like restrepo.the provision codified at divests federal courts of jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief relative to cancellation of removal.gonzález ruano holder,f d,cir internal citation omitted.the statute thereby leaves the matter of whether an alien should receive such relief to the attorney general discretion and precludes our review in the absence of a colorable constitutional claim or question of law.elysee gonzales,cir see also cruz camey gonzales,cir.
within this context,the manner in which we approach a finding of lack of good moral character could unfold in either of two ways,depending on whether or not the agency exercised its discretion in reaching its determination.see bernal vallejo,cir noting good moral character determination may involve either a question of fact or a discretionary determination.because a finding of lack of good moral character is required,under f,for aliens belonging to certain per se categories,id.emphasis added,a determination that an alien may not receive cancellation of removal relief because he belongs to any of those categories presents a determination which we would be able to review for substantial evidence.however,our review of a determination of lack of good moral character that is not grounded on the per se categories found in f that is,a discretionary finding would still lie outside of our jurisdiction and would be accordingly barred from review.see id.
determination that restrepo offered false testimony 
where,as here,the bia adopts an ij decision but opts to offer a glimpse into its considerations,we review both the decision of the bia and the ij.see wiratama mukasey,cir.
in this case,the ij character findings as to restrepo appear to have been twofold.first,the ij determined that restrepo lacked good moral character insofar as it was evident to her that restrepo had engaged in a sham divorce for the purpose of securing immigration benefits.second,the ij found that restrepo and his wife had provided false testimony to the court regarding the reasons behind their divorce.the latter reason,the ij explained,forced her hand and rendered her unable to give restrepo the benefit of the doubt as to whether he had been a person of good moral character during the relevant period.see f precluding a person who has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits from being found to have good moral character see also toribio chávez,at.
the ij binary findings thus bring us to a natural pause in our discussion.because the ij determination that restrepo underwent a sham divorce and was thus barred from being regarded as a person of good moral character rested on discretionary grounds,our inquiry could very well be at an end.see zajanckauskas holder,cir if there are two alternative grounds for a decision and we lack jurisdiction to review one,it would be beyond our article iii judicial power to review the other.absent authority to review the discretionary ground,any opinion reviewing the nondiscretionary ground could not affect the final order validity and so would be advisory only.alterations omitted quoting ekasinta gonzales,cir.
we hesitate,however,to turn away at the threshold.although at first blush the ij alternate and discretionary basis for her holding appears to foreclose our review of restrepo petition,the ij nevertheless noted that she could have given restrepo the benefit of the doubt as to his being a person of good moral character during the requisite period but for her collateral conclusion that restrepo had provided false testimony to the court.it therefore seems that the ij ultimately predicated her decision to deny restrepo cancellation of removal relief on her finding that he had offered false testimony at his immigration hearings.since false testimony presents a ground for denial that is within the scope of our jurisdiction,see f,we proceed to review the agency reasoning for substantial evidence.under this standard,w e review the agency factual findings,including credibility determinations and may overturn those findings only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.lin gonzales,cir quoting b b.
as noted above,a person found to have provided false testimony during the period for which good moral character is to be established,f,is per se deemed to lack good moral character.for our present purposes,false testimony is limited to oral statements made under oath and,specifically,only to those misrepresentations made with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration benefits.kungys united states.misrepresentations made to satisfy other motives,embarrassment,fear,or a desire for privacy do not qualify as false testimony under the statute.see id.
restrepo does not fare well on the merits.substantial evidence in the record supports the ij determination and the bia reasoned affirmance of the ij finding that restrepo,while under oath,provided false testimony at his immigration hearings regarding the motives underlying his divorce from maría in.here,the ij and the bia both considered several facts that,taken together,they determined significantly undermined restrepo credibility.the ij,in particular,expressed her skepticism that none of the authors of the several letters restrepo submitted in support of his application some of whom had known restrepo for at least years alluded to the fact that restrepo and maría had been divorced or separated.further,the ij and the bia both noted that once divorced,maría married ríos,a citizen,almost immediately thereafter and subsequently obtained lpr status as ríos spouse.the bia decision also recounted other evidence upon which the ij relied,such as the fact that restrepo and maría conceived a child while she was married to ríos that restrepo remarried maría in march just a few months before restrepo was placed in removal proceedings and that,once remarried to restrepo,maría almost immediately filed an alien relative petition on his behalf.it was reasonable for both the ij and the bia to conclude that this evidence supported a conclusion that restrepo offered false testimony inasmuch as he insisted at his hearings before the ij that he divorced maría for legitimate reasons unrelated to securing immigration benefits.we accordingly find no reason to affect the ij credibility determination or corollary finding that restrepo is statutorily precluded from obtaining cancellation of removal relief.see toribio chávez,at upholding denial of cancellation of removal due to f per se lack of good moral character finding based,in part,on ij finding that petitioner testimony was not credible becerril holder,wl,at cir,same.
adverse credibility determination 
in his briefing to this court,restrepo heavily relies on in re a s,which he claims should have guided the analysis the bia followed when it assessed the ij credibility findings.under in re a s,discrepancies or omissions going to the heart of a petitioner claim may support an adverse credibility finding,but only where a test is also satisfied.the bia thus accords deference to an ij adverse credibility determination if 
the discrepancies and omissions described by the immigration judge are actually present in the record 
the discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien provided incredible testimony and 
a convincing explanation for the discrepancies or omissions are not supplied by the alien.
hoxha gonzales,cir.
the government parries restrepo claim that the bia should have worked within the in re a s framework by noting that the bia decision in that case and our application of the cited factors in hoxha gonzales,cir,were circumscribed to the asylum context.in particular,the government appears to contend that these cases are solely apposite to asylum claims examined under the rubric in place before the enactment of the real id act,which became effective on may.see kartasheva holder,cir noting that in cases predating real id act an ij adverse credibility finding can not rest on trivia but must be based on discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum claim.quoting hem mukasey,cir internal quotations omitted see also dehonzai holder,cir following passage of the real id act,an adverse credibility determination may be based on an inconsistency in the applicant testimony without regard to whether the inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim.quoting b b iii.
we are not convinced that these cases can be so easily distinguished from the one before us and note that the bia has cited the in re a s three pronged framework for assessing an ij credibility determinations in deciding an appeal involving a denial of an alien application for cancellation of removal at least once in the past.see in re bruno alfredo dellepiane,no,wl,unpublished decision.however,even if the in re a s framework were applicable in this context,it would not help restrepo.under the in re a s three pronged assessment,for the bia to accept the ij credibility determination,it would have had to conclude that restrepo and maría testimony conflicted with other evidence in the record the discrepancies were reason enough to conclude that restrepo and maría were not credible and restrepo failed t
