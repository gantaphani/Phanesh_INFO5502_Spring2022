sang lee,a korean national,entered the united states in july as a visitor with permission to remain until january.lee overstayed his visa and remains in the united states despite his failure to maintain lawful nonimmigrant status.
in may,lee applied under the immigration and nationality act ina to adjust his status and become a permanent resident based on his employment with the korean broadcasting network kbn.see a.ordinarily,the failure to maintain continuous lawful status by overstaying a visa renders a prospective immigrant ineligible for an adjustment of status.see c excluding aliens who were in unlawful immigration status on the date of filing the application for adjustment of status or who failed to maintain continuously a lawful status since entry into the united states.nevertheless,lee claimed that he could still apply for adjusted status by virtue of i,a provision that permitted otherwise ineligible aliens to apply for an adjustment of status.this pro vision expired on april,except for grandfathered aliens.see b ogundipe.mukasey,cir.
the district director for the united states citizenship immigration services uscis or the service denied lee application,concluding that he did not qualify as a grandfathered alien under j and thus was precluded from filing for an adjustment of status.lee did not appeal the district director denial to the board of immigration appeals bia because,despite lee unlawful immigration status,the service has yet to place him in removal proceedings.instead,after the director denied his application to adjust status,lee filed this action under the administrative procedure act apa challenging the validity of j.the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed lee action.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
grandfathering under section i 
to better understand both the procedural history of lee case and the arguments he raises here,it is helpful to review briefly the process as it relates to i and its grandfathering clause.
prior to,obtaining immigrant status was possible only through the issuance of an immigrant visa by a united states consular office abroad.see choe ins,cir holder,cir explaining that under this practice an alien already inside this country could acquire immigrant status only by temporarily leaving the united states to secure an appropriate visa.in,congress established an process,codified in a,affording aliens who entered as nonimmigrants a means of becoming permanent residents without having to depart the united states and apply for an immigrant visa from a consular office abroad.see a ins bagamasbad,per curiam explaining that the provision was enacted so that aliens would not inevitably be required to leave the country and apply to a united states consul in order to obtain status.
generally speaking,congress has limited the use of the mechanism to lawfully present aliens in order to discourage intending immigrants from moving to the united states before becoming fully eligible for permanent residence and to encourage them to follow the orderly consular process for the issuance of immigrant visas.in re briones,bia see,at observing that this process benefit ted only those aliens who were in the united states lawfully.for our purposes,these restrictions are codified in c.
in,congress enacted i,temporarily lifting c restrictions on certain aliens seeking adjustment of status.under the version originally enacted by congress,
an alien who was eligible to receive an immediately available immigrant visa,but who would be precluded from adjustment of status under a for having entered without inspection or for one of the reasons enumerated in c,was permitted to adjust status upon payment of a surcharge along with an application for adjustment under i.
in re wang,bia.because this measure was intended to be temporary,it contained a sun set provision requiring that a i application for adjustment of status be filed between october,and october.see appropriations act,b,c,stat,effective,in re briones,at.
after the expiration of i under the act,congress added a grandfather clause to allow the continued use of i by aliens who were beneficiaries of either a visa petition or a labor certification filed on or before january.see in re wang,at explaining that the grandfather provision shift ed the focus of the filing requirements from the date the application for adjustment of status was filed to the date on which the underlying visa petition or application for a labor certification was filed appropriations act,b,stat.
in,congress extended the expiration date for i adjustment applications to april,see appropriations act,a b,stat.the cutoff date incorporated into the current version of i 
notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a and c of this section,an alien physically present in the united states 
i entered the united states without inspection or 
ii is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection c of this section 
b who is the beneficiary of 
i an immigrant visa petition that was filed with the attorney general on or before april,or 
ii an application for a labor certification that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the secretary of labor on or before such date 
may apply to the attorney general for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
i.thus,after the amendments,i effectively forgives a period of illegal stay for any alien who is the beneficiary of a labor certification application or an immigrant visa petition filed on or before april.see figueras holder,cir a djustment under i waives any period of illegal stay in the united states if a visa petition was filed on behalf of the petitioner on or before april.the term grandfathered alien appears in the implementing regulations,not the statutory text.the regulations use this term as a type of shorthand for an alien who is the beneficiary of an application for labor certification or a petition for an immigrant visa that was filed on or before april.see a i.
adjustment of status under section i 
the fact that an alien is grandfathered for i purposes does not mean he is a fortiori eligible for an adjustment of status it means only that he is entitled to apply for adjustment of status.ahmed gonzales,cir emphasis omitted.under i,a grandfathered alien must make essentially the same eligibility showing required in any application under a for adjustment of status that the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and that an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the i application is filed.i see ahmed gonzales,cir section i does not create an automatic or a mandatory exception to c in view of the fact that the entire application for adjustment of status must meet with the discretionary approval of the attorney general or his designee.
aliens who seek to adjust their status based on employment,as lee does,are thus required to demonstrate that they are eligible for an visa and that an visa is immediately available.see lendo gonzales,cir.to do so requires the prospective immigrant to find a job with an employer willing to sponsor him through the application process for labor certification and issuance of an immigrant visa.the prospective employer first must apply on behalf of the alien to the department of labor dol for a labor certification.see b c see also united states,cir.the dol issuance of a labor certification indicates that the dol is satisfied that sufficient united states workers are not able,willing,qualified,and available for a particular job and employment of a particular alien will not adversely effect the wages and working conditions of united states workers similarly employed,at see a a i.with a valid labor certification in hand,the prospective employer then submits a petition technically speaking,a form immigrant visa petition for alien worker to the uscis for an immigrant work visa.see lendo,at see b.at that point,the alien,assuming he qualifies for grandfathered status,can apply to adjust his status by filing a form.see i n 
finally,even after a grandfathere
