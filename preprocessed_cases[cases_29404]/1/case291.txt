the background facts of this case are discussed at greater length in our first examination of the board order,see,and here,we relate them summarily.on january,employees at two pan american facilities began a strike after negotiations failed at reaching a new collective bargaining agreement between pan american and the exclusive bargaining representative for its employees,the congreso de uniones industriales de puerto rico the union.that same month,company president jose gonzalez spoke with two nonstriking truck drivers during the conversation,gonzalez stated that he would rather close the company than reach an agreement with the striking employees,called the strikers jerks and sons of bitches,and indicated he would not be concerned if it cost million to rid the company of them.on february,pan american notified the union that it had decided to lay off fifteen striking employees.a letter from pan american to the union,dated the same day,stated that the layoffs were due to economic reasons and as a result of a substantial decrease in production and sales.gonzalez later confirmed that sales dropped in january and february and conceded that the reduced level of sales caused the company to require a lower work force.
previously,in,pan american had begun to modernize its facilities equipment to satisfy an environmental order which required significant changes in how the company conducted its business operations.the modernization resulted in decreased staffing needs and a reduction of one or two employees in each succeeding year.after the february layoffs,pan american initially did not cite its modernization program as a reason for the layoffs.but after the union filed unfair labor charges with the board,pan american contended before a board administrative law judge alj that the layoffs were attributable to the modernization program.
after a trial,the alj found that pan american had violated the act by implementing the february layoff without giving the union adequate notice and reasonable opportunity to bargain.although the alj found the evidence of modernization and automation compelling enough to rebut a discrimination claim under a,the judge determined the striking employees were engaged in protected activity,found that antiunion animus existed,and noted that the timing of the layoffs in relation to the commencement of the strike was somewhat suspicious in reaching his conclusion that pan american february layoffs violated the act under a as a remedy for the violation,the alj ordered full backpay to and reinstatement of the fifteen employees.the board affirmed the alj ruling and adopted the recommended order.
on its first appeal to this court,pan american asserted that because of the role of its modernization program in the layoffs,it was not required to bargain over the decision to terminate the fifteen employees,only over the effects of the layoffs,see generally first maint,d,and that the appropriate remedy therefore was limited backpay as prescribed in transmarine navigation.a majority of the panel held that the board had not sufficiently explained why pan american had to bargain over a decision motivated both by reduced sales and a modernization program.pan am.grain,at.we thus remanded the case to the board for clarification of how multiple motives for a layoff should be analyzed and whether the board viewed modernization decisions as mandatory subjects of bargaining.
in its supplemental decision and order,the board found that a combination of factors,including a substantial reduction in sales in january and february coinciding with the strike led to the february layoffs such that the layoffs were motivated by reasons other than efficiency gains from modernization.the board held that because pan american failed to establish it would have implemented any particular layoff solely as a result of modernization and even in the absence of its economic reasons,it had a duty to bargain over the february layoff decision.the board noted that it would have addressed this court question of whether a company must bargain over layoffs arising solely because of modernization had pan american established that any particular layoff was based exclusively on the modernization program.based on this reasoning,the board again found that pan american had a duty to bargain with the union over the decision to lay off fifteen employees,which unquestionably affected the terms of unit employees employment in a material and substantial way,and held that the company unilateral implementation of the layoffs violated sections a and of the act.the board again ordered a full backpay remedy.
we now consider whether the board complied with our remand and sufficiently clarified its reasoning such that its finding that pan american violated sections a and of the act and the subsequent remedial order are justified.the board has the primary responsibility for determining the scope of an employer statutory duty to bargain,ford motor,d,and we will affirm the board statutory construction so long as it is reasonably defensible,id.at.see universal camera.a court may not displace the board choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.we treat the factual findings of the board as conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record.id.at.e,f.and because the act has granted the board wide discretion in fashioning remedies,mount desert island,cir,we will not disturb a remedial order unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the act.otis,cir quoting.power.
