in july,the tsa briefed all federal air marshals including robert maclean about a potential plot to hijack passenger flights.a few days after the briefing,maclean received from the tsa a text message cancelling all overnight missions from las vegas until early august.maclean,who was stationed in las vegas,believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous and illegal.he therefore contacted a reporter and told him about the tsa decision to cancel the missions.after discovering that maclean was the source of the disclosure,the tsa fired him for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.
maclean challenged his firing before the merit systems protection board.he argued that his disclosure was whistleblowing activity under b a,which protects employees who disclose information that reveals any violation of any law,rule,or regulation,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.the board held that maclean did not qualify for protection under that statute because his disclosure was specifically prohibited by law,b a namely,by r.the court of appeals for the federal circuit vacated the board decision,holding that section r was not a prohibition.
held maclean disclosure was not specifically prohibited by law.
a the government argues that maclean disclosure was specifically prohibited by law in two ways first,by the tsa regulations on sensitive security information,and second,by section r itself,which authorized the tsa to promulgate those regulations.
i maclean disclosure was not prohibited by the tsa regulations for purposes of section b a because regulations do not qualify as law under that statute.throughout section,congress repeatedly used the phrase law,rule,or regulation.but congress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here it used the word law standing alone.congress choice to say specifically prohibited by law,instead of specifically prohibited by law,rule,or regulation suggests that congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.in addition,section b a creates a second exception for disclosures required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.that the second exception is limited to actions by the president himself suggests that the first exception does not include action taken by executive agencies.finally,interpreting the word law to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.that interpretation would allow an agency to insulate itself from section b a simply by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited all whistleblowing.
the government proposes two alternative interpretations,but neither is persuasive.first,the government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law.the government bases this argument on the decision in chrysler brown,where this court held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law unless there is a clear showing of contrary legislative intent.at.but congress use of the word law,in close connection with the phrase law,rule,or regulation,provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations in this case.second,the government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.the government,however,was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.
ii likewise,maclean disclosure was not prohibited by section r.that statute does not prohibit anything instead,it authorizes the tsa to prescribe regulations.thus,by its terms,section r did not prohibit the disclosure here.the government responds that section r did prohibit maclean disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulations to that effect.but the statute affords substantial discretion to the tsa in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.thus,it is the tsa regulations not the statute that prohibited maclean disclosure,and those regulations do not qualify as law under section b a.
b the government argues that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like maclean would gravely endanger public safety by making the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the tsa employees.those concerns are legitimate,but they must be addressed by congress or the president,rather than by this court.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
federal law generally provides whistleblower protections to an employee who discloses information revealing any violation of any law,rule,or regulation,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.b a.an exception exists,however,for disclosures that are specifically prohibited by law.ibid.here,a federal air marshal publicly disclosed that the transportation security administration tsa had to cut costs by removing air marshals from certain flights.the question presented is whether that disclosure was specifically prohibited by law.
in,congress enacted the homeland security act,stat.as relevant here,that act provides that the tsa shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c.
around the same time,the tsa promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it called sensitive security information.see fed.reg.the regulations described categories of sensitive security information,including s pecific details of aviation security measures such as information concerning specific numbers of federal air marshals,deployments or missions,and the methods involved in such operations.cfr j.sensitive security information is not classified,so the tsa can share it with individuals who do not have a security clearance,such as airport employees.compare exec.order,cfr,comp,with cfr c.
robert maclean became a federal air marshal for the tsa in.in that role,maclean was assigned to protect passenger flights from potential hijackings.see a.
on july,the department of homeland security dhs issued a confidential advisory about a potential hijacking plot.the advisory said that members of the terrorist group al qaeda were planning to attack passenger flights,and that they considered suicide hijackings and bombings as the most promising methods to destroy aircraft in flight,as well as to strike ground targets.app.the advisory identified a number of potential targets,including the united kingdom,italy,australia,and the east coast of the united states.finally,the advisory warned that at least one of the attacks could be executed by the end of the summer.ibid.
the tsa soon summoned all air marshals including maclean for briefings about the hijacking plot.during maclean briefing,a tsa official told him that the hijackers were planning to smuggle weapons in camera equipment or children toys through foreign security,and then fly into the united states into an airport that did require them to be screened.at.the hijackers would then board flights,overpower the crew or the air marshals and fly the planes into east coast targets.at.
a few days after the briefing,maclean received from the tsa a text message cancelling all overnight missions from las vegas until early august.maclean,who was stationed in las vegas,believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous.he also believed that the cancellations were illegal,given that federal law required the tsa to put an air marshal on every flight that present s high security risks,a,and provided that nonstop,long distance flights,such as those targeted on september,should be a priority,b.see app.
maclean therefore asked a supervisor why the tsa had canceled the missions.the supervisor responded that the tsa wanted to save money on hotel costs because there was no more money in the budget.at.maclean also called the dhs inspector general office to report the cancellations.but a special agent in that office told him there was nothing that could be done.at.
unwilling to accept those responses,maclean contacted an msnbc reporter and told him about the canceled missions.in turn,the reporter published a story about the tsa decision,titled air marshals pulled from key flights.at.the story reported that air marshals would no longer be covering or international flights because the agency did not want them to incur the expense of staying overnight in hotels.ibid.the story also reported that the cancellations were particularly disturbing to some because they coincide d with a new hijacking threat issued by the department of homeland security.at.
after msnbc published the story,several members of congress criticized the cancellations.within hours,the tsa reversed its decision and put air marshals back on the flights,at.
at first,the tsa did not know that maclean was the source of the disclosure.in september,however,maclean appeared on nbc nightly news to criticize the tsa dress code for air marshals,which he believed made them too easy to identify.although maclean appeared in disguise,several recognized his voice,and the tsa began investigating the appearance.during that investigation,maclean admitted that he had disclosed the text message back in.consequently,in april,the tsa fired maclean for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.
maclean challenged his firing before the merit systems protection board,arguing in relevant part that his disclosure was protected whistleblowing activity under b a.the board held that maclean did not qualify for protection under that statute,however,because his disclosure was specifically prohibited by law.mspr.
the court of appeals for the federal circuit vacated the board decision.the parties had agreed that,in order for maclean disclosure to be specifically prohibited by law,it must have been prohibited by a statute rather than by a regulation.at emphasis added.thus,the issue before the court was whether the statute authorizing the tsa regulations now codified at r specifically prohibited maclean disclosure,at.
the court first held that section r was not a prohibition.the statute did not expressly prohibit employee disclosures,the court explained,but instead empowered the tsa to prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure s if the tsa decided that disclosing the information would harm public safety,at.the court therefore concluded that maclean disclosure was prohibited by a regulation,which the parties had agreed could not be a law under section b a.ibid.
the court then held that,even if section r were a prohibition,it was not sufficiently specific.ibid.the court explained that a law is sufficiently specific only if it requires that matters be withheld from the public as to leave no discretion on the issue,or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.ibid.quoting.and section r did not meet that test because it provide d only general criteria for withholding information and gave some discretion to the tsa to fashion regulations for prohibiting disclosure.at.the court accordingly vacated the board decision and remanded for a determination of whether maclean disclosure met the other requirements under section b a,at.
we granted certiorari.
section b provides,in relevant part,that a federal agency may not take 
a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of 
a any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences 
i any violation of any law,rule,or regulation,or 
ii gross mismanagement,a gross waste of funds,an abuse of authority,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,
if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.
the government argues that this whistleblower statute does not protect maclean because his disclosure regarding the canceled missions was specifically prohibited by law in two ways.first,the government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by the tsa regulations on sensitive security information cfr a b,j.second,the government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by r,which authorized the tsa to those regulations.we address each argument in turn.
in,the tsa regulations prohibited the disclosure of s pecific details of aviation security measures such as information concerning specific numbers of federal air marshals,deployments or missions,and the methods involved in such operations.cfr j.maclean does not dispute before this court that the tsa regulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the canceled missions.thus,the question here is whether a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is also specifically prohibited by law under section b a.emphasis added.
the answer is no.throughout section,congress repeatedly used the phrase law,rule,or regulation.for example,section b e prohibits a federal agency from discriminating against an employee on the basis of marital status or political affiliation,as prohibited under any law,rule,or regulation.for another example,section b prohibits an agency from grant ing any preference or advantage not authorized by law,rule,or regulation.and for a third example,section b a prohibits an agency from retaliating against an employee for the exercise of any appeal,complaint,or grievance right granted by any law,rule,or regulation.
in contrast,congress did not use the phrase law,rule,or regulation in the statutory language at issue here it used the word law standing alone.that is significant because congress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.russello united states.thus,congress choice to say specifically prohibited by law rather than specifically prohibited by law,rule,or regulation suggests that congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.
the interpretive canon that congress acts intentionally when it omits language included elsewhere applies with particular force here for two reasons.first,congress used law and law,rule,or regulation in close proximity indeed,in the same sentence.b a protecting the disclosure of any violation of any law,rule,or regulation if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law second,congress used the broader phrase law,rule,or regulation repeatedly nine times in section alone.see a d i,b e,b,b a i,b b i,b a,b,b,d.those two aspects of the whistleblower statute make congress choice to use the narrower word law seem quite deliberate.
we drew the same inference in department of treasury,irs flra.there,the government argued that the word laws in one section of the civil service reform act of meant the same thing as the phrase law,rule,or regulation in another section of the act,at.we rejected that argument as contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text.at.indeed,we held that a statute that referred to laws in one section and law,rule,or regulation in another can not,unless we abandon all pretense at precise communication,be deemed to mean the same thing in both places.ibid.that inference is even more compelling here,because the statute refers to law and law,rule,or regulation in the same sentence,rather than several sections apart.
another part of the statutory text points the same way.after creating an exception for disclosures specifically prohibited by law,section b a goes on to create a second exception for information specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.this exception is limited to action taken directly by the president.that suggests that the word law in the only other exception is limited to actions by congress after all,it would be unusual for the first exception to include action taken by executive agencies,when the second exception requires action by the president himself.
in addition,a broad interpretation of the word law could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.if law included agency rules and regulations,then an agency could insulate itself from the scope of section b a merely by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited whistleblowing.but congress passed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did not trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their ranks.thus,it is unlikely that congress meant to include rules and regulations within the word law.
the government admits that some regulations fall outside the word law as used in section b a.but,the government says,that does not mean that all regulations are excluded.the government suggests two interpretations that would distinguish law from law,rule,or regulation,but would still allow the word law to subsume the tsa regulations on sensitive security information.
first,the government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law legislative regulations,while excluding those that do not,interpretive rules.brief for petitioner.the government bases this argument on our decision in chrysler brown.there,we held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law,and that it would take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before we concluded otherwise,at.thus,because the tsa regulations have the force and effect of law,the government says that they should qualify as law under the statute.
the government description of chrysler is accurate enough.but congress use of the word law,in close connection with the phrase law,rule,or regulation,provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations.indeed,using law and law,rule,or regulation in the same sentence would be a very obscure way of drawing the government nuanced distinction between different types of regulations.had congress wanted to draw that distinction,there were far easier and clearer ways to do so.for example,at the time congress passed section b a,another federal statute defined the words regulatory order to include a rule or regulation,if it has the force and effect of law.a ed.likewise,another federal statute defined the words state law to include all laws,decisions,rules,regulations,or other state action having the effect of law.c ed.as those examples show,congress knew how to distinguish between regulations that had the force and effect of law and those that did not,but chose not to do so in section b a.
second,the government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.brief for petitioner.outside of this case,however,the government was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.not a single dictionary definition,not a single statute,not a single case.the government interpretation happens to fit this case precisely,but it needs more than that to recommend it.
although the government argues here that the word law includes rules and regulations,it definitively that argument in the court of appeals.for example,the government brief accepted that the word law meant legislative enactment,and said that the only dispute was whether r serve d as that legislative enactment.brief for respondent in ca fed.then,at oral argument,a judge asked the government attorney the following question i thought i understood your brief to concede that the word law ca be a rule or regulation,it means statute.am i wrong the government attorney responded you not wrong your honor.i be as clear as i can.specifically prohibited by law here means statute.oral arg.audio in,at see also,at now,as we been discussing here,we not saying here that the word law needs to encompass regulations.we saying statute.those concessions reinforce our conclusion that the government proposed interpretations are unpersuasive.
in sum,when congress used the phrase specifically prohibited by law instead of specifically prohibited by law,rule,or regulation,it meant to exclude rules and regulations.we therefore hold that the tsa regulations do not qualify as law for purposes of section b a.
we next consider whether maclean disclosure regarding the canceled missions was specifically prohibited by r itself.as relevant here,that statute provides that the tsa shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c.
this statute does not prohibit anything.on the,it authorizes something it authorizes the under secretary to prescribe regulations.thus,by its terms section r did not prohibit the disclosure at issue here.
the government responds that section r did prohibit maclean disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulations to that effect.see brief for petitioner,see also post,at sotomayor,dissenting.but the government pushes the statute too far.section r says that the tsa shall prohibit disclosures only if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c emphasis added.that language affords substantial discretion to the tsa in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.
the dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discretion,viewing it as the almost ministerial task of identifying whether a particular piece of information falls within the scope of congress command.post,at.but determining which documents meet the statutory standard of detrimental to the security of transportation requires the exercise of considerable judgment.for example,the government says that section r requires the under secretary to prohibit disclosures like maclean.the government also says,however,that the statute does not require the under secretary to prohibit an employee from disclosing that federal air marshals will be absent from important flights,but declining to specify which flights.reply brief.that distinction comes not from section r itself,but from the under secretary exercise of discretion.it is the tsa regulations not the statute that prohibited maclean disclosure.and as the dissent agrees,a regulation does not count as law under the whistleblower statute.see post,at.
the government insists,however,that this grant of discretion does not make section r any less of a prohibition.in support,the government relies on administrator,faa robertson.that case involved the freedom of information act foia,which requires federal agencies to disclose information upon request unless,among other things,the information is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.b.in robertson,we held that the federal aviation act of was one such statute,becaus
