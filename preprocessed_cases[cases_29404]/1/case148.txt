in,christine johnson,an instructor in graphics,was denied a position in the engineering department at the university of puerto rico mayaguez campus upr.three others did receive positions one woman and two men,all of whom had,as the position description required.johnson did not have a and did not accept offers by upr to pay for her to get one.
johnson filed administrative discrimination gender and national origin charges,followed by a title vii lawsuit,against upr.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant,rejecting johnson claims that she was qualified for the position,that upr reliance on her lack of a was a pretext,and that the real reason for the failure to give her a position was discrimination.we affirm,finding that the requirement for positions was a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for upr actions and that johnson did not meet her burden of showing that the articulated reason was pretextual.
factual background 
johnson,a native of new york,received her master degree in architecture from the university of buffalo.johnson moved to puerto rico in and began working at upr mayaguez campus in january of.
upr is an organic system of higher education composed of institutional units which function with academic and administrative autonomy within standards provided by puerto rico law and the rules and regulations of the board of trustees.laws ann.tit,a.the mayaguez campus is one such institutional unit.id.a.puerto rico law provides the chancellor of the mayaguez campus with,among other things,the authority to appoint deans for the different schools,directors for different departments,and administrative and academic personnel.id.c.
at upr mayaguez campus,johnson served as a graphics in the department of engineering for approximately twelve years under temporary service contracts that were formalized every semester johnson federal complaint asserts claims dating back to.in,the department of engineering wanted to offer more graphics classes,most of which were taught by instructors with temporary contracts,and was having a difficult time hiring graphics professors who possessed,as required by departmental guidelines.the department of engineering accordingly approved a resolution,on april,requesting permission of the chancellor to hire graphics professors who did not have.the request was apparently granted.
three individuals who did not have applied for probationary appointments,and two josé and joseph robinson were given appointments beginning on july.johnson did not apply for the position.
robinson,like johnson,was born in the united states.he was hired because he was the only one qualified to teach the class creative design inge,and he also possessed an engineering degree.crespo was hired to teach the class inge,because out of all those who applied and had taught the class,he had the most experience,since he had taught the class in a capacity for the five previous semesters.
after those two hires,the department of engineering did not seek or hire any other individual for a position until the time period.
in the meantime,on november,upr board of trustees amended the general rules and regulations governing upr to clarify that to obtain a faculty position a candidate needed to have a.the regulations state,in section a,that 
as of fiscal year,in order to hold a position of professor or researcher,or to hold a rank in said categories,the person must have,at least,obtained a doctoral degree or equivalent terminal degree in areas that train him or her especially for the subject matters that he or she teaches,researches,or is in charge of.
on april,walter silva araya,the of the department of engineering,issued a public announcement for a position as an assistant professor teaching graphics in the department of engineering.the announcement stated that to be considered for the position the candidate had to have a or in architecture or mechanical engineering.the alternative was contrary to upr amended general regulations and was a mistake.johnson,who had an in architecture,sent a letter to silva on april,before the public announcement,expressing her interest in a position.four other individuals,along with johnson,all of whom lacked,applied for the position.of the five candidates,three were women.no position was ever filled based on this announcement.
the personnel committee of the department of engineering recommended that johnson be chosen in response to the april announcement,but the promotion hit a snag when the recommendation was submitted to chancellor juan vélez arocho.the chancellor rejected the recommendation because the public announcement allowed an individual without a to be appointed to a position,in violation of the general regulations.moreover,johnson herself did not have a and so was not qualified.silva testified that the mistake was an oversight on his part,and the public announcement was cancelled on may.
at this time,silva sought alternative options for johnson,and the chancellor recommended to silva that johnson be offered a leave of absence to pursue a.upr offered to pay for tuition,books,living expenses,and travel.however,johnson never accepted upr offer.
on june,silva issued a new public announcement for the same position,which corrected his earlier mistake.this announcement stated that a pplicants must have a.in civil or mechanical engineering and demonstrate potential for research and teaching.
ten candidates,including johnson,applied for the position.of those ten,six had a,two were in programs,one johnson had a master degree,and one had a bachelor degree.the applications created considerable discussion on the personnel committee because some members wanted to make johnson an offer.however,in the end,she was ranked fourth of the ten,and the top three,all of whom had a,were made offers and accepted.on july,aidcer vidot,luis montejo,and carlos marín were hired.in addition to their,all three had teaching experience as professors,instructors,or teaching assistants.vidot is a woman,montejo is from colombia,and marín is from spain.
in december,with the addition of three new faculty members,upr no longer needed johnson services.as a result,when johnson temporary contract expired that month,upr and johnson did not formalize a new temporary service contract.
procedural history 
on june,johnson filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc against upr,alleging gender and national origin discrimination.she received notification of her right to sue on november.she never sought to amend the charge.on december,she filed suit in federal district court in puerto rico,alleging gender and national origin discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,along with other commonwealth law claims not before us on appeal.
upr moved for summary judgment on april,which the district court granted on march.johnson of,cv adc.the district court ruled that johnson claims arising from the failure to give her a position in,for which she had not applied,were untimely and no longer actionable because johnson failed to file an administrative charge with the eeoc within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.see e.as to the employment actions in and,the district court found that johnson had not established a prima facie case because she did not demonstrate that she was qualified for the position and because the candidates chosen were more qualified since they possessed.finally,the district court concluded that even assuming johnson established a prima facie case,the requirement was a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for upr decision not to hire johnson,and the court explained that johnson services were no longer needed once the other candidates were hired.johnson did not establish that the articulated reason was a sham to cover up a discriminatory purpose.
standard of review 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.galera johanns,cir.we view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,id.at,and make all reasonable inferences in that party favor,thompson coca cola,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a cox hainey,cir.we look to the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions on file,and any affidavits in making the determination.thompson,at.a dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the party.id.quoting sanchez alvarado,cir internal quotation mark omitted.a fact is material if it has potential to determine the outcome of the litigation.maymí ports,cir.
once a properly supported motion has been presented,where a nonmovant bears the burden of proof on an issue,the nonmovant must point to competent evidence and specific facts to defeat summary judgment.tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.the evidence proffered must be significantly probative of specific facts,perez volvo car,cir,and the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmovant position is insufficient,anderson liberty lobby,d.
timeliness of plaintiff eeoc charge as to and events 
the district court held that all claims about events which occurred more than days prior to johnson filing the administrative charge with the eeoc on june,including the decision not to offer her a position,were untimely and not actionable.johnson argues that the adverse employment actions constituted a continuing violation.her argument fails.
under e,a plaintiff must file an administrative charge with the eeoc within or days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.frederique alexandre dep t of natural envtl.res.of,cir.puerto rico is a deferral jurisdiction,so the administrative charge must be filed within days of the alleged unlawful conduct.id.
the district court correctly held that the allegations involved discrete acts failure to give johnson a position for which she did not apply,denials of promotion to a position,and nonrenewal of her temporary contract in these squarely fit within the supreme court explanation of what discrete acts are.in national railroad passenger morgan,d,the supreme court said they are acts such as termination,failure to promote,denial of transfer,or refusal to hire.id.at.such acts are not actionable if time barred,even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock.id.at see rivera aqueduct sewers,cir.
on appeal,johnson recharacterizes her claims as hostile work environment claims,see,tobin liberty mut.ins,cir stating t he classic example of a continuing violation is a hostile work environment,but such revision is both too late and meritless in any event.discrete acts and hostile work environment claims are different in kind,morgan,at,because hostile work environment claims by their nature involve repeated conduct and a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own,see also ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,d,superseded in part by statute,lilly ledbetter fair pay act of,stat,as recognized in galera,at.
only those acts that occurred within the days before june,are actionable,from august,
plaintiff remaining title vii claims fail on the merits 
where,as here,there is no direct evidence of discrimination in violation of title vii,a plaintiff claim is governed by the scheme set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see lockridge of me,cir.under that scheme,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination,which creates an inference of discrimination.kosereis rhode island,cir.if a prima facie case is established the burden of production but not the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer,who must articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.lockridge,at.if the employer provides such a reason,the plaintiff has to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer proffered reason is pretextual and that the actual reason for the adverse employment action is discriminatory.smith stratus computer,cir.
johnson claims fail because she did not meet upr requirement,which was a facially reasonable and legitimate requirement.moreover,johnson has not shown that the reason is pretextual.
johnson was not qualified under a facially reasonable and legitimate requirement 
johnson was not qualified under upr requirements for a appointment because she did not have a see welch mercer,app x,cir plaintiff not qualified where school required an or for a promotion and plaintiff had neither see also jiminez mary washington,cir failure to obtain in timely fashion was legitimate ground for termination.johnson argues that we must consider other facts that show she was qualified,including her length of time teaching,her reputation as the best graphics teacher at upr,and the fact that she was recommended for a position after the first public announcement in.
but upr requirement was reasonable on its face and was plainly legitimate.see jiminez,at.of the three individuals hired under the requirement,one was a woman,and two were of foreign nationalities one colombian and one spaniard.moreover,as silva testified,requiring professors to have a ph.benefits upr in a number of ways.the requirement helps promote the teaching of the most scholarship to students,provides prestige to upr,helps it compete with other universities around the globe,is required for upr to be a institution,and helps upr obtain funding since research professors with doctorate degrees are basically upr main source of research funding.
johnson responds that the doctoral degree requirement is motivated purely by economic reasons.silva testimony establishes otherwise,and the objection is meritless in any event.courts may not sit as super personnel departments,assessing the merits or even the rationality of employers nondiscriminatory business decisions.mesnick,cir.further,the defendant agents were acting under regulations imposed by the board of trustees,which puerto rico law makes binding.see laws ann.tit,a.the requirement was not discriminatory.
johnson can not establish pretext 
in any event,johnson has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the requirement is merely pretextual and the true reason for upr actions is discriminatory.johnson argument primarily rests on the ground that upr could have applied an exception to the requirement.however,she did not satisfy two parts of the exception.first,she would not obtain a even when offered a leave of absence and financial assistance.second,it was not difficult to recruit for the position.
section a of the general regulations states that 
persons who do not fully meet the academic degree requirements may be recruited as teaching staff as long as they have stood out by their exceptional merits in the field of their speciality,or have a recognized competency in an area of difficult recruitment or skills.
to benefit from the exception,section a states that the individual must agree to obtain the required degree in a reasonable period of time.
upr,on the recommendation of the chancellor,offered to grant johnson a leave of absence to pursue a subsidized by upr,and johnson never accepted the offer.johnson herself admitted that she had been encouraged by upr to get a doctorate,that upr offered financial assistance,and that nevertheless she never pursued a so,the exception would not have applied to her.
moreover,johnson did not show that upr had a difficult time recruiting individuals for the position.in fact,six of the ten applicants for the second public announcement had and two others were completing their.
johnson other pretext argument is that the deposition testimony by wilma santiago gabrielini demonstrates that the adverse employment actions were based on the chancellor bias against women but santiago opinion testimony was based on speculation because she lacked any personal knowledge about the events at issue.no reasonable jury could find pretext from this testimony we add that the chancellor is the one who recommended that silva offer johnson a leave of absence to pursue a subsidized.additionally,he had hired women in the past,including santiago,and awarded a position to a woman in response to the june announcement.
