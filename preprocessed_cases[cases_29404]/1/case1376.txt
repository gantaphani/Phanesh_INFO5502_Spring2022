this appeal arises from an action brought by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on behalf of albert bernard pearson,keith wilson,and gradian graham,present or former african american employees of xerxes corporation xerxes,alleging a hostile work environment on the basis of race,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,title vii.the district court granted summary judgment for xerxes.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
xerxes is a fiberglass tank manufacturer based in minneapolis,minnesota.pearson,wilson,and graham worked as assemblers at xerxes plant in williamsport,maryland.bob shifflett was their shift supervisor.he reported to plant superintendent greg carty,who reported to plant manager wayne green.
at all times,xerxes had in place a comprehensive corporate compliance program and program guide,prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the plant.plant employees were instructed to report any violations to their supervisor,plant manager,or a member of xerxes compliance committee.in addition,as of at least january,xerxes also had in place a separate policy,which prohibited sexual,racial and other objectionable conduct or unlawful harassment.the policy provided specific examples of prohibited conduct and,among other directions,instructed plant employees to immediately report the incident to your supervisor and plant manager.all employees received copies of xerxes policies and were trained in them at the time of hire.refresher training was conducted annually.
xerxes and its nonsupervisory employees were also subject to a collective bargaining agreement the cba between xerxes and the united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america,local the union.the cba prohibited unlawful discrimination against employees on account of race,color,creed,national origin,religion,sex,sexual orientation,pregnancy,marital status,age,disability,or union affiliation,or any other legally protected class status.the cba also protected union employees from being disciplined or discharged without just cause.the cba contained a grievance procedure for alleged violations,and union representatives were regularly available to meet with employees about any concerns.the union president testified that xerxes took a strong stance against discrimination,and seem ed to respond very quickly whenever there were allegations of discrimination.
bernard pearson was hired by xerxes to work at the plant on a temporary basis in april and as a employee in june.he testified that from june until february,his coworkers subjected him to repeated racial slurs and pranks in the plant.he testified that amber gatrell used the word n in his presence on repeated occasions and referred to him as boy.he testified that floyd myers called him boy and black polack,and called a white woman a n lover.he also testified that unknown coworkers occasionally played pranks on him,such as turning the lights off in the bathroom and throwing wet paper towels at him,placing gel on the doorknob in the bathroom so that he could not open the door,tampering with his toolbox lock,and hiding his toolbox.pearson testified that he reported these incidents to shifflett as they occurred,but that shifflett did nothing until february.he did not complain to any other members of management.
keith wilson was hired by xerxes as a temporary employee in october and as a employee in december.he alleges that he was first subjected to racial harassment by his coworkers in november.he testified that on two or three occasions someone stole or threw away his and pearson lunches.he also complained that tammy smith called him by names,including buckwheat,benson,and yellow boy.wilson testified that he reported the incidents to shifflett as they occurred,but did not complain to any other management employee because the union representative told him he had to report them to his direct supervisor first.
on february,however,two related incidents involving gatrell and myers were reported to shifflett and to green.wilson testified that while he was working with gatrell,she said to him,boy you do lay up no manway like that.wilson reported the incident to shifflett and told shifflett that where i come from boy is another name for the n word.shifflett memorialized the complaint and his response in writing,as follows 
gatrell and wilson were working together and it was at the end of the shift.wilson started to take the dumpster up to dump it.gatrell said to wilson hey boy you ca dump the dumpster yet because its not later wilson and pearson came to me and said that they were tired of people saying boy to them and other racial slurs.i told wilson and pearson that no they do have to listen to this and that it would be dealt with right away.i went to gatrell and told her that i think the best thing to do is go to wilson and say to him that if he took o ffense about her saying boy to him that she was sorry.the next day gatrell talked to wilson and pearson in the parking lot and told wilson just what i said to.
gatrell admitted using the term boy,but claimed that she did not intend it to be racially offensive.later that same evening,myers exchanged words with pearson and wilson in the lunchroom and said something like,yeah,boy,well i see you outside.myers also admitted using the term boy during the exchange,but claimed that he did not intend it to be racially offensive.after green met with myers about the incident,myers apologized to pearson and wilson.green also held a meeting with the shift employees to review xerxes policies.green reminded the employees that racial harassment,including comments,was prohibited and warned that future misconduct would result in disciplinary action.
after february,wilson reported no further incidents of racial harassment until june in may,however,pearson complained to shifflett that two different coworkers had referred to music being played in the plant as jungle music and n music.shifflett told pearson that he should report the incidents to carty.carty,in turn,met with pearson and the union representative.at the meeting,pearson also told carty about the problems he had experienced with gatrell and myers,and told carty that he wanted it to stop.carty told pearson not to say anything to anyone and that he would take care of it.
when green learned of pearson complaint,he notified xerxes corporate office and ronald bachmeier,the eeo coordinator,traveled to the plant to investigate according to bachmeier 
while at the plant,i conducted a comprehensive investigation into pearson allegations.i interviewed pearson as well as more than other employees.interviewees either denied pearson allegations,explained that pearson had taken their remarks out of context,indicated that they did not mean their remarks to be racially offensive,or had since apologized for those remarks,and explained that pearson had himself engaged in interaction with other employees using profanity and the racially offensive term n.neither pearson nor any other employee attributed any racially offensive remarks to any xerxes supervisor.moreover,although pearson contended that he had spoken with certain xerxes supervisors regarding his concerns,those supervisors credibly disputed pearson contention that he spoke to them or pearson version of their communications.
at the conclusion of the investigation,the following actions were taken by xerxes.myers and gatrell were each issued unpaid suspensions from work and required to attend refresher training in the policies.they were also placed on a final warning that xerxes w ould terminate their employment if it was ever determine d that they engaged,directly or indirectly,in hostile,offensive,or otherwise unlawful conduct toward any xerxes employee.they were also instructed as follows 
you are under no circumstances to have any hostile,offensive,or otherwise unlawful interaction with pearson.you shall not make any racially hostile,offensive,or intimidating remarks,gestures,or engage in any conduct,of any type,which is racially offensive.this prohibition applies to our entire plant,including plant production areas,break areas,lunchroom,restrooms,and parking lot.
bachmeier determined that coworker brian bradley had referred to certain music as jungle music,but that he had not made the remark with intent to disparage any employee race,and had apologized to pearson and another employee.bradley was issued a written disciplinary warning and also required to attend refresher training.he was warned not to engage in prohibited discrimination,harassment,or objectionable conduct to any employee or make any racially hostile,offensive,or intimidating remarks,gestures,or engage in any conduct,of any type,which is racially offensive.he was also warned that future misconduct would subject him to further discipline,up to and including the termination of his employment.
during his investigation of pearson complaint,bachmeier also learned that coworker tammy smith had used the term buckwheat,in the context of a conversation with another african american employee,but determined that her use of the name was related to a television show and that she had credibly denied that she intended the remark to be in any way racially derogatory.in light of the nature of her remark,her explanation,and her credibility regarding the use and context in which she made the remark,smith was provided a verbal counseling remind ing her of her obligation to comply with xerxes policies,and required to attend refresher training.smith was also warned that violations of the harassment policies would result in appropriate disciplinary action in the future 
finally,bachmeier conducted refresher training of all employees regarding xerxes eeo and policies.this included a review of employees options for reporting incidents to xerxes eeo coordinator or corporate compliance committee to facilitate a response by the company.in a separate session,bachmeier retrained the supervisory personnel as well,including their responsibilities with respect to the promotion of a work environment in which all employees are treated lawfully,with dignity and respect.pearson was provided a memorandum summarizing xerxes investigation and response to his complaint,and thanking him for coming forward.pearson withdrew his mchr charge and there were no further reports of harassment at the xerxes plant until april,nearly a full year later.
on april,pearson found a x piece of fiberglass in his locker with the following message on it kkk plans could result in death,serious personal injury,nigga benard.pearson reported the incident to the union representative and green,and xerxes promptly began an investigation pearson also reported the incident to the eeoc.unfortunately,pearson could not identify the culprit,nor name any particular suspect.xerxes was also unable to determine who was responsible.
on april,green reported the incident to the local sheriff office.three days later,green held a plant meeting with all employees.at this meeting,green warned the employees that the act was inappropriate and unacceptable,that xerxes had requested a full police investigation,and that anyone with information about the incident was expected to come forward.the employees were advised that xerxes would take immediate and appropriate discipline,which in all likelihood,would result in termination should xerxes or the police find the person responsible for the act,and that xerxes would encourage criminal prosecution if available.xerxes also posted a notice in the plant to the same effect.
on april,sheriff deputy grimm responded to the plant request to investigate the incident.green advised deputy grimm that pearson had reported racial remarks in the past by fellow employees,but they were handled internally through human resources and none ever contained any reference to the kkk.pearson also told deputy grimm that he could identify no particular person as a suspect but stated there were cliques in the workplace and a number of people could be responsible.the sheriff office was unable to determine who was responsible and advised pearson to report any further incidents.
after the april incident,green periodically checked on pearson to see if he had experienced any further problems.on june,during one such inquiry,pearson told green that someone had put resin on his toolbox lock,but that nothing else had happened.pearson told green that he did not know who played the prank,but he thought there were still a few people play ing games with him.green told pearson that xerxes would get him a replacement lock and reminded pearson to immediately report such incidents.green also assured pearson that the training had been done many times and everyone knows what they are supposed to do and not do so if someone is still playing games we will catch them and we will deal with it strongly.
on june,wilson discovered a small,drawing depicting a person hanging by a noose and the phrase ih ih my n.several days later,wilson reported the incident to shifflett,who made a copy of the drawing and notified green.wilson reported the incident to the eeoc as well.green met with wilson,reported the incident to the sheriffs office,and notified the corporate office.when mike zais,xerxes eeo coordinator at that time,learned of the incident,he also traveled to the plant to investigate and interview employees.unfortunately,the person responsible for this incident was also never identified 
on august,zais summarized xerxes response to the complaints of racial harassment in a memorandum to wilson.zais advised wilson that in response to his concern and those of two other employees,a number of steps had been taken in order to make sure that xerxes maintain s a workplace free of discrimination and harassment.this included an internal investigation and employee interviews enlisting the assistance of the local sheriff office retraining of all supervisors disciplining three employees who xerxes had concluded had violated the prohibition against discrimination and harassment posting notices reminding the employees of the standards of conduct and prohibition of harassment advising the union that xerxes will not tolerate racial discrimination or harassment,and that xerxes will respond to such conduct with strong discipline,including the termination of employees when appropriate and discussing with individual employees situations in which they may have unintentionally offended other employees.
with regard to the sketch itself,zais assured wilson that xerxes is both highly offended by and absolutely opposed to such a communication and that i f we are able to determine who created that communication,and if that person is an employee,xerxes will in all likelihood terminate their employment.wilson was asked to immediately notify xerxes if he learn ed of information that would allow xerxes to identify who created that communication.wilson testified that he did not know what xerxes could have done to discover who created the drawing.
at the time of this appeal,wilson was still employed at the xerxes plant and,with the exception of an isolated comment allegedly made by tammy smith in august,discussed infra,he reported no further incidents of racial harassment after june.pearson also reported no further incidents of racial harassment after june.he voluntarily resigned from xerxes in february,in order to take a position at a correctional facility.prior to leaving,pearson left a message with green indicating his desire to return to xerxes if his new position did not work out.the only violation of the policy that was reported occurred in august.it involved a racial joke told by a white employee to two other white employees.after unsuccessfully attempting to stop their coworker,the two employees reported the incident to xerxes management and the offending party was immediately terminated with the support of the union.
gradian graham was employed by xerxes from august until april.graham testified that during the first two weeks of his employment,coemployee bob churchey did a poor job of training him and encouraged shifflett to fire him.after these two weeks,shifflett reassigned graham to carolyn reed to complete his training.graham also testified that churchey used the n word a bunch of different times during his employment.when asked for details,however,graham could only state that churchey had used the n word on n ot one occasion,but he could not say the exact dates of these.his best recollection was that i t was during his time of employment at xerxes.graham testified that he complained about churchey to shifflett and carty,but was likewise unable to recall any details about these alleged complaints 
graham remaining complaints pertain to shifflett.on january,shifflett told carty that he was having a recurring problem with graham coming to work without the key to his lock.when carty met with graham about shifflett concerns,graham claimed that shifflett did not like him because he was black.carty immediately requested a meeting with the union representative and green.graham only complaint at this meeting,however,was that shifflett stare d at him strangely,which green found insufficient to support a charge of racial discrimination.on january,graham told carty that shifflett had looked under the restroom stall at him and that this incident was witnessed by a coemployee,tony yung.again,the complaint was immediately investigated by green.yung told green that shifflett had entered the bathroom the previous day,but had simply looked at the sink and walked out.yung denied that shifflett had looked under the stall at graham.according to green,graham then changed his story and claimed that shifflett had looked at him through the cracks in the stall door,which was also contrary to yung account.graham denies changing his story and maintains that shifflett looked under the stall door at him.green concluded that graham complaint was not been made in good faith and,because graham had a documented written warning and recent incident of insubordination,issued graham a final warning.
on april,however,graham was instead terminated for excessive absenteeism after receiving several disciplinary warnings for attendance.graham testified that he had been having personal and financial problems that interfered with his attendance and work.he never filed a grievance with the union regarding racial discrimination,his disciplinary warnings,or his termination.he also never filed a charge with the eeoc regarding racial discrimination.the eeoc does not contend that graham termination is related to alleged racial harassment.
in july,the eeoc initiated this action on behalf of pearson,wilson,and a class of black individuals,alleging a hostile work environment.graham was identified as the only additional complainant during litigation 
the district court granted summary judgment to xerxes,based on its conclusion that xerxes responses to the reports of harassment were reasonable as a matter of law.specifically,the district court held that whenever xerxes learned of harassment,it acted quickly and reasonably effectively to end it.with regard to graham,the district court noted its doubts that the sporadic instances of harassment experienced by graham would meet the threshold of severe or pervasive harassment,and held that graham complaints about shifflett were not actionable because there was insufficient evidence that the incidents were based on race.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to xerxes,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the eeoc.eeoc central wholesalers,cir internal quotation marks omitted.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.

in this case it is undisputed that xerxes policies provide d reasonable procedures for victims to register complaints.ocheltree,at howard,at.thus,for purposes of the fourth element,we need only inquire as to whether the eeoc presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that xerxes responses to the complaints made under its policies were not reasonably calculated to end the harassment and,therefore,that liability for the harassment may be imputed to it.
there is no exhaustive list or particular combination of remedial measures or steps that an employer need employ to insulate itself from liability.central wholesalers,at.among other things,we have considered the promptness of the employer investigation when complaints are made,whether offending employees were counseled or disciplined for their actions,and whether the employer response was actually effective.however,the mere fact that harassment reoccurs in the workplace,either by the same offender or different offenders,does not,ipso facto,allow a jury to conclude that an employer response was not reasonably calculated to end the harassment.see adler wal mart stores,cir.the cessation of harassment shows effectiveness,which in turn evidences such reasonable calculation.see also mikels,at noting that we have given great weight to the fact that a particular response was demonstrably adequate to cause cessation of the conduct in question.but this is not the sole factor to be considered.because there is no strict liability and an employer must only respond reasonably,a response may be so calculated even though the perpetrator might persist,adler,at,or,as in this case,harassment reoccurs in the workplace.a remedial action that effectively stops the harassment will be deemed adequate as a matter of law.on the other hand,it is possible that an action that proves to be ineffective in stopping the harassment may nevertheless be found reasonably calculated to prevent future harassment and therefore adequate as a matter of law.knabe boury,cir.in such cases,
courts consider the timeliness of the plaintiff complaint,whether the employer unduly delayed,and whether the response was proportional to the seriousness and frequency of the harassment by way of example,responses that have been held reasonable have often included prompt investigation of the allegations,proactive solicitation of complaints,scheduling changes and transfers,oral or written warnings to refrain from harassing conduct,reprimands,and warnings that future misconduct could result in progressive discipline,including suspension and termination.
the employer is,of course,obliged to respond to any repeat conduct and whether the next employer response is reasonable may very well depend upon whether the employer progressively stiffens its discipline,or vainly hopes that no response,or the same response as before,will be effective.repeat conduct may show the unreasonableness of prior responses.on the other hand,an employer is not liable,although harassment persists,so long as each response was reasonable.it follows that an employer is not required to terminate a particular perpetrator except where termination is the only response that would be reasonably calculated to end the harassment.
adler,at cir citations omitted see also central wholesalers,at noting that we also consider whether the employer took increasingly progressive measures to address the harassment when its initial responses proved ineffective.
we begin with the district court grant of summary judgment on the hostile work environment claims advanced by the eeoc on behalf of pearson and wilson.the eeoc contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to xerxes as to these claims because a reasonable jury could find that xerxes was placed on actual notice of racial harassment by coworkers of pearson in june and of wilson in november,when they first complained to shifflett,respectively that xerxes failed to respond to their complaints at all until february and that xerxes failed to respond to their complaints thereafter with remedial action reasonably calculated to end the harassment.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the eeoc,we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether xerxes had notice of the alleged racial slurs and pranks in the workplace prior to february,but failed to respond with any remedial action.
pearson and wilson each testified that prior to february,they were subjected to the repeated use of racial slurs by gatrell and myers,as well as to various pranks by unknown coworkers that they believed were racially motivated.in addition,wilson testified that tammy smith used names when addressing him.if the facts are as asserted by pearson and wilson,they would constitute racial harassment sufficient to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive atmosphere.spriggs,at.the men also testified that they first reported this harassment to shifflett in june and november,respectively,and continued as the incidents occurred thereafter,up to and including the complaints they made on february,about gatrell and myers.however,xerxes did nothing in response to their complaints until february.
at the time of the prior complaints,xerxes compliance program guide advised employees that they may report a violation of the program by approaching or telephoning their supervisor,plant manager,or a member of xerxes compliance committee,as the circumstances dictate.emphasis added.as the direct supervisor of pearson and wilson,therefore,shifflett was specifically designated as an appropriate person to receive such complaints.
xerxes disputes that complaints of racial harassment were made to shifflett prior to the february,incident with gatrell and myers,but a jury could reasonably credit the testimony of pearson and wilson and conclude otherwise.accordingly,we hold that a reasonable juror could find that the complaints by pearson and wilson to shifflett prior to february were sufficient to place xerxes on actual notice of the racial slurs and pranks in the plant and that xerxes response was unreasonable.accordingly,we vacate the district court award of summary judgment for any alleged racial harassment of pearson and wilson occurring before february,and we remand for further proceedings as to this time period.
with regard to the incidents of racial harassment that were reported on february,and beyond,however,we hold that xerxes response to each reported incident was reasonably calculated to end the harassment and,therefore,reasonable as a matter of law.accordingly,we affirm the district court award of summary judgment for the alleged racial harassment as to this time period.
as of february,xerxes had in place extensive policies consistent with title vii that directed plant employees to immediately report any racial harassment to their supervisor and the plant manager.the employees were assured that their complaints would be promptly investigated and that appropriate remedial action would be taken.
on february,when shifflett and green were made aware of the incident involving gatrell and myers,xerxes response was prompt and proportional to the seriousness of the offense.gatrell and myers were individually counseled and they apologized.in addition,green held a meeting with the shift employees to review xerxes policies and warn that future misconduct would result in disciplinary action.the fact that formal disciplinary action,such as suspension or termination,was not taken against gatrell and myers at that time is an insufficient basis for concluding that xerxes response was unreasonable.see knabe,at t aking punitive action against a harassing employee,reprimand,suspension or dismissal,is not necessary to insulate the employee from liability for a hostile work environment.so long as the remedy is reasonably calculated to prevent future instances of harassment,the company can not be held liable.footnote omitted.as the eeoc has argued,green apparently believed that,because gatrell and myers had apologized and the training had been reinforced,they would not continue to use offensive language in the workplace.his assumption was correct.while myers and gatrell were disciplined for their prior conduct in july,there is no evidence that either of them engaged in acts of racial harassment after february.
in may,pearson complained to shifflett and carty about other coworkers using terms to describe music being played in the plant.pearson also told carty about his previous problems with myers and gatrell,and told carty that he wanted the racial slurs to stop.when green learned of pearson complaint,he notified the corporate office,and an escalated response ensued.bachmeier immediately traveled to the plant to conduct a formal investigation and employee interviews.at the conclusion of the investigation,xerxes imposed written disciplinary action upon myers and gatrell,including unpaid suspensions from work,and issued a final,written warning that any future violations of the policies would result in their termination.bradley received a written disciplinary warning for his use of a term to describe music,and he was advised that he faced possible termination for future violations as well.tammy smith was verbally counseled for her use of a racial nickname during her conversation with another african american employee,presumably wilson.in addition,bachmeier conducted refresher training of all supervisory and nonsupervisory employees in their respective obligations under xerxes policies.
in sum,xerxes response to the complaints of racial harassment in,taken in consultation with the union representatives for the victims and the accused,was prompt,proportional to the seriousness and frequency of the various offenses,and employed increasingly progressive measures to address the harassment that had occurred in the workplace.central wholesalers,at see adler,at.this included employee counseling and disciplinary action,suspensions of two employees,and warnings that future misconduct could result in progressive discipline,up to and including termination.it was not only reasonably calculated to end the harassment as a matter of law,sunbelt,at internal quotation marks omitted,it was actually effective.there were no reported incidents of racial slurs for over two years,and no incidents of pranks for nearly a year thereafter 
in april and june,pearson and wilson each found an anonymous,message in his locker.the messages were unquestionably abhorrent.however,they were of a much different character than the racial slurs and pranks that had been the subject of the complaints the previous year.there was no reason to believe that the employees disciplined in were involved in the incidents in.and the eeoc failed to present any evidence that the two incidents occurred because the disciplinary action and training implemented in response to the complaints were inadequate.
xerxes response to these new incidents was also prompt and reasonably calculated to put a stop to any further such activity in the workplace.indeed,we can think of nothing further that xerxes could have done to convey to the perpetrators how seriously xerxes viewed these incidents and how aggressively it would pursue disciplinary action if it succeeded in identifying the culprits.in addition to conducting internal investigations,xerxes reported the incidents to the local sheriff office.green held a meeting and notified all employees which would,of course,have included the perpetrators if they were employees that law enforcement had been notified and a full investigation requested.the employees were advised that anyone with information was expect ed to come forward,emphasis added,and they were warned that the perpetrators,if identified,would face probable termination and possible criminal prosecution 
xerxes eeo coordinator also traveled to the plant to personally investigate the incidents,interview employees,and review the company efforts to address the situation.in the meantime,green routinely checked on pearson to ensure that he was experiencing no further incidents of racial harassment and,if he was,that xerxes was being made aware of them.it was through this proactive enforcement of xerxes policy that green learned of the single,but also anonymous,toolbox prank that occurred in the midst of the two locker incidents.green assured pearson that the training had been done and that xerxes would continue to respond aggressively to known offenders,and reminded him to immediately report any such violations to him.
for their part,neither pearson nor wilson offered any suggestions of additional steps xerxes should have taken to identify the perpetrators or otherwise respond in a more reasonable or effective manner.and the eeoc,in response to xerxes interrogatory asking it to identify all actions that xerxes should have taken but did not that would have demonstrated an exercise of reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly racial harassment or race discrimination,responded simply that xerxes ha d not effectively stopped or prevented racial harassment in its workplace.that,however,is not the standard for imputing liability on xerxes.
we conclude that xerxes response in was also reasonably calculated to end the harassment as a matter of law,sunbelt,at internal quotation marks omitted,and that it was effective in doing so.no further threats or workplace pranks occurred after xerxes response.the single reported violation of xerxes policy was the racial joke that was told by a white coworker in august,which resulted in the employees reporting the offense in accordance with the policies and the offending employee being fired.
finally,the eeoc claims that,despite this demonstrable effectiveness,a reasonable jury could find that xerxes responses in and were unreasonable based upon pearson testimony that he was subjected to two isolated racial slurs in august,and wilson testimony that he was subjected to a single racial slur in august.
pearson testified that in august,coworker sam crone referred to african american women as nappy headed hos,and tammy smith told him that he looked like curious george as he was climbing a ladder.pearson did not,however,report these alleged incidents to xerxes at the time and he resigned a few months later.accordingly,xerxes was given no opportunity to investigate the complaints or respond appropriately.
wilson testified that,in august,after this lawsuit was filed,tammy smith said to him,i hope this does not offend you,but i not trying to be nobody white n,as she was cleaning up a work area.wilson claims that he reported the comment to shifflett,but does not claim that he reported it to green or any other management employee as he had been instructed.xerxes contends that it first learned of the alleged incident several weeks later,when the eeoc attorney reported it to xerxes attorney.when green investigated the claim,he was unable to corroborate it.wilson advised green that there were no witnesses to smith alleged statement.smith absolutely denie d having made the statement and state d that she never used the n word to wilson.internal quotation marks omitted.wilson also claimed that he reported the incident to the union representative,but the union representative told green that he thought he heard it through the grapevine.accordingly,green notified wilson that he had been unable to substantiate the allegation and took no further action.
the eeoc makes much of these alleged,albeit isolated,racial remarks,particularly the unreported and uncorroborated accusations against smith,as evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that xerxes previous disciplinary action against her and the others was unreasonable.we disagree.
as an initial premise,we note that an employer can not be expected to correct harassment unless the employee makes a concerted effort to inform the employer that a problem exists under its reasonable procedures.howard,at emphasis added.thus,employee s claiming harassment by a coworker bear significant responsibility in notifying the employer.id.at see barrett applied radiant energy,cir noting that l ittle can be done to correct harassing behavior unless the victim first blows the whistle on it.here,both pearson and wilson inexplicably failed to avail themselves of xerxes available procedures to report these additional instances of racial slurs in the workplace,procedures of which they were undeniably aware and had effectively used in the past.
even if the alleged racial slurs by smith had been properly reported,however,this would be an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that xerxes discipline of smith or the others in was too light to be reasonable.plaintiffs often feel that their employer could have done more to remedy the adverse effects of the employee conduct.but title vii requires only that the employer take steps reasonably likely to stop the harassment.knabe,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the standard in no way requires an employer to dispense with fair procedures for those accused or to discharge every alleged harasser.and a good faith investigation of alleged harassment may satisfy the standard,even if the investigation turns up no evidence of harassment.such an employer may avoid liability even if a jury later concludes that in fact harassment occurred.harris l l wings,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also adler,at the courts must balance the victim rights,the employer rights,and the alleged harasser rights.if our rule were to call for excessive discipline,employers would inevitably face claims from the other direction of violations of due process rights and wrongful termination.
this principle finds particular significance in this case,where xerxes bore responsibility to investigate its employees complaints of racial harassment by their coworkers and an obligation to fairly investigate and only discipline offending coworkers,including smith,in a manner consistent with the protections the union afforded to all nonsupervisory employees in the workplace.as the district court aptly noted below,g iven xerxes collective bargaining agreement with the employees union,it is difficult to imagine what further steps xerxes might have taken to discipline its employees or to prevent future instances of harassment.
in the end,the crux of the eeoc claim on appeal is the same as its answer to xerxes interro
