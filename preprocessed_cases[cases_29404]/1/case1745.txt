this petition for review of the calls order represents the latest challenge to the federal communication commission implementation of the telecommunications act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of title,united states code act.the texas office of public utility counsel topuc and the national association of state utility consumer advocates nasuca,along with intervenor consumer federation of america cfa collectively,petitioners,claim that the calls order violates the procedural requirements of the administrative procedure act,a as well as the substantive provisions of the act.we affirm the calls order in most respects,but we remand for further analysis the portions regarding the million universal service fund and the.
we must briefly review the regulatory regime of the telephone industry to better understand the issues presented in this petition.the telephone industry is comprised of two sets of carriers.local exchange carriers lecs provide local basic telephone service,while interexchange carriers ixcs offer service.since the divestiture of in,robust competition has existed in the market with ixcs trying to recruit new customers and lure subscribers from each other.on the other hand,lecs until recently had natural monopolies on local service in their respective regions,because they own the network infrastructure necessary to make telephone calls.the prohibitive capital costs involved in laying out a separate infrastructure deterred potential competitors from entering the local service market.the act made competition in the local basic service market one of its main goals.congress prodded incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs that is,lecs like the baby bells which own the infra provide use of their network to companies that wanted to enter the local service market.in return,congress allowed ilecs,which had previously been barred from offering service in their home regions,to enter that market.
the act provision of allowing lecs to use ilecs infrastructure resembled an arrangement already shared by ixcs and ilecs ixcs rely on ilecs network to originate and terminate calls.more technically,the ixcs use the local loop,which refers to telephone wires running from a person telephone to the local telephone switch.whenever someone makes a phone call,he or she taps into the local network,where the call is then routed between a lec local switch and an ixc switch.the costs incurred by the ilecs in providing the use of this infrastructure are called loop costs.
two sources of revenues allow the ilecs to recover the loop costs.first,all of basic local service pay a flat subscriber line charge slc that appears in their monthly telephone bills.prior to the calls order,the fcc capped the slc at per month ilecs can charge less than per month,but it can not levy an access charge above that amount.the slc alone is insufficient to defray the loop costs entirely.thus,the fcc assesses an access charge against ixcs,which in turn usually pass down these costs to.at first,the fcc levied a fee called the common carrier line charge ccl against ixcs.the fcc later replaced the ccl with the presubscribed interexchange carrier charge picc.see access charge reform order,price cap reform performance review for local exchange carriers,transport structure and pricing,end user common line charges,cc docket,and,first report and order,fcc.released may,access charge reform order.the fcc determined that callers did not financially burden the network more than callers,but were nevertheless being penalized by a ccl charge.the fcc believed that the picc more accurately represented the true costs incurred by callers.
in addition to fostering competition in the local telephone service market,the act had another key goal of continuing the provision of affordable universal service to all americans.traditionally,the phone bills of poor and rural customers have been implicitly subsidized by rate manipulation.callers and urban residents pay artificially higher phone bills to subsidize and support universal service for others.congress recognized that these implicit subsidies could not continue under the regime ushered in by the act.in a competitive market,a carrier that subsidizes rural or poor customers by charging rates while billing rates to urban customers will be undercut by a competitor offering rates to urban.congress wanted to continue subsidizing universal service,but in a way more consistent with the reforms.the act thus required that the implicit subsidy system of rate manipulation be replaced with explicit subsidies for universal service.to implement the goals of the act,the fcc issued a series of orders.
the fcc first issued its access charge reform order.as noted before,the order abolished the ccl fees assessed against ixcs,and replaced them with the picc.by ensuring that access charges more accurately reflected the actual costs incurred,the fcc hoped that it would facilitate the shift to a competitive market.the order also increased the slc cap for business customers on the assumption that they could afford such a price increase.it,however,did not increase the slc cap for primary residences and businesses.several ixcs petitioned for review of the access charge reform order,alleging,among other things,that the failure to increase the slc cap on primary residential and businesses amounted to new implicit subsidies.the eighth circuit upheld the access charge reform order in part on the ground that the act commitment to universal access constrained the fcc from raising the slc on other lines.see southwestern bell.fcc,cir citing b statement of affordable universal access.noting that the order was a transitional plan only,the court further upheld the fcc decision to rely on market forces rather than on comprehensive cost analysis in changing its access charge policy.
the fcc also issued in re joint board on universal service,cc docket,report and order,fcc rcd.universal service order.this order emphasized that implicit subsidies for universal service should be gradually removed from interstate access charges,and replaced with an explicit universal service fund derived from fees levied against telecommunications carriers.this circuit remanded parts of the order,but we upheld the requirement that lecs must reduce access charges by an amount commensurate with the money received for the explicit universal service fund.see.office of.counsel fcc,cir topuc i.
finally,the fcc addressed the issue of the in its in the matter of price cap performance review for local exchange carriers,cc docket,fourth report and order,fcc rcd price cap review.fcc had annually reduced lecs by imposing what it dubbed the,a percentage number that represented the lecs increase in productivity minus the rate of inflation.by lowering the and hence the amount that lecs could charge consumers,the pressured lecs to become more efficient and to lower their costs.in effect,the passed down the savings from the lecs increased productivity to the consumers.in its price cap review,the fcc raised the to percent.on petition for review,the circuit found the increase to be arbitrary and capricious because the fcc did not provide sufficient evidence of increased productivity by the lecs to warrant the percent figure.see united states.ass fcc,usta.it remanded this issue back to the fcc.
while revisiting the two remanded orders from usta and topuc i,the fcc considered and adopted the calls order,a transitional plan intended to help resolve the thorny issues of access charges.this order originates from the work of the coalition for affordable local and long distance service calls,a group of major ixcs and ilecs.although ilecs and ixcs traditionally have held opposing views on telecommunications reform,they worked together in jointly presenting the calls proposal.the fcc conducted a proceeding pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa by soliciting public comments on the proposal and receiving dozens of comments.after making some changes,the fcc submitted a modified calls proposal,and again solicited comments but on an abbreviated schedule.several weeks later,the fcc issued the final calls order.
the calls order promulgates four key changes,all of which are challenged in this petition for review.first,the fcc abolishes the picc fees assessed against ixcs.second,to compensate for the loss of revenues from the elimination of the picc,the order raises the slc price cap for primary residential lines.it will increase from to over a period of several years.the fcc changed the fee structure,believing that it would encourage more competition and lead to lower rates overall for consumers.third,the fcc reintroduces a percent,but switches it from a productivity proxy to a mechanism for rate reduction.fourth,it establishes a transitional million universal service fund to provide explicit subsidies for poor and rural customers.
the parties challenging the calls order include the texas office of public utility counsel,as well as the national association of state utility consumer advocates and the intervenor consumer federation of america,both of which are consumer advocacy groups in their petition,they make two broad challenges against the order.the petitioners first contend that the calls order did not comport with the apa requirements.they characterize the calls order as the product of a surreptitious political deal between the respondent fcc and the calls coalition.the petitioners also challenge the order on substantive grounds,claiming that it betrays,among other things,the act requirement of affordable universal access.we first address the substantive statutory challenge,and then the procedural objections to the calls order.
in reviewing the petitioners substantive claims,we apply the analysis set forth in chevron natural res.def.council,d.in step one,we look to see whether congress has spoken directly on the precise question at issue.see id.at.at.if congress has done so,we must give effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent.id.at.at.if the statute is ambiguous as to the question at issue,we move to the second step of the chevron analysis to determine whether the agency answer is based upon a permissible construction.id.at.at.under this second step,we can reverse the agency decision only if it was arbitrary,capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.see id.at.at.the question is not whether we might have preferred another way to interpret the statute,but whether the agency decision was a reasonable one.see mci telecomm.fcc.
we address in order the petitioners three main objections to the calls order whether the slc price cap increase violates b and i purported affordability mandate whether it contravenes k prohibition against unreasonable allocation of joint and common costs and whether the act requires the fcc to conduct a comprehensive,study.
the petitioners object to the increase in the slc caps for residential and business customers,alleging that it violates the affordability mandate of and arbitrarily reverses the agency policy of ensuring affordable universal service.we hold that the increase in the slc price cap does neither the fcc has reasonably interpreted under of the chevron analysis,and has provided sufficient justification for its change in price cap policy.
the petitioners point to two statutory provisions that allegedly preclude the fcc from increasing the slc cap.section b states that q uality services should be available at just,reasonable,and affordable rates,and i declares that t he commission and the states should ensure that universal service is available at rates that are just,reasonable and affordable.i,b.the fcc acknowledges the importance of affordability under the act,but states that it is only an aspirational guideline that must be carefully balanced with other statutory objectives.in response,the petitioners imply that the fcc must make affordability paramount in formulating access charge policy,even if it comes at the expense of other statutory goals.
we hold that the fcc interpretation b and i as merely aspirational is permissible under of the chevron analysis.accordingly,the two provisions can not serve as a basis to invalidate the slc price cap increase assuming that the increase endangers affordability,which the fcc denies.
we first discuss b.under the heading of u niversal service principles,b lists seven factors that the fcc should follow in implementing the act one of the principles is that q uality service should be at affordable rates.b.we have previously analyzed b under chevron because the listed principles use vague,general language,rendering the section ambiguous.topuc i,at analyzing b.under this deferential review,we have approved the fcc interpretation of the statutory principles as aspirational only.see,at refusing to rely on the aspirational language in b to bind the fcc to adopt certain cost methodologies for calculating universal service support see also chevron at.at holding that courts must defer to an agency reasonable reading of an ambiguous provision.indeed,the lofty and expansive language of b hardly constitute a series of specific statutory commands.topuc i,at.rather,they reflect congressional intent to delegate difficult policy choices to the commission discretion.see alenco,cir ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc,noting the breadth of the commission statutory discretion to balance the multiple goals embodied in the communications act.
similarly,we hold that the fcc reading of i as aspirational is a permissible construction of the statute.chevron at.at.section i states that the fcc should ensure that universal service is affordable.generally,courts have read shall as a more direct statutory command than words such as should or may.topuc i,at.the petitioners counter that courts nevertheless sometimes read should as a direct statutory command.see,alenco,at.while that may be true,the petitioners do not provide any convincing reasons why the word should in this context must be read to rebut the general presumption.the petitioners argument shows only that,at best,the meaning of i is unclear.if a statutory provision is ambiguous,we must uphold the fcc interpretation as long as it is a reasonable reading.see chevron at.at.
thus,while the fcc can not flatly ignore or contravene the goal of affordability,congress gave it the latitude to formulate a policy that considers affordability,along with other policy goals of the act.we can not arrogate to ourselves this function,merely because we or the petitioners believe that the fcc is not maximizing the affordability goal at the expense of other objectives.as we explain later,the increase in the slc cap represents fcc reasoned attempt to maintain the difficult balance between the principles of ensuring affordability and encouraging competition.
notwithstanding the statutory provisions,we can not uphold fcc decision to increase the slc caps if it represents an unexplained reversal of past fcc policy.while the agency is entitled to change its views on the acceptability of a prior policy,it is obligated to explain its reasons for doing so.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.the petitioners allege that fcc has reversed itself from its earlier decisions not to raise the slc cap on residences and businesses due to affordability concerns.see,access charge reform order,increasing the slc cap only on businesses.
the fcc has articulated rational reasons to the degree that it has changed prior policies simply put,the telecommunications market has undergone dramatic changes in the past few years,and it continues to do so.in light of this dynamic market,the fcc has walked a delicate tightrope between the act twin goals of ensuring affordability and promoting local service competition.we have implicitly recognized that an uneasy tension exists between these two goals although increased competition will ultimately make phone service more affordable,the transition from a industry to a regime can bring some growing pains.see alenco,at.as a consequence,while the fcc must see to it that both universal service and local competition are realized,we have also recognized that congress has conferred broad discretion on the agency to negotiate these dual mandates and that courts ought not to lightly interfere with its reasoned attempt to achieve both objectives.id.at emphasis in original.
citing several factors and changes in the market,the fcc believed that its prior concerns about affordability were sufficiently mitigated to allow an increase in the slc from to over the course of several years.calls order.first,the fcc noted that the prior slc limit of was established in if adjusted for inflation,it would stand at.see id.at.in light of this,the fcc did not find that an increase in the slc cap would raise affordability concerns.second,it cited empirical evidence suggesting that telephone subscribership would not be negatively impacted by such an increase.see id.at.the fcc also noted that increased funding for the lifeline support program allayed prior fears of unaffordability.finally,the fcc promised to conduct a before the slc is scheduled to rise above.
in addition,the fcc believed that benefits from the abolition of the picc would offset any increase in the slc.although the picc is technically assessed against the ixcs,they usually pass it down,with added costs,to the.see id.eliminating the picc would remove such unnecessary transaction costs.the fcc further reasoned that consumers would benefit because the picc,as an external cost imposed on all ixcs,is relatively resistant to competitive pressures.see calls order.consequently,the fcc believed that it would be difficult for the ixcs to reduce and compete away this fee.see id.on the other hand,only the ilecs assess the slc,which is imposed directly against the consumers.the newly entering lecs are not required to charge the slc.thus,the fcc held that competitive pressure could force ilecs to reduce the slc through efficiency gains.see id.
the petitioners strongly dispute the fcc reasoning.for example,they reply that the fcc logic about the picc is counterintuitive because the market is currently more competitive than the local service market.under our standard of review,we are not required to concur wholeheartedly with the policy analysis of the fcc.rather,we only examine whether prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed and not casually ignored.primary,fec.after reviewing the record,we are satisfied that the fcc has sufficiently explained its reasons for increasing the slc for residential and business customers.the petitioners may not agree with the fcc reasoning,but we can not usurp the fcc role in making the difficult policy decisions regarding affordability and competition.see alenco,at.
the petitioners also challenge the calls order on the ground that it recovers an unreasonably disproportionate amount of joint and common costs of universal service from.at dispute is the meaning of k,which states that the fcc shall establish any necessary cost allocation rules,accounting safeguards,and guidelines to ensure that services included in the definition of universal service bear no more than a reasonable share of the joint and common costs of facilities used to provide these services.k.by abolishing the picc fee assessed against ixcs and increasing the slc cap on,the fcc unreasonably recovers percent of joint and common costs of universal service from,according to the petitioners.
one of the petitioners,topuc,had presented this very same argument in challenging the access charge reform order,which had increased the slc price cap on businesses.the eighth circuit wholly rejected that argument in southwestern bell.it noted that b ecause the slc is a method of recovering loop costs,not an allocation of those costs between supported and unsupported services,k is not implicated.southwestern bell,at.we agree with the eighth circuit.section k concerns cost allocation of joint and common costs,while the slc and the picc involve the recovery of such costs.thus,k does not implicate the slc or the picc cost recovery involves how and from whom the funds are collected,while cost allocation refers to how the costs are disbursed 
in enacting the act,congress established the goal that network access charges should eventually reflect the actual costs of providing and administering the particular network service.to meet this objective,the fcc has primarily relied on market forces to restructure the access charges.the petitioners maintain that the fcc has failed to conduct a comprehensive,in violation of the act.we reject this argument.
the act does not compel the fcc to conduct because the requirements of c and d do not apply to the interstate access services at issue in this petition.see competitive telecomm.ass fcc,cir i t is clear from the act that congress did not intend all access charges to move to pricing,at least not immediately.the act plainly preserves certain rate regimes already in place.instead,b and a broader standard that interstate service rates be just and reasonable without unreasonable discrimination applies here.see b,a.this just and reasonable standard gives the fcc discretion in structuring the access charges.the fcc accordingly has delayed conducting a because of time constraints and the technical uncertainty involved in carrying out a reliable cost study.in lieu of,the fcc has primarily relied on competitive pressures to lower costs.
the eighth circuit earlier upheld the fcc reliance on the market to restructure rates.see southwestern bell,at noting that d ue to the difficulty in creating a reliable cost model for interstate access services,a prescriptive plan would not be feasible at the present time.the petitioners remind the court that nearly three years have passed since the eighth circuit decision.although we recognize that the fcc has not acted as quickly as the petitioners would want,we can not say that the fcc has acted arbitrarily or capriciously,given the transitional nature of the calls order.see alenco,at giving special deference to transitional rules.we are further assured by the fcc promise to conduct a before the slc cap is set to rise over five dollars.in sum,we believe that the eighth circuit analysis in southwestern bell is apropos here 
the fcc has reasonably exercised its predictive judgment in concluding that competition in the local telephone services market will effectively drive interstate access charges to economic costs.if,in light of the actual market developments,the commission determines that competition is not having the anticipated effect on access charges,the agency presumably will revisit the issue.we can not conclude at this time that the fcc decision to adopt a approach was arbitrary in light of the broad discretion congress has given the commission in setting interstate rates.
southwestern bell,at.
the petitioners allege that the fcc procedures in formulating the calls order were fatally defective and in violation of the apa.see a.they claim that the fcc failed to follow appropriate procedures that it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in establishing the million figure for the universal service fund,and that it provided no rational basis to support a percent.
in reviewing an agency procedures under the apa,we apply the arbitrary and capricious standard,recognizing that particular deference is accorded to transitional rules.see alenco,at.we can not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.state farm at.at.our role is to review the agency action to determine whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.state of louisiana verity,cir quoting state farm.
the petitioners characterize the calls order as a tainted political compromise between the fcc and the calls coalition.specifically,the abbreviated second round of and the ex parte contact between the fcc and the calls coalition suggest that the fcc had given approval to the proposed order before considering public comment,according to the petitioners.we hold that the calls order is the product of a valid,if not perfect,informal rulemaking proceeding.the apa requires federal agencies that conduct informal rulemaking to give notice of a proposed rule and consider public comment on it.see.this process allows interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through the submission of written comments.see c.an agency failure to
