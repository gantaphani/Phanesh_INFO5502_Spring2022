facts and proceedings below 
on october,the port filed an application with the corps for a permit to dredge and fill navigable waters of the united states.the port proposed building a cargo and cruise ship terminal on undeveloped land adjacent to the bayport shipping channel along the northwestern coast of galveston bay.the plan called for seven cargo ship berths,three cruise ship berths,and extensive ancillary facilities along a region of the coast that is heavily industrialized.the port intends to finance the bayport project with proceeds from a million bond issue for that purpose approved by the voters of harris county,texas in which both the port and bayport are located.
the corps undertook the comprehensive technical and public interest review required by the code of federal regulations.see,procedures for implementing nepa outlining the corps general regulatory policy preparation of an environmental impact statement.following public input and preliminary technical work,the corps issued its draft environmental impact statement deis on november.the corps continued its technical work and accepted public comment on the deis until august.nine months later,on may,the corps issued its final environmental impact statement feis and entertained further public comment until august.the corps then issued its record of decision rod on december,in which the corps approved a plan for the construction of the bayport terminal and the mandatory preservation of undeveloped areas elsewhere to compensate for the environmental loss at bayport.the corps granted the dredge and fill permit on january,over five years after the permit application was filed.
meanwhile,as the corps was considering the bayport permit application,it was also considering a similar dredge and fill permit application filed in april by texas city,texas to build a cargo terminal at shoal point in galveston county along the southwestern coast of galveston bay.the corps issued a permit to texas city on april,approximately one month before it handed down its feis on the port bayport permit application.
on january,appellants filed their second and final amended complaint asking the district court to vacate the permit and enjoin the port from proceeding with the bayport project because the corps had issued the permit in violation of the cwa and nepa appellants also sought a preliminary injunction against construction while judicial review was pending.rather than rule on this motion,the district court agreed to an expedited pretrial schedule and a summary judgment ruling by may.the port then agreed to stand still while the case went forward through summary judgment.the parties filed for summary judgment in april,and the district court granted summary judgment to appellees and against appellants on may.final judgment was entered the same day.

this deferential standard of review applies regardless of whether we are reviewing the corps decision under the cwa or nepa.
the clean water act 
determination of wetlands jurisdiction 
the centerpiece of appellants challenge to the dredge and fill permit is that the corps erroneously determined the extent of its regulatory jurisdiction over the wetlands at the bayport site appellants maintain the entire approximately acres of wetlands at the bayport site constitutes jurisdictional wetlands,substantially more than what the corps concluded were present the corps found only acres of jurisdictional wetlands,as well as acres of wetlands and acres of intertidal mud flats.appellants contend that the corps,by undercounting the acreage within its wetlands jurisdiction,corrupted the entire decisional process under the cwa 
according to the rod,the corps,using its wetlands delineation manual,initially determined on april,that there were acres of wetlands at the bayport site subject to its regulatory jurisdiction the corps concluded,however,that it needed to reevaluate its jurisdictional determination after the supreme court handed down solid waste agency united states army corps of eng rs,d holding that the migratory bird rule,upon which much of the corps initial determination in this case had been predicated,overreached the corps authority under the clean water act.after bayport,the corps concluded that of the total some acres of wetlands at the site only acres came within its jurisdiction.the corps then evaluated the port permit application in light of this determination.
we do not find it necessary to consider the several ways in which appellants challenge the corps jurisdictional determination.in the rod,the corps responded to substantive public questions about its environmental impact statements.one question concerned the possibility that using a particular survey technology called lidar would enlarge wetlands jurisdiction to acres.the corps replied that lidar is not an approved technique in the wetlands delineation manual,but in any case 
even assuming that all wetlands and other aquatic areas on the bayport site were jurisdictional,which is not the case,the mitigation provided by the port,involving over acres of wetlands and other habitat,adequately compensates for environmental impacts as evidenced by the acceptance of this plan by the other state and federal resource agencies.as a result,even if the corps were to conclude that all of the aquatic areas on the site,including all of the wetlands on the site,were subject to clean water act jurisdiction,the port has provided ample mitigation to compensate for the loss of all aquatic areas on the site that will be filled in or otherwise degraded by the project.consequently,the permit that the corps proposes to issue would still be fully justified in this case by the generous mitigation package offered by the port.therefore,issuance of the proposed permit would still be appropriate under all applicable laws and regulations even if all aquatic areas on the project site were subject to clean water act jurisdiction.
emphasis added.given that the corps clearly would have made the same decision even if it used the wetlands determination that appellants advocate,we need not consider whether the corps abused its discretion in concluding that it could exercise regulatory jurisdiction over only acres of wetlands.manning upjohn,cir principles of judicial restraint dictate that if resolution of an issue effectively disposes of a case,we should resolve the case on that basis without reaching any other issues that might be presented.
practicable alternatives 
the corps may not issue a dredge and fill permit if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.a.appellants contend that shoal point and pelican island,both of which are in southwestern galveston bay,are practicable alternatives to the bayport site but,in an abuse of discretion,were not considered by the corps.a ii defining a practicable alternative as,inter alia,d ischarge of dredged or fill material at other locations in waters of the united states.they assert that,as a result of this oversight,the dredge and fill permit issued to the port is unlawful under the cwa.
while shoal point and pelican island are arguably plausible alternatives given that they are reasonably proximate to bayport and may be environmentally acceptable,they must nevertheless be practicable under a detailed test.an alternative is practicable only if 
it is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost,existing technology,and logistics in light of overall project purposes.if it is otherwise a practicable alternative,an area not presently owned by the applicant which could reasonably be obtained,utilized,expanded,or managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed activity may be considered.
the corps contends that neither shoal point nor pelican island is a practicable alternative under this definition for several reasons.first,shoal point was not available.on april,the corps issued a permit to texas city to build a cargo and cruise ship terminal at shoal point and thus shoal point was not available to the port.shoal point was also unavailable for the additional reason that the port undisputedly has no authority to condemn land outside of harris county.water code c,and the absence of eminent domain power would present a serious impediment to assembling the many contiguous parcels at shoal point that the project would require 
furthermore,neither shoal point nor pelican island is a logistically feasible alternative,and thus is not practicable,because the port intends to fund its project with the proceeds of a harris county bond issue.the proceeds of this bond issue,however,could not legally be spent outside of harris county,which excludes both shoal point and pelican island because they are in galveston county.
in addition,building the new terminal at shoal point or pelican island would not comport with the port overall project purpose,which was to further expand harris county as one of the nation major ports.situating the port at either shoal point or pelican island would frustrate the overall project purpose in the further sense that it would needlessly complicate,rather than simplify,the logistics of maritime commerce through harris county because the shipping industry would have to move passengers and goods through locations that are comparatively remote from metropolitan houston.
appellants only dispute two of these reasons.they contend that the absence of condemnation power and the bond issue do not ipso facto preclude acquiring land outside of harris county because the port could have financed the project at shoal point or pelican island with operating revenues.however,there is no evidence that the port has any surplus operating revenues,much less that any such would be sufficient for that purpose,and the passage of the bond issue suggests otherwise.even if we were to consider the corps other reasons arbitrary and capricious,which we hold they are not,appellants would still not prevail under this objection because an unowned alternative site is a practicable alternative under a only if the site could reasonably be obtained.a mere,unsupported theoretical possibility of acquiring the alternative site,which is all that appellants offer,does not constitute a showing that the alternative site is reasonably obtainable,much less that the corps decision was arbitrary and capricious.appellants have not,therefore,shown that the corps decision not to consider shoal point and pelican island was an abuse of discretion.
deepening the houston ship channel 
appellants contend that the scope of shipping to and from the bayport terminal will eventually lead to deepening the houston ship channel from to fifty feet to accommodate the larger vessels that are expected to traverse the oceans in the future they argue that deepening the channel will have an adverse effect on galveston bay freshwater ecosystems because it will alter the bay salinity.because,they allege,the bayport project will lead to the deepening of the houston ship channel and such deepening will cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of the united states,c,the corps should not have issued the port its dredge and fill permit.
c does not,however,require the corps to consider the effects of the bayport terminal itself once it begins operations.instead,section c requires the corps to consider whether the discharge of dredged or fill material pursuant to a permit will cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of the united states emphasis added,not the effect of any completed project.see,c instructing the regulatory agency to consider s ignificantly adverse effects of the discharge of pollutants on aquatic ecosystem diversity emphasis added see also g defining a cumulative impact for the purposes of the cwa as changes in an aquatic ecosystem that are attributable to the collective effect of a number of individual discharges of dredged or fill material.the deepening of the houston ship channel will not result from the discharge of dredged or fill material from the bayport project.rather,the deepening of the houston ship channel,if it ever occurs,will be the result of a separate project requiring congressional approval undertaken for that specific purpose.it was,therefore,not an abuse of discretion for the corps to construe the cwa and its regulations as not requiring the corps to consider any future deepening of the houston ship channel as an adverse environmental consequence of issuing a dredge and fill permit to the port 
the national environmental policy act 
unlike the clean water act,which has substantive environmental goals,the objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,the national environmental policy act is strictly procedural.robertson methow valley citizens council,d stating that it is now well settled that nepa itself does not mandate particular results,but simply prescribes the necessary process.indeed,nepa does not prohibit the undertaking of federal projects patently destructive of the environment it simply mandates that the agency gather,study,and disseminate information concerning the projects environmental consequences.sabine,at.
nepa requires,among other things,the preparation of a comprehensive environmental impact statement whenever proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affect the quality of the human environment c.appellants contend that the corps final environmental impact statement was procedurally defective under nepa because it did not properly elucidate the alternative required by,and it did not treat the deepening of the houston ship channel as a foreseeable environmental consequence of the bayport project under.appellants also argue that the corps ultimate decision to grant the dredge and fill permit to the port was irrationally inconsistent with one of the conclusions set forth in the feis.
a.the alternative 
an essential feature of an eis is its analysis of alternatives to the proposed action.this alternatives analysis,described by the relevant regulation as the heart of the environmental impact statement,must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action,including the alternative in which it is assumed that the project does not go forward.the importance of the alternatives analysis is reflected in our test for evaluating an eis,which requires,inter alia,determining whether the agency in good faith objectively has taken a hard look at the environmental consequences of a proposed action and alternatives.river basin alliance westphal,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted nepa requires only that the corps consider alternatives relevant to the applicant goals and the corps is not to define what those goals should be.citizens against burlington,busey.cert.denied,d.in this case,the corps identified seven alternative sites and configurations for the bayport project.these alternatives were evaluated under twenty broad criteria and the corps ultimately issued a permit to build the terminal at bayport.
appellants contend that the corps alternative,which was part of the feis issued on may,was flawed because it proceeded under the assumption that no new ship terminals would be built in galveston bay.appellants argue that this assumption was irrational on its face because the corps,just three weeks earlier on april,had granted a permit to texas city to construct a terminal at shoal point on the southwestern tip of galveston bay.appellants assert that an environmental impact statement this defective violates nepa because it does not supply a basis for informed decisionmaking.
the corps responds that its bayport feis was all but finished when the rod and permit for the texas city project were issued.in rejecting a request to prepare a supplemental eis,the corps decided not to treat the proposed shoal point project as an existing condition for the purposes of the bayport feis because the mere issuance of a permit to texas city did not make its project a fait accompli.the rod noted that other factors controlled when,or even if,the shoal point terminal would ever be built.see custer county action garvey,cir characterizing the alternative as the status quo or the current level of activity.rather than frame the shoal point terminal as an existing condition,the corps treated it as a potential cumulative impact and evaluated the port bayport permit application in light of this assumption while appellants may not agree with this methodology,it is neither arbitrary nor capricious and thus is entitled to deference.
deepening the houston ship channel 
appellants contend,as discussed previously,supra c,that the cargo ships of the future will be too large to use the houston ship channel at its current depth of feet and will require future dredging to fifty feet.by being an otherwise potential destination for such vessels,appellants assert that the bayport terminal,and by extension the permit to dredge and fill for that terminal,will in effect cause the channel to be deepened by five feet sometime in the future.such deepening,they maintain,will have drastic environmental consequences because the deeper channel will raise the salinity of transitional ecosystems in galveston bay that are primarily freshwater.they charge that the corps acted arbitrarily under nepa in refusing to consider the deepening of the houston ship channel as an indirect effect of granting the port dredge and fill permit because such deepening is a reasonably foreseeable,not speculative,cumulative effect of the permit.
first,before we examine whether deepening the houston ship channel is too speculative to warrant consideration as a cumulative impact,there is meaningful doubt that deepening the channel can be an effect nepa requires the corps to consider at all.nepa requires the corps to take into account both the direct and indirect adverse environmental consequences of issuing a dredge and fill permit.c ii a b.indirect effects are those which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance,but are still reasonably foreseeable.b emphasis added.a but for causal relationship is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under nepa and the relevant regulations.dot pub.citizen,d.rather,a plaintiff mounting a nepa challenge must establish that an alleged effect will ensue as a proximate cause,in the sense meant by tort law,of the proposed agency action.id.citing prosser and keeton for the proximate cause standard.
however,it is doubtful that an environmental effect may be considered as proximately caused by the action of a particular federal regulator if that effect is directly caused by the action of another government entity over which the regulator has no control.in dot public citizen,the supreme court held that the department of transportation had no duty under nepa to prepare an environmental assessment of the effects of mexican motor carriers using american highways because the authority to allow or prohibit mexican motor carriers into the country rested solely with the president.at.the court held,in other words,that pollution from mexican motor carriers was not an effect that the dot had to consider because no action by the dot would cause mexican motor carriers to enter the united states.it is undisputed that the houston ship channel can only be deepened by an act of congress,not any decision by the corps if the rationale of public citizen is applicable,the deepening of the houston ship channel,if it ever occurs,would not be treated as a b indirect effect caused by the corps decision to grant a dredge and fill permit to the port.at we hold that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions,the agency can not be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.under such an analysis,the corps,therefore,would not be obligated under nepa to consider this possibility and did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so 
we need not,and do not,ultimately determine whether such a public citizen analysis is appropriate in this context.that is so because in any event,even if we were to assume that deepening the houston ship channel is not per se excluded as a matter of law merely because requiring congressional approval from the sorts of cumulative environmental effects that the corps ought to account for in its feis,there was no need to do so in this case because for a number of reasons it is impossible to know whether the channel will ever be deepened.the corps obligation under nepa to consider cumulative impacts is confined to impacts that are reasonably foreseeable.an impact is reasonably foreseeable if it is sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision.sierra club marsh,cir.reasonable foreseeability does not include highly speculative harms that distort the decisionmaking process by emphasizing consequences beyond those of greatest concern to the public and of greatest relevance to the agency decision.robertson.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council,d time and resources are simply too limited to hold that an impact statement fails because the agency failed to ferret out every possible alternative,regardless of how uncommon or unknown that alternative may have been at the time the project was approved.limerick ecology action nrc,cir.
the port properly cites several reasons why asserting that the channel will be deepened is pure speculation.first,the corps expressly concluded that for the foreseeable future almost the only vessels using the bayport terminal would be ships,the largest able to traverse the panama canal.such vessels already operate safely in the houston ship channel and would not require deepening it in the future.see note,supra.the port also points to a report prepared for texas city shoal point project indicating that there is no plausible economic justification for deepening the channel in the foreseeable future.in addition to the absence of any need to deepen the channel,it could only be done,as mentioned above,by congress alone and there is no proposal for any such project finally,e
