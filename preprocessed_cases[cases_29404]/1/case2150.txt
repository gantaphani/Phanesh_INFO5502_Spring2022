gezim dakaj,his wife mire and their minor son kristian have filed this petition seeking review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board affirming an immigration judge denial of their applications for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we now grant the petition for review,vacate the bia decision and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
in june,gezim dakaj applied for asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief on behalf of himself,his wife mire and their son kristian.the dakajs claimed that they risked persecution if required to return to albania because of gezim and mire participation in the movement there.at their hearing in february,where they appeared pro se,gezim testified that,since joining the movement and the democratic in,he had been arrested twice and beaten,that at various times men in police uniforms or supporters of the socialist party had prevented him from operating his fruit stand and that shots had been fired at his house.mire testified that men harassed and threatened her at their fruit stand because they supported the democratic party.
the immigration judge ij discredited the dakajs story based on inconsistencies in their testimony.the ij also concluded that the mistreatment described did not constitute persecution and that the dakajs did not face a risk of persecution if they returned to albania because the democratic party was now in power.
on march,the dakajs filed,pro se,a timely notice of appeal noa.the noa form instructed them to state in detail their reasons for appealing,but they included only two sentences 
the immigration judge misstated facts about the current government of albania and 
the immigration judge refused to let respondent,mire dakaj,testify regarding her experiences in albania and about events that were directly relevant to her claim for asylum.
they also checked the box on the form specifying that they intended to file a separate written brief.
on september,the bia sent to the dakajs address through regular mail the following documents a briefing schedule informing the dakajs that they had until september,to submit a brief,a copy of the ij decision and a transcript of the hearing testimony.the dakajs never filed a brief,and so on october,the government moved for summary affirmance of the ij decision.
the dakajs received the government motion on or about october.they then retained counsel,who filed a brief on november along with a motion asking the bia to accept the brief out of time.id.at.the dakajs claimed that they were not aware of the briefing deadline until they received a copy of the government submission and saw an attached copy of the briefing schedule stating that their brief was due on september.in affidavits attached to their motion,gezim and mire swore that they never had received any mail from the board prior to october,that they had not moved from their current address,that they had contacted and hired an attorney for advice since we did not receive anything that had told us to file our brief,and that they did not intentionally fail to file the opening brief.id.
the bia denied the motion,rejected the dakajs brief,and informed the dakajs that it would not consider any further motions to accept a brief.the bia found the dakajs reasons for delay insufficient,pointing out that the briefing schedule and hearing transcript had been mailed to the dakajs,yet there was no evidence that these materials had been returned as undeliverable by the postal service.
in february,the dakajs asked to modify and amend their noa,reiterating that they had not received the briefing schedule,that they had acted conscientiously in presenting their case to the bia,and that it would be inequitable for the bia to summarily dismiss their case.their newly proposed noa specified four grounds for appeal the ij adverse credibility finding,the analysis,the translator effectiveness,and the ij finding that country conditions in albania had improved.
the bia denied the dakajs motion to modify the noa.the bia found that because the dakajs produced no objective evidence to support their assertion that they never had received the briefing schedule,they had failed to overcome the presumption of regular delivery of the mail.id.at.the dakajs motion to modify the noa,the bia continued,was merely an attempt to circumvent the earlier denial of their motion to file an untimely brief.the bia also took issue with what it described as a false factual claim in the dakajs original noa regarding the ij refusal at the hearing to allow mire to testify the bia concluded that the dakajs willingness to make a false claim to this board undercuts the reliability of their claim that they did not receive the briefing schedule mailed by the board and also weighs against a favorable exercise of discretion on their motion.id.at.
the dakajs then filed a petition for review in this court.in their petition,they challenge the bia refusal to allow them to file an untimely brief or to amend their notice of appeal.they also challenge the substantive basis for the ij decision.
discussiona.denial of leave to file brief 
this court reviews the bia decision to reject a late brief for abuse of discretion.gonzales,cir.the bia may reject a tardy brief,see c in its discretion the board may consider a brief that has been filed out of time.emphasis added,but it must provide an explanation showing that it considered the petitioner arguments and did not merely react to them,at.
the bia denied the dakajs motion for leave to file a late brief because it disbelieved their claim that they had not received notice of the briefing schedule for their appeal.the dakajs submitted,along with their motion for leave to file a late brief,affidavits in which they declared under oath that they never received the briefing schedule that was sent by regular mail to their house.the bia declined to accept the dakajs claims in its decision denying the motion,the board wrote a review of the record indicates that the briefing schedule and hearing transcript were mailed to the respondents at their current mailing address and there is no indication that they were returned to the board as undeliverable by the united states postal service.petitioners.later,in its decision affirming the ij decision,the board expanded on its determination not to accept the brief.there,the board explained that t he respondents claim that they did not receive the briefing schedule,standing alone,is insufficient without any objective evidence to overcome the presumption of regular delivery of the mail and the lack of any evidence in the record that this board briefing schedule was not delivered.
the dakajs submit that the bia decision to deny them leave to file a late motion should be reversed they contend that the board did not explain adequately its reasons for rejecting their sworn assertions that they did not receive the briefing schedule.the government submits that the board explanation was sufficient it notes that the board explained,in its initial decision on the motion,that there was no evidence in the record to indicate that the briefing schedule had been returned by the post office as undeliverable.the government also points to the board final decision on the dakajs appeal,in which the board stated that the dakajs claim of was insufficient without any objective evidence to overcome the presumption of regular delivery of mail resp.br.quoting.
whether an asylum applicant received notice of his asylum proceedings is a question of fact.see joshi ashcroft,cir.the bia is entitled to presume that a notice sent via regular mail was delivered to the recipient to whom it was addressed.see,vincent city colls.of,cir evidence of mailing is evidence of delivery.the bia itself has recognized,however,that the presumption of delivery of regular mail is a weaker one than the presumption that accompanies certified mail and may be rebutted with evidence that the alien did not receive the notice.see matter of,bia.
we have said in the past that a bare,uncorroborated,denial of receipt,even
