two conservation groups challenge adverse summary judgment rulings in an action alleging violations of the fishery conservation and management act the act,and the administrative procedure act the apa.conservation law foundation clf and oceana american oceans campaign allege that in implementing framework adjustment to the atlantic sea scallop fishery management plan framework,the national marine fisheries service nmfs and other federal defendants failed to meet their procedural and substantive obligations under governing law.the district court found that framework was lawful.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on may,the plaintiffs initiated an action challenging framework,a rule that adjusted certain restrictions on sea scallop fishing in the atlantic coastal waters the plaintiffs challenged framework on both substantive and procedural grounds.first,they alleged that nmfs failed to meet its substantive management obligations under the act,a,a a,and the apa second,they claimed that nmfs failure to provide a public comment period violated the act,b,and the apa,d.the plaintiffs asked the district court to declare framework in violation of the governing statutes and to remand it with the requirement that nmfs remedy the alleged deficiencies.they also sought their fees,costs,and expenses.
in september,the parties submitted to the district court a joint proposal for briefing and discovery.see local rule.in the proposal,the plaintiffs requested that the court expedite the case pursuant to f over the next few months,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment the district court heard argument on the motions in may.by september,no decision had issued,and the plaintiffs renewed their request to expedite the case,alerting the court to the fact that framework would expire by its own terms in march.
on october,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants motions.see conservation law found.united states dep t of commerce,d.the court found that the act did not mandate public comment for a rule such as framework and that the public comment period required under the apa had been waived for good cause.see id.at.the court also concluded that nmfs had considered the substantive issues raised by the plaintiffs and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in implementing framework.see id.at.the plaintiffs appealed.on march,while this appeal was pending,framework was superseded by framework 
ii.analysis 
we turn first to the question of mootness.see roe wade,d the usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or certiorari review,and not simply at the date the action is initiated.the defendants contend that the expiration of framework rendered this case moot.see gulf of maine fishermen alliance daley,cir.as the parties invoking the mootness doctrine,the defendants bear a heavy burden in attempting to establish its applicability.mangual,cir.and should they merely cease voluntarily the conduct originally challenged,they must demonstrate that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.id.citing united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d.
the defendants attempt to carry this burden with respect to both of the plaintiffs claims by citing to gulf of maine,a case in which we affirmed the district court finding of mootness where a challenged framework affecting groundfish was superseded while cross motions for summary judgment were pending.see at.in that case,an organization of commercial fishermen alleged that a framework was both procedurally deficient for lack of adequate notice and comment and substantively unlawful because of its closure of inshore fishing areas.see id.the appellant urged us to find that the alleged harms continued,despite the promulgation of subsequent frameworks,and that the issues therefore were not moot.see id.at.we rejected that argument,concluding that the promulgation of a new framework in compliance with procedural guidelines and based on new data rendered the challenges to the superseded framework moot.see id.
clf and oceana respond with arguments similar to those made by the appellant in gulf of maine.as to their substantive challenge to framework,they contend that the harms caused by nmfs failure to close the four fishing areas were perpetuated through framework.this,they say,means that their substantive claim remains live,and for support they rely heavily on northeastern florida chapter of the associated general contractors of america city of jacksonville,d.there,a challenged ordinance that accorded preferential treatment to minority businesses for city contracts was repealed and replaced with a modified version weeks after the supreme court had granted certiorari.see id.at.noting three alterations in ordinance,including adoption of five to participation goals in place of ten percent of city contracts earmarked for minority businesses.these modifications were not enough to render the controversy moot.the supreme court concluded that t here is no mere risk that the city will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct it has already done so.id.at.the analogy to northeastern florida is useful here.
on its face,framework is largely an extension of framework.see,noting that framework only modification of the management measures that previously had been in effect was an increase in certain limits on the amount of scallops that could be held on board a fishing vessel.and as a practical matter,it appears that framework was designed merely to maintain the status quo until nmfs could complete a more comprehensive overhaul of its management measures through an amendment to the scallop fmp nmfs states that framework is based on entirely new data about the condition of the scallop resource,nmfs br.at,gulf of maine,at,but it identifies no portion of the record to support this assertion.see mulvihill golf,cir declining to consider argument where litigant ma de no attempt either to marshal the pertinent facts or to engage in reasoned analysis see also united states zannino,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.in any event,we have studied the record with care and can not tell whether and to what extent framework was developed with new underlying data.consequently,we can not say that the challenged conduct will not recur or has not already recurred.see northeastern florida,at.
whether we characterize the expiration of framework as a voluntary cessation of conduct by nmfs subject to the same standards as in northeastern florida,the core question article iii compels us to ask is whether our adjudication of the issue can grant meaningful relief.gulf of maine,at.here,it appears that the same allegedly harmful scheme continues.no matter how the issue is framed,we have no difficulty concluding that,where a challenged regulation continues to the extent that it is only superficially altered by a subsequent regulation,we are capable of meaningful review.see schall martin,d concluding that changes in general statutory scheme did not moot challenge where contested provision remained the same brockington rhodes,d per curiam finding that suit attacking requirement that nominating petitions be signed by seven percent of voters on ground that no more than one percent could be required was not mooted by new statute reducing signature requirement to four percent keyishian board of regents of the university of the state of new york,d noting that abandonment of requirement that employees disclaim membership in communist party did not render challenge to constitutionality of procedure moot where underlying statutes and regulations remained.the plaintiffs challenge to the substance of framework is not moot.
as to their procedural challenge to framework,clf and oceana begin their response to nmfs mootness arguments by acknowledging that framework was promulgated in a procedurally proper manner.yet,the plaintiffs argue,their challenge remains live because nmfs conduct is capable of repetition,yet evading review.se
