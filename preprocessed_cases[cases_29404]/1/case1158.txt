opinion of the court 
this matter comes before this court after having been transferred from the united states district court for the district of new jersey pursuant to the real id act of,stat.codified as amended at.the transfer presents a procedural issue that has been addressed only recently.some review of the history of this case is necessary to understand what is at issue.
david nnadika,who is a native and citizen of nigeria,filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the district court.nnadika named as respondents michael chertoff,secretary of the department of homeland security michael garcia,assistant secretary of immigration customs enforcement uscis michael anderson,interim field office director uscis william joyce,officer in charge of elizabeth new jersey detention facility alberto gonzales,attorney general and eduardo aguirre,assistant secretary uscis.nnadika made essentially two claims,as appears from the title.he sought to enjoin respondents from removing him and also sought an order to uscis to grant reconsideration and approval of his form asylee relative petition.
nnadika is a male who participated in protests in his native nigeria.in november of,nnadika left nigeria and went to kenya with his who,at the time of the immigration hearing,remained in kenya.he entered the united states on september,without inspection and submitted an application for asylum on or about november.his administrative asylum application was not granted and he was referred to an immigration judge ij.at that hearing,nnadika testified that he was a member of the social diplomatic party sdp,a political organization in nigeria that supported the candidacy of an individual who was elected to the nigerian presidency in,but whose election was not recognized by the nigerian dictator.nnadika testified that the nigerian military police shot his father,another sdp activist,during a protest in november of,and that nnadika himself feared that he would be killed if deported to nigeria.
the ij noted that nnadika had not submitted any evidence to establish his or a relative membership in the sdp or any political organization,or to corroborate the shooting.the ij found that nnadika had not established more than general problems in nigeria to support his request for asylum.app.at.because nnadika had not presented evidence of past persecution in nigeria despite having had nearly two years to document the background of his case,the ij held that he had not met his burden of proof and denied the request for asylum and withholding of deportation he advised nnadika that any appeal must be filed by may.
nnadika did not file his notice of appeal to the board of immigration appeals until may,which the bia dismissed as untimely because it had not been filed within ten days after the ij decision was rendered,as required by,b,and a.
nnadika did not voluntarily depart by june,as ordered by the ij.instead,he remained in the united states and married umaka hilda umonnakwe umonnakwe in jersey city,on november.umonnakwe was granted asylum by an ij in new york city on march,
on april,nnadika filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings so that he would have the opportunity to receive asylee status based on his wife asylum status.the ij denied nnadika motion on may,stating that the immigration court did not have jurisdiction under the circumstances to adjudicate a derivative asylum request and that umonnakwe had not filed form with the ins as required for a spouse to receive asylee status.on december,the bia affirmed the ij decision to deny nnadika motion to reopen,agreeing with the ins that nnadika motion to reopen had not been timely filed under b.
undeterred,umonnakwe filed an form on behalf of nnadika on december,and again on december.both were denied as untimely filed,having been filed more than two years after umonnakwe was granted asylum on march.the denial letters stated that i t does not appear that circumstances exist which would warrant the extension of the filing period.therefore,you are ineligible to file form at this time,and this petition may not be approved.app.at a.they further stated,however,that if umonnakwe could overcome the grounds for denial in the future,she could refile with the appropriate documentation.
nnadika,having been unsuccessful in his applications at the agency level,then turned to the district court and filed the above referenced petition for writ of habeas corpus and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.the alleged that the district court had habeas jurisdiction to review nnadika detention pursuant to,and that it may exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and mandamus jurisdiction pursuant to.the also claims that he is entitled to review of deportation as a matter of constitutional right and under the common law.
to the extent that the complaint seeks a writ of habeas corpus,nnadika alleged that he has been in the physical custody of the newark district of immigration and customs enforcement ice,detained at the elizabeth detention facility in elizabeth,new jersey,since march where he has been held pursuant to ice contract to house immigration detainees.he alleged that he exhausted his administrative remedies and is under an order of deportation by the immigration judge who denied his motion to reopen and stay deportation.in addition,nnadika petition claims that he is entitled to derivative asylum under the ina but that his form asylee relative petition has been denied for having been filed out of time.he asserts mandamus jurisdiction pursuant to.
the district court heard oral argument on june,and entered an order dated june,that denied the government motion to reconsider and vacate the stay of removal that denied the petition for habeas corpus insofar as it challenges the detention of the petitioner by respondents,that ordered that pursuant to the real id act the remainder of the petition,which challenges the order of deportation or removal which was entered following proceedings before the immigration court in newark,new jersey,be and hereby is transferred to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit to be treated as a petition for review.finally,the court ordered that the stay of removal it had previously ordered remain in effect during and after the transfer of the case to the court of appeals,noted that the respondents may move in this court to vacate the stay,and ordered the case closed on the district court docket.we consider in the first instance the question of jurisdiction,both in this court and in the district court,in light of the unusually titled document nnadika filed.
when congress enacted the real id act,it included the following 
if an alien case,brought under section of title,united states code,and challenging a final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion,is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of this division may,then the district court shall transfer the case or the part of the case that challenges the order of removal,deportation,or exclusion to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under section b of the immigration and nationality act subsec.b of this section,as amended by this section,or under section c d of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of note.the court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section 
note,see also stat.emphasis added 
the real id act thus distinguishes between those challenges brought by an alien to a final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion,and those challenges made to other aspects of the administrative proceeding.because the real id act is relatively recent legislation,the courts have just begun to focus on the distinction.this court did so to some extent in kumarasamy att y,cir.kumarasamy had been charged with being subject to removal as a who remained in the united states beyond the authorized time.id.at.he sought asylum,protection under the convention against torture cat,and withholding of rem
