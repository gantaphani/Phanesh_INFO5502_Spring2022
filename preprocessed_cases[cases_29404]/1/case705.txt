background 
we recount only such facts as are necessary to explain our decision.padmore is a native and citizen of guyana.he entered the united states in january as a lawful permanent resident.since his arrival,padmore has been arrested on three occasions.
in,he was arrested and charged with selling marijuana to an undercover police officer.at the time of his arrest,according to a sworn statement of an assistant district attorney the affidavit conveying the statements of an undercover police officer,a police officer recovered marijuana from padmore person and more than two ounces of marijuana from a nearby counter.padmore pled guilty to criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree in violation of new york penal law nypl regarding this conviction,padmore testified before the ij that he was arrested while attempting to purchase some marijuana for his own use and that he had never sold controlled substances.he explained that the assistant district attorney statements were based on a mistaken identification.
in,padmore was arrested and charged with criminal possession of marijuana,more than four ounces of cocaine,drug paraphernalia,and a loaded firearm.in,in satisfaction of these charges he pled guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in violation of nypl before the ij,padmore testified that he had never used cocaine,had not possessed a weapon and was arrested based on a mistaken identification.he explained that at the time of his second arrest he was in another person house and was not aware of what was in the guy house.
finally,padmore was arrested in for violating the conditions of his probation.the arrest was triggered by his visit to the house of the mother of his two eldest children.when padmore appeared before a state court judge following that arrest,the judge suspected that padmore was using illegal drugs.ultimately,these charges were dismissed without prejudice.padmore testified before the ij that his behavior in those state court proceedings was attributable to high blood pressure.
in june,the department of homeland security dhs issued padmore a notice to appear charging that he was removable under section a b i of the ina,a b i as an alien who after entry has been convicted of a controlled substance offense.the dhs cited padmore nypl.and his nypl convictions as the bases for his removal.
the ij decision 
in the proceedings before the ij,padmore admitted to all allegations except the conviction for criminal possession of cocaine in violation of nypl.with respect to proof of that conviction,because padmore refused to admit it,the ij relied on the conviction document of record,which is a printout from an unidentified database maintained by the new york state division of criminal justice services.based on the two convictions,the ij concluded that padmore was removable as charged.
padmore applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to ina a,which the ij granted by decision dated september.the ij deemed padmore statutorily eligible for relief and determined that padmore warranted an affirmative exercise of discretion.significantly,for purposes of our analysis,the ij found that padmore criminal record consisted of two convictions for the possession of a controlled substance,as distinguished from a more serious offense,such as a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense removal proceedings tr.immig.city.with respect to padmore conviction for possession of a small amount of marijuana,id.at,the ij found that it not clear that that criminal conduct involved possession of grams or more of marijuana.id.at.the ij made no findings with respect to either i the affidavit attribution of more than two ounces of marijuana to padmore at the time of his arrest,or ii the allegation,also contained in the affidavit,that padmore had sold marijuana to an undercover police officer.with respect to padmore conviction,the ij found that padmore had been convict ed for possession of cocaine,stating t his is a conviction based on possession as opposed to possession with intent to distribute,possession with intent to sell,or a straightforward drug trafficking charge.id.at.the ij made no findings with respect to the arrest report narrative alleging that padmore was in possession of a loaded firearm,over four ounces of cocaine and a quantity of marijuana and drug paraphernalia at the time of his arrest.nor did the ij make any findings with respect to padmore credibility or his denial of the allegations contained in the affidavit and the arrest report.
the bia opinion 
the government appealed the ij decision granting padmore cancellation of removal.the dhs argued that padmore was statutorily ineligible for cancellation because his convictions prevent him from demonstrating that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony,see ina a,a,and the ij incorrectly exercised his discretion in connection with padmore cancellation of removal.by decision dated december,the bia sustained the dhs appeal in part and reversed the ij decision.the board found that padmore was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal under a,but concluded that he does not merit,as a matter of discretion,a grant of cancellation of removal.important to our analysis here,the board cited to the contents of the affidavit and the arrest report in support of its decision.padmore petitions from the board decision and order.
discussion 
padmore makes two main arguments to this court on appeal the bia impermissibly engaged in appellate fact finding in contravention of controlling regulation and the bia impermissibly relied on unproven and disputed allegations as a basis for its decision in contravention to its precedent.we consider each argument in turn.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
in the absence of constitutional or legal issues in dispute,we do not have jurisdiction to review the board exercise of discretion to deny cancellation of removal under ina a.see ina a b i,a d a b i,a d see also gonzales,cir affirming de la vega gonzales,cir id.at acknowledging jurisdiction to consider colorable questions of law,such as whether the agency applied an erroneous legal standard internal quotation marks omitted.although we lack jurisdiction to review the bia discretionary determinations concerning cancellation of removal,a b i,we may review constitutional claims or questions of law arising in connection with such determinations,id.a d,including whether the bia has violated its own rules.see shi jie ge holder,cir.
the board regulations provide,in pertinent part,that e xcept for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts or the contents of official documents,the board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.d iv.see also noble keisler,cir bia commits reviewable legal error when,in contravention to its own rules,it fails to defer to an ij factfinding wallace gonzales,cir same fen yong chen bureau of citizenship immigration,cir same when it makes de novo credibility determinations.by force of this regulation,i f incomplete findings of fact are entered by an ij and the bia can not affirm the immigration judge decision on the basis that he or she decided the case and if the dispositive issue is not sufficiently clear,bia has said it will remand to the ij for further.in re.thus,when the bia engages in factfinding in contravention of d iv,it commits an error of law,which we have jurisdiction to cor
