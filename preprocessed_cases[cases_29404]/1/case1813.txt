rezvan gholamhossein karimijanaki and her son,hesameddin nossoni,seek review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board affirming an immigration judge ij order that they be removed to their native country of iran.because sufficient evidence supports the board and ij rulings that karimijanaki abandoned her lawful permanent resident status,her absence from the united states was not a temporary visit abroad,her conduct was imputable to nossoni an unemancipated minor during the relevant period,and nossoni did not automatically acquire citizenship based upon his father naturalization prior to the removal proceedings,we deny the petition for review.
in october,karimijanaki and her husband,ali nossoni,along with three of their four children,golrokh,farideddin,and hesameddin nossoni,were admitted as lawful permanent residents lpr pursuant to an immigrant visa petition filed by ali brother in their fourth child,zahra,remained in iran because she was years old and therefore ineligible for derivative lpr status from her uncle petition.that same year,ali filed a petition for zahra to immigrate to the united states as the unmarried daughter of a lawful permanent resident.
following his admission,ali remained in the united states.karimijanaki,however,returned to iran with her children after spending one month in the united states her stated purpose in doing so was to care for zahra,who had no immigrant visa and was culturally forbidden from living alone in iran as an unmarried woman.although karimijanaki mother and sister lived in iran,karimijanaki testified that they could not serve as zahra chaperones because they did not reside in tehran,where zahra attended a university.according to karimijanaki,zahra could neither transfer to a different school nor live in a dormitory because she was a tehran resident the dorms were reserved for students from outside the region and employed.believing that she could remain abroad for as long as ten valid period of her immigrant still retain her lpr status,karimijanaki intended to remain in iran until zahra received her lpr status,a process she was told would take approximately two years but which,in reality,took ten.
in or,golrokh and farideddin returned to the united states to live with their father in michigan,where they attended college.petitioners karimijanaki and hesameddin nossoni,however,remained continuously in iran until their return to the united states in june.while living in iran during this approximately period,petitioner hesameddin nossoni attended school.petitioner karimijanaki did not work but supported herself and her children with money her husband sent from the united states.in addition,she received some assistance from zahra.karimijanaki owned two apartments in iran and had a joint bank account with zahra.she did not own a home,work,or have a bank account in the united states,and she had no permits authorizing her to the united states.
ali nossoni traveled twice from the united states to iran to visit his family.his trips included a visit in,and a four to visit at an unspecified later date.
although zahra had not yet acquired an immigrant visa,petitioners nevertheless returned to the united states without her in june so that petitioner hesameddin nossoni,who was then sixteen years old,could avoid mandatory military service in iran.allegedly,the iranian government did not allow males to leave iran once they turned seventeen to insure their availability for military service at eighteen.
upon their attempted to the united states in june,karimijanaki had an return ticket to iran that was valid for one year,but petitioner hesameddin nossoni had a ticket.karimijanaki told immigration officials that she intended to stay in the united states for one year,during which time she planned to resolve zahra visa issue and apply for citizenship.if she could not achieve these goals,karimijanaki acknowledged that she might return to iran to zahra,although she would forget the ticket if required to stay longer in the united states.
immigration authorities served karimijanaki and her son with notices to appear alleging that they had abandoned their permanent residence in the united states and were subject to removal because they did not have valid visas or entry documents.petitioners denied that they had abandoned their residence and were removable,and they were granted temporary parole into the united states pending a hearing before an immigration judge.
within months of petitioners attempted to the united states,karimijanaki mother passed away,and her sister,who was retired and had been caring for her mother,moved to tehran to live with zahra.they lived together from until.in or,zahra earned her master degree from the tehran university she attended.
at the july,merits hearing,both petitioners were represented by private counsel and were the only witnesses to testify karimijanaki testified that she had not left the united states since her return in june,that her husband had obtained his united states citizenship,and that zahra had received her immigrant visa through her father petition and was flying to the united states that evening.ali nossoni,who lived and worked previously in detroit for five years,had accepted employment and began living in anaheim,california,approximately years before the hearing.karimijanaki,golrokh,farideddin,and petitioner hesameddin nossoni,however,lived in detroit because the children were attending college in the area.petitioner hesameddin nossoni also testified that on the day of the hearing,his unmarried sister golrokh was traveling by herself in greece.
in his written opinion,the ij ruled that karimijanaki abandoned her lpr status and that her absence from the united states was not a temporary visit abroad,imputed her conduct to her minor son,petitioner hesameddin nossoni,rejected his claim that he automatically acquired united states citizenship when his father was naturalized in,found petitioners removable,and ordered that they be removed to iran.subsequently,the board dismissed petitioners appeal,affirming all of the ij rulings but not addressing the claim that petitioner hesameddin nossoni automatically acquired citizenship upon his father naturalization.
petitioners timely requested review.
where the board affirms the ij ruling but adds its own comments,we review both the ij decision and the board additional remarks.gilaj gonzales,cir.a deportability order is valid only if it is based upon reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.c a.the supreme court has defined substantial evidence as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and enough evidence to justify,if the trial were to a jury,a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.consolo fed.maritime comm n,d defining substantial evidence under the administrative procedure act citations omitted.the court has cautioned that something less than the weight of the evidence,and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.id.in other words,u nder this deferential standard,we may not reverse the board determination simply because we would have decided the matter differently.koliada ins,cir.

karimijanaki challenges the board decision affirming the ij rulings that she abandoned her lpr status and that her more than absence from the united states between the latter part of and june was not a temporary visit abroad.
the term lawfully admitted for permanent residence means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.a.an lpr who returns from a visit abroad may be considered a returning resident eligible for to the united states without producing a passport,immigrant visa,permit,or other document.a a a b.however,to justify those privileges,the alien must have departed from the united states with the intention of returning and has not abandoned this intention and is returning to the united states from a temporary visit abroad and,if the stay abroad was protracted,this was caused by reasons beyond the alien control and for which the alien was not responsible.a.in addition,a n alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states unless the alien has abandoned or relinquished that status or has been absent from the united states for a continuous period in excess of days.a c i ii.
the parties agree that where,as here,petitioners have colorable claim s to returning resident status,the government has the burden of proving they are not eligible for admission to the united states.hana gonzales,cir quoting singh reno,cir.that burden requires the government to establish petitioners ineligibility for admission by clear and convincing evidence.c a a pickering gonzales,cir.a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.b c.
in determining whether an alien has abandoned her lpr status,we examine the totality of the alien circumstances,including the location of the alien family,property,and job,and of course the length of the alien trip s abroad but also other evidence in the record demonstrating the alien intent with regard to maintaining her lpr status.hana,at.the alien intent is measured by an objective standard.see singh,at an alien desire to retain his status as a permanent resident,without more,is not sufficient his actions must support his professed intent.however,an individual with lpr status may also abandon that status by unintentional acts.in re duarte,bia lawful permanent resident status may be lost through abandonment,intentional or unintentional.
the term temporary in temporary visit abroad is not merely an antonym of permanent,singh,at rather,a visit abroad is temporary if a it is for a relatively short period,fixed by some early event or b will terminate upon the occurrence of an event that has a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time.hana,at quoting and approving singh,at see also hana,at approving the second circuit clarification that when the visit relies upon an event with a reasonable possibility of occurring within a short period of time the intention of the visitor must still be to return within a period relatively short,fixed by some early event.quoting ahmed ashcroft,cir.
after a thorough analysis,the board and ij ruled that karimijanaki abandoned her residence and took more than a temporary visit abroad.supporting those conclusions,they found that,from the latter part of until june,karimijanaki never lived longer than one month in the united states and neither made a single return visit to the united states nor applied for a permit.the ij also deemed it significant that,although three of her four children obtained immigrant visas through their uncle petition and her husband remained in the united states,karimijanaki nevertheless took all three children back with her to iran in,where they lived for an extended period.
the board and ij noted that when karimijanaki returned to the united states in june,her admitted purpose was not to remain in the united states rather,she desired to help her son avoid mandatory military service in iran,resolve her daughter visa issues,and merely apply for citizenship without staying.after her intended yearlong visit to the united states,karimijanaki again planned to return to iran to live with zahra,who was then a adult residing with her aunt,until her daughter obtained an immigrant visa.
the board agreed with the ij characterization of karimijanaki argument that cultural norms compelled her to live with zahra as overstated.the ij noted that karimijanaki told an immigration officer that she planned to leave zahra alone in iran during her intended stay in the united states in that zahra aunt began living with zahra two months after karimijanaki june arrival in the united states,thereby leaving zahra alone in iran for the two months before her aunt joined her and that karimijanaki younger,unmarried daughter golrokh was traveling by herself in a foreign country on the hearing date.based upon this evidence,the ij found that while karimijanaki may have strongly preferred her daughter not live alone,this preference clearly did not amount to an entirely inflexible prohibition.
assuming arguendo that such cultural norms prohibited unmarried women from living alone in iran,the ij rejected karimijanaki contention that zahra could not live with her aunt after she finished her bachelor degree.the ij also questioned why karimijanaki had to return to iran to accompany her unmarried daughter in when zahra was not then living alone,but was companioned by her aunt.in other words,granting that karimijanaki may initially have been compelled to return to iran,the ij reasoned that she remained in iran by choice long after necessity demanded it.
the ij was further persuaded by the extent of karimijanaki ties to iran and the absence of her contacts with the united states between and june.in particular,karimijanaki had a joint bank account with zahra,owned two apartments,and sent her children to school in iran.she had no home or bank account in the united states.although her husband lived and worked in the united states,karimijanaki never traveled to the united states to visit him during the entire period.instead,her husband traveled twice to iran to visit his family.
finally,the ij ruled that karimijanaki absence from the united states was not a temporary visit abroad.notwithstanding her approximately stay in iran after obtaining lpr status,the ij found that she intended to remain in iran until her daughter married or obtained an immigrant visa.these events,according to the board and ij,did not have a reasonable possibility of occurring within a short time period,but their occurrences,if at all,were indefinite.the ij characterized as completely unreasonable karimijanaki belief that zahra would receive her immigrant visa in two years because the process took six years at that time,and karimijanaki had waited eleven years to acquire her own immigrant visa.giving karimijanaki the benefit of the doubt,however,the ij reasoned that a lthough she may have initially believed it would only take two years for zahra to obtain her immigrant visa,at some point during the process,she must have become aware that the process would actually take much,much longer.in any event,the ij concluded that it was speculative whether zahra would even receive a visa.
based upon these findings,the ij ruled that i t was karimijanaki two trips to the united states,not her life in iran,which constituted temporary visits abroad.in addition,her inten t to reside in the united states eventually at some nebulous point in the future was insufficient to show she did not intend to abandon her residency.
although karimijanaki concedes that w hile the amount of time she spent in iran would,by itself,support a finding of abandonment,she argues that the totality of the circumstances compels a contrary conclusion.her central complaint is that t he bia severely punished her for attempting to fulfill her obligation to care for zahra in iran until zahra received her own immigrant visa.she acknowledges that t he time this took was not fixed by a definite end date but there was a reasonable possibility that it would happen within a short time period.according to karimijanaki,legislation passed by the congress in would have protected her family from separation,thereby allowing her to avoid having to return to iran,but she regrets that such legislation came too late.she also asserts that her ties to the united states were cement ed because her husband
