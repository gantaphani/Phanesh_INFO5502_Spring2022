opinion of the court 
appellants in this case seek to represent a putative class of aliens who are detained,pursuant to c,pending their removal proceedings.the class complaint,filed in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,sought a declaratory judgment that the continued detention of the class members,without bond hearings,violates the immigration and nationality act ina and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the district court denied the class certification motion and dismissed the class complaint,finding that f deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an application for declaratory relief on behalf of the plaintiff class.section f precludes class actions that seek to enjoin or restrain the operation of several immigration statutes,including c.the district court concluded that restrain encompasses declaratory relief.we reverse.
appellants alexander alli and elliot grenade are lawful permanent residents whom the government deems removable from the united states as a result of past criminal convictions.see a.appellants were detained pursuant to c which provides that the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who is deportable by reason of having committed certain enumerated offenses 
after alli and grenade had been detained for,respectively,months and months,they filed a combined habeas petition and civil complaint alleging that their continued detention violated the ina and the due process clause.they sought,inter alia,an order directing the government to provide them with a bond hearing.in addition to their individual claims,appellants sought to represent a class of lawful permanent residents residing in pennsylvania or,in the alternative,in the middle district of pennsylvania,who had been or would be detained without hearing,pursuant to c,for over six months.the putative class sought a declaration that the failure to afford such a hearing violates the ina and the due process clause.
the district court granted appellants individual petitions but refused to consider their class claims,finding that f stripped it of jurisdiction to entertain a class action requesting declaratory relief.the government did not appeal the ruling on the individual petitions,but appellants sought review of the class decision.
the district court had jurisdiction under and.we exercise jurisdiction under,and we exercise plenary review over legal conclusions associated with orders dismissing claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.white squire postal,cir.
although not raised by either party,we briefly address a procedural wrinkle that implicates the mootness doctrine.the district court denied appellants motion for class certification on august.dkt.in the same order,the district court dismissed the portions of appellants complaint and habeas petition that sought class relief.but on january,the district court ruled that both of appellants detentions were unreasonably prolonged,and thus ordered individualized bond hearings for each appellant dkt.accordingly,appellants no longer have a personal stake in the merits of the class claim.nevertheless,because the denial of class certification occurred when appellants individual claims were still live,their appeal is not moot.see parole comm geraghty,a n action brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff substantive claim,even though class certification has been denied.rosetti shalala,cir a federal appellate court retains jurisdiction over a named plaintiff challenge to a denial of class certification,even if the plaintiff has not maintained a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation since that decision.we may therefore review the district court conclusion that f deprived it of jurisdiction to certify appellants class claim for declaratory relief.
section f provides 
regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,no court other than the supreme court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part iv of this,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated 
at issue in this case is whether the term restrain,in f,encompasses,and thus bars,appellants class claim for declaratory relief regarding c detention practices 
the parties agree that use of the disjunctive or demands that restrain have some meaning other than enjoin.see chalmers shalala,cir we see no basis to construe the disjunctive or in any way other than its plain meaning see also rosenberg xm ventures,cir w hen interpreting a statute,courts should endeavor to give meaning to every word which congress used and therefore should avoid an interpretation which renders an element of the language superfluous.
but the parties dispute what we may and may not consider in construing the statute.appellants argue that the meaning of restrain may be derived by reference to the statute context including neighboring provisions,while the government contends that resort to statutory context is only appropriate where the term in question is ambiguous.the government claims and the district court found that restrain is not ambiguous,but merely broad,and thus that it is improper to consult the provision context.see appellees br.at ambiguity may not be read into a statutory term or phrase simply because congress used a different term or phrase in another part of the same statute.alli decker,d,that congress employed different language in another portion of the statute does not change the plain meaning of restrain.
it is true that w here the statutory language is unambiguous,the court should not consider statutory purpose or legislative history,parker nutrisystem,cir,and that the title of a statute can not limit the plain meaning of the text,dep t of corrections yeskey,quoting trainmen baltimore ohio.but neither the government nor the district court has cited to any authority that requires a court to ignore other provisions within a statute when making the threshold ambiguity determination indeed,t he supreme court has stated consistently that the text of a statute must be considered in the larger context or structure of the statute in which it is found.united states tupone,cir see also fda brown williamson tobacco corp,in determining whether congress has specifically addressed the question at issue,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.accordingly,the district court approach to discerning the existence of ambiguity an approach based on dictionary definitions was insufficient.see brown gardner,ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.
we therefore turn to the statutory context of f.a closely adjacent provision,e a,precludes courts from entering declaratory,injunctive,or other equitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien this provision is compelling evidence that congress knew how to preclude declaratory relief,but chose not to in f.see ins cardoza fonseca,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting russello united states.in nken holder,the supreme court followed this presumption in interpreting f,immediately adjacent to the provision at issue here,and noted that the presumption was particularly true where the subsections were enacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review procedures.see nken holder.
even if the contrast between enjoin or restrain in f and declaratory,injunctive,or other equitable relief in e a does not,by itself,demonstrate that restrain does not encompass declaratory relief,it at least underscores an ambiguity that encourages consideration of f section heading.see.dep t of revenue piccadilly cafeterias,s tatutory titles and section headings are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.quoting porter nussle,internal quotation marks omitted.the title of f,limit on injunctive relief,counsels in favor of interpreting restrain as referring to a form of injunctive relief.this reading is reinforced by the broader heading of e,limitations on relief.as noted above,e unlike f expressly bars jurisdiction over both injunctive and declaratory relief.we therefore read limit on injunctive relief to mean what it says,and we conclude that restrain refers to one or more forms of temporary injunctive relief,such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
in sum,viewing the provision in context and then taking into consideration the heading of the provision,it is apparent that the jurisdictional limitations in f do not encompass declaratory relief.this moderate construction of restrain is in keeping with the supreme court instruction that statutes limiting equitable relief are to be construed narrowly.see porter warren holding,unless a statute in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.see also samuels mackell,a suit for declaratory judgment is essentially an equitable cause of action quoting great lakes dredge dock huffman,our conclusion is consistent with the ninth circuit holding on the identical question,and with the first circuit conclusion in a slightly different context.see rodriguez hayes,cir arevalo ashcroft,cir 
the government contends that restrain should be construed to include declaratory relief because,in this context,such relief is the functional equivalent of injunctive relief.specifically,the government contends that our interpretation leads to an absurd result by creating a loophole that stops just short of ordering injunctive relief but establishes on a basis the right to such injunctive relief.appellees br.at see also,lamie trustee,it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.
under certain circumstances,declaratory relief has been deemed functionally equivalent to injunctive relief.for example,in california grace brethren church,the supreme court assessed whether declaratory relief was permissible under the tax injunction act,which provides that district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the collection of any tax under state law emphasis added.in ruling that the act precludes both injunctive and declaratory relief,the court observed that the declaratory judgment procedure may in every practical sense operate to suspend collection of the state taxes until the litigation is ended,grace brethren church,at quoting great lakes dredge dock huffman,and that a prohibition on declaratory relief was consistent with the principal purpose of the act to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.id.at quoting rosswell lasalle bank,
but declaratory relief will not always be the functional equivalent of injunctive relief.in steffel thompson,the supreme court noted that t he express purpose of the federal declaratory judgment act was to provide a milder alternative to the injunction remedy,quoting perez ledesma,brennan,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the steffel court noted that t he only occasions where this court has found that a preclusion of injunctive relief inevitably led to a denial of declaratory relief have been cases in which principles of federalism militated altogether against federal intervention in a class of adjudications.id.at see also id.at when no state proceeding is pending and thus considerations of equity,comity,and federalism have little vitality,the propriety of granting federal declaratory relief may properly be considered independently of a request for injunctive relief.
the reasoning of steffel significantly undermines the government wholesale attempt to equate declaratory and injunctive relief,and it supports the conclusion that our reading of f would not produce an absurd result.the distinct purpose and effect of a declaration,as compared to an injunction,presents an entirely plausible basis upon which congress might choose to bar one form of relief but not the other.moreover,in this context a classwide declaration would not indeed,by the plain terms of the statute,could not form the basis for classwide injunctive relief.though appellants do not dispute that class members could pursue individual injunctions after issuance of a classwide declaration,see steffel,at u nder a declaratory judgment might serve as the basis for issuance of a later injunction,such individual relief is expressly permitted under f 
finally,as one respected scholar has noted,allowing classwide declaratory relief would facilitate the supreme court review that congress apparently intended.see gerald neuman,federal courts issues in immigration law,see also f no court other than the supreme court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain emphasis added.the supreme court could not exercise original jurisdiction over such a class action,and a n appellate jurisdiction necessarily implies some judicial determination,some judgment,decree,or order of an inferior tribunal,from which an appeal could be taken.the alicia,wall.if instead section f were interpreted as permitting classwide declaratory but not injunctive relief in the lower courts,there would be a justiciable class action that could be subjected to appellate review.neuman.at.thus professor neuman has articulated an additional reason that our interpretation of restrain would not lead to an unreasonable result.
in summary,we conclude that construing f to permit class declaratory relief would not produce an absurd result.we accordingly decline the government invitation to disregard the most natural reading of the statute.
the problem in this case is to determine the scope of what congress intended in using the word restrain in f.the government places particular emphasis on that term dictionary definitions.we think that,in construing a statute,dictionary definitions may be helpful starting points,but on dictionaries to the exclusion of sources such as adjacent statutory provisions can lead a court astray.as we have noted previously,see supra note,the supreme court has given prudent counsel interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.dolan,at.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of those portions of appellants amended habeas petition and civil complaint that sought class relief,vacate the district court denial of class certification,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority concludes that,although f prohibits class action relief to enjoin or restrain immigration laws that regulate the detention of aliens convicted of crimes pending their removal,these jurisdictional limitations do not encompass declaratory relief.op.at.i disagree because a class action for declaratory relief has the effect of restraining the operation of laws,like c,that regulate detention in immigration proceedings precisely what the plain text of f prohibits.
the statute at issue in this case provides as follows 
regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,no court other than the supreme court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part iv of this subchapter,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.
f emphases added.although this provision bars class action suits to enjoin or restrain the immigration laws that regulate the detention of aliens subject to removal,alli argues that,by its plain language,f contains no prohibition on declaratory relief.he points out that the text does not use the term declaratory and that the section is entitled limit on injunctive relief.i find these arguments unpersuasive.the real issue in this case is whether the word restrain bars a class claim for declaratory relief that would have the same practical effect as a class claim for injunctive relief.the majority concludes that it does not because the word restrain refers to temporary injunctive relief.op.at.this is incompatible with the majority conclusion that the word restrain should have a meaning different from the word enjoin.op.at.in my view,while the term enjoin refers to injunctive relief including the temporary kind the term restrain is a broad one that includes,among other things,declaratory relief.for this reason,i respectfully dissent.
the district court rejected alli interpretation of f and,for several reasons,i find its analysis persuasive.first,because we endeavor to interpret statutes according to their ordinary meaning,chapman united states,i find dictionary definitions helpful.see massie united states dep t of housing and urban,cir noting that the dictionary is the proper starting place for ascertaining the plain meaning of words.in this case,those definitions comport with understanding.the word restrain means restrict,limit,confine,and to hold back from action keep in check or under control repress.the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed random house webster unabridged dictionary ed the compact oxford english dictionary ed.
a declaratory judgment that aliens detained pursuant to c must receive an individualized hearing,as the majority would allow,necessarily restricts or limits the executive branch implementation of that statute.i find nothing ambiguous about this result as the government argues,the term restrain is simply broad congress was so concerned about judicial of its policy that it used a broad term in order to prevent it.see diamond chakrabarty,broad general language is not necessarily ambiguous when congressional objectives require broad terms.in re philadelphia newspapers,llc,cir as a general matter of statutory construction,a term in a statute is not ambiguous merely because it is broad in scope.
alli class action petition for declaratory relief operates to restrain the operation of the law and is therefore barred by f.in younger harris,the supreme court held that a plaintiff generally can not file an action in federal court to enjoin a pending state prosecution.a companion case,samuels mackell,recognized that allowing declaratory judgments in such cases would largely undermine younger holding.the supreme court explained that the propriety of declaratory and injunctive relief should be judged by essentially the same standards.id.at.applying this principle,the supreme court acknowledged that allowing declaratory judgments against pending state criminal prosecutions would serve as the basis for a subsequent injunction against those proceedings and thus result in a clearly improper interference with the state proceedings,and even if the declaratory judgment is not used as a basis for actually issuing an injunction,the declaratory relief alone would have virtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction id.emphasis added.in this way,it recognized that a declaratory judgment had the same practical limiting effect on a state prosecution as an injunction.id.at.ordinarily,however,the practical effect of the two forms of relief will be virtually identical 
i am not persuaded by the majority reliance on steffel thompson,to dismiss this authority.steffel did not purport to overrule samuels.it merely acknowledged that different considerations enter into a federal court decision as to declaratory relief,on the one hand,and injunctive relief,on the other.steffel,at.this is certainly true the decision to grant declaratory judgment is a purely discretionary one.see wilton seven falls.the question is whether the considerations that led the supreme court to decide in samuels that allowing declaratory judgments would undermine its holding in younger are also applicable here.they are.
the concern in samuels was that declaratory judgments would have the same practical effect of interfering with pending state proceedings as an injunction.here,the concern is that a declaratory judgment has the same practical effect of interfering with pending immigration proceedings in immigration courts established by congress and administered by the executive branch.in both situations,a declaratory judgment will serve as the basis for a subsequent injunction against those proceedings and even if the declaratory judgment is not used as a basis for actually issuing an injunction,the declaratory relief alone would have virtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction samuels,at emphasis added.this consideration was not present in steffel,which reaches the sensible conclusion that a declaratory judgment action can be filed when there is no pending proceeding to interfere with.at.
furthermore,the fact that district courts must consider a variety of factors in deciding between declaratory and injunctive relief is irrelevant to whether a declaratory judgment restrains.the majority implies that a declaratory judgment only restrains if it is the functional equivalent of an injunction.op.at.in this case,i believe that the two forms of relief are functionally equivalent.but even if they are not even if a declaratory judgment is a milder form of relief a milder form of relief can still limit,restrict or keep someone back from action.in this light,i am unconvinced that a declaratory judgment does not restrain the operation of c.
indeed,if a declaratory judgment does not restrain that is restrict,limit,confine or keep under control the operation of a law then what does it do at its inception,the concept of declaratory relief was controversial because of the concern that such judgments were merely impermissible advisory opinions.see charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,ed.these concerns remain real,which is why courts are required to ensure that a declaratory judgment action presents an actual controversy and not just an abstract question of law.see simmonds aerocessories,elastic stop nut of,cir.the fundamental test is whether the plaintiff seeks merely advice or whether a real question of conflicting legal interests is presented for judicial determination.id.here,it must be assumed that plaintiffs are seeking a determination of their legal rights as a class,not merely advice.surely the determination of the legal rights of an entire class of aliens restrains the executive branch legal authority over that class.see california grace brethren church,in enacting the declaratory judgment act,congress recognized the substantial effect declaratory relief would have on legal disputes.
second,the supreme court interpretation of similar statutory phrases also supports my reading of f.the tax injunction act states that district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the collection of any tax under state law.recognizing that there is little practical difference between injunctive and declaratory relief,the supreme court held that this language stripped district courts of their jurisdiction to issue declaratory judgments as well as injunctions.grace brethren church,at.circuit courts interpreting the johnson act,which contains similar language limiting the ability of district courts to enjoin,suspend or restrain the operation of public utility rates set by state agencies,have reached the same conclusion the phrase enjoin,suspend or restrain covers declaratory relief.see brooks sulphur springs valley,cir tennyson gas serv,cir.
alli is correct to point out that these statutes implicated concerns of federalism.but i find this attempt to distinguish the cases more illuminating than discouraging if concerns of fede
