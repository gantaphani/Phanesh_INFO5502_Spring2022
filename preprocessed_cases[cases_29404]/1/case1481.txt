the petitioners,telebrands corporation,tv savings,llc and ajit khubani collectively,telebrands,challenge the scope of a federal trade commission ftc order containing an all claims,all products provision.we enforce the order.
telebrands markets a wide variety of products to consumers using advertisements that offer the consumer a vehicle,such as a telephone number,mailing address or internet site,to respond directly to the advertiser it routinely employs a compare and save strategy to select and market products.in other words,telebrands monitors trends in the marketplace and in various advertising channels to identify popular items that it can replicate cost effectively.once it locates such a product,telebrands enters the market as a competitor,offering a comparable item at a lower price.
telebrands employed this strategy when it introduced the ab force,an electronic muscle stimulation ems abdominal belt,in december.the ab force consisted of a small control unit held in place by an elastic belt worn around the abdominal area.the control unit cycled an electric current into the abdominal muscles,causing them repeatedly to contract and release involuntarily.when telebrands introduced the ab force,several other ems products,including several abdominal belts,were already on the market.in fact,khubani first considered marketing an ems abdominal belt in early when he noticed the abtronic abdominal belt in greensheet.greensheet is a television industry publication that generates weekly rankings of spots and infomercials based on two sources of information media budget data that it receives from advertisers and its own monitoring of national cable and selected broadcast markets 
according to greensheet,infomercials for three competing ems abdominal belts,abtronic,ab energizer and fast abs,were highly ranked before and during the time that the ab force was being marketed.those infomercials promoted the belts as a method to lose weight,fat and inches,and to gain abdominal muscles,all without the need for exercise.advertisements that aired during that time period for some other ems abdominal belts contained similar claims.
telebrands elected not to make such claims expressly but suggested them implicitly by encouraging comparison to the products that did so.for example,ab force advertisements referenced those fantastic electronic ab belt infomercials on tv.the initial television and radio advertisements for the ab force also described abdominal belts as the latest fitness craze to sweep the country,and the radio advertisement pointed out that the other belts promis e to get our abs into great shape exercise.fit,models were shown using the ab force in the television advertisements some of those models also posed to show off lean physiques,while others performed conventional abdominal exercises.
the ftc issued an administrative complaint alleging that telebrands had made false and misleading claims in violation of sections and of the federal trade commission act ftc act,specifically,the complaint alleged that telebrands had made unsubstantiated claims that the ab force caused loss of weight,inches or fat,caused abdominal muscles,and was an effective alternative to regular exercise.
an administrative law judge alj found that telebrands had made the claims alleged in the complaint and that the claims were material to consumers.furthermore,the parties had stipulated that telebrands neither possessed nor relied on substantiation of the alleged claims,and that,in fact,the use of the ab force did not result in the claimed benefits.therefore,the alj concluded that the claims made by telebrands were false and misleading in violation of the ftc act.
the ftc complaint sought broad relief including a provision requiring telebrands to have substantiation prior to advertising any other ems device,or any food,drug,dietary supplement,device,or any other product,service,or program.however,the alj imposed a narrower provision 
telebrands in connection with the manufacturing,labeling,advertising,promotion,offering for sale,sale,or distribution of ab force,any other ems device,or any device,product,service or program promoting the efficacy of or pertaining to health,weight loss,fitness,or exercise benefits shall not make any representation,in any manner,expressly or by implication,about weight,inch,or fat loss muscle definition exercise benefits or the health benefits,safety,or efficacy of any such product,service,or program,unless,at the time the representation is made,telebrands possess es and rel ies upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.
on appeal,the ftc affirmed the alj conclusion that telebrands had violated the ftc act but entered a final order that included a broader provision 
telebrands in connection with the manufacturing,labeling,advertising,promotion,offering for sale,sale,or distribution of ab force,any other ems device,or any food,drug,dietary supplement,device,or any other product,service or program,shall not make any representation,in any manner,expressly or by implication,about weight,inch,or fat loss,muscle definition,exercise benefits,or the health benefits,safety,performance,or efficacy of any product,service,or program,unless,at the time the representation is made,telebrands possess es and rel ies upon competent and reliable evidence,which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence,that substantiates the representation.
emphasis added.
telebrands appeals this provision,which it refers to as an all claims,all products provision and the ftc refers to as comprehensive coverage.telebrands requests that we modify the ftc final order to replace the challenged provision with the more narrow provision imposed by the alj or remand to the ftc for the purpose of determining the appropriate scope of the provision in light of our opinion.significantly,telebrands does not appeal the ftc conclusion that telebrands violated sections and of the ftc act.
telebrands argues that the ftc lacked authority to issue the broader provision because no reasonable relation exists between that provision and telebrands violation of sections and.specifically,it argues that substantial evidence does not support two ftc findings relied upon as a foundation for the provision telebrands intended to make false advertising claims and telebrands conduct in making implied claims in the marketing of the ab force is transferable to other product advertising.it also argues that the ftc erred as a matter of law in finding that telebrands entry into three prior consent orders for unrelated alleged violations on unrelated products,and with no admission of liability,constitutes a history of prior violations that supports the imposition of the broad language.
congress has empowered and directed the ftc to prevent the use of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a.in line with that directive,congress has given the ftc primary responsibility for devising orders to address those deceptive practices,and the ftc has broad discretion in doing so.ftc,d.the ftc factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.el moro cigar ftc,cir.moreover,courts will interfere with the remedy selected by the ftc only where there is no reasonable relation between the remedy and the violation.atlantic ref.ftc,d.
the ftc considers three factors in determining whether order coverage bears a reasonable relationship to the violation it is intended to remedy the seriousness and deliberateness of the violation the ease with which the violative claim may be transferred to other products and whether the respondent has a history of prior violations.stouffer foods.in reviewing ftc orders for the existence of a reasonable relationship between the remedy and the violation,courts have relied on these same factors.see,sears,roebuck ftc,cir see also,kraft,ftc,cir ftc,cir.we do likewise 
the reasonable relationship analysis operates on a sliding one factor importance varies depending on the extent to which the others are found.in other words,the more serious a violation,the less important transferability and prior hist
