pickering first argues that the bia decision fails as a matter of law.however,a review of that decision and the applicable case law reveals that the bia correctly interpreted the law by holding that,when a court vacates an alien conviction for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or to avoid adverse immigration hardships,rather than on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes.matter of pickering,i n,bia.this interpretation of the law is consistent with that of other circuits and with our own interpretation.a conviction vacated for rehabilitative or immigration reasons remains valid for immigration purposes,while one vacated because of procedural or substantive infirmities does not see zaitona ins,cir see also ins,cir ins,cir sandoval ins,cir but compare ins,cir holding that all convictions remain valid for immigration purposes with discipio ashcroft,cir following precedent in,while criticizing it as overbroad.
the bia upheld the immigration judge order that petitioner was removable based on the quashed drug conviction,ruling that the canadian court had quashed the petitioner drug conviction solely for immigration purposes,in other words,to avoid adverse immigration consequences.matter of pickering,i n at,at.in determining that the petitioner conviction remained valid for immigration purposes,despite the order of the canadian court quashing the conviction,the bia relied on the law under which the canadian court issued its order and the terms of the order itself,as well as the reasons presented by the respondent in requesting that the court vacate the conviction.id.
however,the record used by the bia to determine that the canadian court acted solely for immigration purposes appears to be incomplete.the bia based its ruling on the fact that the judgment only refers,as the grounds for ordering the conviction quashed,to the respondent request and his supporting affidavit.id.in fact,the canadian court,in quashing the petitioner conviction,relied on the notice of appeal filed herein and the affidavit of the petitioner and the hearing at.there is nothing in the record before us regarding the hearing that the canadian court relied upon,in part,to quash the conviction.
the petitioner,in his notice of appeal and affidavit,stated that he was appealing his conviction because of the bar it placed on his permanent immigration to the united states.at.the bia imparted the petitioner motivation for seeking to have the conviction quashed onto the canadian court as its rationale for quashing the conviction.matter of pickering,i n at,at.however,the motive of the petitioner in seeking to have his conviction quashed is of limited relevance to our inquiry.see sandoval ins,cir.such motive is relevant only to the extent that the canadian court relied upon it in quashing the conviction.as the record before us does not include a record of the hearing and is,therefore,incomplete,it is impossible to tell the extent to which the canadian court relied upon petitioner motive,or even why the canadian court acted in the manner it did.
the government relies on this court ruling in zaitona,at,to support the proposition that where the record,as here,provides a reasonable basis to conclude that a motion to quash or vacate a conviction is driven by immigration hardships and not by remedying statutory or constitutional violations,a conviction remains a conviction for immigration purposes.final brief of respondent at.zaitona,however,is easily distinguishable on the facts.
in zaitona,the only explanation offered by the state court for vacating the conviction was so that it might consider a judicial recommendation against deportation jrad.zaitona,at.immediately following the vacation of his conviction,zaitona pleaded guilty to the identical crime.the only difference between the first and second sentence was the jrad.id.in zaitona,i t was unimportant to the court determination that zaitona attorney may have originally surrounded his request for the jrad with language of ineffective assistance of counsel,because it was apparent from the order of the court and the record that the conviction was vacated solely for immigration reasons.id.unlike zaitona,in the instant case,the order of the canadian court is silent on the question of its motivation,referring instead to the petitioner request,supporting affidavit and hearing.matter of pickering,i n at,at.in zaitona,the record provided more than a reasonable basis for concluding that the judgment was vacated for immigration reasons.indeed,the record clearly revealed substantial evidence that the court action was taken for the sole purpose of relieving zaitona from deportation.zaitona,at.here,the record before us lacks the record of the hearing upon which the canadian judge relied,at least in part,in quashing the conviction.
as the order of the canadian court is silent on the question of its motivation or rationale,the bia looked to the notice of appeal and affidavit filed by the petitioner,ruling that neither identified a basis to question the integrity of the underlying criminal proceeding or conviction.there is no reference to the hearing before the canadian court,no indication that the bia had that record in its possession and no indication that it reviewed it in any fashion to determine the rationale behi
