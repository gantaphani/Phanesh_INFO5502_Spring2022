gary yeschick brought suit against norman mineta,the former secretary of the united states department of transportation who oversees operations of the federal aviation administration faa or agency,alleging that the faa failed to rehire him due to his age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,adea or act.pursuant to,an applicant for federal employment claiming discrimination under the adea must consult the agency equal employment opportunity eeo counselor within days of the alleged discriminatory act.the district court,granting summary judgment in favor of the faa,found that because the faa labeled yeschick application as inactive in,and because yeschick did not contact the eeo counselor until,yeschick failed to meet this administrative requirement.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether yeschick was an active applicant when he contacted the eeo counselor in,and we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
yeschick was employed by the faa as an air traffic control specialist hereinafter,controller between and at the cleveland air route traffic control center hereinafter,cleveland control center.in,president reagan terminated yeschick along with fellow members of the professional air traffic controllers organization patco after they refused to return to work during a labor strike.twelve years later,in,president clinton,by executive order,lifted the ban imposed by president reagan on these employees,thereby allowing the former patco members who had participated in the strike to apply for with the faa.the faa issued a recruitment notice for reinstatement and transfer eligible applicants who were separated from the faa as result of the patco job action of.joint appendix ja.interested applicants were directed to submit the appropriate forms within a day application window,september,to october.yeschick timely submitted an application,dated october,noting cleveland as his geographical preference for employment.he was years of age at that time.
thereafter,the faa human resources office,located in oklahoma city,compiled an inventory of the approximately applications submitted by former patco members.when an faa facility had vacancies and the authority to hire,a regional office could request applicants from this list,as well as from other applicant pools,who had noted the corresponding geographic preference.
there was a hiring freeze affecting all applicants seeking employment as controllers in the great lakes region from to.in march and january,after the freeze terminated and hiring of controllers was reopened,the faa human resources office provided the great lakes regional office with lists of former patco applicants interested in positions at the cleveland control center.the referral lists contained names and applications in and names and applications in.the cleveland control center selected four former patco controllers for rehire from the list and nine from the list.yeschick appeared on both lists,but he was not selected for employment.after,the cleveland control center continued to hire individuals for controller positions,but selected no former patco applicants.further,the faa human resources office did not issue any patco referral list to the cleveland control center after the individuals hired were selected from other applicant pools.
after filing his application for in,yeschick had no further contact with the faa regarding the status of his application.despite moving twice after applying,once in and again in,he did not notify the faa of his change of address on either occasion.on june,the faa sent yeschick a letter to inform him of possible contract employment opportunities.the letter was returned to the faa marked return to order expired.in,the faa reviewed the patco inventory to reduce the size of the referral lists by eliminating those applicants where evidence indicated that current contact information for the applicant was not available.ja.because the faa lacked yeschick current address,it determined yeschick application to be inactive.
on september,another former patco controller informed yeschick that the cleveland control center had hired applicants as controllers who were younger and less qualified than yeschick.because yeschick believed that he was as qualified,if not more qualified,than the younger applicants,and because yeschick claims that he had no reason to believe that he may have been discriminated against because of his age prior to this conversation on september,he contacted an eeo counselor on october,to report the faa alleged discriminatory hiring practices.he subsequently filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging age discrimination in violation of the adea.
notably,in the days preceding yeschick contact with the eeo counselor,the faa hired several younger individuals to fill controller positions in the cleveland control center three were hired on september,two at age and one at age two were hired on september,both at age.
on march,the eeoc dismissed yeschick complaint for failure to initiate contact with an eeo counselor within days of the alleged discriminatory event,as required under a.on appeal,the eeoc affirmed.yeschick timely brought the instant action in federal district court,claiming that the faa violated the adea when it refused to employ him because of his age and because it generally followed a practice of refusing to hire as controllers persons who were forty years of age or older.the district court first granted the faa motion to bifurcate discovery in order to resolve the standing and exhaustion issues raised by the faa in a prior unsuccessful motion to dismiss.the district court then granted the faa subsequent motion for summary judgment concluding that although yeschick had standing to sue,he ceased to have a valid,active application with the faa as of.yeschick mineta,cv,wl at.thus,the court reasoned,at the very latest,the day clock would have started ticking when the faa decided yeschick was no longer a valid candidate for employment back in.id.because yeschick did not contact the eeo counselor until,the district court concluded that he failed timely to exhaust his administrative remedies in accordance with a.the district court went on to hold that because yeschick was not a valid applicant,he also could not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.
yeschick timely appealed to this court.he argues that the district court erred in concluding that yeschick was not an applicant in and that he,therefore,did not timely contact the eeo counselor the district court abused its discretion when it determined that yeschick failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination when the court previously limited discovery to issues of standing and exhaustion of administrative remedies and regardless of the limited discovery,yeschick has established a prima facie case of discrimination.
