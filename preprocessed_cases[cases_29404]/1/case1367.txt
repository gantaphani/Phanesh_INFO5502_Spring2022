qingyun li,the petitioner in this case,seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia remanding her case to the immigration judge ij.the government urges us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.as discussed below,we conclude that this court has jurisdiction over the petition,but nonetheless decline to exercise that jurisdiction for prudential reasons.accordingly,we dismiss the petition without prejudice to li right to seek review at a later time.
li,a native and citizen of the republic of china,illegally entered the united states in august.she subsequently applied for adjustment of status based on an approved i visa petition filed by her employer.after proceedings not relevant to this appeal,the department of homeland security dhs denied her application,and on july,the dhs served her with a notice to appear.the notice charged li with removability as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.before the ij,li conceded that she was removable as charged and renewed her application for adjustment of status.on april,the ij found li removable as charged,denied her application for adjustment of status,and granted her the privilege of voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to china.
on october,the bia upheld the denial of li application for adjustment of status and dismissed her appeal from the ij decision finding that the ij failed to provide li with the required advisals,however,the bia remanded for the immigration judge to grant a new period of voluntary departure and to provide the required advisals.the bia opinion concluded by stating that the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.li filed a timely petition for review with this court.
the government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over li petition,an argument that we squarely reject based on prior precedent that is binding on our panel and undisturbed by any intervening supreme court decision.however,following the approach employed by the first and sixth circuits in similar circumstances,we nonetheless dismiss the petition without prejudice for prudential reasons.
this court reviews legal questions,such as the existence of its own jurisdiction,de novo.kporlor holder,cir.in this case,the government asks us to hold that we lack jurisdiction over a bia order remanding for a grant of voluntary departure because it is not a final order of removal.two prior decisions of this court,however,have held that bia orders substantially identical to the instant one are final and immediately appealable.
first,in saldarriaga gonzales,cir,the government argued that there was no final order of removal under c where the bia ordered removal,but remanded to the ij to allow the petitioner an opportunity to apply for voluntary departure.id.at.the court rejected this argument and found the order immediately appealable,citing to decisions of the eleventh,ninth and sixth circuits with persuasive reasoning on the issue.see also del pilar united states attorney general,cir an order of removal was a final appealable order,despite the fact that the bia was remanding to the immigration judge for the limited purpose of permitting del pilar to designate a country of removal castrejon garcia ins,cir bia order reversing an ij grant of suspension of deportation and remanding the case for a determination of voluntary departure in lieu of deportation was a final order of deportation perkovic ins,cir bia order reversing an ij grant of asylum and remanding the case was a final order of deportation.
similarly,in perez vargas gonzales,cir,the court relied on saldarriaga in holding that a bia order denying relief from removal but remanding the case to the ij to determine an alien eligibility for voluntary departure is a final order of removal conferring jurisdiction.id.at.
this court prior decisions in saldarriaga and perez vargas are binding on this panel.united states collins,cir a decision of a panel of this court becomes the law of the circuit and is binding on other panels.those decisions plainly address the jurisdictional issue here,and compel the conclusion that we have jurisdiction over li petition.
the government,however,urges this court to reconsider its holdings in saldarriaga and perez vargas in light of intervening legal developments,specifically,the supreme court decision in dada mukasey,d and the promulgation of a prior panel decision may be overruled by a superseding contrary decision of the supreme court.collins,at citing etheridge norfolk ry,cir.in etheridge,this court determined that a subsequent supreme court decision specifically rejected the reasoning on which the prior decision was based and thus,the prior decision was no longer controlling.at.
the question here,then,is whether dada specifically rejected the reasoning on which the prior panel decisions were based which,in turn,were based on the authority.although the rationale of dada,as well as the new regulation,may impact this case ultimate disposition,dada did not specifically reject the reasoning,see etheridge,at,on which saldarriaga and perez vargas were based,either expressly or implicitly.
in dada,the supreme court discussed the nature of a voluntary departure arrangement between an alien and the government,describing it as an exchange of benefits,much like a settlement agreement.in return for anticipated benefits,including the possibility of readmission,an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she has the means to depart the united states and intends to do so promptly.id.at.citing b.
the alien in dada made a voluntary departure arrangement,and then two days before the expiration of the departure period,sought to withdraw his request for voluntary departure and filed a motion to removal proceedings based on new and material evidence.at.the bia denied the motion to reopen on the ground that petitioner had overstayed his voluntary departure period.relying on d,the bia concluded that an alien who fails to voluntarily depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from applying for and receiving certain forms of discretionary relief,including adjustment of status.id.at.it did not rule on petitioner motion to withdraw the voluntary departure request.
the supreme court disagreed with the bia conclusion.instead,the court held that the proper way to protect both the exchange of benefits that voluntary departure constitutes and the alien statutory right to file a motion to reopen is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period.pursuant to this approach,an alien may agree to voluntary departure,but unilaterally withdraw the request before expiration of the departure period and pursue instead a motion to reopen.id.at.if the alien pursues such a motion,he gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the ij alternate order of removal.id.at.the court also noted that this is the approach taken in the regulation relied upon by the government in the instant case.see id.at.
the new regulation,moreover,requires as a condition to being granted voluntary departure prior to completion of removal proceedings,that the petitioner waive appeal of all issues.b i d.the regulation also dictates that the filing of a petition for review or any other judicial challenge to the administratively final order results in the automatic termination of the grant of voluntary departure and that the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect.i.as noted,the regulation is applicable to li.see supra at.
in determining whether dada effectively overruled saldarriaga and perez vargas,it is of course significant that dada did not address the jurisdictional issue here.indeed,dada was not tasked with deciding any jurisdictional question,and thus clearly did not explicitly overrule the jurisdictional holdings of saldarriaga and perez vargas.nor did dada reject the reasoning for the jurisdictional holdings of those cases.the assertion of jurisdiction in this court prior precedent and the three cases on which this court relied is based on
