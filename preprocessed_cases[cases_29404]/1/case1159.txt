the board affirmed the holding of the alj that trafford was the alter ego of liberty,and that as a result trafford was bound by the collective bargaining agreements in place between liberty and the unions.trafford petitions for review,arguing that the decision by the board lacked substantial evidence and contained an error of law with regard to the application of the alter ego test.having reviewed both challenges and found them unavailing,we will affirm the decision of the board.
factual and procedural history 
factual history 
liberty was formed by joseph wortley in.it at one time employed people,had sales in excess of million,and was the printer in the pittsburgh region.liberty had other divisions in addition to its printing division.it offered digital services,including web design and production,in addition to software development.a small part of its business was also devoted to warehousing the operation.customers such as heinz shipped materials to be held at liberty warehouse and liberty shipped them out as orders and invoices were received.roughly of liberty business was devoted to printing or services of the business was devoted to warehousing.approximately of the people who worked at liberty at its inception worked in the warehouse operation.app.
the employees were represented by two unions,the federation and the iue.the salaried employees were represented by the federation the iue represented the hourly workforce.beginning in,liberty began experiencing financial difficulties.it was unable to repay its debt and eventually its principal lender,independence community bank bank,filed a complaint in mortgage foreclosure seeking over million from liberty.liberty ultimately surrendered all of its assets to the bank on september.
the next day,september,the managers at liberty were notified by liberty president richard carmody that the assets had been surrendered,and that liberty was to halt all operations and send the employees home.the unions did not receive advance notice that liberty was going to terminate employees and cease operations.nor were the unions given the opportunity to negotiate over those actions or their effects.meanwhile,the cfo of liberty,patrick manderfield,advised the bank that liberty value as a going concern was greater than its liquidation value,hoping that the bank would continue operating liberty.the bank declined to do so and chose to liquidate the company.most of liberty assets were auctioned off.
after the surrender of assets,the printing and business quickly disappeared.however,heinz inquired whether liberty could keep its inventory at the trafford,pa facility and resume the fulfillment services there.joseph wortley notified liberty former management staff that if they could create a viable business comprised solely of services,he would sell it to them for.the staff declined.but they agreed to formulate a business plan for operating a business.sometime later,barbara wortley,wife of joseph wortley,agreed to back the endeavor with a equity investment.she later extended a loan to the new entity,trafford.
trafford,needing equipment,relied on an appraiser graphtek,to assess the value of the items in the hands of the bank that were located at the trafford,pa site.trafford ultimately paid the bank for rack shelving,hand trucks,cabinets,office chairs,desks,pictures,and computer equipment.app.the trafford facility resumed operations on september,before trafford itself was even incorporated.app.three of liberty four managers constituted the management at trafford.ten of the twelve trafford employees were previously employed by liberty.nearly all of trafford initial customers were former liberty customers.liberty customers did not become customers of trafford.trafford also began a new service leasing out portions of its facility to agx international.trafford leasing service accounted for less than one percent of trafford business.app.
shortly after trafford was created,former liberty employees leonard manganello former manager of the plant and pat manderfield former cfo began hiring trafford employees.the employees were selected without regard to the seniority provisions in liberty contracts with the unions.trafford established new wage rates,benefit levels,and other conditions of employment.the unions demanded that trafford abide by the duties set forth in the collective bargaining agreements to which liberty was a party.trafford refused and the unions filed charges against liberty and trafford alleging violations of sections a and a of the nlra.specifically,the unions claimed that liberty and trafford were alter egos and that they violated the nlra by failing to bargain before ceasing operations,terminating the employment of individuals without bargaining,and setting new wages and terms and conditions of employment for recalled workers.
at the time of the alj proceeding,trafford had a total of twelve employees.ten were and two were.ten of the twelve were previously employed by liberty.app.liberty never officially dissolved,nor did it file for bankruptcy.app.
procedural history 
the alj heard evidence in the case on july and july.he issued his decision in november.after describing the factual history,he noted the principle that employers may not avoid their duties under their employment contracts by forming what appears to be a new company but is in fact a disguised continuance or alter ego of the old company.app.quoting cartage.the alj then described the crawford door test,see crawford door sales,for finding that two companies are alter egos 
in order to decide if two facially independent employers are alter egos,the board considers whether the two entities have substantially identical ownership,management,supervision,business purposes,operation,equipment and premises,and customers.the board also looks to whether the purpose behind the creation of the alleged alter ego was legitimate or whether,instead,its purpose was to evade responsibilities under the act.no single one among these factors is determinative of alter ego status and not all the indicia need be present for the board to conclude that a finding of alter ego status is appropriate.
app.citations and quotations omitted.
the alj proceeded to analyze the workings of liberty and trafford in light of these enumerated factors.
management,supervision,and ownership 
the alj noted that trafford was wholly owned by barbara wortley,wife of joseph wortley,the owner of liberty,and that the circumstances indicated that a true transfer of control did not result from barbara wortley interposition.he noted that joseph wortley was the one who initiated discussions about continuing the operation in some form,and that joseph wortley arranged for a bank to provide special financing to trafford on the basis of yet unrealized accounts receivable.the alj found that the totality of the circumstances confirms that the real control of trafford was with wortley,not his wife.a strong showing of common ownership of liberty and trafford has been made.app.
the alj concluded that the record established that liberty and trafford had substantially identical management and supervision.he noted that three of liberty four managers became the management team at trafford and that their supervisory duties did not change.every one of trafford managers had been a liberty manager on september,the day liberty informed its staff it would cease operations.app.the alj found these facts to constitute a strong showing of substantial identity in management.id.
equipment and customers 
the alj concluded that there was substantial identity of equipment and customers.trafford used the same premises liberty had occupied until september,trafford purchased from the bank the same exact equipment that liberty warehouse had used all of trafford initial customers were liberty customers and of trafford revenues over the first eight months were from companies formerly doing warehousing business with liberty.the alj accordingly found that liberty and trafford shared substantially identical equipment and customers.
motivation 
the alj first noted that a showing of improper motive is not necessary to a finding of alter ego status under a p brush.the alj also considered it implausible that wortley would sacrifice the printing and operations that constituted over percent of liberty business for the purpose of freeing the operation from its labor law responsibilities.app.but the alj did take note of how trafford came into existence.the alj noted that the decision to create trafford as the vehicle for continuing the business could have been motivated by a desire to avoid the obligations of the collective bargaining agreements.
the alj also stated that he had little evidence upon which to base a decision as to the purpose in forming trafford.joseph wortley did not testify,nor did barbara wortley or richard carmody,the president of liberty,and the alj drew an adverse inference from the failure of the wortleys to testify the alj noted what he called the transparent ploy of designating barbara wortley the owner.and he saw evidence of an improper motive in liberty failure to inform the union about the decision to suspend liberty operations and surrender assets,as well as the failure to bargain over the effects of ceasing liberty operations.the alj also pointed to the fact that carmody refused to accept or process labor grievances as the president of liberty after september.these factors led the alj to conclude that a desire to avoid labor law obligations was a motivation for those actions.app.he noted that it might have been just one of several desires of liberty and wortley in continuing trafford,but it was a legally significant desire all the same.app.
business purposes and 
the alj deemed the question of substantially identical business purposes and operations a closer call.it noted that the warehouse business was a small portion of liberty overall portfolio of the total.but the entirety of trafford business consisted of continuing liberty component.additionally,liberty operation remained complete and functioning during the transition from liberty to trafford,without a significant hiatus.app.the record shows that on september,trafford simply took over the same work,on the same orders,for all the same customers that liberty operation had serviced until september.id.
the alj was given pause by the fact that trafford continued only a very small part of liberty overall business,and stated that neither party has identified any decisions where the board has considered whether under such circumstances substantial identity of business purpose and operation exists for purposes of the alter ego analysis.app.but the alj found roughly analogous precedent in cases involving successorship,where it noted that the board found sufficient commonality of ownership where even a small portion of the original company business is transferred to the new enterprise,but a majority of the new enterprise employees are from the predecessor bargaining unit.id.based on that precedent and the facts available,the alj found that trafford and liberty had substantially similar business purposes and operations.
the alj concluded his analysis by stating that on the basis of these factors,he found that trafford and liberty are alter egos.to sum up,the evidence shows that wortley closed the warehouse fulfillment business he owned late on a wednesday,and resumed that warehouse fulfillment business on the following monday as a new enterprise at the same location with the same clients,and essentially the same managers,but without recognizing the unions or applying the existing collective bargaining agreements.app.
in a portion of the alj opinion not appealed by trafford,the alj then found that trafford had violated sections a and a of the nlra.he based his holding on the actions taken by liberty before,during,and after liberty cessation of operations,as well as on the actions taken by trafford in failing to meet the obligations of liberty labor agreements with the unions.
nlrb decision 
in a july,decision by the nlrb board a panel comprised of chairman battista and members liebman and schaumber,the board affirmed the alj ruling.the panel stated that in agreeing with the alj that trafford is an alter ego,chairman battista,and member schaumber find it unnecessary to pass on the judge finding that trafford and liberty source had substantially identical business purposes and operations.app.similarly,the panel stated that in affirming the alj finding as to the purpose behind the creation of trafford,it was not relying on the adverse inference the alj drew from the failure by trafford to call the wortleys to testify.the decision by the panel noted that one of the panel members,chairman battista,adheres to his position that the general counsel must show,inter alia,an intent to avoid legal obligations under the act in order to prove alter ego status.however,recognizing that under extant board law,unlawful motivation is not a necessary element of alter ego finding chairman battista concurs with his colleagues in the finding of alter ego.app.
after affirming that finding and the alj finding that trafford and liberty engaged in unfair labor practices,the board imposed an order designed to remedy the harm caused.this included an obligation to pay terminated employees back pay,reinstate certain employees,and comply with the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.
petition for review 
trafford timely appealed the board decision.trafford challenge to the board decision is confined to the alter ego issue.specifically,trafford claims that the alter ego finding lacked substantial evidence,and that the board committed legal error by failing to consider whether trafford and liberty had substantially identical business purposes.trafford does not attack the findings regarding violations of sections a and a.
in challenging the alter ego finding,trafford argues that the companies are not owned by the same individual that the composition of the trafford management,though it overlaps with the liberty management,performs different jobs that there was no purpose to evade labor law obligations and that m ost importantly,the character and nature of the two businesses is substantially and materially different.petr.br.trafford also argues that the board failed to apply the proper legal standard when it refused to consider whether trafford and liberty had substantially identical business purposes and operations 
jurisdiction 
the board had jurisdiction over the case pursuant to section a of the nlra,a.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the board decision pursuant to sections e and f of the act.e f.
