this decision is final pursuant to i a and.
on march,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey setting forth the background and the history of the consent orders and seeking prevailing party attorneys fees and costs pursuant to the idea.cbe responded,inter alia,that plaintiffs are not prevailing parties under the provisions of the idea.in july,and his parents filed a motion to enforce that part of the alj order of february,requiring cbe to pay,as well as for statutory interest,attorneys fees,and costs incurred in enforcing the order.on october,the district court issued an opinion denying plaintiffs motion for and costs.the case was then reassigned to another district judge on march,and marked closed by the clerk of the court.on june,the district court granted plaintiffs motion to reopen.shortly thereafter,plaintiffs filed their motion for prevailing party attorneys fees.cbe filed a for summary judgment.
the district court granted cbe motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees,holding that although the consent orders entered in favor of plaintiffs did not preclude plaintiff from being a prevailing party,app.at,plaintiffs success was de minimis and they were therefore not entitled to attorneys fees.the district court stated that obtaining an iep,an order for reimbursement of psychological services in the amount of,reinstatement in school,and an evaluation by an independent child study team did not constitute a substantial victory.app.at.in addition,the district court stated that plaintiffs did not prevail beyond the basic requirements of the idea and,and can not be considered a prevailing party because of their failure to achieve any relief on the merits of their claim that materially altered their legal relationship with cbe.thus,an award of attorney s fees is inappropriate.app.at.
plaintiffs appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment to cbe.plaintiffs contend that the consent orders entered by the alj rendered them the prevailing party and that their success was significant.in response,cbe contends that pursuant to the supreme court decision in buckhannon bd.west virginia,d,attorneys fees can not be granted for settlements entered into in the course of administrative proceedings.cbe further contends that even if attorneys fees can be recovered for consent orders entered into pursuant to administrative proceedings,the district court correctly found that plaintiffs had only de minimis success in this case.
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as did the district court.antonelli new jersey,cir.in reviewing the grant of summary judgment,we must view the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.in re flat glass antitrust,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.

a.the buckhannon standard 
under the american rule,parties are typically responsible for their own attorneys fees.see alyeska pipeline service wilderness society,d.as noted above,however,the idea,et,contains a specific provision authorizing an order for such fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.ex rel.orange tp.bd.of,cir citing i b.
in buckhannon bd.west virginia,the supreme court clarified its interpretation of the term prevailing party.at.the court held that in order to be a prevailing party,a party must be successful in the sense that it has been awarded some relief by a court.id.at.the court noted that this concept of success,however,is not inconsistent with a defendant voluntary compliance.the court acknowledged that a party benefiting from a settlement agreement,for example,could be a prevailing party,provided the change in the legal relationship of the parties was in some way judicially sanctioned.id.at.see also john ex rel.paul delaware county intermediate unit,cir.
this court has held that buckhannon applies to the provision of the idea.see john,at holding that buckhannon applies to attorney s fee claims brought under the idea provision.in interpreting buckhannon,we have stated that a stipulated settlement could confer prevailing party status under certain circumstances,john,at emphasis in original namely,where it alters the legal relationship of the parties and is judicially sanctioned.a stipulated settlement is judicially sanctioned where it contains mandatory language is entitled order,bears the signature of the district court judge,not the parties counsel and provides for judicial enforcement.id.citing truesdell phila.hous,cir see also preservation coalition federal transit,cir holding that buckhannon does not limit fee awards to enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees christina bloomberg,cir holding that a settlement was not enforceable by the court absent a new action for breach of contract and therefore plaintiffs were not prevailing parties.
the district court found that the consent decrees at issue here met the requirements set forth in john and truesdell.the district court noted that the consent order entered on february contain ed mandatory language stating that cbe will do certain things,was entitled consent order,bore the signature of the alj,and is enforceable under and in state court.app.at.
cbe contends that to constitute a decree under buckhannon,a court must retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement and have the power to issue a citation for contempt for.it argues that because the alj here did not and could not retain jurisdiction to enforce its consent orders in accordance with kokkonen guardian life ins.of america,d,these orders lacked the judicial imprimatur required by buckhannon to confer prevailing party status.
the supreme court had previously considered whether a court maintains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement when it does no more than so order a stipulation and order of dismissal that dismisses the complaint after settlement without reference to the settlement agreement.id.the court held that there was no jurisdiction,but noted that 
t he situation would be quite different if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal in that event,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order and jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.
id.at.kokkonen suggests settlement of an administrative proceeding is the equivalent of an administrative decree on the merits where,as here,the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement has been made part of the order of dismissal.see ex rel.new york city of,cir.
the court of appeals for the second circuit has convincingly addressed and rejected an argument similar to the one that cbe makes here.in,the parents of disabled children instituted four separate new york state administrative proceedings challenging,under the idea,the special educational programs that the new york city department of education had provided for disabled children.in two of the four proceedings,impartial hearing officers entered decisions for the plaintiffs on the merits.in the two others,impartial hearing officers issued statements of agreement and order that recorded the terms of settlement agreements between the parties.the plaintiffs then sought attorneys fees.the court of appeals held that idea administrative decisions may,in certain circumstances,confer prevailing party status.it noted that although an administrative decision on the merits in an idea case does not have judicial imprimatur,it has administrative imprimatur 
its terms are enforceable,if not by the iho itself then by a court,including through an action under w e conclude that the combination of administrative imprimatur,the change in the legal relationship of the parties arising from it,and subsequent judicial enforceability,render such a winning party a prevailing party under buckhannon principles.
at emphasis in original.
the second circuit specifically rejected the argument made by the board of education there,similar to that made by cbe here,that plaintiffs can not be prevailing parties because the ihos conducting their hearings lacked jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreements under our analysis,the fact that the ihos,as is common in administrative procedures,have no enforcement mechanism is irrelevant,at least so long as judicial enforcement is available.we are persuaded by the analysis in 
cbe argues that because admin.code mandates review of settlements by an alj,the alj signature here does not provide the required judicial imprimatur it simply attests to the fact that the orders were not contrary to law.cbe cites to christina bloomberg,cir,in support of this proposition.in christina,the plaintiffs,inmates at a training school who had challenged the education being provided,obtained a hearing and approval of a settlement pursuant to.e,which requires that t he court must approve any settlement of a certified class.the eighth circuit held that they were not prevailing parties for purposes of fees because this type of agreement is not enforceable by a court absent a separate breach of contract action,and therefore,does not bear the necessary judicial imprimatur.
as is clear from,a settlement of administrative proceedings that is judicially enforceable meets the buckhannon requirements.because the consent orders entered here were enforceable through an action under and under state law,these consent orders,unlike those in christina,satisfy buckhannon.
prevailing party status 
we turn to the basis on which the district court denied plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees its conclusion that plaintiffs can not be considered prevailing part ies because of their failure to achieve any relief on the merits of their claim that materially altered their legal relationship with cbe.app.at.the supreme court has rendered a number of decisions on this issue.in farrar hobby,the court held that a plaintiff prevails when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff,d p laintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for attorney s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.hensley eckerhart,d emphasis added quotation marks and citation omitted.thereafter,the court stated that,to succeed,at a minimum,the plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.
we summarized our review of the applicable legal principles in ridgewood bd.of educ.ex rel,where we held that a resolution materially alters the legal relationship between the parties when it modif ies the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court noted that certain victories may be technical or de minimis but characterized its approach as adopting a generous formulation of prevailing party status.see texas state teachers,at,at.in a later case,the court clarified the distinction that exists between the issue of plaintiff eligibility for an attorney fee award and the amount of the attorney fee that should be awarded.
in farrar,the court first explained the meaning of technical victory by providing the following example 
in texas state teachers,the district court declared unconstitutionally vague a regulation requiring that nonschool hour meetings be conducted only with prior approval from the local school principal.t his finding alone would not sustain prevailing party status if there were no evidence that the plaintiffs were ev
