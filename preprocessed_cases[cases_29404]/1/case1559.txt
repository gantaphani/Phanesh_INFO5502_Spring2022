roseller osicos nolos nolos petitions for review of the board of immigration appeal bia decision to uphold the immigration judge ij order of removal and the bia subsequent denial of his separate motions to reconsider and to reopen.nolos argues that he is not removable because he derives united states citizenship from his parents,who he claims acquired united states citizenship by virtue of their births in the philippine islands philippines while the country was a united states territory,and the nevada theft conviction that forms the basis of the removal order does not qualify as an aggravated felony under a g.for the following reasons,we deny the petition for review.
nolos was admitted to the united states in as a lawful permanent resident.in,he pleaded guilty to a theft offense pursuant to nevada 
nolos,proceeding pro se,admitted the dhs allegations and conceded his removability.in august,the ij determined that nolos was removable because his nevada conviction constituted an aggravated felony under a g and ordered him removed to the philippines.nolos timely appealed the ij order to the bia.after an initial dismissal and a subsequent grant of nolos motion to reopen in light of newly discovered evidence,the bia determined that not all of the subsections of nevada revised statutes constituted aggravated felonies and that the judgment of record of conviction the government submitted to prove nolos was convicted of a theft not specify which provision of nevada revised statutes nolos was convicted of violating.as a result,it vacated its initial dismissal of nolos appeal and remanded the case to the ij.
on remand,the dhs submitted the nevada information charging nolos with theft under nevada revised statutes.after a review of this additional material,the ij determined that nolos was convicted under b b met the requirements of theft under the immigration and nationality act ina and nolos was removable as an aggravated felon.the bia agreed with the ij determination and dismissed nolos appeal.
nolos filed a timely petition for review and also filed with the bia a timely motion for reconsideration and a motion to reopen,asserting in part that he was a citizen of the united states.after the bia denial of those motions,nolos filed an additional timely petition for review of this bia decision.
although our review of a final order of removal is limited under,gonzales,cir,we have jurisdiction to consider the purely legal questions of whether nolos is a united states citizen and whether he was convicted of an aggravated felony,see gonzales,cir alwan ashcroft,cir.we also have jurisdiction to review the bia denial of nolos motions to reopen and reconsider under b and c.see kucana holder.
while we owe deference to the bia interpretation of the ina under the principles of chevron usa,nrdc,our review of the legal questions posed here is de novo.see patel mukasey,cir,at omari gonzales,cir alwan,at.
the government argues initially that nolos petition should be dismissed in part on the procedural ground that he failed to comply with because he did not present an application for relief and did not raise citizenship as a defense before the ij.the bia decision,however,did not deny nolos motion on the ground of noncompliance with.although the bia noted that nolos could and should have raised this claim during proceedings before the ij and failed to support his claim with any evidence or to attach an application for the relief requested,it went on to consider and reject nolos claim that he was a united states citizen.against this background,we decline the government invitation to dismiss in part nolos petition on the basis of noncompliance with.accord holder,wl cir.
there are two sources of citizenship birth and naturalization.gonzales,cir.nolos asserts that he derives united states citizenship from his parents,who he claims became united states citizens at birth because they were born in the philippines when the country was a united states territory.we have not previously decided this question.however,the second,third and ninth circuits have held that birth in the philippines at a time when the country was a territory of the united states does not constitute birth in the united states under the citizenship clause,and thus did not give rise to united states citizenship.lacap ins,cir valmonte ins,cir rabang ins,cir the courts of appeals explained that the term united states as it is used in the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment did not,without more,include united states territories simply because the territories were subject to the jurisdiction or within the dominion of the united states.id.at see also valmonte,at.in reaching their holdings,the courts found guidance from the supreme court insular cases jurisprudence on the territorial scope of the term the united states as used in the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment.valmonte,at rabang,at.the insular cases were a series of supreme court decisions that dealt with various challenges to duties on shipments from puerto rico to the united states mainland.rabang,at valmonte,at.
in downes bidwell,one of the insular cases,t he court held that puerto rico was not a part of the united states within the revenue clauses of the constitution.id.at.the court reached this conclusion by considering the territorial scope of the term the united states in various clauses of the constitution.valmonte,at rabang,at citing downes,at.the court compared the revenue clause language all duties shall be uniform throughout the united states,united states constitution,art.i,with the thirteenth amendment prohibition of slavery and involuntary servitude within the united states,or any place subject to their jurisdiction,id.amend.xiii,emphasis added,and that of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment providing that persons born or naturalized in the united states,and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside,id.amend.xiv,emphasis added.see downes,at cited in rabang,valmonte,at.the court then concluded that the disjunctive or in the thirteenth amendment showed that there may be places within the jurisdiction of the united states that are no part of the union to which the thirteenth amendment would still apply,while citizenship under the fourteenth amendment is not extended to persons born in any place subject to the united states jurisdiction but instead limited to those born or naturalized in the states of the union.id.see rabang,at discussing downes,at valmonte,at discussing downes,at.
relying on downes,the rabang and valmonte courts observed that l ike the revenue clauses,the citizenship clause has an express territorial limitation which prevents its extension to every place over which the government exercises its sovereignty.rabang,at citing united states,brennan,dissenting see also valmonte,at.the courts of appeals further noted the court subsequent statement that in dealing with foreign sovereignties,the term united states has a broader meaning than when used in the constitution,and includes all territories subject to the jurisdiction of the federal government,wherever located.rabang,at quoting downes,at valmonte,at citing downes,at.they observed that i n other words,as used in the constitution,the term united states does not include all territories subject to the jurisdiction of the united states government.rabang,at citing as see also examining bd.of eng rs,architects and surveyors flores de otero,

against this background,the rabang,lacap and valmonte courts held that i t is incorrect to extend citizenship to persons living in united states territories simply because the territories are subject to the jurisdiction or within the dominion of the united states,because those persons are not born in the united states within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment.valmonte,at citing rabang,at rabang,at lacap,at citing rabang,at valmonte,
