kamal patel,a permanent resident alien and federal inmate,appeals the dismissal of his action under a for a judgment declaring him a united states national.patel alleges that he is a united states national because he applied for citizenship,registered for the selective service,and declared his permanent allegiance to various united states officials.because we hold that these facts fail to allege united states nationality under a,we affirm the dismissal.
we set forth the facts as alleged in patel amended complaint.patel is a federal inmate who has resided in the united states since the age of eleven and has been a permanent resident for almost years.he registered for the selective service at eighteen.he has sworn an oath of allegiance to the united states and submitted evidence of his oath to an immigration judge,the president of the united states,the secretary of state,and the attorney general.nearly every member of his family is a united states citizen or permanent resident.patel applied for citizenship,but he does not claim to have completed the naturalization process.removal proceedings have not been initiated against him.
because the federal bureau of prisons classifies patel as an alien,he is ineligible for a number of prison rehabilitation programs,including prerelease classes and community confinement.in an effort to become eligible for those programs,he brought this action seeking to be declared a united states national under a against the secretary of homeland security,the director of the united states citizenship and immigration services,the attorney general of the united states,and the director of the federal bureau of prisons.
the district court dismissed patel complaint under b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.rather than addressing patel a claim,the court misconstrued the complaint to assert a habeas claim under and a claim under bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d.the court reasoned that these claims failed as a matter of law because inmates do not have a constitutional right to participate in rehabilitative programs.patel timely appealed.
although the district court failed to address patel a claim,we examine the record de novo to determine whether he states a claim.see brown dep t of,cir.
section a,a provision of the immigration and nationality act ina,provides that any person within the united states who claims a right or privilege as a national of the united states and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency upon the ground that he is not a national of the united states,may bring an action against the relevant department or agency head for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the united states.a.an action may not be brought if the person status as a national became an issue by reason of,or in connection with any removal proceeding or is in issue in any such removal proceeding.id.
because a does not specify when a person should be declared a national of the united states,we look to the nationality provisions of the ina for guidance.the ina defines the term national of the united states as a a citizen of the united states,or b a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.id.a.the ina goes on to specify the means by which united states nationality may be acquired,which are limited to birth and naturalization.id.nationality at birth and collective naturalization,nationality through naturalization.persons born in the united states,or,under certain circumstances,abroad to united states citizen parents,are nationals and citizens of the united states at birth.id.persons born in an outlying possession of the united states american samoa or swains island,or abroad to national parents,are nationals,but not citizens,of the united states at birth.see id,a.for those not born united states nationals,the only means provided by the ina for acquiring united states nationality is naturalization.see id.
patel does not claim to have acquired united states nationality through birth or naturalization.rather,he argues that he qualifies as a united states national under the definition provided in a b,as interpreted by this court in united states morin,cir.in morin,we held that a permanent resident alien who had applied for citizenship was a united states national under a,which was by a criminal statute.at.without addressing whether the alien satisfied any of the statutory procedures for acquiring united states nationality,we simply reasoned 
a national of the united states may be a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.a.the district court found that because soto was a permanent resident alien of the united states who had applied for united states citizenship,he was indeed a national of the united states.we agree an application for citizenship is the most compelling evidence of permanent allegiance to the united states short of citizenship itself.
patel argues that he qualifies as a united states national under morin because he has demonstrated his allegiance to the united states by applying for citizenship,registering for the selective service,and providing evidence of his oath of allegiance to united states government officials.although we agree with patel that he would state a claim under morin interpretation of a b,for the reasons explained below,we conclude that morin interpretation does not control over the contrary,interpretation of the statute by the board of immigration appeals bia.
as a threshold matter,we emphasize that the statutory provision at issue a is a provision of the ina.the ina provides that t he secretary of homeland security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of the statute and that the determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.a.under the supreme court decision in chevron,natural res.def.council,d,when congress delegates authority to the executive department to administer a statute,the executive department interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions is entitled to controlling weight,unless that interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.at.thus,because the bia possesses delegated authority from the attorney general to administer the ina,the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms in the ina concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.aguirre aguirre,d citing ins cardoza fonseca,d.
the bia,for its part,has long rejected the interpretation of a that we advanced in morin.see matter of tuitasi,bia holding that a b does not confer nationality on aliens who claim only to owe permanent allegiance to the united states.the bia reaffirmed this position in in re navas acosta,bia,which was decided after morin.drawing on the historical meaning of the word national and the statutory framework of the ina,the bia concluded that a does not provide a method for acquiring united states nationality rather,nationality under the act may be acquired only through birth or naturalization.navas acosta,at.referencing the specific language of a b,the bia explained that whether one owes permanent allegiance to the united states is not simply a matter of individual choice.instead,it reflects a legal relationship between an individual and a sovereign.id.at internal citation omitted.that relationship may not be created through unilateral declarations of allegiance,but rather,may only arise in compliance with the conditions set by congress.id.at.
in morin,we did not so much as mention the bia interpretation of a,much less decide the level of deference it should command.in a subsequent decision,however,we clarified that the bia interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.see fernandez keisler,cir.fernandez was a removal case in which the petitioner,a permanent resident alien,claimed to be a united states national under morin because he had applied for citizenship,while the bia argued that he was an alien subject to removal because he had not completed the naturaliza
