facts and proceedings below 
carlos pacheco is an air traffic controller specialist with the federal aviation administration faa in corpus christi,texas.in december,the corpus christi air tower announced a vacancy.pacheco applied,but was ultimately passed over for promotion by a applicant.
air traffic employees who have bid on a vacancy are subject to a two step selection process.in the first step,a human resources personnel specialist from the federal aviation administration faa human resource management division hrmd determines which of the candidates is qualified for the position,and submits the names of the qualified candidates to the selecting official,which in this case was the corpus christi facility manager,warren meehan.in this case,hrmd forwarded seven names,including pacheco,to meehan.in the second step,the selecting official chooses among the candidates referred to him or her by hrmd.
warren meehan had recently implemented a promotion system based,not on years of experience,but on specified employee attributes,such as initiative,loyalty and integrity.the idea for this system came to him while at a manager conference,at which the faa regional manager had described the employee attributes that he deemed important in future faa leaders.upon his return from the conference,meehan decided that all future promotions at corpus christi would consider these factors.
meehan new system was used for the first time in february,for the operations supervisor december vacancy at the corpus christi air tower,the promotion that is the subject of pacheco suit the supervisors of all seven employee candidates whose names had been forwarded by hrmd were interviewed and asked to rate their supervisee,on a scale of one to ten,in each of these attributes.the supervisor interviews were conducted by a panel,which included a hispanic faa employee from outside the facility.after the interview results were compiled,the panel reported them to warren meehan,who made the final employment decision.pacheco,who was ranked sixth out the seven employees,was notified on february,that he did not get the promotion.
pacheco timely contacted an equal opportunity counselor,alleging that he was passed over for promotion on the basis of his race unsatisfied with the counselor advice,pacheco timely filed a formal administrative complaint on april,with the equal opportunity office eeo of his employer,the department of transportation dot on june,the dot office of civil rights notified pacheco by mail that it was accepting the following claim for investigation whether the faa treated you differently,based on your national origin hispanic,when you were not selected for a supervisor job on february.the letter notified pacheco that if he objected to the way his claim was stated,he should contact the office within five days.pacheco did not respond.
unsatisfied with the eeo resolution of his complaint,pacheco filed this suit in the court below on november,against norman mineta,secretary of the dot,pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,section c pacheco suit alleges both discrimination and discrimination the district court entered summary judgment against pacheco on his claim,and dismissed pacheco claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b.the court held that pacheco had failed to exhaust his administrative remedy before the eeo with respect to his claim.pacheco does not appeal the summary judgment dismissal of his claim.his only issue before this court is whether he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his claim.
despite the dot summary judgment victory,the district court,without explanation,ordered that each party bear its own costs pursuant to rule d.d.the dot filed a motion for a new trial and to amend judgment on the ground that the court erred in denying an award of costs to the prevailing party without any explanation.the district court then ruled that the losing party brought this action in good faith and accordingly denied the dot motion.the dot has on the issue of costs.
discussion 
exhaustion of the claim 
pacheco appeals the district court rule b dismissal of his claim,arguing that he did,in fact,exhaust his administrative remedies before the eeo.because we find that the scope of pacheco administrative charge is too narrow to have exhausted a claim for discrimination,we affirm.
disparate impact versus disparate treatment 
title vii creates a federal cause of action for two largely separate theories of discrimination,disparate treatment and disparate impact.international brotherhood of teamsters united states,d.discrimination addresses employment actions that treat an employee worse than others based on the employee race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.in such cases,proof and finding of discriminatory motive is required.id.
discrimination,on the other hand,addresses employment practices or policies that are facially neutral in their treatment of these protected groups,but,in fact,have a disproportionately adverse effect on such a protected group.hebert monsanto,cir.in cases,proof or finding of discriminatory motive is not required.id.the defendant,however,can rebut a prima facie showing of disparate impact by proving that the challenged policy is a business necessity.griggs duke power,d.
b.the exhaustion requirement 
section of the civil rights act of,c,permits most federal employees to seek relief from proscribed discriminatory employment practices in federal district court.as a precondition to seeking this judicial relief,however,complaining employees must exhaust their administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the eeo division of their agency brown general servs,d martinez dep of army,cir.we review de novo a district court determination of whether the exhaustion requirement is satisfied martinez,at randel dep of navy,cir.
the scope of the exhaustion requirement has been defined in light of two competing title vii policies that it furthers.on the one hand,because the provisions of title vii were not designed for the sophisticated,and because most complaints are initiated pro se,the scope of an eeoc complaint should be construed liberally.sanchez standard brands,cir fellows universal restaurants,cir on the other hand,a primary purpose of title vii is to trigger the investigatory and conciliatory procedures of the eeoc,in attempt to achieve resolution of employment discrimination claims.id.at.indeed,a less exacting rule would also circumvent the statutory scheme,since title vii clearly contemplates that no issue will be the subject of a civil action until the eeoc has first had the opportunity to attempt to obtain voluntary compliance.sanchez,at.see also ong cleland,cir a llowing a federal court complaint to proceed despite its loose fit with the administrative charge and investigation is precluded if it would circumvent agency efforts to secure voluntary compliance before a civil action is instituted.with that balance in mind,this court interprets what is properly embraced in review of a claim somewhat broadly,not solely by the scope of the administrative charge itself,but by the scope of the eeoc investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.sanchez,at.we engage in analysis of the statement given by the plaintiff in the administrative charge,and look slightly beyond its four corners,to its substance rather than its label.fellows,at fine gaf chemical,cir ong,at 
so,for example,in fellows,this court held that an entire class of plaintiffs had exhausted their administrative remedies,even though the administrative charge complained only of individual discrimination.fellows,at.see also sanchez,same.later,in gamble birmingham southern railroad,this court held that black railroad workers who had filed an administrative charge complaining of discrimination in promotions to conductor had also exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to claims of discrimination in promotions to higher supervisory positions.cir.
on the other hand,in fine gaf chemical,this court held that a plaintiff administrative remedies were not exhausted with respect to an incident of sexual discrimination because the incident sued upon was separate from the one raised in her administrative charge,cir.and,in young city of houston,this court held that a sex discrimination claim had not been exhausted by the plaintiff charge of race and age discrimination.cir.
this court has not faced a question on appeal like pacheco whether a claim was exhausted by the plaintiff administrative charge thus,we have yet to consider what facts in an administrative charge might be reasonably expected to trigger an eeo investigation.however,other circuits,as well as some federal district courts,have addressed the question.
for example,in grace bank of america,judge fitzwater ruled that a plaintiff who filed an administrative charge of a firing did not exhaust her claim.grace bank of america,no.civ,wl.in grace,the plaintiff had filed an administrative charge asserting that the bank discriminated against her by terminating her employment.in dismissing the plaintiff claim,the court explained that a claim for disparate impact is not like or related to the plaintiff eeoc charge nor could it reasonably be expected to grow out of it.id.
judge cote in the southern district of new york issued a similar ruling in woodman,holding that the plaintiff administrative charge could be reasonably expected to lead only to an investigation of disparate treatment,not disparate impact.woodman,d.in that case,the plaintiff had filed an charge with the eeo alleging that 
a ll of my nine colleagues at who were fired,except two,were over the age of.on the other hand,my counterpart in los angeles,who is much younger,was not fired.it seems,therefore,that age was a motivating factor in my employment termination.
woodman,d at.the court held that it was not enough for the plaintiff to have alleged that other colleagues were affected because she had failed to identify a specific,facially neutral employment practice.id.furthermore,the court reasoned that the plaintiff administrative charge had complained of intentional age discrimination,a crucial element in a claim that is unnecessary in a claim.id.
in gomes avco,the second circuit held that the plaintiff administrative charge had exhausted both a claim for and discrimination,cir.there,plaintiff administrative charge stated he was passed over for promotion because of his portuguese ancestry.he alleged that he applied for a promotion such promotions are governed by an experience rule he arguably met this experience requirement the promotion was given to someone less qualified and he was the only portuguese employee in his job classification.
the court held that t o be sure,this complaint most naturally supports a claim of intentional discrimination nonetheless,once the eeoc investigated the case and found that the plaintiff did not satisfy the eight year rule,it would have been perfectly natural for the eeoc to question the necessity of the eight year rule itself.id.at.the court reasoned that the plaintiff allegation that he was the only portuguese employee in his job classification would reasonably lead the eeoc to consider disparate impact.id.furthermore,the allegation that people were promoted ahead of him might lead the eeoc to question the business justification for such a rule.id.but most importantly,unlike grace or woodman,the plaintiff in gomes had identified a facially neutral employment policy the rule that provided a foundation for an eeo investigation.the court recognized that the rule would have put the eeo on notice of a possible claim,thus an investigation of the plaintiff disparate impact claim would reasonably have flowed from an investigation of his disparate treatment claim.id.at.
pacheco administrative charge 
pacheco administrative charge see note,supra lists three incidents of discrimination 
the february,incident was for a supervisor job opening at this facility.once again,the good old boy was selected even though i was more qualified having been in the agency since.this being my seventh facility my third level facility.
the incident before this occurred the summer of when i had a bid at orlando in the southern region.i was told by the chief that the southern region does pick out of region.three months later a white controller from our facility was picked up for atlanta in the southern region.this person had been here two years with the faa.i asked the chief about the aforesaid policy,he had no comment.
an incident before this occurred in,someone defaced a picture of my son on my mail tray no others were touched.i presented the incident to the chief who in turn told me he would write me a formal letter of apology.it must have slipped his mind because i have yet to receive it.
only the first incident was accepted for investigation by the eeoc.the second and third were rejected as these two incidents which are not the subject of the instant suit are relevant only to the extent that they provide context to the first.
in reviewing the first incident,the question is whether a investigation might reasonably be expected to grow out of the facts that pacheco did allege.in deciding this question,a review of the prima facie case for disparate impact is relevant.a plaintiff must show a facially neutral policy that,in fact,has a disproportionately adverse effect on a protected class.hebert,at.furthermore,proof of discriminatory motive is not required for claims.id.
on its face,pacheco administrative charge alleges none of the elements of disparate impact.instead,it is facially a claim,like those in grace and woodman,alleging that he was singled out for intentional discrimination because of his race.pacheco complained that he was passed over for promotion in favor of a good old boy.as the district court below noted,this complaint clearly supports claims for unfair and intentional discrimination,but does not even suggest claims under a disparate impact theory.
in particular,we note that pacheco administrative charge fails to identify any neutral employment policy that would form the basis of a claim.see gomes.a neutral employment policy is the cornerstone of any eeo investigation,since the eeo must evaluate both the policy effects on protected classes and any business justifications for the policy.
finally,we note that all three incidents mentioned in pacheco administrative charge are examples of discrimination.the two earlier incidents,where pacheco was allegedly lied to about the southern region hiring policy and allegedly harassed by a who defaced a picture of his son,though time barred,provide a context for understanding pacheco latest allegation.in his administrative charge,pacheco himself links all three incidents,suggesting that they were part of a larger pattern of intentional discrimination against him by the manager of the faa corpus christi facility.
to be clear,we do not require that a plaintiff check a certain box or recite a specific incantation to exhaust his or her administrative remedies before the proper agency.see sanchez,at.nor do we require,for purposes of exhaustion,that a plaintiff allege a prima face case before the eeoc.see id.instead,the plaintiff administrative charge will be read somewhat broadly,in a inquiry into what eeoc investigations it can reasonably be expected to trigger.
in this case,we hold that a investigation could not reasonably have been expected to grow out of pacheco administrative charge because of the following matters taken together it facially alleged disparate treatment it identified no neutral employment policy and it complained of past incidents of disparate treatment only accordingly,we affirm the district court b dismissal of pacheco claim.
ii.discovery 
because we hold that pacheco did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim,we need not decide whether,as pacheco contends,the district court abused its discretion by denying pacheco certain discovery on that claim.nevertheless,we note that the record indicates no such abuse of discretion.atkinson denton pub,cir reviewing for abuse of discretion mayo,cir declining to reverse trial court discovery rulings unless they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.
not until this suit has pacheco finally alleged,albeit in only the most conclusory fashion,discrimination.his complaint alleges that he was the victim not only of intentional discrimination but also of a promotion application and selection process with an adverse impact on hispanics 
pacheco was eliminated in the new configuration of the second stage of the selection process which was used for the first time in february in the promotion to fill the corpus christi operations supervisor vacancy which pacheco was denied.according to meehan affidavit,the process has been used only one other time since,and there is no contrary evidence.despite this,pacheco interrogatory requested the identity of all persons who have been selected or promoted into a supervisory or management position in the southwest region of the faa between and the present including their race and national origin.
the information sought through this interrogatory would have been of limited relevance to pacheco suit.pacheco requested the discovery of faa data dating back to,five years before the policy of which he apparently complains was implemented.more importantly,pacheco requested this data for the entire southwest region even though he never alleged discrimination by anyone but the manager of the faa corpus christi facility accordingly,even if pacheco had exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his claim,we would decline to hold that the district court abused its discretion by denying pacheco such broad,and largely irrelevant,discovery.see,atkinson,at holding,in an age discrimination suit,that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying discovery of past employee records because there was no nexus between the plaintiff claim and the records that the plaintiff sought conboy edward jones,cir unpublished.
iii.cross appeal on rule d 
the dot argues that,as a matter of law,the good faith of the plaintiff is,by itself,an insufficient reason to defeat the provision in rule d.this question is a matter of first impression in this court,but all circuits that have expressly considered the question agree with the dot position.
rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that costs,other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the district court otherwise directs.d.because the rule authorizes the district court to deny the award,we review that exercise of authority for abuse of discretion.schwarz folloder,cir.only when a clear abuse of discretion is shown can an award of cost be overturned.humble oil and refining,cir.
however,rule d contains a strong presumption that the prevailing party will be awarded costs.schwarz,at.indeed,this court has held that the prevailing party is prima facie entitled to costs,and has described the denial of costs as in the nature of a penalty.schwarz,at.as a result of this presumption,the general discretion conferred by rule d has been circumscribed by the condition that a court may neither deny nor reduce a prevailing party request for cost without first articulating some good reason for doing so.schwarz,at citation omitted delta air lines,august,d assuming that costs are denied to the prevailing party only when there would be an element of injustice in a cost award.
the fifth circuit has little case law addressing this issue,but in other circuits,a wide range of reasons have been invoked to justify withholding costs from the prevailing party.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at.among these are the losing party limited financial resources misconduct by the prevailing party close and difficult legal issues presented substantial benefit conferred to the public and the prevailing party enormous financial resources id.and,according to wright and miller,courts also deny costs if the losing party prosecuted the action in good faith.id.at.however,every case cited by wright and miller for this proposition denies costs on the basis of both the losing party good faith and some other one or more of the factors listed above.
every circuit to expressly address the question in a published fourth,sixth,seventh,ninth and ruled that good faith,by itself,can not defeat the operation of rule d.teague bakker,cir t he mere fact that a suit may have been brought in good faith is alone insufficient to warrant a denial of costs in favor of a prevailing defendant cherry champion,cir a party good faith,standing alone,is an insufficient basis for refusing to assess costs against that party.white white,american hosp.supply,cir good faith without more,however,is an insufficient basis for denying costs to a prevailing party capital development board of illinois,cir the losing party good faith and proper conduct of the litigation is not enough national information services,trw,cir,overruled on other grounds by association of educators state of california,cir en banc overruling national information systems but only to the extent it held that only misconduct may support the denial of costs to a prevailing party aerotech,estes,cir.
here,even though the dot was in all respects the prevailing party,it has been denied costs by the district court when the government pressed the court for a reason,which it was required to give,the district court replied it is clear that plaintiff brought this action in good faith.he is represented by an excellent lawyer who litigates in good faith.under such circumstances,each party should bear its own costs.
following our sister circuits,we hold that the losing party good faith is alone insufficient to justify the denial of costs to the prevailing party.all federal litigants,including this plaintiff,have an obligation to bring suit in good faith.western district of texas local rule,standards of professional conduct adopting the standards of professional conduct of the state bar of texas,including rule,which requires attorneys to bring suits in good faith.as the ninth circuit has said,it follows that noble intentions alone do not relieve an unsuccessful litigant of the obligation under rule d to compensate his opponent for reasonable costs.if the awarding of costs could be thwarted every time the unsuccessful party is a normal,average party and not a knave,rule d would have little substance remaining.national information services,supra,at.
the district court abused its discretion in denying costs to the prevailing party on the basis of plaintiff good faith alone.out of respect for the district court statutory discretion to shift costs,we vacate the award of costs and remand for a of whether or to what extent costs should be awarded to the prevailing party and,if not,the reasons for that denial.
conclusion 
because we hold that pacheco failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim for discrimination,we affirm the district court rule b dismissal of that claim.however,because the district court abused the discretion granted to it under rule d,we vacate the district court ruling on the award of costs and remand for a of whether or to what extent costs should be awarded to the prevailing party.
the judgment is affirmed in all respects except as to costs the district court ruling as to costs is vacated,and the cause is remanded to the district court solely for a redetermination,not inconsistent herewith,of whether or to what extent costs should be awarded
