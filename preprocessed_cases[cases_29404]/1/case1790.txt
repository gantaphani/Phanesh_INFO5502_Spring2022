in this case,we confront the question of whether a defendant who successfully obtains dissolution of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in a labor dispute case may recover its damages,fees and costs under section seven of the act,if no bond was ordered prior to dissolution of the injunction.we answer in the affirmative and therefore reverse the decision of the district court.
matrix human services and its operate a head start program in detroit,michigan,which employs teachers and other staff.the michigan american federation of state,county,and municipal employees council,local is the union that represents those employees.
in,matrix reduced the length of the head start program from twelve to ten months due to monetary restraints and,thus,only paid its employees for ten months of work.each year thereafter,matrix made a determination of whether it could afford to provide its employees with healthcare benefits or whether it needed to reduce those benefits to coincide with the ten months of wages and work.
matrix informed the union on october,that it would only provide ten months of healthcare benefits for the calendar year.matrix told the union that employee healthcare benefits would terminate as of june,and pick back up on august.matrix also provided the union with instructions on how its members could purchase medical coverage through the federal consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra program to bridge the roughly gap.
in accordance with the parties collective bargaining agreement,the union filed a grievance regarding the healthcare issue on november.on april,the american arbitration association notified the parties that it would hold an arbitration hearing on october,than two months after matrix planned to resume paying for employee healthcare benefits.
on june,just one day before coverage was set to lapse,the union filed a complaint in the circuit court of wayne county,michigan seeking to enjoin matrix from discontinuing the benefits the union also moved for an ex parte temporary restraining order prohibiting matrix from proceeding with its plan to cease paying for coverage the following day,june.apparently without matrix ever being aware of the complaint and motion,the michigan state court granted the ex parte temporary restraining order.notably,at least for purposes of this appeal,the state court did not require that the union post an injunction bond.
the state court temporary restraining order kicked off a frenzy of litigation.upon receipt of the complaint and the ex parte temporary restraining order,matrix promptly removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan on june,asserting that the union claim actually arose under the federal labor laws.on june,matrix moved to dissolve the temporary restraining order.the district court heard argument on matrix motion on june and,on july,dissolved the temporary restraining order due to the union failure to show irreparable harm.during this june,when matrix removed to federal court,to july,when the district court dissolved the temporary restraining did not move the federal court to impose an injunction bond as a condition of the union keeping the injunction in place.
things slowed down after the court dissolved the temporary restraining order on july.on september,matrix moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the claims were then moot.the union agreed and,on october,the district court dismissed the case.however,the court denied matrix request for fees and costs as a prevailing party under federal rule of civil procedure d.
thus,on november,matrix moved to recover approximately in fees and costs incurred in seeking dissolution of the temporary restraining order.the basis for matrix motion was section seven of the act.the union responded that matrix may not recover fees and costs because a defendant who successfully dissolves an injunction may recover under section seven only against an injunction bond and,in this case,no bond was ever ordered by either the state or federal court or posted by the union.matrix put forth two arguments in response.first,it contended that the only reason that there was no bond was because the union got a state court to issue an ex parte temporary restraining order behind matrix back instead of bringing its claim in federal court and providing matrix with sufficient notice to appear at the temporary restraining order hearing and to request a bond.it would not be fair,matrix argued,to preclude it from recovering its fees on the basis of the union litigation strategy.second,matrix argued that it may recover its fees in any event because section seven of the act does not necessarily condition recovery of fees on a bond actually being in place.
the district court agreed with the union,michigan american federation of state county and municipal employees,council matrix human services,no,wl,dist.lexis,matrix timely appealed.

matrix makes essentially the same arguments on appeal as it made in the district court.the union primarily contends that the statute clearly conditions recovery of fees on the presence of a bond and that matrix effectively waived its right to recover under section seven when it did not move the district court to impose a bond prior to ruling on the motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order 
whether a defendant who successfully dissolves an interlocutory injunction in a labor case can recover under section seven of the act in the complete absence of a bond is a question of first impression.other courts have gotten close to the question but have reached differing conclusions,and we have previously discussed in dicta the recovery of fees in under section seven.
in,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that an injunction defendant could not recover fees and costs under section seven independent from or in excess of the bond previously imposed by the trial court.int l ladies garment workers union donnelly garment,cir.there,the defendant had incurred many thousands of dollars in fees and costs in seeking to dissolve an injunction,but the district court had only ordered that the plaintiff post a bond of.in ruling that the defendant could not recover more than the total of the bond,the court stated 
we may not suppose that congress,in imposing upon the court the duty of determining the amount of security adequate to the protection of a defendant,and just to a plaintiff,intended that the court determination should be wholly ineffectual and without meaning as the measure of plaintiff liability upon his undertaking.we think the statutory requirement of a bond,upon certain conditions,in an amount to be fixed by the court is conclusive evidence of the legislative intention that the bond should be the evidence and the measure of plaintiff liability and defendant protection.
id.at.the court further reasoned that 
necessarily,at the beginning of an action,the amount of security adequate for a defendant protection is a matter of estimate.it may be fixed in a sum which the event proves inadequate or excessive.if the security required by the court becomes inadequate while the restraint continues and the litigation proceeds,a defendant has ready to hand the means for his protection by a motion for an increase in the amount of the security.
taking the exact opposite view,in the court of appeals for the third circuit held that the liability of the plaintiff for loss,expense or damage under was not intended by congress to be restricted solely to the amount of whatever bond the court may have required and,thus,in any case involving a labor dispute the liability of the plaintiff,though not of any surety,for loss,expense or damage,including attorneys fees,under of the act shall be fixed by the court without regard to any limitation in an injunction bond.steel united mine workers,cir.that court read section seven to create two different liabilities,one being the bond secured by a surety and the other being an unsecured liability on the plaintiff to pay the delta,if any,between the bond and the defendant damages,fees and costs.id.at.
our closest cases are aluminum workers international union,local consolidated aluminum,cir and international union,united automobile workers lasalle machine tool,cir.in consolidated aluminum,the district court had entered an injunction and imposed a injunction bond.the defendant brought an interlocutory appeal,arguing both that the injunction exceeded the district court authority under and that the district court had used an incorrect analysis in setting the injunction bond.we agreed that the injunction was beyond the district court jurisdiction,and also found that the district court had failed to pay heed to the considerations mandated by section seven in setting the bond.we therefore vacated the injunction and remanded for rehearing on the issue of the defendant damages.id.at.
in lasalle machine tool,one question on appeal was whether a preliminary injunction that had been imposed pending arbitration was rendered moot when,in the intervening period,the arbitrator had rendered a decision and thus the injunction expired by its own terms.we held that the appeal of the injunction was not moot because there was still a question as to whether the injunction defendant could recover against the bond.thus,we had to determine whether the injunction was improperly granted as an antecedent to determining whether the defendant could recover against the bond.at.we further stated 
after this opinion had been prepared,but before its release,the union filed a statement with this court to the effect that no bond was ever actually posted in this case.this does not alter our decision on mootness.the issuance of an injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute must be conditioned on an undertaking by the person seeking the injunction to make the person enjoined whole for any loss,expense or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of the injunction.this requirement is made jurisdictional by of the act,having sought and obtained a preliminary injunction the union is obligated to pay the costs and damages incurred or suffered by the party found to have been wrongfully enjoined.the district court ordered an undertaking in the form of a bond.the fact that the bond which was ordered by the district court was not filed is immaterial.
thus,there is no authority directly on point for the question whether a defendant may recover when no bond was ordered,and the circuits are split on the extent of an injunction defendant ability to recover independent from or in excess of an injunction bond.our closest cases are united on the proposition that failures in the bond improper analysis by the district court or a plaintiff failure to post a not preclude a defendant from recovering under section seven of the act.but neither case concerns a district having never ordered a bond,and neither goes so far as to hold that recovery may be independent of section seven bond requirement.therefore,we believe it helpful to start the analysis afresh and then return to the case law to determine whether matrix or the union has the better part of the matter.
we begin with basic principles.matrix seeks to recover the attorney fees that it incurred in trying to rid itself of the union temporary restraining order.it is fundamental in our civil system that each party to a lawsuit bears its own costs unless a statute or agreement provides otherwise.see,alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d detailing the history of the ability to recover fees in the american system and stating absent statute or enforceable contract,litigants pay their own attorneys fees wilson int l of teamsters,cir under the american rule,unless a contract or a statute expressly authorizes an award of attorneys fees,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.citing alyeska mcauley motors,stating that michigan follows what is commonly termed the american rule with regard to payment of attorney fees,which is that a party may not recover its fees absent express authorization by statute or contract.thus,though it may seem unfair,we may not award fees to a party unless we are authorized to do so by statute or agreement.
in this case,matrix points to section seven of the act as the font of its entitlement to fee shifting.we must therefore examine that statute to determine whether it allows matrix to recover in these circumstances.the statute provides,in relevant part 
no temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss,expense,or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction,including all reasonable costs together with a reasonable attorney fee and expense of defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.
the undertaking mentioned in this section shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety,upon a hearing to assess damages of which hearing complainant and surety shall have reasonable notice,the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose.but nothing in this section contained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action under or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary remedy by suit at law or in equity.
although drafted in the using the legalese that was the vernacular of that era,we find this statute to be unambiguous.an undertaking with adequate security is just a way of saying bond,and,indeed,it is commonly accepted that section seven discusses bonds.see,int l ladies garment workers union,at citing webster dictionary for the proposition that an undertaking is ordinarily understood to be a bond.we are further convinced that the plain language of section seven discusses only bonds.we therefore reject the third circuit interpretation in united states steel that section seven provides for two liabilities,one against the bond secured by a surety and another unsecured against the plaintiff.
in addition to the unambiguous text of the statute,other factors confirm our interpretation of section seven.first,this reading of the statute is implicit in our discussion of section seven in consolidated aluminum.there,we found that the district court had not considered the appropriate factors in setting the injunction bond and therefore remanded for rehearing on the issue of the defendant damages.at.had we read section seven as allowing recovery from the plaintiff independent of a bond,we would have simply remanded to assess damages we need not have discussed the proper bond analysis.instead,because we interpreted section seven to tie recovery of fees and costs to the amount of the bond,we remanded the case to the district court to redo the analysis of what would have been an appropriate bond under the considerations set forth in section seven and to allow recovery against whatever that amount turned out to be our reading of section seven is also reinforced by the supreme court statement that generally a party injured by the issuance of an injunction later determined to be erroneous has no action for damages in the absence of a bond.grace local union,int l union of united rubber workers,d we therefore hold that section seven of the act allows recovery only in relation to a bond set according to the conditions in the act.if it turns out that the bond is less than the total of the defendant damages,the defendant will only be made partially whole if the bond exceeds the defendant damages,the defendant will be made whole.
at first blush,finding that the act allows recovery only in relation
