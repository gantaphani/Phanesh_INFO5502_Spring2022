on motion for attorneys fees and costs 
in a previous opinion,we granted the petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia or board filed by madhumilind potdar.the path by which potdar reached this court is a long and tortuous one,recounted in detail in two prior opinions of this court,see potdar keisler,cir potdar i potdar mukasey,cir potdar ii we presume familiarity with these prior decisions.currently before the court is potdar motion for attorneys fees and costs.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we deny the petition.
petitioners in immigration cases are eligible for attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act,eaja.to be eligible for an award of fees,a petitioner must show that he was a prevailing party the government position was not substantially justified there existed no special circumstances that would make an award unjust and he filed a timely and complete application for fees.kholyavskiy holder,cir citations omitted.here,potdar timely filed a complete petition for fees and costs.additionally,the government does not dispute that potdar is a prevailing party.see respondent opposition at.the government also does not claim that special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust.kholyavskiy,at.consequently,the only issue we must resolve is whether the government position was substantially justified,an issue on which the government bears the burden of proof.floroiu gonzales,cir golembiewski barnhart,cir 
to be substantially justified,the government position must be justified in substance or in the main or justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.pierce underwood,d.the government meets this burden if it had a reasonable basis in truth for the facts alleged,it had a reasonable basis in law for the theory propounded,and there was a reasonable connection between the facts alleged and the theory propounded.kholyavskiy,at citing conrad barnhart,cir.the eaja is not an automatic statute in favor of litigants who prevail against the government,zapon united states dep t of justice,cir t he outcome of a case is not conclusive evidence of the justification for the government position,united states hallmark const,cir.more specific to the immigration context,a determination that part of the bia decision was not supported by substantial evidence does not foreclose the possibility that the position was substantially justified.howard barnhart,cir.rather,we must consider the factual and legal support for the government position throughout the entire proceeding.hallmark constr,at.
as we observed in kholyavskiy,we have identified some relevant considerations for evaluating the government position 
for instance,courts are more likely to conclude that the government position is substantially justified if it is supported by our precedent or that of other courts.see krecioch united states,cir finding the government position to be substantially justified in part because it was supported by precedent from other federal circuits.moreover,uncertainty in the law arising from conflicting authority or the novelty of the question weighs in the government favor when analyzing the reasonableness of the government litigation position.marcus shalala,cir.by contrast,s trong language against the government position in an opinion assessing the merits of a key issue is evidence in support of an award of eaja fees,golembiewski,at,as is wholesale rejection of the government arguments by the merits panel,see id.at awarding fees and observing that w e did not reject any issue raised by the plaintiff on appeal nor did we adopt or affirm any position taken by the commissioner.
the supreme court has cautioned that we must not treat different phases of litigation as atomized for purposes of determining whether the government position was substantially justified.commissioner,ins jean,d.however,for ease of analysis,we shall review separately the different phases of the present litigation and the parties approaches at each stage.after doing so,we then shall consider whether the government position as an inclusive whole,was substantially justified.we begin our review with potdar motion to reopen before the bia.potdar does not seek fees for any proceeding pre dating the filing of the petition for review with this court.however,because many of the arguments and decisions made during the administrative process frame the arguments made to this court,we recount those as well.
administrative proceedings 
in april,the bia determined that potdar was excludable.in its decision affirming the immigration judge ij,the bia rejected several grounds of exclusion relied upon by the ij however,it did find that,because potdar was seeking legalization,he had immigrant intent,and,therefore,he was excludable based on his failure to present an immigrant visa.potdar ii,at.potdar did not appeal from that order,but pursued other avenues of relief.specifically,his employer sponsored him for an visa and submitted a labor certification application on his behalf.after this application was approved,the employer petitioned for an immigrant visa on his behalf,and potdar applied for adjustment of status.id.at that point,potdar moved to reopen proceedings before the bia so that his pending applications could be processed by the district director.his pro se motion requested that the board re open sic my case and consider these new findings.further,i would request the board to grant a stay of removal until my petition for alien worker form and application to adjust to permanent resident status form are adjudicated by the bcis.the motion went unopposed,and,on november,the bia grant ed the motion to reopen and remand ed the case for further proceedings.
in the reopened proceedings,potdar counsel charted a new course.instead of arguing in support of a stay to allow the processing of his application for adjustment by the district director,he renew ed the motion that he had made before the prior ij to dismiss the charges of excludability having been charged against him and terminate the instant exclusion proceedings.armed with documents that could not be located during his initial proceedings,specifically his grant of advance parole,potdar requested that the instant proceedings in exclusion be terminated and the applicants sic admission as a parolee be reinstated pending adjudication of his legalization application or any other application for status pending with the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis office.id.at.the government responded that,because the district director had revoked the applicant advance parole,he was properly placed into exclusion proceedings.the government,therefore,requested that the motion to terminate be denied.
in considering the parties filings,the ij mistakenly characterized potdar motion to reopen as requesting adjustment of status.the immigration court determined that it did not have authority to consider such a request and certified the record to the board sua sponte,posing the following questions w as the grant of the applicant motion for adjustment appropriate is the denial of adjustment of status is sic warranted as a matter of law.the ij entered this order on july.thereafter,potdar did not seek to apprise either the ij or the board that the ij had misunderstood his request.
over eight months later,the board considered the certified record and questions.it accepted the ij characterization of potdar august,filing as seeking an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status.the board agreed with the ij that he lacked authority to grant adjustment of status in exclusion proceedings.it therefore vacated its prior decision and denied the motion to reopen.
petition for review 
potdar petitioned for review.before this court,potdar raised a myriad of issues challenging the ij failure to grant the motion to terminate and challenging aspects of the board initial determination of excludability a determination for which potdar had not sought review.however,potdar did not raise as a separate issue the fact that the board misconstrued the nature and purpose of his motion to reopen 
in response,the government argue
