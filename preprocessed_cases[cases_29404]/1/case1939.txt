four environmental groups filed this action contending that the office of surface mining and reclamation,an office of the department of the interior,abused its discretion in conducting an environmental assessment of an application by the national coal corporation to mine roughly acres in the cumberland river watershed of northeastern tennessee and in issuing a finding of no significant environmental impact with respect to the application.among other things,plaintiffs argued that the agency environmental assessment did not take a sufficiently hard look at the consequences of the application,see aberdeen rockfish students challenging regulatory agency procedures,d,as mandated by the national environmental policy act of,stat.codified as amended at et,and that the agency arbitrarily concluded that the proposed mining would have no significant impact on the region environment.the extensive record compiled by the agency,the many modifications made to the mining application by the coal company in response to concerns raised by the agency and the minimal effects of the mining proposal on the environment all convinced the district court that the agency did not abuse its discretion.
while we affirm,we express one caveat in doing so.throughout the process and throughout this litigation,the office of surface mining has taken the position that it need only consider three alternatives to the mining the license,deny the license or take no action.that approach,in our view,unduly circumscribes the scope of alternatives that the statute and regulations require federal agencies to consider.nonetheless,because the administrative record shows that the agency in effect did consider other options to the coal company license request primarily modifications to the application that would diminish the environmental consequences of the mining and because plaintiffs on appeal have not identified any concrete alternatives that the agency should have considered but did not,we affirm.
on june,the national coal corporation applied to the office of surface mining for a permit to conduct contour and auger coal mining operations on zeb mountain in campbell and scott counties,tennessee.op.at.commonly known as strip mining,mining removes surrounding rock with explosives to expose a seam of coal,which permits miners to excavate the coal with heavy mining equipment and often with the use of additional explosives.once a mining company has removed the surrounding rock,it also can remove the coal through auger mining,which accesses the coal with a large drill.
the coal company sought a permit to mine and build support structures on acres of a acre area.according to its application,the mining project would last about ten years and in the end would return all but a small portion of the affected land to its natural contours,including acres of previously mined,unreclaimed land.consistent with the requirements of the surface mining control and reclamation act of,stat.codified as amended at et,the coal company published its application in the local newspapers.and consistent with the act,the office of surface mining,which administers the act on behalf of the department of the interior,solicited comments from various federal,state and local governmental agencies and environmental organizations about the application.op.at.the united states fish and wildlife service,the tennessee wildlife resources agency,the division of natural heritage of the tennessee department of the environment and conservation,one of the plaintiffs and several other environmental organizations provided comments.the agency also held an informal conference about the application on october,which attracted registered speakers and prompted letters from interested parties.
as a result of this discourse and as a result of its own inquiry,the office of surface mining issued seven notices of deficiency to the coal company.in response,the company revised and republished its proposed mining plan several times,making changes that affected nearly all areas of interest under the national environmental policy act,including providing greater protection for various animal species threatened by the mining,improved contingencies for the treatment of potentially contaminated water,a revised plan,a revised plan,improved standards,a revised revegetation plan that included the use of hardwood trees,a plan to reestablish the habitats of certain species and a plan to protect local residents from the noise and dust caused by blasting.
the agency also conducted an environmental assessment of the plan,which examined the effects of the proposed mining on topography,geology,soils,vegetation,land use,aesthetics,hydrology,fish and wildlife,cultural and historic resources,air quality and socioeconomics.on june,the agency published this environmental assessment as well as a finding of no significant impact,the posting by the coal company of a million bond designed to ensure that it meets its reclamation a permit for the company to begin mining.

congress enacted the national environmental policy act t o declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment and to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man.to the ends of advancing this purpose,of the act mandates that all agencies of the federal government shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment a detailed statement by the responsible official on 
i the environmental impact of the proposed action,
ii any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,
iii alternatives to the proposed action,
iv the relationship between local uses of man environment and the maintenance and enhancement of productivity,and 
v any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
as suggested by the requirements of this detailed statement what the regulations refer to as an environmental impact statement,act serves procedural rather than substantive goals.it does not require agencies to achieve particular substantive environmental results,marsh or.natural res.council,d,but requires them to collect and disseminate information about the environmental consequences of proposed actions that fall under their respective jurisdictions,sw.williamson county cmty.ass slater,cir greater yellowstone coalition flowers,cir contrasting the substantive restrictions of the clean water act with the procedural requirements of the national environmental protection act.the upshot of the act is to integrate environmental concerns into the very process of agency decisionmaking.andrus sierra club,d see also robertson methow valley citizens council,d noting that the act focuses the agency attention on the environmental consequences of a proposed project,guarantees that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in the agency decision,and ensures that other affected governmental bodies will have adequate notice of the expected consequences and the opportunity to plan and implement corrective measures in a timely manner.
in integrating environmental considerations into agency deliberations,requires an affected federal agency here the office of surface mining to prepare an environmental impact statement whenever two things are true there has been a proposal for legislation and other major federal actions,and the proposal would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.no one questions that major federal action exists here,as the office of surface mining has responsibility under the surface mining control and reclamation act for approving applications to mine coal in this country.c see noting that major federal actions include actions potentially subject to federal control and responsibility id.a referring to such actions as ones that may be assisted,conducted,regulated,or approved by federal agencies id.b see generally slater,at holding that a major federal action need not be funded by federal money.
the point of debate is whether this mining proposal would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.in providing guidance to agencies about when they should prepare an environmental impact statement,the implementing regulations,promulgated by the council on environmental quality,say that the agency should ask whether the proposal is one that n ormally requires an environmental impact statement,a,or n ormally does not require such a statement,id.a.when,as in this case,the agency determines that it is not clear whether the license application requires an environmental impact statement,the regulations direct the agency preliminarily to prepare an environmental assessment.id.b.

at pages in length,the environmental assessment satisfies most of these regulatory requirements.it contains a brief discussion of the need for the proposed decision,and it discusses at length the environmental effects of the proposed action,including its impact on topography,geology,soils,vegetation,land use,hydrology,fish and wildlife,threatened and endangered species,cultural and historic resources,air quality,aesthetics,socioeconomics,public safety and environmental justice.
in considering the environmental consequences of the plan,the agency consulted numerous studies of similar mining operations in other appalachian mountain regions.see,ja referencing a report on soil redevelopment in a west virginia coal mine site in ja referencing a tennessee valley authority draft environmental assessment for nearby braden mountain concerning measures to ease the reintroduction of wildlife to the mining site ja referencing a report regarding reclaimed mines on nearby brushy and walnut mountains and concluding that reclamation will minimize any impact on wildlife id.referencing a study indicating that mining causes greater disturbances to salamander populations than clearcutting ja referencing a west virginia university study concluding that emissions from similar mining operations posed little health risk ja referencing a previous office of surface mining environmental impact statement to establish the likely impact area of dust id.using an environmental study on surface mining to determine the likely effect of changes on residents ja using an office of surface mining environmental impact statement to determine the likely threat to local residents from blasting operations.the agency also consulted studies assessing the specific effects of this mining operation.see,ja referencing the cumulative hydrological impact assessments performed by the office of surface mining to evaluate the effects of the proposed mining on area water supplies.and,finally,the agency considered the environmental impact statement that it had completed in approving tennessee plan for overseeing surface coal mining operations and reclaiming abandoned mining areas under the surface mining control and reclamation act.see,ja.
the report acknowledges that the mining will have several effects the disruption of land use,habitat,aquatic,air quality,soils,postmining vegetation cover,and aesthetics.ja.but it explains that the plan reclamation and mitigation efforts will diminish,if not entirely remediate,most of these problems over the long run.see,ja noting that although mining initially will drive certain animal species out of the area,the large amounts of similar habitat adjacent to the project area mean that the impact on terrestrial wildlife in the region would be temporary and is unlikely to have adverse impacts on the wildlife population as a whole in the area,and the subsequent incremental reclamation of the disturbed areas would reduce impacts to local populations of wildlife ja i n the short term,disturbance to soils will be complete but mitigated to a large extent by the salvaging and redistribution of soil growth medium studies confirm that development of soils and soil profiles more similar to the native soils is likely to occur over a period of years following completion of mining.ja noting that much of the local vegetation will be removed during mining but thereafter will be replaced with native vegetation,restoring an area substantially diminished by previous mining and logging.
when it comes to the effects of the mining application,the agency assessment shows that it took a hard look at the consequences of its decision and did not act arbitrarily in making a finding of no significant impact.so long as mining involves the initial destruction of the earth surface,it will have some effect on the environment.the critical question is what the company proposes to do about it.the company in this instance responded to initial concerns that the agency raised about the application,proposed measures to mitigate the damage to the environment and proposed measures designed to restore the environment to its state.in addition to raising these concerns,the agency thoroughly examined the application and the environmental consequences of granting the license.under these circumstances,the agency did what the law required it to do with one exception discussed below,and its decision that the effects of the mining would not be significant lay well within its discretion.see sierra club slater,cir concluding that the agency determination that temporary impacts are not significant was not arbitrary and capricious see also akiak native cmty.united states postal,cir concluding that evidence that an impact was only meant that its impact was not significant river.alliance,corps of eng rs of united states army,cir concluding that the temporary nature of the harmful effects at issue,among other considerations,rendered them insignificant.
impacts from a mining operation are another matter,though they do not invariably doom a mining proposal or,as here,compel the issuance of an environmental impact statement.in its report,the agency acknowledged four consequences of the proposed mining operation alterations of topography,additional alteration of the geologic strata,increased infiltration rates through the backfilled material,and permanent retention of roads and sediment basins.ja.the proper implementation of the proposed operation and reclamation plan,it concluded,would prevent or minimize the adverse effects that may occur from the permanent changes.id.the agency conclusion is not unreasonable.the permanent changes to topography,for example,consist of the initial removal of to feet from the tops of three knobs on a ridge in the proposed mining area that ultimately will be replaced with backfill.when coal companies previously mined this ridge,they left knobs or highwalls,which is to say the unreclaimed remnants of earlier mining operations.the agency concluded that the replacement of the highwalls with backfill would not have a significant environmental impact because the current topography consists of the remnants of past mining and of soil contaminated by that mining and the backfill would more nearly return the ridge to its original,contour.the agency further concluded that the plan adequately mitigated the other effects of the operation and that in the end they would be minimal.see ja noting that backfill would help to shore up the disturbed geological strata ja noting that despite increased water flow through backfill materials,the proposed operation has been designed to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area ja noting that despite retention of mining roads and sediment basins,w hen the mining and reclamation is complete,the overall aesthetic quality of the area will generally be improved by the elimination of much of the previously abandoned mine impacts.
relying on its environmental assessment,the agency issued a finding of no significant impact,explaining that the consequences of the mining are predicted to be minor to moderate in the while impacts should be minimal.ja.reasoning that reclamation would ameliorate most of the consequences of the mining and that the residual effects would be minor,the agency concluded that the permit would not have a major impact on the quality of the human environment.therefore,an environmental impact statement pursuant to c of the national environmental policy act is not required.ja.in view of the agency generally thorough environmental assessment again,with one exception noted below,in view of the considerable changes made to the coal company proposal during the review process,in view of the company proposal to improve a previously unreclaimed mining site,in view of the environmental assessment incorporation of a prior environmental impact statement regarding coal mining in the region and that statement detailed discussion of the general effects of mining in the area and in view of the support for its determination,the agency decision to issue a finding of no significant impact was neither arbitrary nor capricious.
plaintiffs challenge these conclusions on three grounds the agency prepared a deficient environmental assessment because it failed to consider sufficient alternatives to the proposal the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing a finding of no significant impact instead of requiring an environmental impact statement and the agency should have made the environmental assessment available for public comment days before its final decision.
first,plaintiffs point out that the agency considered just three alternatives in preparing the environmental the license,deny the license or take no action.in failing to consider other alternatives,plaintiffs claim,the agency breached the regulatory requirement that an environmental assessment contain a brief discussion of alternatives and the environmental impacts of those alternatives.
as a general matter,the range of alternatives that must be discussed under the national environmental policy act is a matter within an agency discretion.friends of ompompanoosuc fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir see also.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d citizens against burlington,busey.in exercising that discretion,the agency should consider the purpose of the project,see citizens against burlington,at,and the environmental consequences of the project.
as to the latter consideration,an agency has fewer reasons to consider alternatives when it prepares an environmental assessment as opposed to when it prepares an environmental impact statement.for in permissibly preparing an environmental assessment alone,the agency has determined that the proposed project will have minimal environmental consequences,and accordingly its duty to consider alternatives is less pressing than when it issues an environmental impact statement.see native ecosystems council united states forest,cir.nebo prop.prot.ass fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir north carolina fed.aviation,cir.and when an agency permissibly identifies few if any environmental consequences of a project,it correspondingly has fewer reasons to consider environmentally sensitive alternatives to the some courts have referred to as a approach to the issue.highway j citizens group mineta,cir cent.coop.grazing dist.sec y of the united states dep t of,cir river.alliance,corps of eng rs of the united states army,cir.a lthough consideration of some range of alternatives is essential to any environmental assessment,it makes little sense to fault an agency for failing to consider more environmentally sound alternatives to a project which it has properly determined,through its decision not to file an impact statement,will have no significant environmental effects anyway.sierra club espy,cir.
in this instance,the agency concluded that the surface mining control and reclamation act and accompanying regulations gave it just three options in reviewing the proposed action of a private party on private no action,grant the license or deny the license.it considered and rejected the alternative because it concluded that this option fell outside of its legislative authority.as it understood the federal program for tennessee under the surface mining act,the program did not give it authority to decline to act on the application.see gov t br.at the office of surface mining listed the only alternatives available when a federal agency is reviewing the proposed action of a private party to mine privately owned land.it considered and rejected the option as an inferior course of action.see ja noting that the temporary and permanent changes that the mining would cause would be prevented but d isapproval would also result in the loss of employment opportunities associated with this mine site as well as the loss of revenue to the local economy and county tax base.and it picked the preferred the license.
we do not disagree with the agency inclusion of these three options in its assessment,and we do not disagree with its assessment of each option.but the suggestion that the agency had authority only to mention these three alternatives in its environmental assessment presents a false trichotomy.whatever duties the surface mining control and reclamation act imposes on the office of surface mining,it does not suspend the agency independent obligations under the national environmental policy act.to the contrary,in enacting the surface mining control act,congress disclaimed any interest in modifying the national environmental policy act.see a nothing in this act shall be construed as superseding,amending,modifying,or repealing the national environmental policy act of b nothing in this chapter shall affect in any way the authority of the secretary of the department of the interior under other provisions of law to include in any permit such conditions as may be appropriate to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation operations.while the one statute the mining act may well channel and control the agency authority to grant a mining license,see c,the other statute the environmental act independently requires federal agencies to study,evaluate and discuss alternatives to the proposed mining plan,see the congress authorizes and directs that,to the fullest extent possible all agencies of the federal government shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement by the responsible official on alternatives to the proposed action.environmental assessment shall include brief discussions of alternatives as required by.
nor,at any rate,has the agency demonstrated that the mining act pulls it in one direction while the environmental act pulls it in another when it comes to the review of this mining application.in claiming it has authority under the mining act only to grant or deny a license,the agency cites four c.but these provisions do not support the agency position.section c gives the secretary a long list of duties not restrictions,which include authority to order the suspension,revocation,or withholding of any permit for failure to comply with any of the provisions of this act or regulations.why this provision prohibits the agency from identifying and discussing alternatives to a mining application remains unclear,particularly since another part of this same subsection says that the secretary may perform such other duties as may be provided by law and relate to the purposes of this act.c.
even less clear is why the statement of purpose of the act,prohibits the agency from considering other alternatives in an environmental assessment.that provision includes the following in its statutory purposes establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations,assure that surface coal mining operations are so conducted as to protect the environment,assure that adequate procedures are undertaken to reclaim surface areas as contemporaneously as possible with the surface coal mining operations,strike a balance between protection of the environment and agricultural productivity and the nation need for coal as an essential source of energy and wherever necessary,exercise the full reach of federal constitutional powers to insure the protection of the public interest through effective control of surface coal mining operations.id.none of the other stated purposes of the act restricts an agency in identifying alternatives to a mining application,and the requirement that an environmental assessment identify and discuss environmentally sound alternatives to an application hardly disrespects the act special concerns related to preserving and protecting the environment.
still more puzzling is the agency invocation of a.it says that the regulatory authority shall review the application,written comments and objections submitted,records of any hearing held on the application and issue a written decision,within a reasonable time set by the regulatory authority,either granting,requiring modification of,or denying the application.emphasis added.that the agency may require modification of the application of course presents the quintessential alternative to granting or denying the application,and consistent with the national environmental protection act it would permit the agency to identify alternatives that are more environmentally considerate than the application proposed course of action.the final regulation cited by the agency,adds little,as it merely identifies the requirements for approving a permit application.
in the face of these provisions,we are hard pressed to understand the agency insistence that an environmental assessment in this area and presumably an environmental impact statement as well may consider only three,disapproval or no action.surely one alternative that could have been discussed was a modification to the to the size of the area being mined,to the types of mining being contemplated or to the mitigation measures for the mining operation.that the agency previously identified several deficiencies in the application and that the coal company modified the application in response to this notice of deficiencies does not change matters.if the company has satisfied the agency that it has adopted appropriate mitigation measures,that permits the agency to explain in the environmental assessment that while a further modification to the application is an alternative,it no longer is a necessary alternative or,as sometimes will be the case,it is not a feasible alternative.the point is,modification remains an that disproves the agency claim that it has no authority to consider other alternatives.nor is there anything in the mining act or regulations that the agency has called to our attention that prohibits the agency from a similar the application with conditions.
whether in the context of environmental assessments or environmental impact statements,other courts have been skeptical of this kind of agency the agency licensing responsibility gives it authority only to say yes or no to permit applications,making these the only alternatives the agency must discuss.as these courts correctly have recognized,the national environmental policy act prevents federal agencies from effectively reducing the discussion of environmentally sound alternatives to a binary choice between granting or denying an application.see davis mineta,cir o nly two alternatives were studied in detail the no build alternative,and the preferred alternative.the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving an environmental assessment that does not provide an adequate discussion of p roject alternatives.see also.envtl.coal.dombeck,cir t he national environmental policy act and council on environmental quality regulations require an agency to study in detail all reasonable alternatives in an environmental impact statement courts have interpreted this requirement to preclude agencies from defining the objectives of their actions in terms so unreasonably narrow they can be accomplished by only one alternative.simmons united states army corps of eng rs,cir one obvious way for an agency to slip past the strictures of the national environmental policy act is to contrive a purpose so slender as to define competing reasonable alternatives out of consideration and even out of existence.the federal courts can not condone an agency frustration of congressional will.if the agency constricts the definition of the project purpose and thereby excludes what truly are reasonable alternatives,the environmental impact statement can not fulfill its role.each agency shall interpret the provisions of the national environmental policy act as a supplement to its existing authority and as a mandate to view traditional policies and missions in the light of the act national environmental objectives.
nor does department of transportation public citizen,d,support the agency position that it may redefine the alternatives discussion in an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement to the option of granting or denying the permit.it concerned a matter not in dispute a m ajor federal action had occurred sufficient to prompt the agency to prepare an environmental impact statement.id.at.what is not properly before us,the court disclaimed,is any challenge to the environmental assessment due to its failure properly to consider possible alternatives to the proposed action,the issuance of the challenged rules that would mitigate the environmental impact of the authorization of operations by mexican motor carriers.id.at.in any event,even if public citizen and its discussion of agency authority governed the alternatives requirement,we have explained why the agency had authority to require the coal company to modify its proposal.see a r egulatory authority shall review the application,written comments and objections submitted and records of any hearing held on the application and issue a written decision,within a reasonable time set by the regulatory authority,either granting,requiring modification of,or denying the application.emphasis added.
to be clear,our objection to the agency position is a discrete,and readily correctable,one the agency holds to the view that it effectively may not discuss or consider any alternatives other than granting or denying an application in an environmental assessment and presumably an environmental impact statement,and that position can not be reconciled with the surface mining and reclamation act,the national environmental policy act or the regulations promulgated under either act.we appreciate that the agency has ample discretion to determine the number of alternatives it will identify and discuss but it can not adopt the position that its discretion will never exceed two alternatives in truth,one alternative,as two options give the agency just one alternative.we appreciate that an environmental assessment concluding that a proposed action will have minimal consequences for the environment will diminish the number of alternatives that the agency should identify and consider but this reality does not confine the agency to considering only whether to deny or grant the license,an agency alternative that it did not take passage of the national environmental policy act to establish.
and we appreciate that the agency may apply a rule of reason in this area and discuss only reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.see.yankee nuclear power,at.so,for example,the agency had no duty to discuss energy conservation as an alternative to the coal company license the surface mining act itself encourages such mining while striking a balance between the economic,energy and employment advantages of coal mining on the one hand with the environmental hazards of coal mining on the other.see id.at.rejecting energy conservation as a reasonable alternative to the proposal to license a nuclear plant because t o make an impact statement something more than an exercise in frivolous boilerplate,the concept of alternatives must be bounded by some notion of feasibility cent,at an agency need not consider all policy alternatives in its.nor must an agency pursue policy alternatives that are contrary to the pertinent statutory goals or do not fulfill a project purpose.citizens against burlington,at.but this accepted limitation on the agency duty does not give it a free hand to set aside anything other than granting or denying an application as an unreasonable alternative.in contrast to a policy alternative generally say,energy conservation in the context of a surface mining application an alternative within the ambit of an existing standard say,a different scope of operation or additional mitigation may not be abandoned without any consideration whatsoever.cent,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
while we can not accept the agency interpretation of its duty to discuss alternatives in an environmental assessment,we are not prepared to invalidate this environmental assessment as arbitrary and capricious.rules are rules,it is assuredly true.and one would customarily hesitate to find harmless a procedural flaw in a procedurally driven statute.as the tenth circuit reasoned in mandating compliance with the national environmental policy act procedural requirements as a means of safeguarding against environmental harms,congress has presumptively determined that the failure to comply with the act has detrimental consequences for the environment.davis,at see sierra club marsh,cir.
but plaintiffs have not shown that this error had any chance or still has any chance of altering the agency deliberations or conclusions.davis,at requiring plaintiffs in the context of a action to show that their specific environmental interests were injured by violation of the act.on appeal plaintiffs have not identified a single alternative that the agency should have considered but did not.see greater yellowstone,at stressing the importance of record evidence suggesting two viable alternative s as demonstrating agency error pub.citizen,at.none of the respondents identified in their comments any rulemaking alternatives beyond those evaluated in the environmental assessment,and none urged the agency to consider alternatives.
moreover,while the agency did not identify additional alternatives in so many words in the environmental assessment,it plainly considered alternatives during the administrative process.among other things,the agency issued seven notices of deficiency to the coal company,and each of these deficiencies prompted the coal company to modify the plan with additional mitigation measures.see ja all comments and concerns received by the agency during this integrated review process were evaluated and required the coal company to modify the permit application to mitigate predicted impacts to the extent practicable.in the environmental assessment itself,a section addressing the impact of the plan on threatened and endangered species has an extended discussion of some of the mitigation measures that were adopted and the benefits of this modification over the original licensing proposal.see ja discussing measures adopted during the review process to ease the effect of the plan on the indiana bat and the blackside dace.
also mitigating the agency error is the fact that in the agency completed a programmatic environmental impact statement,reviewing the state program under the surface mining control and reclamation act for all of tennessee.that document not only reviewed four decisional alternatives no decision,deny,grant or grant with conditions,but it also discussed alternatives in terms of the type of mining to be authorized and the yields to be allowed,among other mining variables.the agency issued its environmental assessment in the context of this prior statement and in many instances incorporated it.see,ja discussing pros and cons of underground coal mining,area mining,contour mining,mountaintop removal and augering ja comparing methods of coal processing.
having rejected the agency limitation on its authority to discuss alternatives under the national environmental policy act,we see no sensible point under these unusual circumstances in going one step the environmental assessment and prolonging this litigation,particularly with respect to a project that has already been underway for two years.when it comes to environmental impact statements and,to a lesser degree,environmental assessments,the act identifies two purposes to ensure that the agency,in reaching its decision,will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts and to guarantee that the relevant information will be made available to the larger audience that may also play a role in both the decisionmaking process and the implementation of that decision.robertson,at.the problem with this assessment was one of form,not function.the agency in effect did consider alternatives and the assessment identified considerable other information that normally would fall under the heading of alternatives.while we remain reluctant to excuse procedural violations of a procedural statute,this is one of those rare instances in which it is appropriate.greater yellowstone,at noting that because by the time the corps environmental assessment was prepared,canyon club and the corps had seriously considered various alternatives,the court had less concern about the paucity of alternatives discussed in that document friends of the ompompanoosuc,at noting in the context of the national environmental policy act that b ecause vermont can not demonstrate prejudice from the
