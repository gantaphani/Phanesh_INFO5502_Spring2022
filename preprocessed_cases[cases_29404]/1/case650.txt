petitioner yan juan chen chen,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,seeks review of a may,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the september,decision of an immigration judge ij,denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.in re yan juan chen,no.may,aff g no.immig.city.
the principal issue before us is whether substantial evidence supports the ij determination that chen failed to carry her burden of proof.underlying that is the issue of whether the ij reasonably concluded that chen failed to provide reasonably available corroborating evidence to support her claim.having reviewed the record and the arguments on appeal,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ij determinations,and we therefore deny chen petition for review.
background 
chen claims 
in her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,chen alleged that she was persecuted for violating china policy.because her husband belongs to an urban household,she asserted,the couple were permitted to have only one child,regardless of its gender.chen claimed that in november,a month after the birth of her first child,a daughter,she was ordered to wear an intrauterine device iud.when she refused,family planning officials went to her home and took her to have an iud forcibly inserted.chen alleged that she later went to a private doctor to have the iud removed because she wanted more children and,shortly thereafter,she became pregnant.she also asserted that in june,after she had missed her regular checkup,family planning cadres came to her home and forced her to go to a local hospital where,once her pregnancy was confirmed,she was forced to undergo an abortion.following the abortion,chen alleged,she had another iud forcibly inserted and,in may,she returned to the same private doctor she had seen previously to have her iud removed.she then went into hiding,fearing that the officials would find her again.on june,chen alleged,she and her husband fled from china to the united states,leaving their daughter behind with chen mother.
prior proceedings 
chen entered the united states on or about june,and was immediately apprehended.her husband,who arrived in the united states separately,was not apprehended.appearing before an ij on october,chen conceded removability and requested relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.she based her claims on her past encounters with chinese officials and her belief that she would be sterilized if she were made to return.chen appeared at a hearing on january,at which time she was approximately six months pregnant with her second child.for this reason,the ij continued the hearing to september,after the child birth.also at this hearing,the ij cautioned chen,through her attorney,that he expect ed her to produce her husband to provide corroborating testimony 
q and as far as testimony is concerned,i expect that the husband should be,going to be here testifying.correct 
a i would assume so,your honor.yes.
q i do assume it,i expect it,number one,counsel.
administrative record.chen later filed a proffer of witness form notifying the immigration court that her husband would testify on her behalf at the continued hearing about the persecution he and his wife suffered in china due to china coercive population control practices.id.at.
however,chen failed to produce her husband at the september hearing.the ij warned chen that her husband absence was extremely detrimental to her case.id.at.he continued,i explained that the last time and it clear that he one that knows exactly what happened to her in china.he got the best information for her.he can only support her case in this particular regard.id.chen attorney explained that chen husband chose not to appear out of fear that he would be apprehended as an undocumented alien.the ij rejected that explanation,stating that it does happen.unless somebody is wanted for a crime somewhere,it does not happen here.id.he then allowed chen a final opportunity to consider whether to go forward without her husband testimony.after consulting with her attorney,who informed her of the consequences of proceeding without her husband testimony,chen decided to continue with the hearing.
chen was the sole witness to testify at her hearing.the ij found that her testimony was insufficiently detailed and unpersuasive.specifically,he noted that 
the testimony is not detailed it is kind of cursory to say the least,including she just reread to us or told us the same thing that was contained in her affidavit.nothing further and nothing specific.the court had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of chen and had an opportunity to assess the credibility of her testimony.i find that her testimony is unreliable.
id.at.the ij noted certain inconsistencies in chen testimony,particularly with regard to the provenance of the documentary evidence she provided,and stated that m ost of this probably could have been straightened out by the husband testimony,but clearly we do not have that testimony.the husband is here in the united states and has not testified before this court.id.at.
with respect to the documentary evidence chen provided including a first child certificate,an only child certificate also referred to as an honor certificate,and her certificate of abortion the ij concluded that the evidence was equally suggestive of an elective abortion as of a coerced abortion and consistent with an individual who is trying to maintain this honor position sic of having only one child.id.at.none of the documents actually stated or compelled the inference that chen abortion was coerced.
the ij concluded that chen testimony on its own was insufficient to sustain her burden of proof and that the documentary evidence she provided was insufficient to make up for the testimony deficiency.id.at.therefore,without corroborating testimony from her husband,the ij ruled that chen had failed to satisfy her burden of proving her eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the cat.on appeal,the bia held that the ij had correctly determined that chen did not meet her burden of proof as to her requested forms of relief because her testimony was weak and she did not provide reasonably available corroborative evidence.id.at.because the bia did not pass on the ij credibility determination,the government moved in this court for a remand to the bia for an express ruling on that question.see note,ante.on remand,the bia held that the ij had not made an adverse credibility determination,and proceeded to affirm the ij judgment again,on the basis that chen had failed to meet her burden of proof.
on appeal,chen contests the bia conclusion that her testimony was weak and in need of additional corroboration and argues that,in any event,she provided sufficient corroborating evidence even absent her husband testimony.the government contends that,given chen vague and undetailed testimony,the ij properly demanded corroborating evidence,which chen failed to provide.at oral argument before us,the government stressed that chen husband was available to testify and was not made unavailable merely because he subjectively feared being apprehended.in support of its argument,counsel for the government noted that,under the derivative asylum provision,b a,chen husband would have been eligible to apply for adjustment of status if chen had been granted asylum,and therefore he had every incentive to testify on her behalf.chen counsel conceded that her husband would have qualified for derivative asylum,but argued that she should not be held responsible for her husband decision not to testify.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia has adopted the ij reasoning and offered additional commentary,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.james mukasey,cir consequently,when we refer to the ij decision or the ij reasoning,we refer to the decision of the ij as modified and affirmed by the bia.
