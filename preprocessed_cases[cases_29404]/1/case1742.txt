the court is asked to review final decisions of the benefits review board determining that galle notice of appeal to the board was timely and awarding a limited amount of compensation benefits under the longshore and harbor worker compensation act lhwca,et.plaintiff andrew galle appeals the board decision on the merits of his claim for disability benefits.galle argues that the board properly held that his notice of appeal from the alj decision was timely,but that the board erroneously limited his benefits by finding only a permanent partial disability,rather than a permanent total disability,by excluding certain medical services,and by refusing to award fees to galle representative.ingalls shipbuilding,ingalls and aetna casualty and surety company aetna,which is ingalls lhwca carrier,arguing that the board erroneously determined that galle notice of appeal to the board was timely,but that the board properly limited galle benefits.the director of the office of workers compensation programs owcp filed a brief limited to the question of whether galle filed a timely notice of appeal to the board.the director construes the relevant federal rules and regulations to require the conclusion that galle notice of appeal was timely.we agree,and affirm the board determination that galle filed a timely appeal with the board.we likewise affirm the board decision on the merits of galle claim for disability benefits.
background 
in november,galle was injured on the job when he tripped over debris left by other workers,and fell hard on his knee and right shoulder.galle filed this claim for compensation benefits under the lhwca in.see.in june,the alj held an evidentiary hearing on galle claim.on march,the alj issued a decision ordering ingalls and aetna to pay galle temporary total disability benefits from november until october,and permanent partial disability benefits from october forward.the alj excluded benefits for certain medical expenses claimed by galle,see,and ordered the defendants to pay certain penalties,see e.the decision was filed in the deputy commissioner office on april.see a compensation orders become effective when filed in the office of the deputy commissioner.galle moved for reconsideration,which was denied.see b permitting motions for reconsideration of an alj benefit determination.galle filed a timely appeal to the board.see.
in july,the board affirmed the alj decision,as modified to include additional benefits for medical services.on august,galle moved for reconsideration of the board decision.see i.shortly thereafter,in january,galle unexpectedly died.galle counsel withdrew and his widow,margaret galle,continued as his representative.in april,galle,represented pro se by his widow,filed a second motion for reconsideration of the board decision.in november,the board issued an order granting galle motion for reconsideration in part by changing the date upon which total temporary disability ended and permanent partial disability began from october to june,thus affording galle an additional twenty months of benefits for total disability.in january,galle filed a petition for review of the board decision with this court,see c,thus ending the first complete round of administrative review.
in january,and while the petition for review was pending in this court,the defendants filed a motion to alter or amend the november,board decision.the defendants motion was based upon new information indicating that galle may have sought for certain medical services,as to which compensation had been denied on the theory that he had not sought such.in october,the board granted that motion,remanding the case to the alj with instructions to receive evidence on the issue and to whether the challenged medical expenses were compensable on the basis of that evidence.in november,this court dismissed the pending petition for review on the basis of the board remand order.between february and november,galle filed several motions for reconsideration of certain aspects of the board october remand order.in december,the board issued an order stating that no further filings would be accepted by the board because the case was on remand to the alj.
on remand,the alj received evidence on the issue.on june,the alj issued an order expanding the award in galle favor by including some of the previously excluded medical expenses requested by galle.ingalls and aetna were ordered to pay interest on the additional amount.the alj also awarded galle for travel expenses associated with receiving medical care,and denied galle request for fees,which was based upon the premise that she was galle legal representative.on june,the decision was filed in the deputy commissioner office.
on july,galle filed a motion for reconsideration of the june,decision.the lhwca regulations recognizing the right to file a motion for reconsideration of an alj benefits determination provide that the motion must be filed not later than ten days from the date the alj decision or order was filed in the office of the deputy commissioner.b.the issue to be decided in this case is whether parties should exclude or include weekends and holidays when calculating that time period.galle and the director maintain,and the board held,that b time period must be calculated with reference to federal rule of civil procedure a,which excludes weekends and holidays from the time computation.the parties agree that,if rule a applies,galle motion for reconsideration was timely because it was filed before monday,july.the defendants maintain that b time period must be calculated with reference to,which requires that intervening weekends and holidays be included in the time computation.the parties agree that if applies,galle motion for reconsideration was untimely because it was not filed on or before june.
the alj denied galle july,motion for reconsideration on august.in the course of that denial,the alj stated that the motion was filed two days late,accepting the defendants position that b required that the motion be filed on or before june.the alj nonetheless addressed the merits of galle motion for reconsideration,stating that galle pro se status entitled him to some leniency in application of the controlling time period.the alj august,order denying galle july,motion for reconsideration was filed in the deputy commissioner office on august.
on september,galle filed an appeal of the alj decisions on remand.a notice of appeal to the board must be filed within thirty days from the date on which an alj decision or order is filed in the office of the deputy commissioner.see.failure to file within the proscribed period will foreclose all rights to review by the board,and an untimely notice of appeal will be summarily dismissed by the board for lack of jurisdiction.id.the time period is suspended,however,during the pendency of a timely filed motion for reconsideration of the alj decision.see a.
galle appeal to the board was filed more than days after the alj decision on remand,but only days after the alj denial of his motion for reconsideration.thus,galle september,notice of appeal to the board was timely if and only if his july,motion for reconsideration was also timely,and therefore effective to suspend the time period for filing an appeal.
on september,the board affirmed the alj decisions on remand.rather than to rely upon the alj theory that galle was entitled to leniency in the application of the filing period,however,the board held that galle motion for reconsideration before the alj,and thus,his appeal to the board,was timely filed because the time period in must be calculated using the computation method specified in federal rule of civil procedure a.the board then affirmed the alj disposition on the merits of galle claim.
galle moved for reconsideration of the board order to the extent it affirmed the alj decision on the merits of his disability benefits claim,which the board denied.see i.galle then filed a timely petition for review of the board decision with this court.see c.the defendants followed suit with a timely.
the case presents an important question of first impression concerning the interplay of specific regulations and federal rules when calculating the time period for filing a motion for reconsideration of an administrative law judge benefit determination under the lhwca.we begin with an analysis of the potentially controlling provisions.
department of labor dol regulations governing administrative review of lhwca claims for compensation benefits are divided into three regulatory parts defined by the pertinent level of administrative review.the first set of regulations is found at part.these regulations govern administration and procedure for lhwca claims before a district director.there is nothing in part recognizing any right to request reconsideration of an alj decision or order.
the second set of regulations is found at part.these regulations are captioned rules of practice and procedure for administrative hearings before the office of administrative law judges the oalj rules or regulations.section defines the scope of those rules as follows 
a general application.these rules of practice are generally applicable to adjudicatory proceedings before the office of administrative law judges,united states department of labor.such proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and the parties shall make every effort at each stage of a proceeding to avoid delay.to the extent that these rules may be inconsistent with a rule of special application as provided by statute,executive order,or regulation,the latter is controlling.the rules of civil procedure for the district courts of the united states shall be applied in any situation not provided for or controlled by these rules,or by any statute,executive order or regulation.
b waiver,modification,or suspension.upon notice to all parties,the administrative law judge may,with respect to matters pending before him or her,modify or waive any rule herein upon a determination that no party will be prejudiced and that the ends of justice will be served thereby.these rules may,from time to time,be suspended,modified or revoked in whole or part.
section provides a method for computing time periods specified under these rules.section provides,in relevant part 
a generally.in computing any period of time under these rules or in an order issued hereunder the time begins with the day following the act,event,or default,and includes the last day of the period,unless it is a saturday,sunday or legal holiday observed by the federal government in which case the time period includes the next business day.when the period of time prescribed is seven days or less,intermediate saturdays,sundays,and holidays shall be excluded in the computation.
b date of entry of orders.in computing any period of time involving the date of the entry of an order,the date of entry shall be the date the order is served by the chief docket clerk.
c computation of time for delivery by mail.
documents are not deemed filed until received by the chief clerk at the office of administrative law judges.however,when documents are filed by mail,five days shall be added to the prescribed period.
service of all documents other than complaints is deemed effected at the time of mailing.
whenever a party has the right or is required to take some action within a prescribed period after the service of a pleading,notice,or other document upon said party,and the pleading,notice or document is served upon said party by mail,five days shall be added to the prescribed period.
section adds five days to a prescribed filing period whenever the party files by mail,c,or the party is required to take action within a prescribed period after receiving service by mail,c.significantly,there is nothing in the oalj rules set out in part granting,defining,or limiting any right to request reconsideration of an alj decision.
the third set of regulations is found at part.these regulations the board rules set out the rules of practice and procedure governing the operation of the benefits review board,and apply to all appeals taken by any party from decisions or orders relating to the entitlement to compensation or benefits under the lhwca.a.section sets out the requirement that a notice of appeal to the board be filed within thirty days after the alj decision or order is filed in the office of the deputy commissioner.as set forth above,further provides that the board has no jurisdiction to consider an untimely appeal.see.immediately following is,the only regulatory provision in the dol scheme recognizing and defining the right to seek reconsideration of an alj decision.that provision,which is captioned e ffect of motion for reconsideration on time for appeal,provides,in relevant part 
a a timely motion for reconsideration of a decision or order of an administrative law judge or deputy commissioner shall suspend the running of the time for filing a notice of appeal.
b in a case involving a claim filed under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act or its extensions see b,a timely motion for reconsideration for purposes of paragraph a of this section is one which is filed not later than days from the date the decision or order was filed in the office of the deputy commissioner.
c if the motion for reconsideration is sent by mail and the fixing of the date of delivery as the date of filing would result in a loss or impairment of reconsideration rights,it will be considered to have been filed as of the date of mailing.the date appearing on the postal service postmark when available and legible shall be prima facie evidence of the date of mailing.if there is no such postmark or it is not legible,other evidence such as,but not limited to,certified mail receipts,certificates of service and affidavits may also be used to establish the mailing date.
we note that nothing in provides that the time period for filing motions for reconsideration is mandatory or that untimely motions will be summarily dismissed.specifying that the time period for appeal from the board decision is mandatory and jurisdictional.to the contrary,subsection c provides that the date of mailing,rather than the date of filing,may be used when the movant reconsideration rights would be otherwise impaired.
section sets out a computation of time rule for those matters governed by the board rules.the computation of time rule set out in the board rules is different from that set out in the oalj rules part.section provides 
a in computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules,by direction of the board,or by any applicable statute which does not provide otherwise,the day from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.the last day of the period so computed shall be included,unless it is a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday,in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday.
b whenever a paper is served on the board or on any party by mail,paragraph a of this section will be deemed complied with if the envelope containing the paper is postmarked by the postal service within the time period allowed,computed as in paragraph a of this section.if there is no such postmark,or it is not legible,other evidence,such as,but not limited to,certified mail receipts,certificate of service and affidavits,may be used to establish the mailing date.
c a waiver of the time limitations for filing a paper,other than a notice of appeal,may be requested by proper motion filed in accordance with and.
we note that recognizes a substantial amount of flexibility in filing periods.indeed,permits a motion requesting a waiver of any time period,aside from that defining the time period for an appeal to the board.
in sum,is the only dol regulatory provision recognizing the right to seek reconsideration of an alj benefit determination.that right is inextricably intertwined with the timing for and a party right to seek further review by the board.both the oalj rules found at part and the board rules found at part,specify a method for computing the time for filing documents governed by those rules.the computation rules,however,are different.the computation method specified in of the oalj rules requires that weekends and holidays be included when the time per
