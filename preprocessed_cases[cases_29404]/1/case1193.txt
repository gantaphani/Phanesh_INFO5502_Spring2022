in soltane united states department of justice,cir,we construed the statute governing the denial of a visa application,b,and held that a b ii did not strip the district court of jurisdiction to review this administrative decision.this appeal by jilin pharmaceutical usa,jilin usa and wei zhao from an order of the district court for the district of new jersey dismissing their complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not involve a denial of a visa application,but rather a revocation of a visa already granted.this requires us to compare the language of the separate statutes dealing with visa denial and revocation,and,having done so,we conclude that a distinction exists between the two statutes in the quanta of discretion conferred upon the secretary of homeland security.accordingly,we will affirm the order of the district court holding that we lack jurisdiction to review this discretionary determination.we will affirm also the court determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear appellants fifth amendment due process claims.
appellant wei zhao is a native and citizen of the people republic of china.appellant jilin usa,which was incorporated in in the state of new jersey,is a wholly owned united states subsidiary of jilin.in,jilin transferred zhao,who was manager of the company import and export division,from china to the united states to serve as president and chief executive officer of jilin usa.on july,in accordance with this plan,jilin usa filed an petition,form,on behalf of zhao to classify him as an intracompany transferee.the supporting documentation asserted that zhao was an executive employee of jilin and that he was transferring to jilin usa in an executive and managerial capacity,as defined at a a b.the immigration and naturalization service ins approved this request on october,granting zhao status until october.on november,the ins approved a petition to extend zhao status until october.
following approval of this second petition,on august,jilin usa filed a form immigrant petition for alien worker on behalf of zhao and sought to classify zhao under the visa category,which permits executive and managerial intracompany transferees to become permanent residents of the united states under b c.on december,the ins approved the petition and granted the visa.upon that approval of the form,on july,zhao and his immediate family filed form applications for adjustment of status from to that of lawful permanent resident.
on september,the ins notified jilin usa and zhao that it intended to revoke its prior approval of the form visa petition.the ins was unconvinced that zhao had been and would be employed in a primarily executive or managerial capacity.on april,the ins revoked zhao visa,noting that jilin usa and zhao had provided only a vague description of his job and had not established that he worked in an executive or managerial capacity.
jilin usa appealed to the office of administrative appeals oaa and submitted a more detailed description of zhao duties.on january,holding that the record contains insufficient evidence to demonstrate that zhao has been employed in a primarily managerial or executive capacity,the oaa affirmed the visa revocation and dismissed the appeal.the oaa subsequently denied jilin and zhao motion to reopen on august,
on november,jilin usa and zhao filed a complaint for mandatory and declaratory relief in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the complaint challenge d the legally incorrect and unjustifiable revocation of the approval of zhao visa petition.concerned about its jurisdiction,the district court ordered the parties to file briefs detailing the statutory provision giving rise to federal court jurisdiction to review the administrative decision to revoke zhao visa.both parties submitted timely responses 
holding that it was barred from asserting jurisdiction over visa revocations at the discretion of the attorney general even when the visa holder is already in the united states,the district court dismissed the complaint on february,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in making this determination,the district court observed that this was a matter of first impression in this circuit and accepted the analysis and conclusion of the court of appeals for the seventh circuit opinion in monica,cir holding that a b ii precludes judicial review of the revocation of a visa petition under.
arguing that the court had committed a clear error of law,that the controlling law had changed,and that a manifest injustice would result if the february decision were not reversed,jilin usa and zhao filed a motion for reargument with the district court on march.the primary focus in their motion was the court of appeals for the ninth circuit opinion in ana international,way,cir,in which the court rejected the seventh circuit logic and held that a b ii does not deny jurisdiction to review a revocation decision made pursuant to.the district court rejected the motion on may,concluding that was more persuasive than the analysis of ana international.this appeal followed 
when analyzing our jurisdiction to review the administrative decision to revoke a visa,the starting point for our discussion is found in the text of a b ii.therein,congress has dictated that no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
any decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a.
a b ii by its terms it therefore becomes necessary always to examine the authority for which is specified,that is to say,the statute setting forth the nature of the administrative discretion granted.
we now must compare the statute that was before this court in soltane with the one governing the case at bar.in soltane,the government contended that the following provision deprived the district court of jurisdiction to review the denial of a visa 
visas shall be made available,in a number not to exceed percent of such worldwide level,to qualified special immigrants described in a of which not more than may be made available in any fiscal year to special immigrants described in subclause ii or iii of a c ii ii or iii,and not more than may be made available in any fiscal year to special immigrants,excluding spouses and children,who are described in a m.
b emphasis added.we held that this language was not specific enough to vest unreviewable discretion in the attorney general.
we concluded that the key to a b ii lies in its requirement that the discretion giving rise to the jurisdictional bar must be specified by statute,and that whether such a specification has been made is determined by examining the statute as a whole.id.at emphasis added.we cautioned,however,that the use of marginally ambiguous statutory language,without more,is inadequate to specif y that a particular action is within the attorney general discretion for the purposes of a b ii.id.at.that an agency has discretion under chevron to interpret the statute it administers does not mean courts lack jurisdiction to review its interpretations.id.at.such ubiquitous discretion was not what congress intended by a b ii.id.indeed,if the term discretion were construed too broadly,it is hard to imagine any action by the attorney general under the relevant title that would not be deemed discretionary.id.at.
we now turn to the statute governing the revocation of a visa.it is found in 
the secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title.
even by a most cursory comparison of the statutes it is apparent that is away from the provision that was before us in soltane in terms of the discretion it specifies is in the hands of the secretary.that being so,we now address the central question now presented in this appeal,whether a b ii deprives courts of jurisdiction to review administrative decisions made pursuant to.
we are not the first court of appeals to address the applicability of the jurisdictional bar of a b ii to administrative decisions made pursuant to.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit first took up the visa revocation issue in,where the court observed that states that the attorney general may revoke approval of a petition,and may do so at any time.at.in the court view,t his language plainly signifies a discretionary decision.id.accordingly,it held that the discretionary nature of a revocation of approval is apparent from the plain language of.id.at.
in ana international,a split panel of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held otherwise.basing its analysis upon the premise that there is a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action,it first determined that it would give a narrow construction to a b.at quoting ins cyr,d.accordingly,it determined that the only acts immunized from review by are those constituting matters of pure discretion,rather than discretion guided by legal standards.id.quoting spencer,united states,cir.
addressing,the ana international court then held that within this statute congress clearly authorize d some measure of discretion by using the phrase may,at any time,for what he deems to be.id.at.but,by incorporating the good and sufficient cause language,the court also concluded that congress established a standard that restricts the discretion of the attorney general.id.after examining both ninth circuit and board of immigration appeals cases,the court decided that the good and sufficient cause language of furnishes a meaningful legal standard and that the attorney general right or power to revoke approval was not entirely within his judgment or conscience.id.citing tongatapu woodcraft hawaii,feldman,cir matter of tawfik,bia.
it also held that the decision to revoke the appellant visa was not only governed by,but also,because the petitioner initial petition and subsequent petition sought to classify him as a manager,by the definition of managerial capacity that is codified at a.it determined that this statutory definition further served to restrict the attorney general discretion because the determination of what constitutes a manager is not a discretionary decision,but rather one governed by an objective legal standard.id.at.accordingly,because of the good and sufficient cause language and the definition of manager at a,the court held that a b ii did not strip courts of jurisdiction to review decisions made by the attorney general pursuant to.
in a vigorous and,in our view,persuasive dissent,judge tallman rejected much of the ana international majority interpretation of and the provision interaction with a b ii.he wrote that a common sense reading of the language of,in conjunction with a b ii,leads ineluctably to the conclusion that the attorney general visa revocation decisions are discretionary.id.at tallman,dissenting.section did not limit revocations to good and sufficient cause,he reasoned,but rather to circumstances in which the attorney general deems there to be good and sufficient cause.id.at tallman,dissenting.if the statutory language may,at any time,for what he deems to be indicates a purely legal and hence decision such that review of the decision is permitted it is difficult to contemplate what would be an unreviewable discretionary act.id.at tallman,dissenting.
although this is a question of first impression for this court,we have nevertheless established general standards to determine when a decision is unreviewable under a b ii.in ashcroft,cir,we considered whether a b ii precluded courts from reviewing the attorney general denial of a waiver under c upon considering the language of c,we held that it explicitly assigns to the attorney general the discretion to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who demonstrates one of the three qualifications for waivers.id.at.significantly,unlike,which is devoid of any legal requirements,c contains several.nevertheless,in concluding that this statute still vests unreviewable discretion in the attorney general,we found it significant that the provision states that the attorney general may grant such a waiver,not that the attorney general shall grant such a waiver,making clear that the waiver may not be granted even if the legal requirements of the three waiver qualifications are met.id.at emphasis in original.moreover,we noted that n ot only may the attorney general make the decision to grant a waiver in her or his discretion,but the attorney general has the sole discretion to decide what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence.id.quoting c.consequently,we concluded that a b ii divested us of jurisdiction to consider the denial of waivers under c.less than four months later,we decided soltane.
appellants essential contention before us is that within the phrase good and sufficient cause is a nondiscretionary,reviewable statutory standard which must be met before the attorney general is free to exercise his discretion in revoking a petition.jilin usa br.at.although they concede that a b ii precludes review of discretionary decisions,they argue that rather than giving the attorney general limitless discretion to revoke approvals,the language of is intended to give the attorney general only a small degree of latitude in determining the revocability of a petition.id.at.in this case,they contend that the revocation was grounded on the clear and specific requirements of a a b that must be met in order to qualify as an executive or managerial employee,and we may therefore review that underlying statutory determination.id.at.absent a grant of complete discretion pursuant to,they argue,the jurisdictional bar of a b ii does not apply.
appellants argument ignores the plain language of.drawing from the lessons of and soltane,and examining in its entirety,we note several clear indications that the revocation of an approval of a petition is committed solely to administrative discretion.
first,states that the secretary of homeland security and,previously,the attorney general may revoke approval of a petition.teaches that such language is indicative of administrative discretion for purposes of a b ii.see at observing that the word may vests discretion in the attorney general see also zhu gonzales,citations and quotations omitted t he usual presumption is that may confers discretion.soltane,at stressing that the word shall in b makes the attorney general resulting determinations nondiscretionary.
second,states that approval may be revoked at any time.this too connotes a level of discretion,at ana int l,at firstland int l,at.indeed,as the court of appeals for the second circuit observed in firstland international,the discretion to revoke at any time had once been restricted by the notice requirement.at c,stat.at.congress elimination of this requirement strongly indicates an intent to strengthen the discretion of the secretary of homeland security to revoke approval of petitions.
third,permits revocation when the secretary deems there to be good and sufficient cause.this language indicates that congress committed to the secretary discretion the decision of when good and sufficient cause exists to revoke approval.zhu,at emphasis added holding that b b i,which allows the attorney general to waive a visa issuance requirement when the attorney general deems it to be in the national interest,comes within the reach of a b ii because it grants the attorney general the discretion to make that determination but see ana int l,at emphasizing the determination of what constitutes good and sufficient cause at the expense of explicit statutory language,deems that grants the secretary discretion to judge for himself what constitutes such cause.
tracking the ninth circuit logic in ana international,appellants argue that to determine good and sufficient cause,the attorney general must consider the definitions of manager and executive as codified at a a b.see ana int l,at stating that when the attorney general relies upon discrete legal factors in making a decision,the meaning of that particular legal classification nevertheless remains a re
