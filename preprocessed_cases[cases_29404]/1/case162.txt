petitioners carlos alberto lobo lobo and his children collectively,petitioners or lobos seek review of a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article iii of the united nations convention against torture cat.after careful consideration,we deny their petition for review.
background 
petitioners are natives and citizens of honduras who entered the united states without inspection on approximately october.we first turn our eyes to those events that transpired prior to the lobos border crossing,which are derived from lobo testimony before the immigration judge ij.
lobo and his family lived in san pedro sula,honduras,where lobo worked as a tax analyst and,following a promotion,as chief of the commercial department for the city.lobo lived and worked there for approximately twelve to thirteen years.lobo job responsibilities were equivalent to those of a tax collector he was in charge of ensuring that commercial establishments and merchants in the municipality of san pedro sula properly paid their taxes on time.if a business was unable to pay its taxes,it fell to lobo department to arrange a payment plan for the company to assure it would not default on its payments.
lobo control and monitoring of commercial establishments tax payments proved to be a demanding job.as tax evasion shadow cast ever wider over san pedro sula,lobo commonly had the responsibility of fining or closing businesses that failed to meet their tax obligations.perhaps true to form,one of the businesses that decided to take a gamble with its tax obligations was a casino operating in the municipality.by,the casino had failed to pay its taxes for the third time in three years,the overdue payments of which totaled approximately three and a half million dollars.with potential fraud flags flying,investigations commenced,with lobo leading the investigatory pack.
lobo probing uncovered the following details the casino was managed by a woman closely associated with the municipality and the casino was not being required to pay taxes due to continuing fraud within the relevant hierarchical governmental structure.lobo prepared a report of his findings and conclusions and distributed it to the casino and various government entities,including the municipality audit department,accounting department,and treasury department.
the report was,to put it lightly,not.soon after lobo report went public,lobo began to receive threats.in july of,his boss,josé dennis lagos lagos,began pressuring lobo to make the report disappear by threatening to make his job disappear.lobo declined lagos request.that same month,lobo began to receive threats at his home.
lobo testified that he received approximately five or six threats in total between july and september and that sometime during the course of these threats,lobo was fired from his job.lobo described his threats as follows two threats from lagos one threat from an attorney sent by lagos another threat from a woman whose relation to lobo or the municipality is unclear from the record who came to his house and aimed a gun to his chest and demanded money and another from persons whom lobo believed were sent by lagos who came to his house and threatened lobo and his family.lobo noted that the threats to his family were not just one occasion it was various times before he left honduras.lobo additionally testified that,after being fired from his job,he continued to receive threats at his home,whether over the phone or in person,and that immediately before he departed for the united states,he received a threat from an agent that worked with the dean who came to his house with a firearm lobo stated that he never reported these warnings for fear that those responsible for the confrontations might be associated with the authorities.
by late september,lobo had reached his breaking point.lobo left honduras along with his three children,crossing the mexican border and entering the united states without inspection on or about october.
on may,lobo filed an affirmative asylum application with the immigration and naturalization service ins,predecessor to the united states citizenship and immigration naturalization service uscis.in,an asylum officer at uscis interviewed lobo about his case.the officer subsequently referred his application to the immigration court.
on september,the department of homeland security dhs commenced removal proceedings against petitioners,issuing a notice to appear the notice to lobo and his three children.the dhs charged lobo and his children under a a i of the immigration and nationality act as aliens present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled following inspection.the notice stated that lobo and his children,citizens of honduras,had illegally entered the united states via texas on approximately october.
on january,petitioners appeared before the ij.at the hearing,petitioners admitted all facts,conceded removability,and acknowledged they would be seeking asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat lobo also testified at the hearing,recounting the aforementioned events underlying his reasons for fearing return to honduras.
on april,the ij,having considered petitioners applications and lobo testimony,denied their applications and ordered their removal.the ij concluded that lobo had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution to qualify for asylum.specifically,the ij determined that lobo evidence did not rise to a level sufficient to constitute persecution.the ij stated that no evidence showed the threats lobo received were likely to be carried out no harm in fact befell any of the lobos during the over threat period and no evidence showed that others in honduras had been harmed for failure to remain quiet in the face of corrupt business activities with the exception of lobo reference to a missing reporter,which the ij deemed too lacking in proof to be of any weight in lobo case.additionally,the ij noted that lobo had not been active in honduran politics prior to leaving,and his five brothers and mother had remained living in honduras unharmed,despite lobo contention that individuals,from time to time,asked as to his whereabouts which lobo asserted served as proof of an ongoing risk to his life and safety.
as to the withholding of removal claim,the ij held that because lobo could not establish a claim for asylum,he could not meet the higher standard of proof needed to make out a claim for withholding of removal the ij thus denied this claim as well.the ij similarly denied lobo request for cat relief,finding that lobo had failed to offer any proof that he risked facing torture should he return to honduras.lastly,the ij denied the remaining lobos applications,stating that because each of the is older than,they no longer ha ve a viable claim for derivative asylum in any event.
on may,the bia affirmed the ij decision dismissing petitioners appeal lobo then timely filed a petition for review with this court.
ii.discussion 
we begin with the applicable standard of review.because the bia here offered its own elucidations upon the ij reasoning,we review both decisions as a unit.arévalo girón holder,cir.our review requires us to adopt both a deferential and de novo stance.id.at.on the one hand,we apply the substantial evidence standard and defer to those findings of fact that are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.nikijuluw gonzales,cir quoting elias zacarias,internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,we review anew all legal conclusions,with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the governing statute.sok mukasey,cir.in the end,we may only set aside the agency determination if the evidence points unerringly in the opposite direction.laurent ashcroft,cir see also castillo díaz holder,cir noting reversal of agency decision only warranted if a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary quoting b b internal quotation marks omitted.
the evidentiary burden here lies with lobo to show that he is a refugee under the immigration laws.see b b i nikijuluw,at.to establish such qualification for asylum,lobo must demonstrate that he is unable to go back to honduras due to past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.hasan holder,cir quoting a a internal quotation marks omitted see also guerrero holder,cir.if a petitioner here,lobo clears the past persecution hurdle,he creates a rebuttable presumption that a fear of future persecution also endures.guerrero,at b.
persecution,a term of a more elusive character due to its lack of a specific definition under the immigration and nationality act,is better clarified by precedent.see nikijuluw,at the immigration and nationality act provides no precise definition of persecution,but t he case law is more informative.we have held that the term encompasses more than threats to life or freedom,but less than mere harassment or annoyance.sok,at quoting aguilar solís,cir.that is,the totality of the harm suffered must add up to more than mere discomfiture,unpleasantness,harassment,or unfair treatment.morgan holder,cir quoting nikijuluw,at internal quotation mark omitted.additionally,the source or administration of such harm must trace back at least on some level to governmental action or omission.see jorgji mukasey,cir noting the state must be the source of or at least acquiesce in the persecution harutyunyan gonzales,cir p ersecution always implies some connection to government action or inaction.
having laid the relevant legal groundwork,we turn to the agency determination that lobo did not suffer past persecution.we conclude that the agency decision passes the substantial evidence test.
lobo anchors his claim of past persecution in the approximately five or six incidents of threats or extortions lobo testified to receiving following his casino investigation in honduras recounted above.threats to one job,personal safety,or family are without question highly unsettling and.and while it is true that a showing of threats may be sufficient to establish past persecution,the presence or absence of physical harm and,indeed,the degree of harm inflicted remains a relevant factor in determining whether mistreatment rises to the level of persecution.gilca holder,wl,at cir.may,quoting ruíz mukasey,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the ij found with the bia largely adopting its findings that lobo received threats did not rise to the level of persecution because no evidence showed or suggested that such threats ever were at risk of being carried out,and the threats occurred over the course of an approximately period,with no harm ever befalling any of the lobos.we have recognized that h ollow threats,without more,certainly do not compel a finding of past persecution,gilca,wl,at quoting ang gonzales,cir,and that the absence of evidence of physical harm may plainly support the bia determination that nothing tantamount to persecution transpired.ruíz,at.given the lack of credibility or impendency to the threats at issue,including the absence of any harm actually betiding the lobos,the evidence does not compel a disturbance of the agency conclusion.see elias zacarias,at stating t o reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports the conclusion,but compels it emphasis in original.
moreover,the ij noted that lobo testimony as to such incidents contained inconsistencies including the nature and number of threats actually received,and the identities of those responsible for ordering or issuing such threats that,while not sufficient to warrant an adverse credibility finding,made it difficult to fully credit his testimony or to uphold his claim without further corroboration for instance,although lobo testified that at least one of his received warnings occurred at gunpoint with an accompanying threat of death or harm,the ij found such testimony to be inconsistent and lacking proof as to the plausibility of its actually being effectuated.gilca,wl,at.while any such warning is indubitably unsettling,credible verbal death threats may fall within the meaning of persecution only when the threats are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.vilela holder,cir internal citation omitted quoting bonilla mukasey,cir.as the ij determined and bia echoed,the threats here were not sufficiently credible or imminent to constitute persecution under applicable case law.ravix mukasey,cir.
lobo past persecution claim is deficient on another ground.the record here is devoid of evidence showing that the threats lobo received were linked to a statutorily protected ground,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the ij rejected lobo claim that he was being targeted based on political opinion or membership in a particular group,noting as to the former that lobo was not active in honduran politics and had not belonged to a honduran political party,and as to the latter that lobo had failed to specify as to which social group he might gap in the application that only lobo could fill the absence of any evidence that lobo was targeted on the basis of a protected ground,coupled with his failure to proffer evidence showing harm amounting to persecution,serves,here,as the tolling bell for lobo past persecution claim 
in sum,the agency determination that lobo could not show past persecution was supported by substantial evidence.whether the underlying threats are viewed in isolation or the collective,it was well within the agency aegis to conclude that such acts did not amount to past persecution.
because we affirm the agency determination as to past persecution,lobo asylum claim now rests upon whether he can independently establish that he has a fear of future persecution.nikijuluw,at see also b.to make such a showing,lobo must traverse two pathways he must demonstrate not only that he harbors a genuine fear of future persecution but also that his fear is objectively reasonable.negeya gonzales,cir.the ij determined,and the bia agreed,that while lobo may subjectively fear returning to honduras,his stated fear was not objectively reasonable.
specifically,the ij noted that approximately two decades had passed since lobo had left honduras.chávez oliva gonzales,app x,cir noting that petitioner absence from country for over a decade significantly decrease d the likelihood that he would be harmed on account of an alleged statutory ground.although lobo testified that the persons who threatened him still held government positions and were presently under investigation in honduras,the ij and bia noted lobo failure to provide any evidence in support of this contention,aside from unsubstantiated references to news that he seen through the computer and uncorroborated,statements from family members.we agree with the agency determination that this evidence or lack thereof does not rise to the level of specific proof generally required to establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.see,castillo díaz,at stating an alien can demonstrate directly her fear of future persecution where no rebuttable presumption is established through an offer of specific proof quoting romilus ashcroft,cir see also mukamusoni ashcroft,cir noting that t he subjective test of establishing a fear of future persecution requires the applicant to prove his fear is genuine,while the objective test requires showing by credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.
moreover,the ij reasoned,and the bia agreed,that the fact that lobo mother and siblings had continued to live in honduras following lobo departure,without suffering any harm aside from alleged inquiries from others as to lobo current whereabouts,weighed against a finding of persecution sufficient to qualify for asylum.we have often echoed that t he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien homeland undercuts the alien claim that persecution awaits his return.budiono mukasey,cir quoting ly mukasey,cir see also decky holder,cir lópez pérez,at aguilar solís,a
