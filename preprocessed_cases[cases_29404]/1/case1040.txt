opinion of the court 
carlen higgs is the subject of a final order of removal from the united states issued by an immigration judge.higgs filed a notice of appeal with the board of immigration appeals bia or board incorrectly identifying the appeal as one from an interlocutory ruling,rather than from a final order of removal.as a result,the board dismissed higgs appeal as moot.higgs filed the instant petition for review,challenging the board dismissal of his notice of appeal,the merits of the ij decision,and the enforceability of the order of removal.
for the reasons below,we conclude the board order is a final order within the meaning of a and that the board erred by failing to liberally construe higgs petition for review.we will therefore grant higgs petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
carlen higgs was born in the bahamas in and in was lawfully admitted into the united states as a permanent resident.in,higgs was charged with possession of and intent to deliver marijuana,in violation of pennsylvania law.con.stat.a,and knowing and intentional possession of a controlled substance,in violation of.con.stat.a.three years later,the government sought to remove higgs under two provisions of the immigration and naturalization act ina.under the ina,the government has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is deportable.c a.the government also sought removal pursuant to ina a b i which states 
any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state or the united states relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.
a b i.in addition,the government also invoked ina a a iii,which authorizes removal of a ny alien convicted of an aggravated felony.a a iii.
represented by counsel,higgs contested his removal on the ground that his prior convictions did not satisfy either provision.the immigration judge ij agreed,finding that higgs sustained only a conviction for possession of marijuana and thus was not removable under ina a a iii.after examining the state trial testimony,the ij also found that higgs was not removable under subsection b i because he possessed less than grams of marijuana.on november,the ij issued an order terminating the removal proceedings against higgs.
the government moved for reconsideration,and on november,the ij granted the motion.in so ruling,the ij explained that he had misunderstood the arresting officer trial testimony,and that in fact,he testified that higgs was arrested with bags of marijuana containing between grams and grams.therefore,higgs was removable under ina a b i.higgs then moved for reconsideration,arguing that the trial testimony was vague and confusing and did not establish the exact amount of marijuana.at.
on february,the ij issued a third order,described as an interlocutory ruling,noting the uncertainty regarding the weight of the marijuana attributable to higgs.based on this uncertainty,the ij ordered the government to obtain a copy of the property receipt that itemized the seized marijuana,in the hopes that the receipt would conclusively prove the amount of marijuana at issue.at.the government submitted the receipt,and on march,the ij issued a fourth order,styled as an interlocutory ruling on motion,finding in the government favor.the ij explained that 
the trial transcript was certainly not the modicum of clarity.a review of the chemistry report verifies the substance confiscated from higgs as marijuana,but only verified a total amount of grams of marijuana from five separate baggies out of a total of baggies found on higgs person.
t he court is constrained to concur with government counsel that there was no need for the laboratory to perform an analysis on all of the baggies once the marijuana was confirmed o ne may reasonably presume that the remainder of the baggies which were not tested by the laboratory also contained marijuana.that is,it stretches credulity to believe that only the baggies chosen for random testing contained marijuana and the remainder might not have.
thus the ij concluded that higgs possessed over grams of marijuana at the time of his arrest.following this fourth ruling,the ij issued a final order of removal on may.this fifth,and last,order was purely administrative in nature and did not contain any reasoning or further explanation of the ij decision.it also noted that higgs was reserving his right to appeal,and that his notice of appeal was due by june.
on may,proceeding pro se higgs filed a notice of appeal and a motion for emergency stay of removal.in the section of the notice asking for the date of the decision in a merits proceeding being appealed,higgs wrote march.at.higgs also identified three reasons for his appeal the ij erroneous factual determination that higgs possessed over grams of marijuana,thus making him eligible for removal under ina a b i the need for clarification of the government burden under the clear and convincing evidence standard and,relatedly,clarification on the relationship between the government burden of proof,the rule of lenity and the rule granting presumption to a liens.at.
higgs first notice of appeal was rejected by the bia as because the form lacked the necessary first page.higgs his notice of appeal,but that appeal too was dismissed.in its ruling issued july,the bia determined that,because higgs notice of appeal identified the ij march,interlocutory ruling as the subject of its appeal,the petitioner had filed an interlocutory appeal.noting that the basis for the interlocutory appeal had been superceded by a final order of removal,the board found higgs interlocutory appeal to be moot and dismissed it.at.
higgs timely filed this petition for review.he also sought a stay of the removal proceedings,which this court granted.in this petition for review,higgs argues that the bia erred in failing to construe his notice of appeal liberally.as to the merits of his removal,higgs first submits that the ij erred in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence that he possessed more than grams of marijuana and was therefore ineligible for removal pursuant to ina a b i.next,higgs contends that the order removing him to the bahamas can not be enforced because,by operation of law,he is not a bahamian citizen 
the government raises two challenges to our jurisdiction in this case,which we review de novo.hoxha holder,cir citing singh ashcroft,cir.in its motion to dismiss,the government maintains that we lack jurisdiction over this petition because the bia order of dismissal is not a final order within section a because it did not adjudicate higgs removability and did not affirm the may,decision,which was the final order of removal in the instant case.gov t mot.dismiss at.in addition,the government contends that we lack jurisdiction because higgs has not exhausted his administrative remedies.we disagree.
our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal is set forth in a.under that provision,we may review only a final order of removal.id.emphasis added see also khouzam att y,cir.we have taken a broad view of what constitutes a final order of removal under section.in yusupov attorney general,we stated our agree ment with the decisions of several of our sister circuit courts of appeals conclud ing that an order is final for jurisdictional purposes when a removability determination has been made that is no longer appealable to the bia,regardless of whether a formal order of removal has been entered,cir see also shehu att y,cir denial of a petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture constitutes a final order of removal within the meaning of section,because the alien is entitled to no further process before deportation.
in khouzam,we found an agency action that made the deportation of an alien a certainty constituted a final order of removal.at.in that case,following a ruling by the second circuit granting the petitioner a deferral
