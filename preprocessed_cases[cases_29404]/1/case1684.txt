background 
appellant robinson worked as a sales representative for glazer wholesale drug company,glazer,a wholesale distributor of alcoholic beverages.robinson job required him to drive to miles per week.in march of,robinson suffered a stroke,which permanently impaired the peripheral vision in his right eye.his doctors advised that it would be dangerous for him to drive.
unable to continue at his position with glazer,robinson applied to appellee aetna for disability benefits.aetna served as the administrator and insurer for glazer employee welfare benefits plan the plan.the plan provides disability benefits when beneficiaries are totally disabled.the plan further explains that beneficiaries are totally disabled when they are unable to perform the material duties of their own occupation s.in august of,aetna concluded that robinson qualified as totally disabled.it determined that robinson could not perform the material duties of a field sales rep because that job required him to drive of the time.consequently,aetna approved robinson claim for benefits.
eighteen months later,aetna received an attending physician statement from robinson treating physician,isaac loose.a question on the form asked what restrictions the physician had placed on the patient.as examples,the form listed activities of daily living,driving,lifting,pulling,pushing,and amounts,in response,loose wrote,none.he also wrote that robinson had no restrictions due to ocular history.construing this as an indication that robinson condition had improved,aetna terminated robinson benefits.robinson asked aetna to review this decision.
robinson appeal included a new letter from loose,which clarified or corrected the attending physician statement.the letter concluded,driving is hazardous for this patient especially in heavy traffic areas.please review his disability benefits.robinson also included a letter from another treating physician,armitage harper,who similarly wrote,it is unsafe for robinson to drive any vehicle with this visual field loss.seeking to resolve the apparent discrepancy between loose two statements,aetna referred robinson file to one of its own physicians,oyebode taiwo.taiwo determined that robinson condition was serious and permanent and that he was incapacitated from any occupation which required the operation of a motor vehicle.
considering this evidence on review,aetna upheld the termination but changed its reasons for the decision.it explained to robinson by letter that it had spoken to a vocational consultant and determined that driving was not a material duty of a sales in the general economy.the administrative record does not reflect that aetna contacted a vocational consultant.in its review letter,aetna told robinson that he had exhausted his administrative remedies.
robinson sued under the employee retirement income security act erisa to recover benefits due to him under the terms of the plan.a b.at the close of discovery,aetna moved for summary judgment.on march,the district court granted aetna motion,and this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews summary judgments de novo in erisa cases,applying the same standards as a district court.see baker metropolitan life,cir.
iii.discussion 
procedural challenge to aetna review 
robinson complains that aetna failed to follow procedures.in relevant part,erisa provides 
in accordance with regulations of the secretary,every employee benefit plan shall 
provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant,and 
afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
challenges to erisa procedures are evaluated under the substantial compliance standard.see lacy fulbright jaworski,cir hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir marks newcourt credit group,cir.this means that t echnical noncompliance with erisa procedures will be excused so long as the purposes of section have been fulfilled.white aetna life ins.
robinson argues that he was denied the full and fair review mandated by section in two ways.first,he points out that aetna did not provide review of its specific basis for rejecting his claim.second,he highlights aetna failure to identify the vocational expert upon whom it allegedly relied.
aetna specific reason for terminating robinson benefits has never been reviewed at the administrative level.aetna initially notified robinson that it terminated his benefits because it believed he was able to drive.upon review,aetna changed its reasoning.aetna informed robinson for the first time in its review letter that it had determined his occupation did not require driving and told robinson that he had exhausted his administrative remedies.robinson never had an opportunity to contest at the administrative level this new basis for terminating his benefits.aetna points out that it did review the ultimate decision that robinson was not totally disabled.it argues that this was sufficient.we disagree and hold that section requires an administrator to provide review of the specific ground for an adverse benefits decision.
subsection mandate that the claimant be specifically notified of the reasons for an administrator decision suggests that it is those specific reasons rather than the termination of benefits generally that must be reviewed under subsection.see mccartha city,cir holding that an administrator failed to substantially comply with section where the initial notice of termination failed to state one of the grounds on which it ultimately relied.furthermore,this court has previously read the two subsections of section as complementing each other.in schadler anthem life insurance,this court explained that the requirement that the administrator disclose the basis for its decision is necessary so that beneficiaries can adequately prepare for any further administrative review,cir internal punctuation omitted.the notice requirements of erisa help ensure the meaningful review contemplated by subsection.id.quoting halpin grainger,cir see hackett,at stating that effective review requires a clear and precise understanding of the grounds for the administrator position.additionally,mandating review of the specific ground for a termination is consistent with our policy of encouraging the parties to make a serious effort to resolve their dispute at the administrator level before filing suit in district court.see vega life ins,cir en banc.thus,aetna failed to comply with section when it terminated robinson benefits without reviewing the specific ground for that decision.
in his second section argument,robinson faults aetna for not disclosing its vocational consultant.erisa regulations require administrators to p rovide for the identification of vocational experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with a claimant adverse benefits determination h iv.furthermore,the procedures governing disability plans will not be deemed to provide a claimant with a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of a claim and adverse benefit determination unless they comply with the regulation requiring disclosure of vocational experts.h.aetna failed to comply with this regulation.
aetna does not directly dispute robinson claim that it violated erisa reg
