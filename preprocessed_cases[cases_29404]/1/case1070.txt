chen,a native and citizen of china,fujian province,entered the united states in without inspection.chen,also from china,fujian province,entered in without inspection.the couple married here in and have had two sons,born in and,both united states citizens.in,after the department of homeland security served notices to appear,petitioners conceded their removability before an immigration judge ij.they applied for asylum,withholding of removal,convention against torture cat relief,and,alternatively,voluntary departure.chen,the lead applicant and sole witness to testify before the that they fear persecution upon return to china for having violated the policy in that chen will be forcibly sterilized face economic persecution 
the ij denied relief.among other things,the ij found that chen stated desire to have a third child upon return to china is speculative,and that,under the holding in matter of,bia,she failed to show a fear that she would be forcibly sterilized upon returning with her two united states citizen children.the ij also denied withholding of removal and found no evidence showing a likelihood that chen will be subjected to torture upon return.
petitioners filed a motion with the ij to reopen the record and for reconsideration.they submitted an affidavit from an aunt of chen,who stated that she was forcibly sterilized upon returning to china with two children that she had while in japan.the ij denied petitioners motion,noting that they had ample opportunity to present all evidence at the merits hearing,and that the evidence from the aunt was available and could have been presented previously.
the bia affirmed and dismissed petitioners appeal,finding that petitioners failed to show an objective,fear of persecution.the bia agreed with the ij that petitioners do not warrant asylum based on the birth of their two children,and it rejected petitioners efforts to distinguish their case from matter of.the bia rejected,in particular,the argument that petitioners children will be considered chinese citizens for purposes of enforcing population control policy.the bia also affirmed the ij decision to reject,for lack of authentication,a letter that chen mother purportedly had obtained from the local village committee which indicated that chen would be sterilized upon return.further,the bia found no evidence to support petitioners claim that they may suffer economic persecution,and it held that chen had failed to show that she is likely to be tortured,either because she gave birth to two children or because she illegally emigrated.finally,the bia denied petitioners request for a remand so that the ij could consider evidence regarding the aunt sterilization,holding that the ij properly refused to reopen the proceedings to consider evidence that was previously available.petitioners timely filed a petition for review in this court.
we have jurisdiction under a.our review is of the bia decision,although we also review the ij decision to the extent that the bia adopted or deferred to the ij analysis.zhang gonzales,cir.we review factual findings,including findings of persecution and fear of persecution,under the substantial evidence standard.sandie att y,cir.under this deferential standard,findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.id.quotation marks omitted.
petitioners argue that chen established that her fear of future persecution is.they contend that the bia and the ij engaged in generic reliance on the holding in matter of and failed to consider evidence showing that petitioners children will be treated as chinese citizens,which gives rise to their fear that chen will be sterilized or subjected to onerous fines for having had more than one child.petitioners br.at.
the bia recent opinion in matter of,bia,contains a comprehensive discussion that persuasively addresses many of the issues before us.this court has not previously considered in a precedential opinion the bia latest view of this issue.
the respondents there,like the chens here,were natives and citizens of china who hailed from the fujian province and had two united states citizen children.id.at.they claimed that if they returned to china,and specifically the fujian province,the female respondent would be subject to forced sterilization as well as a significant fine.id.the ij agreed and granted the respondent application for asylum.id.the bia vacated the opinion of the ij,concluding that the respondent had not shown that she possessed a fear of forcible sterilization or other sanctions rising to the level of persecution.id.at.
in doing so,the bia noted that state department reports on country conditions,including the profiles of asylum claims country conditions,are highly probative evidence and are usually the best source of information on conditions in foreign nations.id.at.with respect to the discussion of forced sterilization in china and fujian province in particular,in the may china profile of asylum claims and country conditions profile,the bia stated 
although acknowledging that there were reportedly forced sterilizations in fujian in,the state department observes that consulate general officials visiting fujian have found that coercion through public and other pressure has been used,but they did not find any cases of physical force employed in connection with abortion or sterilization.in interviews with visa applicants from fujian representing a wide of society,consulate general officers have noted that many violators of the policy paid fines,but they found no evidence of forced abortion or property confiscation.according to the fujian provincial birth planning committee,there have been no cases of forced abortion or sterilization in fujian in the last years.

similarly,with respect to the profile discussion regarding the economic sanctions that might be imposed,the bia stated 
the state department profile indicates that an economic penalty in the form of a social compensation fee may be imposed upon a birth planning violator.however,the respondent has not met her burden of establishing that payment of such a fee would put her at such a severe economic disadvantage that it would amount to persecution.the profile indicates that there is wide variation in the amount of social compensation fees and the severity of hardship they impose for births.it also notes that couples unable to pay the fee immediately may be allowed to pay in installments.
id.at internal citations omitted.
in sum,the bia in matter of concluded that the evidence presented indicates that physical coercion to achieve compliance with family planning goals is uncommon and unsanctioned by china national laws and that the overall policy is much more heavily reliant on incentives and economic penalties.id.at.with regard to those incentives and penalties,the bia held that the respondent has not shown that her locality represents a current exception to the general rules in which the chinese government relies on a variety of measures short of persecution to enforce its population control policy.id.
with matter of in mind,we find substantial evidence in the record here to support the denial of asylum.to establish eligibility for asylum,petitioners had to prove either past persecution which they have not claimed or a fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily enumerated ground.att y,cir.a fear must be both subjectively and objectively reasonable.id.at.to establish objective reasonableness,petitioners must show that a reasonable person in the alien circumstances would fear persecution if returned to china.zubeda ashcroft,cir.a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to abort a pregnancy or undergo involuntary sterilization or is subject to persecution
