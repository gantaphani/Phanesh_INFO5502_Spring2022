friends of back bay,together with back bay restoration foundation,the plaintiffs below,appeal the district court award of summary judgment to defendants united states army corps of engineers the corps,secretary of the army john mchugh,the commanding general of the corps,robert van antwerp,and colonel andrew backus,the district engineer for the corps in its norfolk district.the plaintiffs complaint challenged the corps decision to approve a permit under section of the clean water act cwa,and section of the rivers and harbors act of rha,to build a mooring facility and concrete boat ramp about feet from the back bay national wildlife refuge the refuge in virginia beach,virginia.as set forth below,we vacate the district court judgment and remand.
proposed by developer kenneth douglas wilkins,the permitted project the project or the wilkins project in a cove off north and shipps bays,tributaries to back bay,would expand to from the number of existing slips at the same site,the additional being dedicated for watercraft use primarily by residents of nearby condominiums.the approved permit directly authorizes channel dredging,as well as the excavation and relocation within the project area of silt and other material.see a empowering secretary of the army to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters of the united states.in addition,the permit provides for the construction of bulkheads,piers,mooring piles,and a walkway in conjunction with the slips and ramp.see requiring approval of secretary for,inter alia,creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by congress to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the united states.
in mitigation of vegetated wetlands cleared to make way for the facility,the permit specifies the creation of equivalent wetlands nearby,and it requires the relocation there of the plants being displaced by the new construction.the permit also attaches a number of operational conditions to the completed project,including horsepower limitations on boat motors,restrictions on who may use the facility,and the installation of signs informing the public of the establishment of a zone the nwz for watercraft within the refuge.see 
prior to issuing the permit,the corps solicited public comment on the underlying application it received over responses,the overwhelming majority of which were in opposition to the project.the mayor of virginia beach recounted that various state and federal government agencies had expended countless millions of dollars to conserve back bay,and she expressed concern that detrimental environmental impacts would result from greatly increase d access for jet skis and powerboats to the ecologically sensitive area.
in considerably more detail,the gloucester,virginia,field office of the united states fish and wildlife service the fws documented the historical efforts to preserve and restore submerged aquatic vegetation sav in the area.the fws surmised that well documented adverse effects of motorized watercraft,such as sediment resuspension,water pollution,shoreline erosion,destruction of sav and other wetlands,and disturbance to fish and wildlife,would increase if the wilkins project were fully realized,and predicted that because back bay is a shallow water system,these effects are likely to be amplified.id.at the regional director of the fws followed up with a separate comment,in which he maintained that the discharges occasioned by the project will have a substantial and unacceptable impact on aquatic resources of national importance,and that,consequently,the subject permit must be modified,conditioned,or denied.id.at.
similar sentiments were echoed by the virginia department of game and inland fisheries warning that restoration efforts will face even more challenges in this unique system and may ultimately be rendered unsuccessful,and the federal environmental protection agency professing its belief that the proposed project is contradictory to the environmental goals of several federal,state,and local resource agencies and the public interests,and thus strongly recommends that the corps deny the applicant request for permits,id.at.the fws likewise supported denial of this project as proposed,id.at,but suggested that if the corps were inclined to proceed,it should prepare an environmental impact statement eis to address impacts to federal trust resources due to project construction and operation,habitat loss,and of migratory pathways and feeding and resting areas.id.at.
an eis is a detailed statement that ascertains,among other things,the effect of the proposed action on the environment,including any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,and evaluates alternatives.c.as an integral underpinning of the national environmental protection act nepa,an eis must be devised in connection with every recommendation or report on proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.see state ex rel.campbell,cir.to determine whether a particular action meets the threshold of significantly affecting environmental quality,federal agencies are required to draft an environmental assessment ea,which is a concise public document designed to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a finding of no significant impact fonsi.a see campbell,at.
in its march,public notice of the permit application,the corps announced its preliminary determination that no eis will be required.in light of the fws comments advocating for denial or,at a minimum,urging preparation of an eis,the corps broached the concept of the nwz,which it could create through designating the project vicinity a temporary restricted area an internal memorandum dated june,reflected the corps understanding that the fws indicated that implementation of the nwz regulation should alleviate many of their concerns and that they will likely withdraw their objection to the wilkins project once this plan is in effect.id.at.
the nwz went into effect that same day by virtue of a local order,for which public notice was subsequently provided on june.therein,the corps recognized that watercraft use in and around the refuge was adversely impacting sav and nesting,feeding and breeding birds as well as causing shoreline erosion from boat wakes.id.at.according to the corps,the nwz would secure a significant measure of protection to the refuge and its resources.id.the local order expired on december,after which the corps made permanent the restricted area designation,effective may.the official corps memoranda issued in connection with the temporary and permanent designations each provided that the nwz 
may be enforced by any federal agency,state,local or county law enforcement agency,or private security firms in the employment of the corps or fish and wildlife service so long as the entity undertaking enforcement action has the legal authority to do so under the appropriate federal,state,or local laws.
as a practical matter,however,enforcement of the nwz appears to be problematic.in the course of interagency discussions of the project in,it was revealed that the marine detachment of the virginia beach police department was unable to routinely patrol the back bay due to current staffing constraints.responding to the continuing concerns expressed by the fws,colonel dionysios anninos,the district commander for the corps,conceded on september,that e nforcement will be an issue,but he was hopeful that compliance with the nwz would be achieved through education,signage,and public pressure.id.at.colonel anninos insisted,however,that the lack of funding necessary for a state or federal agency to fulfill obligations is not a sufficient reason to deny a project.id.
by letter of october,the fws regional office memorialized the agency ongoing discussions with the corps concerning the wilkins project.although the fws acknowledged that details of the measures are still to be worked out,its acquiescence in the project was conditioned on a dequate funding for the enforcement of the nwz,with further discussions to be conducted as to the proper allocation of r esponsibility of enforcement and cost share funds.on october,colonel anninos wrote to his district regulatory section,explaining that the corps coordination with the fws had addressed the latter agency concerns.see id.at.that same date,the corps issued the permit.
the permit,however,neither mandates enforcement of the nwz nor guarantees funding therefor.aside from requiring that signage be posted,the permit specifies only that wilkins serve on and participate in a committee of local,state and federal agencies and community stakeholders to attempt to establish a funding program for enforcement of the nwz in back bay.the permit identifies several potential sources for such funding,including grants,assessments,and user fees,and notes that wilkins also may be required to contribute a fair and equitable portion of the funding for this program.id.at.
in the final ea,issued contemporaneously with the permit,colonel anninos,on behalf of the corps,reiterated the consensus that the currently unrestricted use of the waters in and around the refuge may be having an adverse impact on the sensitive and unique natural resources of the refuge and back bay as a whole.the corps observed,however,that refusing the permit would not solve existing and future problems associated with recreational boating in back bay,and insisted that denying this proposal would logically necessitate the denial of all future private piers,boat ramps and mooring projects in back bay due to the potential for cumulative impacts.id.at.notwithstanding that there are no city or state maritime patrols within the bay,id.at,the corps asserted that the nwz will limit and reduce any adverse impacts from the construction and operation of the facility,id.at.the ea culminated in a fonsi,thus declaring that no eis will be prepared.id.at.
the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court for the district of columbia on december,seeking review of the corps decision,in accordance with of the cwa,to allow the dredging and subsequent discharge via relocation of silt and fill material,and challenging the corps determination that issuance of the permit does not qualify under nepa as a federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,such that an eis must be prepared in advance.on the defendants motion,and over the plaintiffs opposition,venue was subsequently transferred to the eastern district of virginia.
the district court exercised jurisdiction over both aspects of the complaint pursuant to the general review provisions of the administrative procedure act apa.see,ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir instructing that c laims challenging federal agency action under the cwa and nepa are subject to judicial review under the apa.the court directed the filing of the administrative record,after which the parties submitted for summary judgment.following a hearing on january,the district court,by its opinion and order of february,entered judgment on behalf of the defendants.
in so doing,the district court rejected the plaintiffs contention that potential harm to the refuge from boating activities could properly be considered a legitimate secondary effect of the dredging and filling authorized pursuant to the cwa.see friends of back bay army corps of eng rs,cv,slip op.at.with respect to the nepa challenge,the court concluded that the corps decision to grant the permit without preparing an eis was within the agency broad discretion and not contrary to law.see id.at.upon timely notice filed on february,the plaintiffs pursue this appeal.
the apa provides that a reviewing court is bound to hold unlawful and set aside agency action for certain specified reasons,including whenever the challenged act is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir.the foregoing statutory criteria render our oversight highly deferential,with a presumption in favor of finding the agency action valid,yet the standard does not reduce judicial review to a rubber stamp of agency action.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
to comply with nepa,federal agencies must take a hard look at the potential environmental consequences of their actions.aracoma coal,at citation omitted.in a similar fashion,we must engage in a searching and careful inquiry of the record,so that we may consider whether the agency considered the relevant factors and whether a clear error of judgment was made.id.at quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe.insofar as an agency decision may be deemed unreasonable as a matter of law,it is likely to have been arbitrary and capricious.see marsh oregon natural res.council,noting courts adoption of arbitrary and capricious and reasonableness standards under the apa,and explaining that difference between the two is not of great pragmatic consequence.we evaluate the reasonableness of the corps decisionmaking de novo,without deference to the district court resolution of the issue.see hughes river watershed conservancy glickman,cir.
the parties devoted much effort below,and have again on appeal,debating how to properly characterize the ea.according to the plaintiffs,the corps found at the threshold that granting the permit would affect the environment to the degree necessary to trigger the need for an eis,but that establishment of the nwz would ameliorate the adverse effects such that the net result would be no significant impact.when an agency relies on such a mitigated fonsi,it may avoid preparing an eis.see ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir.in support of their position,the plaintiffs point out that the permit application caused the corps to examine and appreciate the problems associated with watercraft use in back bay the project thus spurred the corps decision to designate the refuge as a restricted area and impose the nwz.
the defendants,to the contrary,maintain that because the nwz was in effect for nearly two years prior to issuance of the ea,it constituted a baseline condition reflecting the state of the environment absent any undertaking pursuant to the permit.see wildlife fed dep t of,wl cir.may,at equating baseline with no action eis alternative mandated for consideration by d.as such,the argument goes,the corps considered from a historical perspective albeit a somewhat brief one the issues giving rise to its creation of the restricted area and the efficacy of the nwz in resolving those issues,but nonetheless concluded that a fonsi was appropriate.
the parties perceive the distinction important in light of pertinent authorities requiring that assumptions underlying a mitigated fonsi be supported by record evidence.see,hill boy,cir ruling corps refusal to prepare eis arbitrary and capricious where no evidence supported key mitigation assumption and no analysis conducted gauging effect of opposite assumption audubon soc y hoffman.cir concluding that forest service arbitrarily and capriciously bypassed eis where record failed to establish likely efficacy of mitigation proposal.an unjustified leap of logic or unwarranted assumption,however,can erode any pillar underpinning an agency action,whether constructed from the or the.once the roof caves in,it offers but a smattering of solace to explain that only the latter were inspected and deemed sound.
a material misapprehension of the baseline conditions existing in advance of an agency action can lay the groundwork for an arbitrary and capricious decision.we recently confronted precisely that situation in north carolina wildlife federation,supra.there,the federal and state agencies charged with evaluating the construction of a proposed toll highway erroneously adopted the assumption that the road would be built in estimating the consequences resulting from no action being taken.in light of the obvious and fundamental blunder,we had no difficulty remanding the matter for reconsideration,noting that courts not infrequently find nepa violations when an agency miscalculates the no build baseline or when the baseline assumes the existence of a proposed project.wildlife fed n,wl,at citati
