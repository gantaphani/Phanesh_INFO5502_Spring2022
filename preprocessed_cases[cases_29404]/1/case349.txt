after the department of homeland security dhs,through its division of citizenship and immigration services cis,denied a petition for renewal of a nonimmigrant specialty occupation visa,the petitioner,royal siam corporation rsc,together with the affected worker,surasak srisang,brought a civil action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico in hopes of reversing cis decision.those hopes were never realized.after some procedural backing and filling,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants all government agencies or actors.see royal siam ridge,d.upon careful consideration of the plaintiffs appeal,we affirm.
background 
we assume the reader familiarity with the district court opinion and,thus,content ourselves with a sketch of the pertinent facts and travel of the case.
rsc owns and operates an upscale thai restaurant in carolina,puerto rico.on a petition filed by rsc predecessor in interest in,thai national who purportedly possessed the equivalent of a bachelor degree in business a specialty occupation visa colloquially known as an visa.this nonimmigrant visa allowed him to enter the united states for a period in order to work as a restaurant manager.srisang availed himself of the opportunity.
in,with srisang visa due to expire,rsc sought its renewal.during the course of its review,cis advised rsc of its doubts about the petition.on october,the agency issued a request for additional proof,noting that the evidence submitted is not sufficient to establish that the job is specialty in scope.although rsc made a supplemental submission,cis eventually denied the petition.on administrative review,cis appeals office upheld the denial 
rsc and srisang thereupon commenced this action,posturing it as a request for review of a final agency decision under the administrative procedure act apa.in their complaint,they sought declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court stayed removal proceedings against srisang.in due course,the court,while retaining jurisdiction,remanded the case to cis for a fuller explanation of its decision.the district court found the cryptic quality of the original decision especially troubling in light of the agency approval of an visa petition for what the court deemed to be an equivalent position.
on remand,cis reaffirmed its previous denial of the petition.in explaining its decision,cis observed that it now regarded its grant of the petition which rested on similar data as plainly erroneous because the job,as described by rsc predecessor in interest,did not qualify as a specialty occupation.see a h i b,i h iii a.a job does not qualify as a specialty occupation unless it satisfies an amalgam of criteria that relate to educational requirements,complexity of the work,the specialized nature of the duties to be performed,and the like.see h iii a.in this case,the agency concluded that the proof submitted did not establish that the restaurant manager in or in a specialty occupation within the purview of these criteria.
cis explanation did not stop there.the agency noted that its approval of the earlier petition had been erroneous for another reason as well.in,cis had found srisang marriage to a united states citizen fraudulent,that is,entered into for the purpose of circumventing the immigration laws.citing c,cis expressed the view that because srisang had engaged in marriage fraud,he was statutorily ineligible for a specialty occupation visa.
the circumstances attendant to this alternate ground of decision are not in dispute.the marriage occurred in.as a result,srisang was conditionally granted lawful permanent resident status.in,srisang sought to make that status unconditional.following an investigation,however,cis found the marriage fraudulent a finding that srisang does not now contest.withal,the government left hand obviously did not appreciate what the right hand was doing.although the marriage fraud finding was brought to cis attention in connection with the specialty occupation visa petition,the agency had,in an apparent oversight,approved that petition 
with cis detailed amplification of the binary grounds for rejection of the visa petition in hand,the district court ruled that the denial was neither arbitrary nor capricious.see royal siam,d at.accordingly,the court entered summary judgment in the defendants favor.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,rsc and srisang attack both of the reasons advanced by cis in support of its decision.first,they maintain that the restaurant manager position qualifies as a specialty occupation and that cis,in failing to reach this conclusion,acted arbitrarily.second,they posit that the marriage fraud bar does not apply in cases involving nonimmigrant visas.as a fallback,they exhort us to find that the government forfeited any right to invoke either rationale by approving the visa petition notwithstanding full disclosure,at that time,of both the job description and the marriage fraud.
the government rejoins that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended by the real id act of,a b ii.its second line of defense is that both grounds of decision were that neither was waived and that,therefore,the district court decision is bulletproof on the merits.
given the sprawling nature of this asseverational array,we begin at the beginning and address the jurisdictional question.we then move to the merits.
a.the jurisdictional question.
under,we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions and orders of the district courts within this circuit.the case before us comprises an appeal from a decision of one such district decision that is final inasmuch as it ends the litigation pending in that court,leaving nothing to be done but to execute the judgment.consequently,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.see jilin pharm.usa,chertoff,cir monica,cir.
that is not the end of the jurisdictional issue.the real import of the government jurisdictional exegesis relates to whether the district court had jurisdiction.we must consider that aspect of the argument despite the government awkward phrasing of it.after all,it normally is incumbent upon an appellate court to satisfy itself both of its own jurisdiction and of the jurisdiction of the trial court before proceeding further.see bender williamsport area sch,d irving united states,cir en banc.
in this instance,there may be reason to think that the jurisdiction of the district court seems suspect.the ina,in its current iteration,is littered with provisions.of particular pertinence here,the law provides with exceptions not relevant to this case that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory and regardless of whether the judgment,decision,or action is made in removal proceedings,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
ii any decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under certain asylum provisions.
a b ii.the government suggests that,under this provision,no court has jurisdiction to review cis denial of an visa petition because such a determination is fully committed to agency discretion.see id.a stating that t he admission to the united states of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the attorney general may by regulations prescribe.
the cogency of this argument is not.even though the provisions of section apply outside the removal context,see zhu gonzales,at cdi info,reno,cir van dinh reno,cir,the question remains whether the statutory scheme places the authority to grant visa petitions sufficiently within cis discretion as to engage the gears of the jurisdictional bar.
the answer to this question is freighted with uncertainty,in part because the courts of appeals have disagreed about how to approach the matter of when a statute can be said to specify discretionary authority.see,zhu,at describing various approaches.to illustrate,the sixth circuit determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the denial of an visa because the regulations,rather than the pertinent statute itself,commit the matter to agency discretion.see cdi info,at.but other circuits have rejected that interpretive model.see,zafar,cir zhao gonzales,cir.we,too,recently have rejected it,insisting that the relevant commitment to agency discretion must be found in the statute itself.see alsamhouri gonzales,cir.there is,moreover,a further problem.the text of the statute upon which the government relies here,a,is considerably less definitive in its commitment of authority to agency discretion than other statutes that have been found to animate the jurisdictional bar.
in the face of these concerns,we believe that this is a case in which we the jurisdictional question.we recognize,of course,that federal courts can not ordinarily exercise hypothetical jurisdiction that is,a federal court ordinarily may not assume the existence of jurisdiction in order to decide the merits of a case or controversy.sinochem int l malay.int l shipping,d steel citizens for better env t,d.but that principle admits of an area of elasticity.
in mapping the contours of this narrow crevice,we have distinguished between article iii jurisdiction which may never be bypassed and statutory jurisdiction which may occasionally be bypassed.see,universal communic,lycos,cir nisselson lernout,cir parella ret.bd.of employees ret,cir see also mcbee delica,cir w e have consistently interpreted the rule against hypothetical jurisdiction as applying in its strict form only to issues going to article iii requirements.in the immigration context,we have bypassed enigmatic jurisdictional questions in circumstances in which precedent clearly adumbrates the result on the merits.see,ashcroft,cir seale ins,cir 
this case fits within that crevice.on the one hand,the jurisdictional question is not only thorny but also a matter of statutory,not constitutional,dimension and its proper resolution is uncertain.on the other hand,the outcome on the merits is foreordained.consequently,we bypass the jurisdictional question and proceed directly to the heartland of the plaintiffs appeal.
b.the merits.
we are bound by the same ground rules as the district court in assessing agency decisions.shore,thompson,cir.thus,the district court decision in this case engenders de novo review.see id.
seeking a foothold,rsc and srisang start by pointing out that an agency unexplained departure from a prior course of action may raise arbitrariness concerns.see,saint fort ashcroft,cir ins,cir.that doctrine,however,does not shed any light here.at this stage of the litigation,we are not dealing with an unexplained departure on remand from the district court,the agency carefully laid out the reasoning that underpinned its repudiation of the specialty occupation visa under which srisang had been allowed to enter the country.cis said that the earlier petition had been approved in accordingly,the petition should be i the restaurant manager position failed to qualify as a specialty occupation and ii srisang marriage fraud rendered him statutorily ineligible for the requested largesse.each of these grounds floats on its own bottom if either passes muster,the district court grant of summary judgment must be upheld.
rising to this challenge,rsc and srisang contest both grounds.they argue that cis misconstrued the administrative record,misapplied the regulations pertaining to specialty occupations,and incorrectly invoked the marriage fraud bar.in our view,cis determination that rsc restaurant manager position was not a specialty occupation is dispositive here.
we do not write on a pristine page.congress has laid out eligibility standards for the granting of specialty occupation visas.see a h i b.under these standards,a specialty occupation requires a theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,and b attainment of a bachelor or higher degree in the specific specialty or its equivalent as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the united states.id.i.the statute also sets forth requirements pertaining to licensure not applicable here and providing for due recognition of experience and expertise.see id.i.agency regulations flesh out these requirements.see h.the regulations define a specialty occupation as 
an occupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor including,but not limited to,architecture,engineering,mathematics,physical sciences,social sciences,medicine and health,education,business specialties,accounting,law,theology,and the arts,and which requires the attainment of a bachelor degree or higher in a specific specialty,or its equivalent,as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the united states.
id.h ii.to satisfy this definition,a position must touch at least one of four overlapping bases.see id.h iii a.these bases are set out in the margin the burden of proving that a particular position comes within this taxonomy and,thus,qualifies as a specialty occupation is on the applicant.see.
against this backdrop,we examine what transpired here.cis,relying in part on the united states department of labor occupational outlook handbook the handbook,determined that the plaintiffs failed to show that the restaurant manager position touched any of the four specified bases.in that regard,the agency found that the duties of the position were not more complex than those associated with similar positions in the general economy.
the plaintiffs attack cis analysis on several fronts.first,they take aim at the agency use of the handbook,which recounts the particulars of numerous occupations.this array includes food service managers,and cis placed rsc restaurant manager position within that niche.doing so was an error,the plaintiffs claim,because that placement lumped rsc establishment with less toney establishments such as and chain restaurants.relatedly,the plaintiffs argue that slavish devotion to the handbook led cis to ignore evidence demonstrating rsc uniquely complex and specialized needs.we address these arguments in the ensemble.
when congress has entrusted an agency with rulemaking and administrative authority,courts ordinarily afford considerable deference to the agency interpretation of the regulations that it has promulgated under that authority.see bowles seminole rock sand.shore,at.courts should withhold this deference only if the agency interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d quoting seminole rock,at.we find no indication that cis forfeited its entitlement to deference here.
in its review of petitions for nonimmigrant work visas,cis the occupational descriptions collected in the handbook.subject only to caveats at the outer fringes,the choice of what reference materials to consult is quintessentially within an agency,thus,courts routinely have approved cis practice of consulting the handbook.see,blacher ridge,d,shanti,reno,d,sava,defensor meissner,cir consulting the handbook for a similar purpose.
here,moreover,cis characterization of the restaurant manager position as a species of the generic food service manager position appears entirely reasonable.based on the evidence before it,the agency fairly summarized the duties of rsc restaurant manager position as follows 
the restaurant manager would be in charge of all operations,and he will perform duties that entail,in part hiring,firing,and supervising employees contacting suppliers and ordering supplies promoting the restaurant designing the layout of the restaurant and its equipment estimating food and beverage costs and requisitions conferring with food preparation and other personnel to plan menus and related activities investigating and resolving food quality and service complaints and handling all financial matters.
these tasks appear a good match for the duties of a food service manager,which the handbook describes,in pertinent part,as follows 
food service managers are responsible for the daily operations of restaurants and other establishments that prepare and serve meals and
