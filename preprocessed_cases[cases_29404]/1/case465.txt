this petition for review is the latest chapter in a dispute between joan taylor taylor and beverly migliore migliore collectively appellants on the one hand,and the state of rhode island state and the rhode island department of environmental management ridem on the other.we last encountered this case in,when appellants sought review of a district court order that prevented the united states department of labor department of labor from adjudicating their complaints that they had been fired in retaliation for reporting potential violations of the solid waste disposal act swda.see rhode island dep t of envtl.mgmt.united states ridem united states,cir.
in that case,we upheld the district court order but modified it in that we allowed the department of labor to act where the assistant secretary for occupational safety and health assistant secretary intervened in the proceedings to remove any sovereign immunity bar.following our decision,the assistant secretary attempted to intervene in one suit brought by migliore but declined to intervene in other suits by the appellants against the state and ridem.in this petition,appellants contest this decision not to intervene and argue that regardless of the assistant secretary inaction,they should be allowed to pursue their suits because the state has waived its sovereign immunity through other means.we disagree,and after careful consideration,we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the administrative review board arb of the department of labor.
background 
this case has a complicated history.in,migliore,an employee of ridem,filed with the assistant secretary three complaints against ridem,alleging that the state agency had violated the whistleblower provisions of the swda.in particular,migliore claimed that ridem violated the swda by retaliating against her for reporting what she believed to be ridem failure to implement properly the swda.after an investigation,however,the assistant secretary determined that the state agency had not violated the swda.migliore objected to the assistant secretary findings and,as was her right,requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj at the department of labor on august,following a lengthy hearing,the alj to whom the case had been assigned issued a recommended decision awarding migliore both equitable relief and damages migliore i.ridem then appealed the alj decision to the arb.
on august,migliore filed another complaint with the assistant secretary migliore ii alleging that ridem had retaliated against her for pursuing her initial complaint.after investigating,the assistant secretary found that ridem had indeed violated the whistleblower provisions of the swda by,among other things,issuing a statement to the media that attacked migliore credibility personally and went beyond mere disagreement with the alj findings in migliore i.the order accompanying the assistant secretary determination awarded migliore in damages.ridem objected to the assistant secretary findings and order in migliore ii and requested an alj hearing to appeal these matters.in its hearing request letter,ridem did not invoke a defense of sovereign immunity.
also following the alj decision in migliore i,two of migliore,taylor and barbara raddatz raddatz,filed whistleblower complaints with the assistant secretary alleging retaliation by ridem for their participation in migliore i.after the assistant secretary quickly issued his determination that raddatz complaint lacked merit,raddatz requested an alj hearing.during this period,the assistant secretary continued to investigate taylor complaint.
on february,while migliore i was pending before the arb and the migliore ii and raddatz cases were pending before an alj,and while taylor complaint was being investigated by the assistant secretary,the state and ridem sought injunctive relief in federal district court.alleging a violation of its sovereign immunity,the state sought to enjoin the department of labor from further investigation and adjudication of the complaints of migliore,raddatz,and taylor.on september,the district court enjoined the department of labor adjudication of the complaints but declined to enjoin the assistant secretary investigation of taylor complaint.see rhode island united states,d.shortly after this decision was handed down,the assistant secretary,in november,issued a determination in taylor favor finding that her allegations had merit.he also ordered ridem to pay to taylor to reimburse her for her legal fees.ridem objected to the assistant secretary findings and order and requested a hearing before an alj.
the appellants,along with raddatz,then appealed the order of the district court.in,this court upheld the district court order but modified it in one important respect.see ridem,at.we held that the secretary of labor was not prohibited from intervening in the enjoined proceedings and removing the sovereign immunity bar.id.distinguishing cases that are barred by sovereign immunity,those pursued by private parties in federal courts or administrative tribunals against states,from cases that are not barred,those brought against states by federal administrative agencies to enforce federal laws,we concluded that intervention by the secretary in the enjoined cases would remove the sovereign immunity bar.see id.at,quoting from the district court discussion of alden maine,d.
on august,the assistant secretary filed a motion to intervene in migliore rhode island objected,contending that intervention would violate the district court injunction,as modified by this court decision in ridem.rhode island therefore returned to district court seeking to enjoin the assistant secretary from intervening.on january,the district court granted rhode island motion,ruling that the assistant secretary could not intervene in migliore i,because rhode island sovereign immunity is violated if intervention occurs at the time the case is before the arb.any intervention,stated the district court,had to occur at or before the alj stage.see rhode island united states,d.since the assistant secretary could not intervene,the sovereign immunity bar was upheld,and the arb was compelled to dismiss the case on april.
on may,the secretary of labor advised the appellants that she would not intervene in their suits against the state and ridem taylor and migliore ii.as a result,the alj dismissed,on sovereign immunity grounds,migliore complaint on july,and taylor complaint on august,because the secretary had decided not to intervene,the sovereign immunity bar remained.
the appellants then appealed the alj dismissal of their complaints to the arb.in two separate proceedings,the arb affirmed the alj actions.although the arb provided a number of reasons for its decisions to affirm,there are two grounds in particular that appellants challenge here.first,appellants had argued,using the reasoning of lapides bd.of regents of the.of georgia,d,that the state had waived its sovereign immunity merely by requesting a hearing before the alj to contest the assistant secretary initial findings.the arb,however,dismissed this argument for two reasons.it held that our analysis of lapides in we concluded that the state pursuit of injunctive relief in the federal district court did not constitute a waiver of its sovereign equally applicable to the state requests for alj hearings in the taylor and migliore ii cases.it also recognized that there is a distinction between the stage during which the assistant secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the alj adjudicates those complaints.the arb held that sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage.the only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing.in making this request for a hearing,the party is merely clarifying its entitlement to sovereign immunity,not waiving it.
second,in affirming the alj dismissal of the taylor case,the arb,noting that the secretary had decided not to intervene,agreed with the alj that neither the federal court decisions granting injunctive relief to rhode island nor other legal authorities compelled the secretary to intervene to prosecute taylor complaint.in re joan taylor,arb case.the arb also cited this court statement in ridem that the secretary may intervene if she so chooses,at,as well as the regulation at f,which states that the secretary designee may participate in the proceedings at his discretion.id.
it is the arb dismissals on these two grounds that the appellants challenge here.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in ridem,we held that the secretary final determinations under the whistleblower provisions of the swda are subject to review in the court of appeals in accordance with judicial review provisions of the apa administrative procedure act.ridem,at.accordingly,the secretary decisions will be upheld unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence or are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a,e.see also sasse dep t of labor,cir simon simmons foods,cir.
sovereign immunity 
appellants first claim is that despite the secretary refusal to intervene in their cases,the state has waived its sovereign immunity through other means.a state sovereign immunity is a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure.clark barnard.we have previously stated that a state can waive its eleventh amendment immunity to suit in three ways by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the jurisdiction of a federal court or administrative proceeding by consent to or participation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express condition or by affirmative conduct in litigation.new hampshire ramsey,cir citations omitted.
appellants here invoke two separate kinds of waiver.first,they claim that the state has waived its sovereign immunity through its litigation,by requesting hearings before an alj following the initial investigative findings by the assistant secretary.we note initially that we have confronted a similar argument in two of our recent cases.in both ridem and ramsey,it was claimed that a state waived its sovereign immunity solely by seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative decision.in both cases,however,we rejected this argument,noting that the mere seeking of judicial review of an agency decision by a state that was a defendant before the agency was insufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity.ramsey,at see also ridem,at.the argument made here is slightly different,as it relates to the review of an administrative decision not before a federal article iii court,but rather before an federal administrative law judge.nevertheless,we believe that the reasoning of our earlier opinions applies in this instance as well.see also federal maritime comm south carolina state ports,d finding that the sovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also applies in adjudications conducted by a federal administrative agency butz economou,d noting the similarities between adjudication by an administrative law judge in a federal administrative agency and adjudication by judges in a court.
we also find unconvincing an offshoot of this,appellants claim that the state has waived its immunity through its litigation conduct because it has selectively invoked its immunity to gain a litigation advantage.appellants draw this idea from two cases in particular lapides and ramsey.in lapides,the supreme court confronted a case in which the plaintiff had brought suit against the state in state court on a claim in which the state had statutorily waived its immunity.the state,in response,removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss,asserting that it was immune from suit in federal court under the eleventh amendment.the court held that in removing the case,the state had voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court and therefore had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct.lapides,at.this decision was based in part on the inequity of allowing the state to reverse its statutory waiver by a change in forum.
in ramsey in a part of the opinion different from that discussed above,we were similarly distressed by a state exploitation of its sovereign immunity to obtain unfair litigation advantages.in that case,the state of new hampshire made a voluntary and calculated choice to attempt to obtain the dismissal of a federal court action,wanting instead to litigate certain claims through a state administrative grievance procedure.once the dismissal was granted,the state participated in the administrative grievance procedure,knowing that the procedure ultimately provided for federal judicial review.when the case did actually reach a federal court,the state tried to assert its sovereign immunity.we held,however,that because new hampshire participated to its advantage in the grievance procedure to the detriment of its opponents,the state had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct.we said,in other words,that the state,having gained the advantage that it sought,is bound by the choice that it made.ramsey,at.
appellants argue that this case is similar to lapides and ramsey and that the state here has waived its immunity because it too used its immunity to gain a litigation advantage.in particular,the appellants point to how the state requested hearings before the alj when it was not compelled to do so.it had other means of preserving its,it could have simply waited for the determinations of the assistant secretary to become final and then defended in enforcement proceedings by asserting sovereign immunity at that point such a course of action would have come with a price.the state would have faced the daunting prospect of secretarial involvement,and such involvement would have precluded the state from asserting its sovereign immunity alj hearings,by contrast,posed no such risk,according to the appellants,because in such a setting the state would be permitted to invoke sovereign immunity at its pleasure.in light of the litigation advantages that came with the state conscious decision to preserve its rights through alj hearings,appellants argue that we should hold that the state waived its immunity through its litigation conduct.
such a choice,however,is different from the situation presented in lapides or ramsey.the state here never made a prior decision that affected its ability to invoke its immunity,as was the case in lapides or ramsey.to be sure,the choice faced by the state in this case related to immunity.but the state decision to preserve its rights through an alj hearing rather than through waiting for an enforcement action was the first time it made any decision relating to that immunity.indeed,it had to be.as the arb correctly recognized,there is a clear distinction between the stage in which the assistant secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the alj adjudicates those complaints.sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage.the only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing,as the state did here.thus,this is not a situation,such as in lapides,where the state has attempted to regain,by a change in forum,a litigation advantage that it already renounced by a general statute.ramsey,at discussing lapides,or one such as in ramsey,where new hampshire tried to reverse the effects of a choice it had earlier made.in requesting alj hearings,the state here took advantage of its first opportunity to assert a sovereign immunity defense,a defense that was not available at the investigatory stage of the administrative proceedings.
the state here may have obtained a litigation advantage from its decision to pursue alj hearings.the line of cases,however,does not prevent a litigant from obtaining any sort of advantage relating to immunity in pursuing his case.they only condemn those litigation advantages that are inconsistent or unfair.see lapides,at.noting that the rules governing waiver by litigation conduct are motivated by problems of inconsistency and unfairness.where the state tries to backtrack on immunity decisions it has already made,as was the case in both lapides and ramsey,such inconsistency and unfairness are evident.nothing the state did in this case,however,can be deemed unfair or inconsistent.see ridem,at noting that the state has consistently asserted its sovereign immunity in the administrative proceeding therefore,we decline to find that the state waived its sovereign immunity as a result of its litigation conduct.
appellants also argue that the state has waived its sovereign immunity under laws,which waives the state immunity in all actions of tort in the same manner as a private individual or corporation.appellants argue that their employment discrimination claims here are tort actions in order to show that the state has waived its sovereign immunity in this case.they also state that their claims closely resemble discrimination actions brought pursuant to,which have been recognized as one type of claim that is covered by laws.see marrapese rhode island.
whatever the merits of these arguments,appellants reliance on laws is misplaced.following this court decision in ridem,taylor and migliore never raised before either the alj or the arb the applicability of the rhode island statute to their administrative cases.nor is the argument referenced anywhere in the administrative record.accordingly,appellants have forfeited the argument by failing to raise it during the administrative proceedings.see disabled americans for equal access,ferries del caribe,cir noting that legal theories raised for the first time on appeal are waived okmyansky herbalife int l of,cir same ridem,at noting that c laims of waiver of immunity are like any other legal argument and may themselves be waived or forfeited if not seasonably asserted.
in their reply brief,appellants claim that these arguments relating to forfeiture invoke the doctrine of,that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies before proceeding before a court.in their attempt to show the inapplicability of such a doctrine here,appellants point out that the exhaustion doctrine is subject to certain exceptions.for example,they note that a party is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies where it would be futile for it to do so.see,drinkwater metropolitan life ins,cir discussing exhaustion in the context of erisa.appellants argue that it would have been futile in this case for them to raise laws before the secretary or her designees because these individuals had no expertise in the interpretation of rhode island law.they also note,alternatively,that exhaustion is not mandated and that it is within the discretion of the court as to whether to apply the doctrine citing acción social de puerto rico,viera pérez,cir.
appellants,however,are incorrect.our discussion of forfeiture has nothing to do with exhaustion.there is no question that the appellants here did exhaust their administrative remedies.they first brought their cases before the assistant secretary,then faced an appeal before an alj,and finally appealed the dismissal of their actions before the arb.there is nothing more they can be expected to do in the administrative setting.our concern is that the appellants are raising this issue for the first time in this court.if this petition is properly to be considered a review of the arb action,the appellants are required to have raised their arguments about laws before the arb,the alj,or the assistant secretary.see massachusetts ex rel.div.of marine fisheries daley,cir where agency action is taken upon an administrative record,it must be reviewed based on that record.citation omitted.because appellants did not raise the issue earlier,their argument about a waiver of sovereign immunity under laws fails.
intervention by the secretary 
finally,taylor and migliore claim that the secretary decision not to intervene in their cases violated the swda,because under that statute the secretary has no discretion whether to enforce if a violation is found.appellees,however,state that this is a,arguing that the secretary decision on whether to intervene is unreviewable by this court under the supreme court decision in heckler chaney,d.in that case,the supreme court held that an agency decision not to take requested action where the action is committed to agency discretion by law is presumptively unreviewable quoting the administrative procedure act,a.the court stated that review is not to be had in such instances because a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.heckler,at.
the appellants,in response,argue that the court in heckler also stated that the presumption of unreviewability may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.id.at.in other words,where there is a sufficient or meaningful standard provided in the governing statute,courts have something against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion,and judicial review is allowed.massachusetts pub.interest research group,united states nuclear regulatory comm n,cir citing heckler,at.the appellants point to b as providing a standard sufficient to guide judicial review in this case.
the key question,then,is whether a meaningful standard exists here against which we can judge the secretary decision not to intervene in the appellants cases.id.we need not resolve such a question,however,for even assuming that the appellants are correct and that b provides such a standard,we find,after undertaking the requisite judicial review,that the secretary refusal to intervene in this instance was proper.
as we have already mentioned,appellants argue that where violations of the swda employee protection provision have been found,the secretary is required to act.in support of their argument,they cite to the text of b 
upon receipt of a complaint,the secretary of labor shall cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate.upon receiving the report of such investigation,the secretary of labor shall make findings of fact.if he finds that such violation did occur,he shall issue a decision,incorporating an order therein and his findings,requiring the party committing such violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the secretary of labor deems appropriate 
b.appellants are arguing,in other words,that once a violation is found,the secretary has no has mandatory duties that he must perform.to emphasize the mandatory nature of the secretary duties,appellants point to how in the section cited,congress used the word shall to describe the secretary obligations no less than seven times with the appellants citing instances not quoted in the above paragraph.they also note that the word shall is ordinarily the language of command quoting alabama bozeman,d.
appellants are correct that there is a procedure that the secretary is required to follow in dealing with whistleblower complaints.title of the code of federal regulations,pt.implements the employee protection provision provided for in the swda,and provides procedures for labor department officials to follow when they receive a whistleblower complaint.the regulations appoint the assistant secretary to act for the secretary and to undertake and complete an investigation within thirty days of the receipt of a complaint.d.if the assistant secretary finds a violation,he is to issue a notice of determination that includes,among other things,an order requiring the party at fault to abate the violation.any order,however,is only preliminary at the time the notice of determination is released.according to the regulations,any party desiring review of the determination or any part thereof is required to file a request for a hearing with the chief administrative law judge within five business days.if a request for a hearing is timely filed,the notice of determination of the assistant secretary shall be inoperative,and shall become operative only if the case is later dismissed.see d.when the notice of determination becomes inoperativ
