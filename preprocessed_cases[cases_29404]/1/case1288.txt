before the court is an administrative appeal challenging rules promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc.as part of a coalition of local authorities,montgomery county,maryland,petitions for review of the fcc october,order the order,which issued rules implementing section a of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of,a,also known as the spectrum act.petitioners contend that the procedures established in the order conscript the states in violation of the tenth amendment,and that the order unreasonably defines several terms of the spectrum act.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the fcc order is fully consonant with the tenth amendment.we further conclude that the fcc has reasonably interpreted the ambiguous terms of section a of the spectrum act.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
to provide context for the issues raised in the petition,we first set forth the statutory and regulatory framework from which the fcc order arises.
in,congress passed the spectrum act as part of the middle class tax relief and job creation act.the spectrum act included,among other things,a series of measures designed to encourage the growth of a robust national telecommunications network at issue in this appeal is section a of the spectrum act,entitled wireless facilities deployment facilities modifications.a.section a addresses wireless providers efforts to expand their networks by modifying existing electronic equipment that sits atop towers and other structures.if,for example,a wireless provider wanted to collocate transmission equipment on an existing tower or other site in order to increase wireless service,the provider would ordinarily need to seek local zoning approval,because the modifications would alter the physical profile of the facility.
section a limits local authority to bar collocation or other modification efforts 
n otwithstanding section of the telecommunications act of public law or any other provision of law,a state or local government may not deny,and shall approve,any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.
a.section a defines the term eligible facilities request as follows 
for purposes of this subsection,the term eligible facilities request means any request for modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that involves 
a collocation of new transmission equipment 
b removal of transmission equipment or 
c replacement of transmission equipment.
a.together,these provisions forbid localities from exercising their zoning authority to deny providers requests to modify wireless equipment,so long as the proposed modification does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the facility.the statute does not define what kinds of modifications would qualify as substantial.
congress charged the fcc with implementing the spectrum act,u.a,and the fcc initiated that process by issuing a public notice of proposed rulemaking.see in re acceleration of broadband deployment by improving wireless facilities siting policies,fcc rcd.following a contentious period during which numerous parties submitted their views,the fcc issued an order on october,implementing section a.in re acceleration of broadband deployment by improving wireless facilities siting policies,fcc rcd,amended by fcc rcd.these rules are codified at.
the order begins by noting the underlying congressional concern that municipal permit review processes were hindering efforts to expand wireless networks.
despite the widely acknowledged need for additional wireless infrastructure,the process of deploying these facilities can be expensive,cumbersome,and among other requirements,parties must typically obtain siting approval from the local municipality 
although these review requirements serve important local and national interests,local and federal review processes can slow deployment substantially,even in cases that do not present significant concerns.
order.with the aim of reduc ing regulatory obstacles and bring ing efficiency to wireless facility siting,the order turned to the task of implementing section a and defining its terms.id.
two aspects of the order are relevant to this appeal.the first implements the statute directive that localities shall approve applications by establishing what the order calls a deemed granted remedy.order.the second clarifies what kinds of physical modifications are substantial,and what types of facilities qualify as wireless towers and base stations within the meaning of the statute.we briefly summarize each before turning to petitioners arguments.
to implement the spectrum act mandate that localities shall approve requests covered by section a,the order establishes a deemed granted remedy.under this procedure,when a locality receives a covered request,it has sixty days to review the application,if it elects to review the request at all.c.within that period,the locality shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section.id.c.if the locality fails to act before the period expires,the request shall be deemed granted.id.c.however,the grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the locality in writing after the review period has expired that the application has been deemed granted.id.the rules authorize applicants to bring claims relating to section a applications in any court of competent jurisdiction,and the order explains that this provision permits applicants to seek declaratory judgments memorializing the grant.id.c order.
the order acknowledges that section a does not expressly provide for a time limit or other procedural restrictions on municipal review of applications.order.however,the fcc determined that the deemed granted remedy was consistent with section a,which states that localities may not deny,and shall approve qualifying applications.id.as the fcc explained,
t his directive leaves no room for a lengthy and discretionary approach to reviewing an application that meets the statutory criteria once the application meets these criteria,the law forbids the state or local government from denying it w ithholding a decision on an application indefinitely would be tantamount to denying it,in contravention of the statute pronouncement that reviewing authorities may not deny qualifying applications.
id.in light of these concerns,the fcc concluded that the text of section a supports adoption of a deemed granted remedy,which will directly serve the broader goal of promoting the rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure.id.
the fcc order also undertakes the task of interpreting several undefined terms.order petitioners challenge two in particular what is a base station that may be modified,and what does it mean to substantially change a facility 
first,the fcc defined the term base station to include structures other than towers that support or house an antenna,transceiver,or other associated equipment,even if the structure was not built primarily for that purpose id.c.b iii.in other words,a base station can be any example,a building or a utility pole that has transmission equipment installed on top.
second,the fcc has provided a definition establishing objective criteria for determining when a proposed modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of a facility 
for towers outside of public,it increases the height by more than feet or,whichever is greater for those towers in the and for all base stations,it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than or feet,whichever is greater 
for towers outside of public,it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet,or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance,whichever is greater for those towers in the and for all base stations,it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet 
it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved,but not to exceed four cabinets 
it entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site of the tower or base station 
it would defeat the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station or 
it does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of the facility unless the noncompliance is due to a change that does not constitute a substantial change under the preceding standards.
order notwithstanding this definition,the fcc explains in the order that localities may continue to condition approval on compliance with generally applicable building,structural,electrical,and safety codes and other public safety laws.id.and,of course,localities are permitted to deny applications if they determine that the proposed modification is not covered by the fcc order implementing section a,such as a proposal to add five equipment cabinets to a utility pole.
on appeal,petitioners contend that the fcc order violates the tenth amendment by compelling the states to grant permit applications,and they assert that the order defines certain statutory terms in a manner inconsistent with the text of the act.we consider these arguments in turn.
petitioners argue that the order violates the tenth amendment by compelling local and municipal governments to participate in federal regulatory efforts by approving infrastructure permits.petitioners take particular issue with the deemed granted procedure,which they characterize as direct regulation of the conduct of the locality legislative power,which the tenth amendment prohibits.petitioners br.at.we have jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges to executive agency action pursuant to the administrative procedure act,which instructs a reviewing court to set aside agency action that is contrary to constitutional right or otherwise unlawful.
as the supreme court discussed in printz united states,d and new york united states,d,the tenth amendment forbids the federal government from requiring states to enforce federal laws.in new york,the court explained that 
e ven where congress has the authority under the constitution to pass laws requiring or prohibiting certain acts,it lacks the power directly to compel the states to require or prohibit those acts t he commerce clause,for example,authorizes congress to regulate interstate commerce directly it does not authorize congress to regulate state governments regulation of interstate commerce.
at.thus,neither congress nor the fcc may compel the states to administer federal regulatory programs or pass legislation.this principle is cabined,however.for example,a law that conditions federal funding on state implementation of a federal program does not violate the tenth amendment,unless the inducement of the funding is so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.south dakota dole,d quotation omitted kennedy allera,cir.similarly,the tenth amendment presents no bar to a federal rule that asks the states to choose between regulating according to federal standards and having a federal agency step in to regulate.verizon maryland,global naps,cir.
upon review of the fcc order,we readily conclude that the fcc deemed granted procedure comports with the tenth amendment.as a practical matter,the order implementing section a does not require the states to take any action at all,because the deemed granted remedy obviates the need for the states to affirmatively approve applications.instead,the deemed granted procedure allows the applications to be granted by default if the state does not affirmatively approve them within sixty days.as the fcc points out in its order,the point of the deemed granted provision is to ensure that collocation applications are not mired in the type of protracted approval processes that the spectrum act was designed to avoid.order.moreover,the deemed granted procedure provides a remedy to ensure that states do not circumvent statutory requirements by failing to act upon applications.id.the purpose and effect of section a is to bar states from interfering with the expansion of wireless networks.to achieve that end,the act preempts local regulation of collocations and bars states from denying facility modification applications that meet certain standards.the fcc order does no more than implement the statute.
despite the fact that the order does not require states to take any action at all,petitioners insist that the order commandeers the states and compels localities to administer the spectrum act.they argue that,even under a scenario,it is the state itself that is granting the application.thus,according to petitioners,the order forces states to give collocation applications the imprimatur of state approval.but these applications are granted only by operation of federal law,and the order permits applicants to initiate a declaratory judgment action to seek some form of judicial imprimatur for an application that has been deemed granted.id.therefore,if the permit grants bear the imprimatur of any authority,it is federal,and not local.for this reason,petitioners can not argue that the order requires localities to exercise their legislative power to grant applications.
because the order does not require the states to take any action whatsoever,the fcc rules are a far cry from the statute struck down in printz,which required states to run background checks on handgun purchases.printz,at.likewise,the order bears no resemblance to the statute in new york,which required states to enact state laws providing for the disposal of radioactive waste within state borders or else take title and possession of the waste themselves.new york.functionally,what has occurred here is that the fcc pursuant to properly delegated congressional authority has preempted state regulation of wireless towers.that is entirely permissible under our system of federalism.we therefore conclude that petitioners tenth amendment challenge lacks merit.
having determined that the fcc deemed granted procedure is constitutional,we next address petitioners contention that the fcc has unreasonably defined several terms of the spectrum act.
pursuant to the administrative procedure act,we will set aside the fcc order only if we conclude that its rules are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.furthermore,the fcc interpretation of section a is entitled to deferential review under chevron,usa,natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.id.at.here,a chevron analysis is appropriate because the issue before us involves the fcc interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering.see a.
at step one of the chevron framework,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,or whether,instead,the terms are ambiguous.othi holder,cir quoting chevron,at.there is no question that the terms of the spectrum act at issue here are ambiguous accordingly,this court review is governed by step two of the chevron analysis,under which the sole inquiry is whether the fcc interpretation of the terms is based on a permissible construction of the statute.schafer astrue,cir quoting chevron,at.
against this standard,we review petitioners challenge to the manner in which the fcc has defined the two terms referenced earlier substantially change and base station.
the fcc order provides objective and numerical standards to establish when an eligible facilities request would substantially change the physical dimensions of the facility.for example,as we have noted,a change would be substantial if it entailed any excavation or deployment beyond the current site of the tower or base station.
petitioners challenge these standards on several grounds,but they have a common theme petitioners believe that municipalities should be able to review each facility application to determine whether the proposal would represent a substantial modification of the original structure.this argument,at its core,takes issue with the fact that the spectrum act displaces discretionary municipal control over certain facility modification req
