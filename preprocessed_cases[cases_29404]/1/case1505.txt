usa is a nonprofit,lobbying and advocacy group organized to educate and mobilize senior citizens on a variety of issues affecting them,including social security benefits.in,usa reported total revenues of and a net profit of approximately.usa solicits money and other support from individuals through mass mailings.usa designs its envelopes to entice recipients to open the envelopes,and it mails information and solicitations repeatedly to the same people.
two envelopes used by usa form the basis of this action.see attachments.the first envelope has the words social security printed in bold letters across the top of the envelope.attachment a the front of the envelope is designed to resemble a fedex or express mail letter.there is a box labeled handling instructions in which the options urgent alert,express service,and standard delivery appear,and the small box beside urgent alert is marked with a red check.the envelope also displays a package tracking number.around the perimeter of the envelope,the words social security alert appear over and over.united seniors association,is listed as the sender of the letter.the envelope label also contains a block authorizing delivery without a signature.on the back of this envelope,the message urgent social security information enclosed appears.the social security alert border is also printed on the back of the envelope.the second envelope in dispute contains essentially the same design,but the social security alert border is not present.the second envelope is a snap mailer,which is opened by pulling off the perforated edge of the envelope.the snap mailer directs the recipient to open immediately.attachment b the rear of the second envelope contains the message social security information enclosed.
the ssa began receiving complaints concerning usa mailings,and,after a review of usa mailings,the ssa determined that usa had violated a.acting on that determination,in september,the ssa began discussions with usa regarding usa alleged breaches of a and continued these discussions until the issuance of a penalty letter in august.the ssa penalty letter advised usa that it had mailed envelopes that violated a and imposed a fine of dollar per envelope.upon receipt of the penalty letter,usa requested a hearing before an alj,as provided under the social security regulations.b.
the alj held an evidentiary hearing on april,during which the ssa presented a postal inspector with the united states postal service,who described the misleading nature of usa envelopes.the postal inspector testified that usa mailers were standard or third class mail and the additional instructions on the envelopes such as the tracking number,handling instructions,and authorization for delivery without signature served no legitimate postal function.the postal inspector also testified that the red ink used for the social security alert border in contrast to the black ink used for the sender address is a technique generally used by mass mailers to detract attention from the sender block and focus attention on the social security message.the postal inspector further testified that from viewing the envelope,it appeared usa was trying to disguise the mass mailing nature of its envelopes and that a recipient of such an envelope would a t first glance believe it to be from the ssa and to contain social security information.
the ssa also presented testimony from a professor of elder law employed with the american association of retired persons,who opined that typical social security recipients would believe that usa envelopes contain ed information about their social security benefit.transcript of proceedings before the alj,april,at.the professor also testified that the checkmark beside urgent alert would direct elder recipients to the fact that the information was urgent and it was important for them to open the envelope very promptly.transcript at.the professor noted that such a technique was standard for mass marketers to create a sense of urgency for the person to open the envelope.transcript at.the professor further testified that a typical elderly social security recipient would be more inclined to open usa envelopes than to dispose of them because of the prominent display of social security on the envelope and because the typical recipient would believe the envelopes were official documents.
in response,representatives from usa testified that usa wanted recipients to focus their attention on the message of the mailing,not usa as the sender.usa representatives also conceded that the envelopes were targeted to senior citizens.
based on the testimony and his own review of the contested envelopes,the alj found that usa envelopes violated a and that the fine was reasonable.usa appealed the alj decision to the board which adopted the alj decision.the ssa commissioner chose not to exercise her discretion to modify or revise the board decision and consequently,the alj decision became the final decision of the board.usa has petitioned for review of the board decision and we have jurisdiction under e west because the board adopted the alj decision,we review the merits of the alj decision.
in its petition for review,usa argues that a does not apply to envelopes alone,that substantial evidence does not support the alj finding that usa envelopes violated a,and that a is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad we address each argument in turn.
usa primary argument is that a does not apply to envelopes at all.we review de novo questions of law.crutchfield county of hanover,cir.
when interpreting statutes,we start with the plain language.dep t of labor north carolina growers ass n,cir.in fact,when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.discover bank vaden,cir quoting ex rel.wilson graham county soil water conserv,cir.when interpreting a statute,we must give words their common and ordinary meaning.id.if there is an ambiguity in a statute and it is apparent that congress would expect the agency to speak with the force of law when it addresses the ambiguity,a reviewing court must accept the agency construction of that statute so long as it is reasonable.id.quoting united states mead,d.
as relevant here,a prohibits the use of the words social security in connection with any item constituting an advertisement,solicitation,circular,book,pamphlet,or other communication alone or with other words,letters,symbols,or emblems.a.usa argues that envelopes are not included in a because,under the rule of the last antecedent,the words other communication merely modify advertisement,solicitation,circular,book,and pamphlet by covering the contents of those items,and they can not be read to expand the list to include envelopes.usa argument indicates a misunderstanding of the rule of the last antecedent.according to the rule of the last antecedent,a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.barnhart thomas,d.the supreme court provided a simple example of the rule of the last antecedent in barnhart thomas if parents,who before leaving their teenage son alone in the house for the weekend,warn him,you will be punished if you throw a party or engage in any other activity that damages the house,the limiting clause that damages the house modifies only the last antecedent any other activity and not a party.id.thus,the teenager could be punished for throwing a party regardless of whether damage occurred to the house.see also jama immigration customs enforcement,d applying last antecedent rule to hold that provision in b e vii stating that the country to which an alien is deported must accept the alien does not also apply to b e.in the present case,the rule of the last antecedent is not applicable to the words other communication because the words are not limiting or referential.instead,the noun phrase other communication denotes a member of the list.see wilma ebbitt david ebbitt,index to english ed.
under the doctrine of ejusdem generis,however,does contain a latent ambiguity.according to ejusdem generis,when a general term follows a specific one,the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with the specific enumeration.norfolk western ry.am.train dispatchers,d.applying the doctrine here,other communication should be read to refer only to a communication similar to advertisement,solicitation,circular,book,and pamphlet.one could reasonably conceive that envelopes,as folded containers for messages,and which usually convey only cursory information to a recipient,are dissimilar to advertisements,solicitations,books,pamphlets,and circulars,which are used to persuade,educate,or inform a recipient on matters more than just the name and address of the addressor and addressee.on the other hand,in some instances,an envelope may convey additional information to a recipient.for example,a business may state on the outside of an envelope that it is having a sale in which case the envelope could function like an advertisement.thus,because other communication neither plainly compels nor clearly precludes usa interpretation,its precise import is ambiguous and certainly not free from doubt.humanoids group rogan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because a is ambiguous as to whether envelopes constitute other communication s,we examine the ssa interpretation of the statute.when a court reviews an agency construction of a statute that it administers,the court employs the deferential standard of review articulated in chevron natural res.def.council,d.seafarers int l union,cir.under chevron,we ask whether the agency rule is a permissible interpretation of its organic statute.id.at.the alj,in a formal ruling and after the benefit of a hearing,determined that the ssa position,that other communication s include envelopes,was a reasonable interpretation of the statute that congress empowered the ssa to enforce we have no difficulty concluding that the alj determination,that envelopes are a form of communication that may be prohibited under a,is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.
usa argues that we owe no deference to the alj decision because this is a matter of pure statutory construction and chevron deference therefore is not applicable.we reject usa argument.congress has entrusted to the ssa and to the department of health and human services the protection of the government lines of communication with its citizens on matters related to social security,d,and the determination of what communications threaten these lines falls squarely within the agency and the department expertise.seafarers,at finding chevron applicable because the statutory interpretation at issue involved a multitude of issues that fall squarely within the agency special competence.accordingly,we defer to the ssa interpretation of a and conclude that envelopes are other communication s under that statute.
usa next argues that even if envelopes are covered under a,the contents of an envelope must be examined along with the envelope itself to determine if the envelope creates a false impression that it is approved or endorsed by the government.we agree with the alj that the plain language of a supports a contrary interpretation.because envelopes themselves are other communication s and because an envelope itself can include words,letters,symbols,or emblems that create a false impression that such item is approved,endorsed,or authorized by the social security administration,the use of the prohibited words,phrases,and abbreviations on envelopes alone can violate a.for example,if an organization used posters to advertise for a television broadcast and the posters conveyed the false impression that the ssa endorsed the posters,the organization could not defend the posters on the ground that no broadcast viewer could reasonably believe the ssa endorsed the broadcast.once the viewer tunes into the broadcast,the misleading poster already will have accomplished its purpose.thus,the poster advertisements would constitute a separate communication under a.similarly,once a recipient of a misleading envelope opens the envelope and begins reading its contents,the deceptive communication has served its purpose.
usa reading of the statute simply does not comport with the plain language of a.we find no error in the alj conclusion that envelopes alone may violate a.
next,usa argues that the alj erred by finding that its envelopes violated a because the alj did not require evidence that recipients of usa envelopes were actually misled and that a recipient of usa envelopes could not reasonably be misled into thinking the mailings were from or endorsed by the ssa.we address each claim below.
we review the alj factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence.e.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.craig chater,cir quoting richardson perales,d.it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.id.quoting laws celebrezze,cir.
