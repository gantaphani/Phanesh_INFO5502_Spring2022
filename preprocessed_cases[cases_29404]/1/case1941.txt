this is a case of statutory interpretation.the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic appeals from a grant of summary judgment dismissing the fdic suit to collect million under a criminal restitution order entered pursuant to,part of the victim and witness protection act vwpa of.the action was instituted before the repeal of the act.the outcome turns on an interpretation of the act.we reverse in part and affirm in part and order that summary judgment be entered in favor of the fdic.
in,richard dover dover,now a resident of knoxville,pled guilty to two counts of making a false statement to sunbelt federal savings,in violation of.the conduct underlying the offenses to which he pled guilty concluded in.at a sentencing hearing in,the united states district court for the southern district of texas sentencing court sentenced dover to two years of probation on each count,running concurrently.under the vwpa,the sentencing court also entered an order for criminal restitution in the amount of.this was imposed as a special condition of probation.the sentencing court ordered further that restitution payments would constitute payment against a million civil judgment that had been entered against dover in in favor of sunbelt,and,conversely,payments on the civil judgment would count as restitution.restitution was to be paid to the district court clerk for disbursement to the resolution trust corporation rtc,the receiver for the victim.
rtc sold its interest in the civil judgment to in.in,when dover was released from dischargeable debts by a bankruptcy court,he settled this claim with for.
following the failure of sunbelt,the fdic succeeded to the victim interest in the restitution.it is undisputed that,although section f was repealed in,it applies to this case because dover was sentenced while it was still in effect.
in,dover completed his probation.he had not made any restitution payments save for the settlement,which counts towards the restitution by this time.the fdic amended complaint therefore seeks a restitution amount lower than that originally sought.
the united states attorney office in knoxville,tennessee,filed discovery requests in october and instituted an action to enforce the restitution of million.in january,the district court granted the fdic motion,unopposed by dover,to intervene in the action.three months later,the fdic filed a complaint with the district court to recover million in restitution pursuant to h,the clause that empowers the victim to pursue enforcement in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.
the united states withdrew and the district court permitted the fdic to proceed in its parallel action.pursuant to the order of the district court,the parties filed motions for summary judgment.
dover argued that,as a special condition of his probation,his obligation to pay restitution expired at the end of his probation under the time limits set forth in f.he also argued that the release of his civil liability on the million judgment foreclosed the fdic action to collect restitution.the fdic argued that,because the sentencing court had ordered dover restitution payable immediately,not within a specified period or in specified installments,certain statutory time limits contained in f did not apply the fdic also argued that this section places time limits only on the sentencing court authority to schedule payment of restitution it does not terminate the defendant obligation to pay at the end of those statutory time limits if restitution is still outstanding.
the district court held that the civil settlement of the million judgment did not affect the restitution order.it held that private parties can not release criminal wrongdoers from punishment.however,the court granted summary judgment for dover.the court relied primarily on united states.cir and its interpretation of united states joseph,cir.it adopted the conclusions of the court that 
a defendant restitution obligation may not be extended beyond the time periods mentioned in f,and 
when the deadlines have passed,the restitution obligation has expired and can not be enforced.
the district court therefore found that dover restitution order had expired at the end of his probation and that the fdic was not entitled to pursue enforcement of the restitution order.the fdic filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review de novo the grant of summary judgment in favor of dover.boone spurgess,cir.we hold that the district court erred in finding that an immediately payable restitution order entered under f expired at the end of the criminal defendant probation period.we affirm the district court conclusion that settlement of a civil judgment with the victim and satisfaction of that judgment does not estop the fdic from collecting criminal restitution in favor of the same victim.
this case presents a question of first impression,insofar as it concerns a restitution order pursuant to the terms of the vwpa,a sentence including probation and restitution but no imprisonment,and an order by the sentencing court for immediate payment of the restitution,rather than by a schedule of installments or by a fixed date in the future.
in the court below,dover argued that his obligation to pay restitution expired at the end of his probation because he was ordered to pay restitution as a special condition of that probation.the fdic argued that the restitution having been made a special condition was immaterial to its expiry,and that the time limitations contemplated in f a were inapplicable because the sentencing court ordered the restitution to be paid immediately,rather than on a schedule,as contemplated by f.
the district court found united states joseph,cir controlling the joseph court had concluded that subsection f expressly limits the life of a restitution order.joseph,at.the district court noted that the more recent united states.cir affirmed joseph as good law.
because interpretation of joseph and supported the district court analysis,and because those cases might appear quite similar to the facts here,further exposition of the precedents is useful.
we distinguish joseph on two chief grounds first,the district court in that case ordered restitution to be paid at specified times or at least at times to be specified later,not immediately,and second,our discussion of time limits in that case was situated,if not expressly couched,in the context of payment on a required security agreement.
joseph pled guilty to making a false statement to the small business administration and to filing a false federal income tax return.the district court sentenced him to two years of imprisonment for the false statement,and imposed a suspended sentence and probation for the tax violation.the court further ordered him to pay restitution as one of the conditions of the probation for the tax violation.joseph,at.the joseph court quoted the language of the district court order 
the defendant shall pay restitution in the amount of,which amount will fairly compensate the sba for any unpaid advances it made,and defendant and the sba will execute forthwith a consent judgment in favor of the sba in such amount,which shall be in full settlement of all claims of the sba against defendant and defendant will execute security agreements to secure its payment during and after the period of probation.the payment of such restitution shall be by periodic payments during the period of probation in the amounts and in accordance with the payment schedule to be established by the probation department,which schedule may be adjusted by the probation department as it determines appropriate during the period of probation.
quoted in joseph,at.emphasis supplied.
we note that the district court ordered,pursuant to the language of what is now numbered f,periodic payments.this distinguishes our case from joseph.dover sentencing judge ordered that his restitution be paid immediately.
this court ultimately refused to enforce payment of joseph unpaid restitution agreement.we held that i f restitution is ordered under the victim act,finally,the court may not require the defendant to execute a consent judgment or otherwise require him to secure
