in,the omaha tribe entered into a treaty with the united states agreeing to establish a reservation and to cede and forever relinquish all right and title to its remaining land in nebraska for a fixed sum of money.in,the omaha tribe again entered into a treaty with the united states agreeing to cede,sell,and convey land for a fixed sum.when,in,the tribe sought to sell more of its land to the united states,congress took a different tack.in lieu of a purchase,congress authorized the secretary of the interior to survey,appraise,and sell tracts of reservation land to western settlers and to deposit any proceeds from the land sales in the treasury for the tribe benefit.congress took the same approach in when it passed the act in question.that act authorized the secretary of the interior to survey,appraise,and sell roughly acres of reservation land lying west of a railroad.peebles purchased a tract under the terms of the act and established the village of pender.
in,the tribe amended its beverage control ordinance and sought to subject pender retailers to the amended ordinance.see permitting tribes to regulate liquor sales on reservation land and in indian country pender and its retailers brought a suit against the tribe in federal district court to challenge the ordinance,and the state intervened on their behalf.they alleged that they were not within the reservation boundaries or in indian country and therefore could not be subject to the ordinance.they sought declaratory relief and a permanent injunction prohibiting the tribe from asserting its jurisdiction over the disputed land.concluding that the act did not diminish the omaha reservation,the district court denied relief,and the eighth circuit affirmed.
held the act did not diminish the omaha indian reservation.
a only congress may diminish the boundaries of an indian reservation,and its intent to do so must be clear.solem bartlett.this court framework for determining whether an indian reservation has been diminished is well settled and starts with the statutory text.hagen utah.here,the act bears none of the common textual indications that express such clear intent,e xplicit reference to cession or other language evidencing the present and total surrender of all tribal interests or an unconditional commitment from congress to compensate the indian tribe for its opened land,solem,supra,at.the act language opening the land for settlement under such rules and regulations as the secretary may prescribe,stat,falls into a category of surplus land acts that merely opened reservation land to settlement,decoteau district county court for tenth judicial.a comparison of the text of the and treaties,which unequivocally terminated the tribe jurisdiction over its land,with the act confirms this conclusion.
b in diminishment cases,this court has also examined all the circumstances surrounding the opening of a reservation,hagen,supra,at,including the contemporaneous understanding of the act effect on the reservation.here,such historical evidence can not overcome the text of the act,which lacks any indication that congress intended to diminish the reservation.dueling remarks by legislators about the act are far from the unequivocal evidence required in diminishment cases.
c finally,and to a lesser extent,the court may look to subsequent demographic history and subsequent treatment of the land by government officials.see solem,supra,at.this court has never relied solely on this third consideration to find diminishment,and the mixed record of subsequent treatment of the disputed land in this case can not overcome the statutory text.petitioners point to the tribe absence from the disputed territory for more than years,but this subsequent demographic history is the least compelling evidence in the diminishment analysis.south dakota yankton sioux tribe.likewise,evidence of the subsequent treatment of the disputed land by government officials has similarly limited value.and,while compelling,the justifiable expectations of the living on the land can not alone diminish reservation boundaries.
d because the parties have raised only the single question of diminishment,the court expresses no view about whether equitable considerations of laches and acquiescence may curtail the tribe power to tax the retailers of pender.city of sherrill oneida indian nation of.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the village of pender,nebraska sits a few miles west of an abandoned once used by the sioux city and nebraska railroad company.we must decide whether pender and surrounding thurston county,nebraska,are within the boundaries of the omaha indian reservation or whether the passage of an act empowering the united states secretary of the interior to sell the tribe land west of the diminished the reservation boundaries,thereby free ing the disputed land of its reservation status.solem bartlett.we hold that congress did not diminish the reservation in and that the disputed land is within the reservation boundaries.
centuries ago,the omaha tribe settled in eastern nebraska.by the century,the tribe was destitute and,in exchange for revenue,agreed to sell a large swath of its land to the united states.in,the tribe entered into a treaty with the united states to create a reservation.treaty with the omahas treaty,stat.the tribe agreed to cede and forever relinquish all right and title to its land west of the mississippi river,excepting the reservation,in exchange for,to be paid over years,at.

in,the tribe again expressed its wish to sell portions of the reservation,but congress took a different tack than it had in the and treaties.instead of purchasing a portion of the reservation for a fixed sum,congress authorized the secretary of the interior to survey,appraise,and sell up to acres on the western side of the reservation to be separated from the remaining portion of said reservation by a line agreed to by the tribe and congress.act of june,act,ch,stat.under the act,a nonmember could purchase tracts not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres each or the entire body offered.ibid.proceeds from any sales would be placed to the credit of said indians on the books of the treasury of the united states.ibid.but the proceeds were meager.the act resulted in only two sales totaling acres.
then came the act,central to the dispute between petitioners and respondents.in that act,congress again empowered the secretary of the interior to cause to be surveyed,if necessary,and sold more than acres lying west of a granted by the tribe and approved by the secretary of the interior in for use by the sioux city and nebraska railroad company.act of,act,stat.the land for sale under the terms of the act overlapped substantially with the land congress tried,but failed,to sell in.once the land was appraised in tracts of forty acres each,the secretary was to issue a proclamation that the lands are open for settlement under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.at.within one year of that proclamation,a nonmember could purchase up to acres of land for no less than per acre in cash paid to the united states,so long as the settler occup ied it,made valuable improvements thereon,and was a citizen of the united states,or declared his intention to become such.at.the proceeds
