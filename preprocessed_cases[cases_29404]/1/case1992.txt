grable sons metal products,grable argues that the district court committed two errors in granting judgment to darue engineering manufacturing darue in grable action to quiet title against darue.first,grable argues that its claim,although based on federal tax law,does not present a federal question,and,therefore,that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the case after darue removed it from michigan state court.secondly,grable appeals the district court judgment denying its claim in property darue had purchased at a tax sale after the irs seized it from grable in.
grable action is based on provisions of the internal revenue code concerning proper procedures for notifying delinquent taxpayers that their property has been seized.its claim implicates a substantial federal interest,thereby presenting a federal question.furthermore,the district court correctly denied grable action because the internal revenue code allows for substantial,rather than literal,compliance with regulations regarding notification.neither federal law nor principles of equity supports grable claim,asserted six years after the sale of its property,that notice by certified mail,rather than in person,rendered the irs sale to darue invalid.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety.
the facts in this case are not disputed.in,the irs seized property at plains road,in eaton rapids,michigan,to satisfy grable tax debt resulting from not paying its corporate income taxes for six years.the irs served notice of the seizure by certified mail,although a,the relevant statute,provides that notice must be given personally to the owner of the property.the parties agree that the irs failed to adhere to the exact provisions of the statute but that grable nevertheless received actual notice of the seizure.the irs sold the property to darue on december,for.the record before us contains no clear evidence that grable challenged the sale at the time or attempted to redeem the property at issue in this case.following its standard procedure,the irs executed a quitclaim deed to darue on november.
on december,about six years after darue bought the property,grable challenged the sale in eaton county circuit court by filing a action.darue removed the case to the united states court for the western district of michigan under b.grable filed a motion to remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.c.the district court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because the application of a implicates a substantial federal interest,meaning that grable claim was based on a federal question.on march,the district court denied grable motion to quiet title and awarded judgment to darue.grable appealed to this court in a timely manner.
federal question jurisdiction 
a defendant may remove to federal district court any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.a.district courts have original jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress providing for internal revenue.this court reviews district court decisions regarding subject matter jurisdiction de novo.caudill am.media,cir.because we may not rule on the merits of a case over which a district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction,we must decide that issue first.see thomas united states,cir.the parties do not have diversity of citizenship,a,nor is the united states a party to this action 
federal courts also have original jurisdiction over claims arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.whether a claim presents a federal question must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim.taylor anderson.in its original complaint to quiet title,grable alleged that darue quitclaim deed was invalid because it was given with improper notice pursuant to et and since the tax deed was given pursuant to improper notice as required by a,said transfer and claim through the tax deed is null and void and void ab initio.the key question is whether grable action,based as it is on the faulty process in a tax seizure,arises under federal law and thus invokes federal court jurisdiction.we hold that it does.
the statute upon which grable bases his complaint reads 
as soon as practicable after seizure of property,notice in writing shall be given by the secretary to the owner of the property or shall be left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made.if the owner can not be readily located,or has no dwelling or place of business within such district,the notice may be mailed to his last known address.
a emphasis added.the parties agree that the irs failed to give or leave notification and that therefore the service of notice did not comply with the statute.see goodwin united states,noting government concession that the literal meaning of the statute requires personal service howard adle,demonstrating that certified mailing is insufficient for compliance with the statute by quoting b and irs manual the latter specifies that the original notice of sale will be delivered to the taxpayer personally.although grable complaint hinges on a violation of the internal revenue code,grable insists that its cause of action does not arise under federal law.
the long history of supreme court guidance concerning the meaning of arising under the laws of the united states has been synthesized into a test.although formulations differ slightly among the circuits,a federal question may arise out of a state law case or controversy if the plaintiff asserts a federal right that involves a substantial question of federal law is framed in terms of state law and requires interpretation of federal law to resolve the case.long bando of america,cir see,howery allstate insurance,cir,cert.denied,d seinfeld austen,cir,cert.denied sub nom.abbott labs.seinfeld,d.the asserted federal right in this case,personal notification of seizure of property as provided by irs regulations,fulfills these three requirements.
substantial federal interest 
to identify a federal question,we must make a pragmatic assessment of the nature of the federal interest at stake,howery,at citing commentators,a simple task in this context.the federal government can not function without effective tax collection.see united states kimbell foods,d citing mcculloch maryland,wheat.society has a strong interest in clear rules for handling delinquent taxpayers.the irs must have transparent procedures for seizing and selling property so that people will be willing to purchase property at tax sales,allowing the irs to provide a predictable stream of tax revenue.determining the scope of the irs authority to seize property to satisfy a tax debt undoubtably implicates a substantial federal interest.
presentation as a state law claim 
grable sued to quiet title,which is generally a state law cause of action.however,the scope of a taxpayer right to due process in the form of notice of the tax seizure and sale is the essential element of this claim.grable would not have any cause of action,and darue would have undisputed title to the property,were it not for the technical notice requirements of a.therefore the internal revenue code,not state property law,lies at the center of this dispute.the state and federal claims are sufficiently entwined to allow us to find that grable has presented a federal question.
interpretation of the federal law required 
disposition of all the aspects of this case,including those related to the traditional state law property issues,turn on construction of federal tax law.both parties agree that the only way to resolve the underlying controversy is to evaluate whether a,which mandates notice for irs seizure of property for of taxes in person,requires strict,or merely substantial,compliance with its provisions to allow the irs deed to convey title.if strict compliance is necessary,then grable is entitled to get his property back because the irs did not comply with the letter of the statute.if substantial compliance is
