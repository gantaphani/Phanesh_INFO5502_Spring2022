this case provides a cautionary tale for employers about the risk of maintaining and enforcing a broad confidentiality clause.northeastern land services,nls petitions for review of the national labor relations board finding that it violated section a of the national labor relations act nlra,a,by maintaining an overbroad confidentiality provision and by discharging its employee jamison dupuy for violating it.ne.land,nlrb cch june.the board has filed a to enforce the order.
the case also raises an issue of first impression whether a board decision complied with the quorum requirement of section b of the nlra.we deny the petition and grant the board for enforcement.
because the board is primarily responsible for developing and applying a coherent national labor policy,we accord its decisions considerable deference.nlrb boston dist.council of carpenters,cir citation omitted.the board judgment stands when the choice is between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.universal camera nlrb.a board order must be enforced if the board correctly applied the law and if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record.e,f yesterday children,nlrb,cir.where,as here,the board has reached a conclusion opposite of that of the alj,our review is slightly less deferential than it would be otherwise.indus.mech.contractors,nlrb,cir.
the facts are not in dispute.nls is a temporary employment agency located in east providence,rhode island which supplies workers to clients in the natural gas and telecommunications industries,but pays its workers directly.dupuy was employed twice by nls as a agent for the acquisition of land rights by clients,from february to november,and from july to october.dupuy obtained the placement by contacting rick lopez,a project manager for nls client el paso energy,who had once worked with dupuy at nls.lopez directed dupuy to contact nls,which soon placed him with el paso at its dracut expansion project in massachusetts.
before both of dupuy placements by nls,nls required dupuy to sign a temporary employment contract which said,in relevant part 
employee understands that the terms of this employment,including compensation,are confidential to employee and the nls group.disclosure of these terms to other parties may constitute grounds for dismissal.
this confidentiality provision is at the heart of this case.
dupuy complained to nls about repeated delays in receiving his paycheck.he was particularly concerned because he had to pay for expenses such as his hotel bills up front and later seek reimbursement.after dupuy tried to negotiate with nls,and even threatened to quit,jesse green,executive vice president and chief operating officer of nls,agreed to call lopez to see if el paso would either pay for dupuy hotel bill or provide a larger per diem than nls had offered to help with dupuy cash flow problems.although nls ultimately billed most of dupuy expenses to el paso,nls was responsible for reimbursing dupuy.green told dupuy that lopez would not agree to any alternative arrangements.
in early october,dupuy raised two additional concerns about his job.the first arose when dupuy contacted lopez to tell him that dupuy cell phone was not working.dupuy asked lopez whether he might be able to work for el paso through a different employment agency because dupuy had not been paid in a timely manner by nls.lopez refused dupuy request and gave dupuy the contact information of norm winters,an agent of nls,to resolve the pay issues.
the second concern was the reimbursement for dupuy use of his personal computer.dupuy had initially arranged to receive a reimbursement for computer usage.nls treated this as a business expense for tax purposes,which did not count as income to the employee,and on which nls did not pay social security taxes.on october,however,dupuy received an email from nls coordinator of human resources,susan green,which referred to the computer usage reimbursement rate as per day.dupuy replied that el paso had authorized,and he had been billing,per day for computer usage he questioned the rate.green told dupuy that nls accountants had determined that the computer usage cost should be considered taxable compensation,rather than a expense billed to el paso.green stated that the reclassification of the tax status of the computer usage fee had increased nls overhead costs,requiring an offsetting reduction of per day.
dupuy sent a reply email to green,copying lopez,stating,by copy of this email to rick lopez,i am asking el paso to offset your surcharge and additional tax burden.he said that if he did not receive the offset,i will no longer be using my computer for this job.el paso will have to furnish me with a digital camera,and i will no longer be available by email after today and until the matter has been resolved,my equipment is offline.
on the evening of october,he sent an email to everyone working with him on the el paso project,including rick lopez,saying,until further notice,my computer is offline and i will not be accepting email.i can still be reached by the contact telephone numbers that you have.dupuy did not copy any nls managers on the email.jesse green testified that although he tried to contact dupuy numerous times by paging him,calling his cell phone and leaving messages at his hotel and with other employees,dupuy did not call him back.
on october,jesse green spoke with dupuy on the phone.green told dupuy that nls had tried to accommodate his requests,but that it seemed that nls could never make dupuy happy and,as a result,nls thought it was best to terminate his employment.dupuy replied that he would sue nls for retaliatory discharge,alleging that it fired him because he had threatened to file a complaint against the company with the massachusetts attorney general alleging violations of state wage laws when dupuy pressed jesse green for the reason for his termination,green replied that nls had cause to terminate dupuy employment,as dupuy had not lived up to his end of the bargain with nls.
jesse green later testified that his statement regarding dupuy failure to live up to his end of the bargain was a reference to dupuy failure to comply with the confidentiality provision in the temporary employment agreement that required him not to disclose the terms of his employment to outside parties.green,who had drafted the confidentiality provision,further testified that in making the determination that dupuy had violated the confidentiality provision by contacting el paso directly,green thought it was inappropriate for dupuy to approach a client with his problems about salary,because then we not providing the services that we contracted to provide.
dupuy filed an unfair labor practice charge on october,and filed an amended charge on december.the complaint issued january,alleging that nls violated section a of the nlra by maintaining and enforcing an unlawful confidentiality clause in its employment contract that discouraged employees from engaging in protected concerted activities,and by terminating dupuy employment on october for violating the terms of that clause.
the alj found that although the provision did restrict the employees right to discuss their terms and conditions of employment with third parties,there are different gradations in how seriously employees section rights are affected.relying on his reading of board precedent,the alj found that the confidentiality provision did not violate section a,explaining that because nls did not prohibit discussions of terms and conditions of employment among fellow employees,i find nls restriction a less serious infringement upon its employees section rights.relying on language from desert palace,the alj explained that i t is necessary to strike a proper balance between employees section rights and an employer business justifications.noting the competitive bidding process in nls industry,the alj found that nls had a legitimate and substantial business justification for the rule outweighing the restriction on the employees section rights.dupuy appealed.
on june,the board,by a panel,reversed the alj decision,determining that,under martin luther mem l home,lutheran heritage,the confidentiality provision was unlawful because employees reasonably would construe it to prohibit activity protected by section.the board explained,the confidentiality provision,by its clear terms,precludes employees from discussing compensation and other terms of employment with other parties.employees would reasonably understand that language as prohibiting discussions of their compensation with union representatives.the board determined that the provision was overbroad and therefore in violation of section a,without relying on whether nls had actually enforced the rule.
as to the termination of dupuy employment for violating the rule,the board held,under extant board precedent,an employer imposition of discipline pursuant to an unlawfully overbroad rule constitutes a violation of the act.nls had conceded that it dismissed dupuy because he violated the confidentiality provision.the board concluded that nls termination of dupuy pursuant to the confidentiality provision violated section a.in a footnote to the unlawful discharge analysis,the board explained that one member,chairman schaumber 
a grees that application of double eagle hotel casino dictates a finding that dupuy termination violated a of the act.however,he questions the theory that an employer imposition of discipline pursuant to an unlawfully overbroad rule is necessarily unlawful,such as in situations where the discipline imposed is for a lawful reason albeit under an overly broad,unlawful rule.nonetheless,he applies precedent for institutional reasons for the purpose of deciding this case.

the board ordered,inter alia,that nls rescind the provision that nls notify its current and former employees under the temporary employment agreement of the decision that dupuy be reinstated to his former position or a substantially similar position that dupuy be made whole for any loss of earnings and other benefits suffered as a result of the unlawful action taken against him and that nls ensure that the references to the unlawful discharge be deleted from nls files.
we turn to nls challenge to the board decision.nls contends that the decision could not be properly issued because the board lacked a quorum under section of the nlra,b,in that it can not delegate all of its powers to a panel.on the merits,nls argues that the board erred in finding that the confidentiality agreement violated section and in finding that dupuy termination violated the nlra.these arguments fail.
a.the quorum requirement 
the first issue raised is one of statutory interpretation of section b.we owe some deference to the agency view.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.by statute,the board consists of five members,who are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate and serve staggered terms of five years.a.section b of the nlra states 
the board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more members any or all of the powers which it may itself exercise a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board,and three members of the board shall,at all times,constitute a quorum of the board,except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.
pursuant to that authority,the four members of the board who held office on december,delegated the board powers to a group.when the term of one member of that group expired three days later,a quorum remained 
the board delegation of its institutional power to a panel that ultimately consisted of a quorum because of a vacancy was lawful under the plain text of section b.first,section b allowed the board to delegate all of its powers to a group.second,the statute states that a vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board.the vacancy,which left the quorum remaining,may not,under the terms of section b,impair the right of the quorum to exercise all powers of the board.this is consistent with the conclusion of the office of legal counsel of the department of justice which has concluded,in our view,if the board delegated all of its powers to a group of three members,that group could continue to issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two members remained.quorum requirements,memorandum from edward whelan iii,principal deputy assistant attorney,office of legal counsel,available at wl.moreover,a ny other general rule would impose an undue burden on the administrative process.yardmasters of am.harris.
our conclusion is consistent with that of another circuit,nlrb,cir.in,a panel of the board heard the case,but before the board announced its decision,one member of the panel submitted his resignation.the resignation became effective on the same day the decision in the case issued,although all three members concurred in the decision.the petitioner argued that the decision was unenforceable because it was not made by a properly constituted panel because the resigning person,the petitioner argued,could not have participated in the decision.id.at.reasoned that under section b,even if the member who resigned did not participate in the decision,a decision by two members of the panel would still be binding,id.at,and analogized the quorum requirement in section b to the quorum for the federal courts of appeals.stated,c ourts have interpreted quorum to mean the number of the members of the court as may legally transact judicial business.id.quoting tobin ramey,cir.the court concluded that the participation of the quorum needed to conduct business was sufficient.id.at.
further,courts have upheld analogous approaches by other administrative agencies.see falcon trading group,sec,upholding sec promulgation of a new quorum rule to allow it to continue to operate in the face of multiple vacancies hunter mediation,cir per curiam upholding decision by two members of panel of national mediation board allowing quorum where almost all of the preliminary work had been performed by one member yardmasters of,at upholding the national mediation board delegation of its authority to a single member expected to remain in office.
overbreadth of the confidentiality provision 
section of the nlra prohibits employers from interfer ing with,restrain ing,or coerc ing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section of the nlra.a.section guarantees employees the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.
section a has been read to bar employer interference with employees right to discuss the terms and conditions of their employment with others under section of the nlra.see beth israel hosp.nlrb,d t he right of employees to and bargain collectively established by necessarily encompasses the right effectively to communicate with one another regarding at the jobsite.cent.hardware nlrb,d o rganization rights are not viable in a vacuum their effectiveness depends in some measure on the ability of employees to learn the advantages and disadvantages of organization from others.
an employer violates section a when it maintains a work rule that would reasonably tend to chill employees in the exercise of their section rights.lafayette park hotel.under the board caselaw,if the rule is likely to have a chilling effect on section rights,the board may conclude that its maintenance is an unfair labor practice,even absent evidence of enforcement.see also guardsmark,llc nlrb,explaining and applying lafayette park mere maintenance rule.
nls contends that the confidentiality provision did not violate the nlra because,as a factual matter,it did not prohibit employees from discussing terms of employment among themselves and,although it was enforced,it was not enforced in the face of union activity.nls asserts that mere broad wording,without evidence of actual chilling of union a
