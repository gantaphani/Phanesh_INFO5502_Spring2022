in october,appellee bruce strack strack,along with his wife,filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.strack listed appellant kubota tractor corporation kubota as a creditor holding an unsecured judgment claim against him for approximately.kubota later brought an adversary proceeding against the stracks in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia,challenging the pending discharge of the debt under two statutory exceptions to the presumption of dischargeability defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,under a,and willful and malicious injury by the debtor,under a.the bankruptcy court found neither exception to apply and the debt therefore dischargeable.on appeal,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia affirmed the bankruptcy court opinion and order.because we find that the debt arose by reason of strack defalcation,or nonfraudulent default,while he was acting in a fiduciary capacity,we find that a renders the debt,and reverse the judgment of the district court.having found the debt under a,we do not reach kubota claim under a.
the relevant facts here are not in dispute.strack served as president and majority owner of enterprise equipment enterprise enterprise sold farming equipment,such as tractors,and parts for such equipment at its retail facility located in york county,virginia.kubota was one of the numerous agricultural machinery manufacturing companies for which enterprise acted as an authorized dealer.in his capacity as enterprise president,strack agreed to personally guarantee enterprise indebtedness to kubota.in september,strack also signed kubota dealer sales and service agreement the agreement,which forms the basis of this appeal.
the agreement purpose was to renew enterprise right to purchase and resell kubota products.pursuant to the agreement,kubota sold whole goods,or equipment,to enterprise through a arrangement under such an arrangement,a dealer can purchase goods from a manufacturer without paying for the goods up front.here,enterprise would order a piece of equipment from kubota for either immediate resale or to hold in its product inventory.although no money changed hands,enterprise purchase of the equipment would,in substance,result in the automatic issuance of a loan to enterprise from kubota for the purchase price amount.if an promotion was in place,as appears to have frequently been the case,kubota did not require payment of either principal or interest on this loan for the first several months immediately following the date of enterprise purchase.if no such program was in place,enterprise was required to make interest payments during this period.under either scenario,at the end of the period the entire purchase price became due to kubota.
to secure the performance and payment of all obligations of enterprise to kubota,enterprise granted to kubota a security interest in,and lien on,the equipment.to further protect kubota interests,the agreement prohibited enterprise from disposing of,or selling,any equipment except in the ordinary course of business upon customary terms for value received.the following terms governing enterprise handling of the proceeds from these sales form the crux of this appeal 
until enterprise shall have made settlement with kubota of the full amount due to kubota with respect to any equipment disposed of by enterprise,enterprise shall segregate the proceeds and hold the same in trust for kubota.enterprise shall be entitled to transfer proceeds free of trust if at,or prior to,the time of such transfer,the payment due from enterprise to kubota shall be assured to the satisfaction of kubota.
id.emphasis added.
kubota would conduct regular inventory audits at enterprise facility to determine whether enterprise had sold any kubota equipment without then segregating the proceeds and remitting them to kubota.enterprise frequently sold equipment in such fashion,a breach kubota dubs as going out of trust,and had to repay kubota at the conclusion of the audits.enterprise was able to repay kubota until march,at which time its financial condition deteriorated.
by july,enterprise was indebted to kubota for nearly.according to strack,enterprise was unable to repay kubota because all proceeds garnered were used to pay employees,taxes,and other expenses necessary for enterprise to remain in business.strack went to great lengths to try to keep enterprise afloat,even borrowing against the equity in his home and placing those funds into enterprise account.strack managed to reduce enterprise debt to kubota to approximately by returning parts and inventory that enterprise had previously purchased and by making payments whenever possible despite these efforts,enterprise ultimately went out of business,and was unable to make any further payments to kubota.kubota subsequently sued strack in the circuit court for the county of york,virginia,pursuant to his personal guarantee of enterprise indebtedness,for the balance due under the agreement.in the proceedings,strack admitted the legitimacy of the debt and kubota obtained a judgment against him on july,in the amount of.
on october,the stracks filed for chapter relief and listed kubota as a creditor.kubota later filed an adversary proceeding with the bankruptcy court,alleging that such debt should be under one of two exceptions to the presumption of dischargeability defalcation by a fiduciary,a or willful and malicious injury by the debtor,a the bankruptcy court rejected kubota arguments and found the debt dischargeable.specifically,the court found that the agreement did not unequivocally create an express trust between kubota and enterprise and therefore the debt did not arise while strack was acting as a fiduciary for the purposes of a and strack efforts to repay kubota negated the willful requirement of a.kubota appealed the bankruptcy court judgment,unsuccessfully,to the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.this appeal followed.
kubota maintains that the bankruptcy court and district court erred in finding that strack debt was not excepted from discharge under either a or a.we review the judgment of a district court sitting in review of a bankruptcy court de novo,applying the same standards of review that were applied in the district court.three sisters partners,llc harden in re,cir.thus,here,we examine the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.see fed.irs white in re white,cir.
generally,all legal obligations of the debtor,no matter how remote or contingent are potentially dischargeable in bankruptcy.see,at see also nunnery rountree in re rountree,cir.congress,however,has provided,in,several limited exceptions to this presumption of dischargeability,which we must construe narrowly to protect the bankruptcy act purpose of providing debtors a fresh start.in re biondo,cir.kubota claim turns on the applicability of two such exceptions,a and a.as the party challenging dischargeability,kubota bears the burden of proving the debt by a preponderance of the evidence.see grogan garner,d.
we first address kubota argument that a,excepting from discharge those debts for fraud or defalcation committed by one acting in a fiduciary capacity,proscribes the discharge of strack debt.to prevail under this provision,a creditor must ordinarily make a showing that the debt in issue arose while the debtor was acting in a fiduciary capacity and that the debt arose from the debtor fraud or defalcation.pahlavi ansari in re ansari,cir.here,the second criterion,defalcation,or default,is not in dispute however,since kubota is attempting to prevent the discharge of strack debt based on his guarantee of enterprise indebtedness,kubota must demonstrate not only that enterprise defalcated while acting in a fiduciary capacity for kubota,but also that enterprise actions can be attributed to strack.see airlines reporting ellison in re ellison,cir requiring more than the existence of a fiduciary duty on behalf of the corporation to find that the corporation officers indebtedness,based on their guarantees of the corporation debt,was for fraud or de
