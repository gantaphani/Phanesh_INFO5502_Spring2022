background 
on may,quao lin dong,a chinese national,entered the united states at or near boston,massachusetts without valid entry documents.dong was detained by the united states immigration and naturalization service ins shortly thereafter.on june,the ins issued a notice to appear,charging dong with removability from the united states pursuant to a a i i of the immigration and nationality act ina as an alien who,at the time of application of admission,was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa,reentry permit,border crossing identification card,or other valid entry document.a i i.on february,dong filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal,also later construed as an application for protection under article iii of cat.dong claimed that she feared return to china on account of past persecution by the chinese authorities pursuant to china family planning policy.on december,after numerous continuances,dong testified at a merits hearing in support of her application.
dong testimony recounted her life in china and her alleged persecution at the hands of chinese officials.she was born in china on november,and was later married to le ju jian.on november,dong gave birth to the first of their three children,a girl.in,following the birth of her daughter,dong was forced to have an intrauterine device,or iud,inserted for purposes.dong described her husband being forcibly subdued while she was dragged from her home to have the procedure performed against her will.dong husband subsequently fled china,hoping to obtain legal status in the united states with the intention of bringing dong and their daughter stateside.
in,dong fell ill from the iud and later had it removed.jian rejoined dong in china to care for her from april to june,thereafter returning to the united states.while her husband was in china,dong became pregnant.in january,when dong was seven months pregnant,family planning officials visited dong house.they told her that they knew of her pregnancy and that china family planning policy prohibited her from having a second child.dong was taken to another location,where she was given an injection and put into a cell.while in the cell,dong went into labor.she was then taken to guantow health hospital,where she gave birth to a child.
approximately one month later,dong was instructed by the family planning officials to report to have another iud inserted.dong appeared for the insertion appointment,but she was still experiencing bleeding.after examining her,the doctor stated that she could not be fitted for the iud at that time.dong was told to report for a second attempt at insertion in april.she was cautioned by the doctor that if the second attempt at insertion proved unsuccessful,she would be forced to submit to a procedure that would result in her sterilization.instead of taking this chance,dong fled.she went into hiding,moving into her cousin house which was located about two hours from her home.during this time,dong was advised by her that the family planning authorities had come to her house and continued to look for dong after she had fled.while in hiding,dong made arrangements to join her husband in the united states.dong left china in march.
while in the united states,awaiting the completion of the related administrative proceedings,dong gave birth to two more children.on august,in philadelphia,pennsylvania,dong gave birth to a girl.less than a year later,on july,dong gave birth to a third child,a boy.dong oldest child remains in china.the two younger children live in the united states with dong and her husband.
dong offered several pieces of evidence to corroborate her testimony.aside from the filing documents,initial interview transcripts,and a few other pieces of evidence offered to describe her life in the united states and the births of her three children,dong offered three united states department of state country reports to support her claim of fear of future persecution.dong also offered letters authored by her and a relative,both of whom live in china,which buttress,in detail,her testimony as to past persecution.specifically,her letter gives an account of the events,and turmoil,that surrounded the insertion of iuds and the alleged forced abortion,as well as dong flight into hiding.the relative letter simply states that dong did live with him from through to avoid family planning officials.
dong also offered medical records to reflect the events described in her testimony.documentation of quarterly gynecological exams required by the chinese government were offered to show the extent of the family planning policy.medical records from temple university hospital in philadelphia,pennsylvania,from and,were produced to show that dong had discussed the abortion she was forced to undergo in china in with her doctors when seeking medical treatment here in the united states.dong also offered a special disease certificate from guantow central community hospital stating that she was seven months pregnant and had undergone an induced abortion at the facility.however,this was challenged by the government,who in rebuttal,offered a department of homeland security report that claimed the certificate was fraudulent.this conclusion was based on a statement by an official at guantow hospital,made to consular officials as part of an investigation,claiming that the certificate was fraudulent because there was no doctor with the name on the certificate working at the hospital.dong in turn challenged the dhs report by offering a letter from michael pellerin,director of the political asylum research and documentation service,llc,asserting that the shortcomings of dhs investigative methodology made its report unreliable.pellerin highlighted the failure to research human resource records or other concrete documentation in arriving at the conclusion that the certificate was fraudulent.the dhs report itself discusses the difficulty of securing accurate information from the hospital.specifically,the report stated that the office does not keep any records of the certificates having been issued,the personnel of the office have been constantly changing,and s ignature verification is also not easy to conduct.
additionally,the record contained dong husband jian asylum application.jian stated in his asylum claim that dong was forced to undergo an abortion by family planning officials in,while dong had testified that the iud was inserted in and the forced abortion occurred in.when the government questioned dong about this conflict,she expressed surprise,claiming to have only learned of this for the first time at her merits hearing.dong offered no explanation of the inconsistency created by her husband asylum claim,except for the comment,he does not talk a lot and i did not ask.dong did produce her husband parole and travel documents to corroborate his travel to china in,but she offered no live testimony or affidavit from her husband to resolve this factual discrepancy.
the ij summarized the proceedings as a simple abortion case,requiring the ij to find dong credible in her testimony and persuasive in her request for discretionary relief.at the outset of his analysis,the ij was perplexed by the absence of dong husband during the hearing,so much so that,after finding that dong largely testified consistent with the claim,the ij held that dong nonetheless failed to meet her burden of proof because the evidence she presented lacked specific corroboration in the form of her husband testimony to resolve the discrepancy in dates referred to above.the ij opined that the conflict between dong asylum claim and her husband claim created enough doubt to make it reasonable for the ij to expect this specific form of corroboration.despite this request,dong did not produce the requested corroboration,stating that her husband was under an exclusion to explain why it would be unreasonable to expect him to appear and testify.dong argued that the record evidence she had produced was sufficient to corroborate her claim.the ij did not consider what had been produced,as such,but,relying on abdulai,required corroboration in the form of the husband testimony or affidavit regarding the discrepancy in order for dong to meet her burden of proof.accordingly,he denied dong asylum.
in addition,the ij held that dong failed to make the required showing necessary to justify asylum based on a fear of future persecution,withholding of removal,or relief under cat.dong appealed to the bia,which in affirming the ij ruling,adopted his reasoning and dismissed the appeal.
jurisdiction,standard of review,and dong burden of proof 
the bia had jurisdiction over dong appeal from the ij determination pursuant to.we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the bia under.
dong appeal arises from the bia determination however,we have held that when the bia has affirmed the ij decision,and adopted the analysis as its own,we will review both decisions.see sandie att y,cir because the ij corroboration discussion and determinations are affirmed and partially reiterated in the bia decision,we review them along with the bia decision.therefore,we will review the ij and bia findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.camara att y,cir we affirm any findings of fact supported by substantial evidence and are bound by the administrative findings of fact unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to arrive at a contrary conclusion.quoting yan lan wu ashcroft,cir.we review the ij and bia legal determinations de novo.toussaint att y,cir.if we take issue with the application of law to dong case,we will defer to the authority granted an agency by congress and remand to the bia for the appropriate consideration.ims.ventura.
dong bears the burden of proof in her claim for relief.for dong to qualify for the discretionary relief of asylum,she must establish that she satisfies the definition of refugee within the meaning established by section a of the ina.a.a refugee is defined by the ina as any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.additionally,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.a b.
dong can demonstrate a fear of future persecution by showing that she has a genuine fear,and that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution upon return to her native country.gao ashcroft,cir.her fear must be both subjectively and objectively reasonable.lukwago ashcroft,cir.dong subjective fear can be shown through credible testimony that she fears persecution.see chang ins,cir.objective reasonableness may be established by,among other things,her own testimony,the testimony of other corroborating witnesses,or submitting evidence regarding conditions in her home country.see id a the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.
dong plea for withholding of removal requires her to establish that,upon returning to her native country,her life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina b,b.to receive the grant of withholding,the alien must establish a clear probability or that it is more likely than not that the alien would suffer persecution if repatriated.b ins stevic.unlike asylum,withholding of removal is mandatory rather than discretionary.see id.at.
dong final claim arises out of article iii of the cat,for which relief is available to applicants where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,stat.c.relief under cat exists in the form of withholding of removal to the country of torture.c.cat claims require the alien to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.in assessing the potential of torture,the ij must consider all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture,along with evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant,and the likelihood that an applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured.c.
issue of corroboration 
before us,dong argues that the bia erred in requiring her husband testimony as corroboration of her claim because it is both unnecessary and unreasonable.she urges that,since her husband was in the united states at the time of the abortion in,his statement,or misstatement,on the subject was nothing more than hearsay,and of limited relevance.she also argues that his testimony pales in significance to the other probative evidence she has offered.dong reasons that the other evidence of,the letter from her,the abortion certificate,her husband parole and travel documents,and the united states medical much more persuasive than her husband testimony would be.dong also insists that it is unreasonable for the bia to require her husband corroboration in light of the outstanding exclusion order entered against him and that her husband assertion in his claim should not be determinative of her credibility.though we share some of dong concerns regarding the relevance of her husband testimony,we need not address them specifically,as we find that the ij and the bia erred by misapplying the law regarding when corroboration is necessary in order to meet one burden of proof.
in abdulai we vacated a bia order which found that a nigerian man failed to meet his burden for asylum due to a lack of certain corroborating evidence.at.we held that it is appropriate for the bia to require applicants to supply corroborating evidence in order to meet their burden of proof when it is reasonable to expect such evidence to be produced id.at.our definition of reasonable in this context is where the facts requiring corroboration are central to the applicant claim and easily subject to verification.chukwu att y,cir.in abdulai,we approved of the inquiry utilized by the bia when considering the need for corroboration.at.we held that the ij can find that a petitioner failure to produce corroborating evidence is fatal,but only after following the inquiry,which requires 
an identification of the facts for which it is reasonable to expect corroboration an inquiry as to whether the applicant has provided information corroborating the relevant facts and,if he or she has not,an analysis of whether the applicant has adequately explained his or her failure to do so.
id at quoting in re,bia.this inquiry also requires that an applicant be given the opportunity to produce the corroborating evidence.id.in abdulai we vacated the bia order and remanded for further proceedings because the ij failed to perform the first step of the inquiry,namely,to identify what particular aspects of the applicant testimony it would have been reasonable to expect him to have corroborated.at.
we have required faithful adherence to the test.in chukwu attorney general,we remanded the bia determination that chukwu,a nigerian,failed to meet his burden of proof for an asylum claim that was based on a fear of p
