caretolive filed a request with the food and drug administration,which we will refer to generally as the fda,under the freedom of information act seeking copies of letters sent between its medical experts regarding provenge,an immunotherapy treatment for late stage prostate cancer.the fda was slow to respond to this request,and caretolive filed a lawsuit demanding the immediate production of responsive documents.the district court stayed proceedings while the fda responded to the request and delivered responsive documents.the fda then moved for summary judgment based on having fulfilled caretolive request,which the district court granted.caretolive now appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of the fda and asserts that the district court erred by denying it discovery.however,caretolive has not identified any material question of fact as to the adequacy of the fda search.additionally,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying caretolive leave to conduct discovery.therefore,we affirm the decision of the district court.
caretolive is an association of cancer patients,patient families,doctors,investors,and advocates focused on helping men suffering from late stage prostate cancer.this lawsuit arose as a result of the fda decision denying a biologics license application for provenge.immunotherapy treatments,like provenge,train the body immune system to recognize cancer cells and attack them.although the fda advisory panel had initially recommended approving provenge,the agency did not follow that recommendation.after the fda initial denial,caretolive suspected foul play and filed a request under the freedom of information act with the fda on august.the request sought 
a copy of all letters written to the fda or prepared by the fda and purported to be from scher,hussain and doctor fleming in between march and april of,regarding the biologics license application submitted for provenge also known as including the envelope or other means of communication whereby the fda received such letters and a copy of any record of those letters then being disclosed to any media or other persons or specifically a publication called the cancer letter,including the means of communication to the cancer letter of the scher,hussain and fleming letters from the fda or its employees to outside persons,publications or companies.
although he was not named in the request,caretolive suggests that richard pazdur was the fda cancer czar and at the center of the alleged improprieties.the doctors specifically identified in caretolive request appear to be pazdur advisors.
the fda division of freedom of information received the request on september,and advised caretolive by letter the same day that the request had been received caretolive request was the th request under the freedom of information act that the fda had received that year.the fda division of freedom of information initially forwarded the request to the center for biologics evaluation and research because the request sought records relating to an unapproved biological product regulated by that center.the request was also sent to the office of the commissioner,office of the executive secretariat because it sought records relating to agency correspondence.
on november,the center for biologics responded with records.the office of the commissioner,office of the executive secretariat responded on january,that it had not found any responsive records.
while these searches were pending,the division of freedom of information also sent caretolive request to the division of information disclosure policy in the fda center for drug evaluation and research because the center for biologics indicated that additional records might be found there.the division of information disclosure received the request on october,and assigned it to its complex track.requests that can be answered quickly with readily available documents and do not require any searching or redaction are considered simple,and placed on a faster track known as the simple track.in contrast,if searching or redaction will be required,the request is placed on the complex track.the division of information disclosure believed that caretolive request sought documents not readily available and would require searching and possibly redacting.on december,the division of information disclosure left a telephone message with caretolive counsel stating that it follows a,two track policy to respond to freedom of information act requests and it would process caretolive request accordingly.the division of information disclosure left the same message again on december.
not content to wait,caretolive filed a lawsuit in the southern district of ohio on january,seeking immediate production of all documents responsive to its request.on may,the district court granted the fda motion to stay proceedings and ordered the center for drug evaluation to provide responsive documents no later than may.on may,the division of information disclosure delivered one additional responsive document.the fda also filed a motion for summary judgment the same day,based on its compliance with caretolive request for documents.
caretolive subsequently filed a motion for discovery,which was also titled as a partial memorandum in opposition to the fda summary judgment motion.after briefing concluded,the district court granted the fda motion for summary judgment and denied caretolive motion for discovery.

a.the act requirements to search for responsive documents.
the freedom of information act generally requires federal agencies to promptly make records available after receiving a request that reasonably describes the records and is made in accordance with the agency published rules governing such requests.a a rugiero,at.the agency may only withhold or limit the availability of records that fall within one of the act specific exceptions.d rugiero,at.these exceptions are to be narrowly construed,rugiero,at citing dep t of interior klamath water users protective ass n,and do not apply in this case.the act reflects a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.dep t of the air force rose.
an agency responding to a request under the act must make a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records using methods reasonably expected to produce the requested information.rugiero,at citing campbell dep t of justice.at all times the burden is on the agency to establish the adequacy of the search.id.the factual question is whether the search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents,not whether it actually uncovered every document extant.grand cent.cuomo,cir quoting safecard,sec.
to meet this burden,the agency may rely on affidavits or declarations providing reasonable detail of the scope of the search.in the absence of countervailing evidence or apparent inconsistency of proof,such affidavits will suffice to demonstrate compliance with the obligations imposed by the act.id.internal quotations and citations omitted see also weisberg dep t of justice,agency affidavits that do not denote which files were searched,or by whom,do not reflect any systematic approach to document location,and do not provide information specific enough to enable the requester to challenge the procedures utilized are insufficient to support summary judgment.this inquiry focuses not on whether additional documents exist that might satisfy the request,but on the reasonableness of the agency search.id.district courts typically dispose of freedom of information act cases on summary judgment based on affidavits from the agency describing the search procedures that it followed before allowing the plaintiff to conduct discovery.id.at.
caretolive challenges the entirety of the fda response but places the most emphasis on the center for drug evaluation search,which was processed through its complex track,took over two years to perform,and only located one additional responsive document.however,the detailed affidavits that the fda submitted to the district court establish the adequacy of its search.these affidavits describe the procedures the fda used to process caretolive request and to ensure that it appropriately responded to the request.they describe how the fda determined which offices and departments to search for responsive documents and identify the specific offices,departments,and places searched.in rugiero,we remarked that affidavits describing similar searches appear ed to be the model of responsiveness under the freedom of information act.rugiero,at.as in rugiero,here,the uncontraverted assertions in the fda affidavits establish that the fda satisfied the requirements in the act to conduct a reasonable search for responsive documents.
considering the evidence in a light most favorable to caretolive,as we must,there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the fda search.although the burden is on the fda to establish that it conducted the search in good faith using methods to reasonably identify and produce the requested documents,here,caretolive has not come forth with any evidence to rebut the fda showing,baker hostetler llp dep t of commerce,holding that requestor assertion that an adequate search would have yielded more documents is mere speculation insufficient to rebut affidavits describing search process agency performed.although agencies must respond to requests under the act,they are not required to open their doors and invite the public in to peruse their records.for that reason,our review focuses on the adequacy of the agency search,and not on the chance that additional documents exist.although we are mindful that caretolive is necessarily at a disadvantage because it does not have access to the documents it claims were not produced,that does not absolve caretolive of its responsibility to demonstrate that there is a material question of fact as to the adequacy of the fda search.caretolive does not identify any additional offices or departments where the fda should have searched for documents.all that caretolive offers are conclusory allegations that there must be additional documents because of pazdur role and that the search was not actually conducted as described.however,conclusory allegations that the fda did not conduct a detailed search are insufficient to create a material question of fact precluding summary judgment.the act does not require that agencies account for all of their documents,so long as they reasonably attempt to locate them.to defeat a motion for summary judgment the requestor must identify specific deficiencies in the agency response,which caretolive has failed to do.
the closest caretolive comes to creating a material question of fact is with the search conducted at the fda center for drug evaluation.caretolive asserts that the search was inadequate because it took nearly two years to complete yet only turned up one document.additionally,caretolive points out that the fda only billed it forty cents for reproduction charges,and nothing for the cost of this search.while the low billing is unexpected and unusual,it does not create a material question of fact regarding the adequacy of the fda search in light of the detailed affidavits it submitted.
as the sanger declaration,which describes the procedures the center for drug evaluation followed to conduct the search,explains,caretolive inquiry was placed on the complex track because it involved searching and redaction.although caretolive argues that this was a narrowly tailored,simple inquiry,it has not offered anything to establish that the requested documents had previously been provided to another requestor or that gathering these documents would not require searching or redaction.therefore,it appears that the center for drug evaluation properly placed the request in its complex track even if,in common parlance,caretolive made a simple request.
the sanger declaration sufficiently describes the steps that the center for drug evaluation undertook to respond to caretolive request and explains that the search only took a little over one month to complete.the two year delay was due to a backlog from other requests that the center for drug evaluation had received before caretolive.if a search really took an agency two full years to complete and only turned up one responsive document,perhaps that would suggest that the search was not done in good faith in a manner intended to locate responsive documents and summary judgment would not be appropriate.however,this search did not take two years.it took less than one month after the center for drug evaluation began processing it.additionally,although caretolive argues that the search only turned up one document,the record suggests that the search uncovered numerous documents.several people had been copied on the correspondence caretolive requested,and only one of these documents had not already been given to caretolive from one of the fda other departments.therefore,we can not infer from the delay or failure to find additional responsive documents that the search was not reasonably designed to uncover responsive documents.
the center for drug evaluation bill for only forty cents in reproduction charges is unexpected but does not suggest that the search procedures described in the sanger declaration were not followed.in contrast to this invoice,the center for biologics billed caretolive for hours of search time.the office of the executive secretary billed caretolive.although the center for drug evaluation failure to charge for the search,standing alone,might be some evidence that it did not conduct a detailed search,this single irregularity does not overcome the detailed averments set forth in the sanger declaration.that declaration explains that the center for drug evaluation fulfilled its duties under the act and conducted a reasonable search for responsive documents.
recovering deleted files.
caretolive also argues that in order to comply with the act the fda must use an information technology expert and attempt to recover electronic documents that have been deleted.although pazdur explained in his affidavit that he shredded the physical copies of responsive memos within one month of receiving them and also deleted any electronic copies,caretolive asserts that an information technology specialist would be able to retrieve electronic copies from pazdur computer.caretolive also argues that,as a federal agency,the fda maintains a network with backup copies of pazdur even if he deleted them from his local machine.although both of these assertions may be true,there is no factual evidence in the record supporting them and,therefore,caretolive did not meet its burden of coming forth with evidence to rebut the fda showing.additionally,performing an invasive search for deleted electronic documents is unnecessary in this case because the fda maintains that other individuals were copied on these letters and it has,from these other sources,already delivered copies of these documents to caretolive in response to its inquiry.any documents it might be able to recover from pazdur computer or its servers would merely be cumulative of items already in caretolive possession.in light of caretolive request and the fda response,the fda need not attempt to recover these deleted files to meet its burden of conducting a reasonable search.
although some of our sister circuits have required that agencies attempt to recover electronic files to respond to certain requests,caretolive request and the facts of this case do not require su
