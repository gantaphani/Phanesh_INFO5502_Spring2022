metro machine corporation and signal mutual indemnity association,limited,petition for review of an order of the benefits review board affirming decisions of an alj granting a claim for medical benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the act,see.finding no reversible error,we deny the petition.
before setting out the facts underlying this appeal,we will begin with a brief discussion of some of the relevant legal concepts.
the act creates a comprehensive federal scheme to compensate workers injured or killed while employed upon the navigable waters of the united states.estate of cowart nicklos drilling.the act requires employers to furnish medical care to employees who suffer an injury within the meaning of the act.as is relevant here,injury is defined as an 
accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment,and such occupational disease or infection as arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury.
arising out of and in the course of employment are separate elements the former refers to injury causation the latter refers to the time,place,and circumstances of the injury.indus.fed.sheet metal,director,owcp,industries.through what has come to be known as the aggravation rule,the courts have extended definition such that,if an employment injury aggravates,accelerates,or combines with a previous infirmity,the entire disability is compensable.newport news shipbuilding dry dock fishel,cir.
because congress recognized that the elements of would be difficult to prove,director,owcp greenwich collieries,congress provided the a presumption,the proper interpretation of which is a central issue in this appeal.the statute describing the presumption provides,in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this act it shall be presumed,in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary t hat the claim comes within the provisions of this act.a.
the parties agree that to invoke the presumption,an employee must allege a prima facie case that an injury or death arose out of and in the course of his maritime employment.universal maritime moore,cir.to establish this prima facie case,a claimant must show that he suffered physical harm and that a workplace accident or workplace conditions could have caused,aggravated,or accelerated the harm.bath iron works fields,cir.emphasis added.once the prima facie case is established,the burden of production shifts to the employer,who must produce evidence that could justify a reasonable factfinder in concluding that the claimant either did not suffer physical harm or that no workplace accident or workplace conditions caused,aggravated,or accelerated the harm.see accord moore,at.if the employer satisfies this burden,the presumption falls out of the case,and the factfinder is left to find the necessary facts without considering the presumption.see moore,at.
we now turn to the facts before us.john stephenson claimant worked for metro machine corporation as a pipefitter in virginia from august until august.he has a long history of breathing problems.he suffered from asthma until he was approximately eight years old,and he began smoking when he was.he has received treatment for bronchitis caused by his smoking since the early.and he received treatment for a productive cough and wheezing in and.additionally,he regularly suffered from bronchitis during winters,and his bronchitis was treated with antibiotics.he has been taking steroids for his wheezing and coughing since.he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd in and emphysema in.
on february,claimant was working in the superstructure of a vessel.during his workday,which lasted more than eight hours,he inhaled fumes from welding and burning and the application of epoxy paint the exposure inhaling these fumes caused him breathing problems.after claimant finished his shift and went home,the problems continued all night,prompting him to go to the emergency room the next morning.at the hospital,he was diagnosed with e xacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.he was admitted and remained hospitalized for eight days,during which time he was prescribed steroids,inhalers,empiric antibiotics,and albuterol to treat his copd.upon discharge,he was prescribed a nebulizer and oxygen concentrator,which he had not used prior to the hospitalization.
metro paid claimant compensation for temporary total disability from february,through august,and later for temporary partial disability from september,through september.when he returned to work,he was restricted from going aboard the ship and limited in the amount of weight he could lift.
claimant voluntarily retired in.since his retirement,he has begun using his oxygen concentrator more frequently.he has continued taking the same medications he took when he was hospitalized,but he has increased his dosages.he reports that his coughing has improved over time although his shortness of breath has worsened.
in october,claimant was treated for a fracture at the vertebra by alireza jamali.jamali stated in an office note that the fracture was most likely due to excessive coughing.in february,jamali wrote that claimant required a intake of the steroid for management of his respiratory condition,which contributed to osteoporosis and pathological fracture of.jamali opined that the fracture was directly due to steroid intake from the management of claimant respiratory condition.
asserting that his injuries were the result of the exposure,claimant requested that metro pay for his medical treatment.metro refused and filed a notice of controversion on march,asserting that the treatment he had requested was not related to the exposure.on march,claimant filed a claim for compensation,form,under the act.in the spaces on the form calling for the date of the injury and a description of the accident,he answered and exposure to fumes,and in the space calling for identification of the part of body affected,he answered,lungs.
on may,a claims examiner held an informal conference.memoranda memorializing the conference indicate that claimant had sought medical benefits for both his ongoing copd and his fractured vertebra.the claims examiner recommended payment of benefits for both conditions.
the alj held a hearing regarding the claim on september.the parties stipulated that claimant injured his pulmonary organs on february,that the injury arose out of and in the course of claimant employment with metro and that the act applies to the claim.
the medical evidence introduced at the hearing included the may deposition of claimant treating physician,ignacio ripoll,who was in pulmonary medicine and had been a practicing pulmonary specialist for approximately years.the evidence also included three letters ripoll had written before the deposition concerning the possible causal relationship between the exposure and claimant worsening copd.the letters evidenced ripoll changing views regarding the existence of such a causal relationship.
the alj summarized the contents of the three letters 
in a letter dated january,ripoll wrote that claimant suffers from severe copd with a grade iv impairment using the ama guides.ripoll listed the dates and results of several pulmonary function tests beginning in june of,noting that at that time claimant copd was severe and deteriorating at a rate of three percent per year.ripoll noted that claimant had more symptoms after the exposure than prior to it and therefore found with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the exposure worsened his pulmonary condition,which has declined since that time.
after receiving pulmonary function testing results dating back to january of,ripoll wrote a letter dated july.ripoll opined that the historical data cast doubt on the role of fume exposures respecting claimant declining respiratory function.ripoll stated that the data indicated that the exposure caused an acute pulmonary event,but did not affect the rate of progression of the underlying disease.ripoll included the caveat that the november and january results could be artificially low due to some acute condition at those times and additional testing after the january values could indicate whether claimant lung function improved to a stable baseline.
a november,letter included a graph of claimant forced expiratory volume results from until.ripoll noted that the slope of claimant decline changed after claimant exposure to fumes in.ripoll found that the rate of deterioration increased following the inhalation injury and thus concluded that it was highly likely that the february inhalation injury caused the rapid deterioration in lung function seen after that time.
citations omitted.
finally,in his deposition,ripoll described claimant lung disease as chronic obstructive lung disease or chronic bronchitis,chronic inflammation.he testified that claimant lungs had been irreparably damaged by his many years of smoking,and that his lung function would continue to deteriorate despite any medications he might take.nevertheless,he testified that he continued to believe,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,that the data showed a significant acceleration in the progression of the lung disease after the exposure.
following the hearing,the alj found that claimant established a prima facie case by showing a harm the worsening of his copd and a work incident that could have caused or aggravated that harm.therefore,he found claimant entitled to the a presumption that the worsening of his copd was compensable.
the alj observed that metro sought to show that any aggravation of claimant copd caused by the exposure was only temporary.in support of this position,metro submitted the opinion of ripoll,along with treatment records.given the contradictory and uncertain opinions that ripoll had issued,however,the alj concluded that ripoll opinions were entitled to little weight and insufficient to rebut the presumption.noting that no other evidence tended to show that any exacerbation of claimant copd caused by the exposure was only temporary,the alj concluded that metro had not rebutted the a presumption.he thus awarded claimant past and future medical benefits for his copd.
despite prevailing regarding the copd,claimant moved for reconsideration,contending that the alj had failed to address a part of his claim that the parties had addressed at the hearing,namely,his claim that he was entitled to medical treatment for his vertebra fracture.the alj granted the motion and proceeded to consider the compensability of the fracture.the alj rejected an argument by metro that the a presumption did not apply since the fracture was not specifically identified on claimant form that he had filed in march.the alj further found that claimant established a prima facie case linking his fracture to excessive coughing from,and the steroids he was prescribed for,his copd.regarding metro attempt to rebut the prima facie case,the alj concluded that the fact that claimant,prior to the exposure,had had respiratory problems and took steroids did not constitute evidence that the primary injury did not cause,aggravate,or hasten his fracture.finding that metro had not rebutted the presumption that the fracture was compensable,the alj awarded claimant medical benefits for the fracture.
metro appealed the decisions concerning the compensability of the copd and fracture to the board,which affirmed.the board held that substantial evidence supported the alj finding that claimant established a prima facie case regarding his copd and thus that the alj properly invoked the a presumption.the board rejected an argument by metro that claimant needed to present medical evidence directly linking his copd to the exposure to establish his prima facie case.the board also concluded that the alj properly found that metro failed to rebut the presumption on the basis that ripoll opinion was equivocal.
regarding the vertebra fracture,the board rejected an argument by metro that the a presumption does not apply to secondary injuries,such as the fracture.the board also rejected the argument that the presumption should not have applied because the fracture was outside the scope of claimant claim.the board noted that claimant had raised the claim for medical benefits regarding his fracture before both the district director and the alj,and metro had not contended that it was surprised by the issue or that any late notice prejudiced its ability to defend against the claim.
metro now petitions for review of the board decision.
metro advances various arguments in support of its petition for review.we review the board decisions for errors of law and to determine whether the board adhered to its standard of review.see newport news shipbuilding dry dock harris,cir.the board standard of review requires that the alj findings of fact be considered conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.newport news shipbuilding dry dock director,owcp,cir.per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.and importantly,the act must be liberally construed in conformance with its remedial purpose.northeast marine term.caputo,internal quotation marks omitted.
in this appeal,the director of the office of workers compensation programs of the department of labor the director,is a respondent.we afford deference to the director views concerning the construction of the act because he has authority with regard to the act.see director,owcp newport news shipbuilding dry dock,cir.when,as here,the director is advancing his position in litigation,his position is entitled to respect to the extent that it has the power to persuade.west virginia cwp fund stacy,cir.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.we accord no deference to the board legal interpretation of the act since the board does not serve in a role.see newport news shipbuilding dry dock stilley,cir.
regarding claimant copd,metro contends that the alj erred in relying on ripoll opinions to find that claimant had established a prima facie case.metro argues that if ripoll opinions were too contradictory to rebut claimant prima facie case,they must also have been too contradictory to establish claimant prima facie case in the first place.
this issue is easily disposed of because the alj did not rely on ripoll opinions as a basis for finding that claimant established his prima facie case.the alj found that claimant has demonstrated and metro has agreed that a work related injury occurred february,when claimant was exposed to welding and epoxy fumes,leading to an aggravation of his preexisting copd.indeed,substantial evidence supported the alj finding that claimant established a prima facie case claimant offered evidence that the day after the exposure,he was diagnosed with e xacerbation of copd and hospitalized for eight days as a result.the evidence showed that his copd continued to worsen after that point as well,and his lung function never returned to its level.this evidence was easily sufficient to satisfy claimant fairly light burden,bis salamis,director,owcp,cir,to produce evidence raising the possibility that the exposure had permanently aggravated his copd.moore,at holding that alj properly invoked presumption regarding claim for back problems when claimant testified that he experienced back pain immediately after the accident even though other evidence cast significant doubt on the credibility of that testimony and claimant had acknowledged that he had suffered back pain as a result of another prior injury champion traylor,cir.holding that because claim wa s supported by far more than enough evidence to remove it from the category of mere fancy,the presumption was invoked.and,regardless of ripoll changing opinions regarding whether he could say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the exposure did permanently worsen claimant condition,he never opined that it was not possible that the exposure had that effect.
metro also suggests that the alj improperly required metro,in order to rebut the presumption,to actually prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the exposure did not aggravate his lung condition.again,metro misstates what the alj did.the alj applied the proper standard,requiring metro to proffer evidence that could allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that claimant lung condition was not permanently aggravated by the exposure.see moore,at.and the alj rightly concluded that ripoll july opinion that there was no permanent aggravation from the exposure could not support such a reasonable inference since ripoll had abandoned that opinion.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the alj order awarding claimant medical benefits for his copd,and the board was therefore correct to affirm.
metro also argues that the board erred in affirming the alj decision granting claimant medical benefits for his vertebra fracture.
some of metro arguments regarding the fracture relate to the differences,if any,between how the act treats primary injuries meaning compensable injuries that arise out of,and occur in the course of,employment and secondary injuries meaning other injuries that develop later as the result of primary injuries.we will begin by addressing those arguments.
metro does not deny that a secondary injury can qualify as an injury within the meaning of,but metro maintains that because the fracture was a secondary injury,it was compensable only if it naturally or unavoidably result ed from a primary injury.metro also argues that because the fracture was a secondary injury and was not identified in claimant march claim form,the a presumption should not have applied concerning the fracture compensability regardless of whether claimant established a prima facie case.
in questions of statutory interpretation,we begin with the language of the statute.see dean united states.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we are duty bound to give effect to that language.united states ivester,cir.
as we have discussed,the act defines injury,in relevant part,as an 
accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment,and such occupational disease or infection as arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury.
there is no question that the composition of is awkward.cyr crescent wharf warehouse,cir.at the same time,it is apparent and metro does not dispute that congress included in the definition of injury both accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment primary injuries and injuries that naturally or unavoidably result from such accidental injury secondary injuries.see,jones director,owcp,cir.cyr,at.
it is at this point in the analysis that the views of the various participants in this appeal diverge.metro contends that because the vertebra fracture was not a primary injury,the alj erred in applying the a presumption in determining its compensability.relying on two decisions of the fifth circuit,metro maintains that the presumption applies only to questions of whether alleged primary injuries are compensable and does not apply to questions of whether alleged secondary injuries are compensable.see insurance of state of director,owcp,cir.amerada hess director,owcp,cir.claimant and the director argue that these two decisions that metro relies on were wrongly decided to the extent they conclude that the presumption does not apply to claims concerning secondary injuries.and the director notes that one judge on each panel expressed disagreement with the majority analysis.see amerada hess,at reavley,concurring concluding that the presumption should have applied to the secondary injury if the claimant had established a prima facie case,but concurring in the majority result because the claimant failed to establish his prima facie case see also insurance of the state of,at graves,concurring noting that although the panel was bound to follow circuit precedent,he agreed with judge reavley that the amerada hess majority erred in finding that the presumption created by a of the act is inapplicable to a secondary injury or an injury not expressly listed on the original claim form.
we agree with the claimant and the director that the presumption applies to claims regardless of whether they concern secondary injuries.by its terms,the a presumption is that the claim comes within the provisions of th e act.a emphasis added.as we have explained,the act allows claims regarding primary injuries,secondary injuries,or both.section a does not distinguish between claims concerning primary injuries and those concerning secondary injuries,and in fact a makes no reference to injuries at all.accordingly,we agree with the director that the presumption unambiguously applies to all types of claims 
metro contends that industries supports its argument that the presumption does not apply to secondary injuries,but we respectfully disagree with metro understanding of that decision.in industries,the claim at issue asserted that the employee suffered an injury at work on november,when he was lifting duct work and felt a sharp pain in his neck.see at.the alj denied the claim,finding that the alleged accident actually had not occurred and that the employee and his had testified falsely regarding its occurrence.see id.at.a divided panel of the board affirmed.the court of appeals vacated,however,on the basis that the employee could be found to have suffered an injury when he awoke in pain the day after the alleged accident the court of appeals reasoned that an injury need not occur during work hours and need not be traceable to a specific work incident.see id.at.the court of appeals thus held that if the claimant did suffer such an injury,the a presumption would apply to it.see id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed,holding that the court of appeals had committed two errors.the first error concerned the scope of the employee claim.the court reasoned that the only claim the employee had made was that he was injured at work on november in an accident the alj found had not actually occurred.see id.at.because the employee had not claimed that any injury occurred on november,there could be no presumption that applied to any november injury.see id.at.the court noted that despite the existence of very liberal rules allowing the amendments of pleadings and variances between pleading and proof,such variances can not be so great that they prejudice an employer ability to defend against a claim.see id.at.in the case before the court,the assertion of a november injury was not supported by the claim form the claimant had filed or by the evidentiary record.id.
the court also reasoned that the court of appeals erred in determining that the attack of pain claimant suffered on the morning of november could qualify as an injury within the meaning of the act.see id.at.that is so because for an injury to have occurred in the course of employment,it must have arisen during the employment,and thus a prima facie claim for compensation must allege an injury that arose while the claimant was working.id.however,the only such injury that the claimant had asserted in his claim was the november injury that the alj had found did not actually occur.see id.at.
metro argues that the attack of pain on the morning of november in industries was in essence a secondary injury and that that status as a secondary injury was the reason that the supreme court did not apply the a presumption.we conclude this is a misreading of industries.as the director explains,industries does not suggest that the a presumption does not apply to claims of secondary injuries.rather,the case merely stands for two propositions the presumption applies only to claims of injuries that are actually made,a claim must include a primary injury,which,by definition,must arise during work.
in the present case,because the alj properly found that claimant suffered a compensable primary injury the exacerbation of his copd industries poses no obstacle for him so long as his claim included the fracture.metro does not appear to challenge the conclusions of the alj and the board that claimant claim evolved to include the fracture even though the claim form he originally filed in had only explicitly mentioned his lung injury.and,industries specifically recognized that those making claims under the act need not
