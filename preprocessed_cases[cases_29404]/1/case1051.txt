opinion of the court 
ramon prestol espinal referred to by the parties as prestol petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia that it lacked jurisdiction over prestol motion to reconsider the bia denial of relief because prestol had been removed from the united states.prestol petition requires us to decide whether the attorney general regulation barring aliens who have been removed from the united states from filing a motion to reconsider reopen,d,otherwise known as the bar,is inconsistent with the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,c a,a,which specifically grants an alien the right to file one motion to reconsider and one motion to reopen without any geographic limitation on that right.
prestol was born in the dominican republic but lived in the united states from until.in january,the department of homeland security dhs charged prestol with being removable under section a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.in february,dhs also charged him pursuant to sections a a i and a b of the ina with being removable as an alien convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance and an alien convicted of two or more offenses involving crimes of moral turpitude.these charges of removability were based on prestol convictions for possession of a controlled substance and violating a protective order.
in april,prestol admitted the factual allegations underlying his notice to appear and was found removable as charged.however,prestol applied for asylum,withholding of removal and convention against torture cat protection alleging that because of his previous assistance to the drug enforcement agency he would be targeted for violence by drug dealers if he returned to the dominican republic.on june,the immigration judge ij denied prestol applications for relief.on november,the bia affirmed the ij and days later,november,prestol was removed from the united states to the dominican republic.on december,prestol filed a timely motion to reconsider with the bia.on january,the bia denied the motion to reconsider based on what it deemed a lack of jurisdiction resulting from prestol removal from the united states.prestol petitions for review of this decision.
we review the bia legal conclusions de novo.patel att y,cir.where an agency regulation allegedly conflicts with the governing statute,we employ the analysis prescribed by chevron,natural res.def.council.the focus of chevron is aimed at determining and giving effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent.id.at.under chevron step one,we must first determine if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue of law in the case,using traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.lin zheng att y,cir en banc internal quotation and citation omitted.if congress intent is clear,our inquiry is at an end as the agency is required to give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if the statute is ambiguous,we move to step two and determine if the agency interpretation of the statute,as expressed in the regulation,is reasonable and entitled to deference.id.
before delving into the chevron analysis,we briefly outline the relevant statutory and regulatory framework.the regulatory right to file a motion to reopen or reconsider with the bia has existed since,codified at.in,the department of justice doj issued a regulation barring the bia from reviewing such a motion filed by a person no longer present in the united states,codified at.
that same year,congress passed the mccarran walter act,which established the structure of current immigration laws,c,stat,codified at c.in,congress amended the law to provide courts of appeals with jurisdiction to review final orders of deportation through a petition for review,a,stat,codified at c.however,the amendment contained a provision paralleling the regulatory bar on motions to.specifically,the amendment provided an order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has departed from the united states after issuance of the order.id.the doj issued implementing regulations whereby it repromulgated the bar to motions to,codified at.in april,the doj issued a regulation limiting aliens to one motion to reopen and one motion to reconsider and providing and days respectively for the alien to file each motion,codified at.
shortly thereafter,congress passed iirira,which made several significant changes to immigration law.pub,div.c,stat.for the first time,congress created a statutory right for the alien to file a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen with the bia previously such a right existed only pursuant to regulation.iirira a currently codified at c.congress also codified in the statute some of the regulatory limitations for such motions,including the substantive requirements for motions to reopen,the numeric limitation and time limits.id.notably,when congress enacted iirira in,it did not codify or adopt the bar regulation.see dada mukasey,outlining the regulations iirira codified.
iirira also repealed the bar to judicial review of petitions for review that congress originally imposed in.iirira b,stat.repealing.additionally,congress adopted a day period for the government to deport a person who has been ordered removed.iirira a currently codified at a.
in,the doj promulgated regulations implementing iirira.notwithstanding the fact that congress had for the first time codified the right for an alien to file motions to reconsider and reopen with the bia and eliminated the bar for judicial review,the doj repromulgated the bar for motions to filed with the bia,the regulation at issue in this case,currently codified at d.the bar regulation currently provides a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.d.
with that background before us,we move to the chevron statutory analysis.t he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania.the supreme court has instructed that we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.united states.heirs of boisdore.
the motion to reconsider provision of iirira provides that t he alien may file one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the united states.c a.similarly,c a provides that a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.it follows from the plain language of this statute that from the date of the final order of removal,the alien has days to exercise his or her right to seek reconsideration and days to seek reopening.id.c b,c i.the ina defines alien broadly as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.ina a,a.to repeat,the plain text of the statute provides each alien with the right to file one motion to reopen and one motion to reconsider,provides time periods during which an alien is entitled to do so,and makes no exception for aliens who are no longer in this country.
based on this plain language,the fourth,sixth,and ninth circuits have squarely held under chevron that the bar conflicts with the statutory right to file a motion to reopen reconsider the fourth circuit held that the regulatory bar is invalid because the statute unambiguously provides an alien with the right to file one motion to reopen,regardless of whether he is within or without the country.this is so because,in providing that an alien may file,the statute does not distinguish between those aliens abroad and those within the country both fall within the class denominated by the words an alien.william gonzales,cir.
similarly,the sixth circuit held that no statute gives the bia purchase for disclaiming jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen filed by aliens who have left the country.the most relevant statute,iirira,offers nothing to support such an interpretation of the regulation.an alien,it says,may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section this is an empowering,not a divesting,provision,as it grants the board authority to entertain a motion to reopen.pruidze holder,cir.
consistent with its two sister courts,the ninth circuit has held that the clear intent of congress was to provide aliens with the right to file a motion to reopen reconsider and that the physical removal of an alien by the united states does not preclude the alien from pursuing that motion.reyes torres holder.lexis,at cir,quoting coyt holder,cir.and over the contrary view of his colleagues,a dissenting judge from the tenth circuit reasoned that iirira unambiguously guarantee s every alien the right to file one motion to reconsider removability and one motion to reopen removal proceedings,regardless of whether the alien has departed from the united states.rosillo puga holder,cir lucero,dissenting.we agree with these cases and adopt their analyses.
moreover,two other circuits,including the seventh circuit and,in part,the sixth circuit,have invalidated the bar based on the supreme court decision in union pac.of locomotive eng rs.see pruidze,at invalidating the regulation based on both chevron and union pacific marin rodriguez holder,cir invalidating the regulation solely on union pacific.in union pacific,the supreme court held that an administrative agency can not rely on an procedural rule to disclaim jurisdiction congress alone controls the agency jurisdiction.therefore,the sixth and seventh circuits reasoned that the bia lacked authority to disclaim jurisdiction over the motions 
the second circuit analysis in luna holder,cir,provides additional reinforcement for the view that the bar can not be sustained.in that case,the court addressed whether the day filing deadline for petitions for review of bia decisions violated the suspension clause and the alien right to habeas corpus.in holding that the suspension clause was not violated,the court held that the statutory motion to reopen process provides an adequate and effective substitute for habeas so long as the process can not be unilaterally terminated by the government pursuant to the bia bar.id.at.although the second circuit decline d to decide the validity of the departure bar regulation in every possible context,the court commented that the bar has no roots in any statutory source and that the bia must consider an alien motion to reopen even if the alien is no longer in the united states.id.at internal quotation omitted.
our holding that the plain text of the statute leaves no room for the bar also finds some support in the supreme court decision in dada.there,the court was asked to reconcile two provisions of iirira c which provides that an alien has the right to file one motion to reopen within days of the order of deportation and b which requires an alien who has been granted the right to voluntarily depart to do so within days if the alien does not leave within the voluntary departure period,the alien forfeits his or her right to the full benefits of voluntary departure in particular,removal of the year restriction on readmission.see d.on the other hand,if the alien departs pursuant to the bar regulation,such departure would have the effect of withdrawing the motion to reopen.see d.significantly,the court noted that a more expeditious solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen might be to permit an alien who has departed the united states to pursue a motion to reopen postdeparture.dada,at.however,because the regulation was not challenged in that case as it is here the court declined to consider the regulation.id.
accordingly,the supreme court was required to decide whether congress intended the statutory right to reopen to be qualified by the voluntary departure process.id.at.the government argued that by requesting voluntary departure,the alien was knowingly surrendering the opportunity to seek reopening.the court rejected this argument and instead held that the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw the request for voluntary departure before expiration of the departure period and file the motion to reopen.id.at.
although the holding of dada does not directly implicate the issue presented here,the court repeated emphasis on the statutory right to file a motion to reopen,and the effort of the court to avoid abrogating that right even in the face of another statutory provision which conflicted,inform our analysis.specifically,the supreme court noted that iirira transforms the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien.id.at.it also noted that the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.id.at quoting c a.the court echoed its prior admonition counseling long hesitation before adopting a construction of the statute which would,with respect to an entire class of aliens,completely nullify a procedure so intrinsic a part of the legislative scheme.id.at quoting costello ins,
the court concluded that it must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute removed the motion to reopen safeguard for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law that is,those subject to voluntary departure particularly when the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.id.at.the court did not see the limitation at issue in the plain text of the statute and refused to read one in,notwithstanding the competing statutory and regulatory provisions.see also kucana holder,the motion to reopen is an important safeguard intended to ensure a proper and lawful disposition of immigration proceedings.quoting dada,at.
in sum,the dada opinion emphasizes the importance of the statutory right to file a motion to reopen based on the plain text of the statute.
the government contends that nothing in the text of the statute explicitly precludes the agency from imposing the bar.in other words,it argues that the statute is silent on this issue.the government supports this argument by reliance on the tenth circuit decision in rosillo puga,the only court of appeals decision explicitly upholding the validity of the bar.that court held that the statute is simply silent on the issue of whether it meant to repeal the bars contained in the attorney general regulations.we certainly can not derive a clear meaning from the language about an alien or the alien having the opportunity to file one motion for reopening or reconsideration.id.at 
however,as explained by the fourth circuit majority opinion in william,the government view that congress was silent as to the ability of aliens outside the united states to file motions to reopen is foreclosed by the text of the statute.the statutory language does speak to the filing of motions to reopen by aliens outside the country it does so because they are a subset of the group alien s which it vests with the right to file these motions.at.the same point is made by the dissenting tenth circuit judge in rosillo puga the language congress chose is plain and unequivocal.it draws no distinction between aliens who are in the country and aliens who have departed.all aliens are treated alike under the terms of the statute,and all aliens are guaranteed the right to file one motion to reconsider and one motion to reopen.at.lucero,dissenting 
the government manufactures an ambiguity from congress failure to specifically foreclose each exception that could possibly be conjured or imagined.that approach would create an ambiguity in almost all statutes,necessitating deference to nearly all agency determinations.nothing i
