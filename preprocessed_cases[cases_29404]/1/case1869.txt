petitioners international union,united automobile,aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw,the union,and individual leo andre ahern seek review of the national labor relations board the board decision finding that ogihara america corporation the company did not violate section a,and of the national labor relations act the act,by discharging petitioner ahern.specifically,petitioners challenge the board determinations that employee ahern lost the protection of the act through his deliberate falsification the company met its burden of showing that it would have discharged ahern because of his falsification regardless of his union activity and petitioners did not meet their burden of establishing that ahern discharge was related to his board testimony.for the following reasons,we deny the petition for review and enforce the board order.
in october,the union began an organizing campaign at the company and successfully petitioned for a representation election.in the january election,the company employees narrowly voted against union representation.however,following the union charges and a may hearing,an administrative law judge alj determined that before the election,the company had illegally disciplined an employee for protected activities including distribution of union literature.the alj july order,which was later upheld by the board,set aside the original election and called for a second election.
ahern worked for the company as a press maintenance technician on the second afternoon and evening shift and was active in the union campaign.he was also one of several employees who testified on behalf of the union at the may hearing.from about may until july,ahern and fellow technicians thomas griswold and christopher simmons became especially dissatisfied with supervisor,david gaffka.the three technicians were bothered that gaffka,an outspoken union opponent,was complaining to fellow supervisors about the poor work of employees despite his own poor work.after simmons witnessed gaffka harass another employee and then write him up for poor workmanship,the three technicians resolved to facilitate gaffka demotion by writing an anonymous letter to the company president tokio ogihara.ahern drafted the letter and made revisions based on griswold and simmons suggestions.the letter,dated june,and addressed to ogihara,stated 
we are writing to you as a group of associates both concerned,and disturbed by the conduct and behavior of one of your press maintenance gaffka.on several occasions,dave has approached troy burley and other managers making accusations of alleged mistakes made by associates in their work.dave was threatening that he would have people written up.dave has been mistaken in many of these accusing people of things that happened on days they were not even at work.this shows no regard for core values.
we feel that dave lacks the professionalism,technical skills,and the people skills necessary to be a facilitator at oac.as a facilitator,he is a representative of oac and creates a bad image of this company.in this time of corporate cost cutting,we respectfully request that you personally investigate dave usefulness and impact to oac.turning this matter over to your management team will not solve the problem,as some of your managers promote this behavior.it is your choice to act on this matter or not to,however many associates would welcome the thought of you taking a more active part in managing the managers at oac.if you choose not to respond please keep this confidential.
enclosed are photos of dave own poor workmanship.
thank you for your attention to this problem.
ahern,griswold and simmons enclosed photographs and captions depicting poorly maintained areas in gaffka workspace.according to griswold and simmons testimony,the three technicians agreed to transmit the letter and photographs the package anonymously because they feared reprisal if they included their names.
on june,ahern visited the fedex service desk at a kinko store to mail the package.a kinko employee instructed ahern to fill out the sender name and return address.given the letter anonymous character and ahern belief that the company might not open a package from ahern due to his union activity,ahern instead listed bruce pierson as the sender of the package.pierson was a employee opposed to union affiliation,and ahern believed that ogihara would be more likely to open a package addressed from pierson than from himself.rather than listing pierson address and phone number,ahern listed the address for the county he found in the phonebook at kinko and a fictitious phone number.ahern testified that he used the fictitious address and phone number so that if ogihara checked,he would realize that they were not pierson actual address and number.
upon receiving the package on june,ogihara directed human resources manager director patrick casady to investigate the letter allegations.while casady delegated investigation of the package substantive allegations to another manager,casady met with pierson,who denied sending the package casady also testified that either before or close to the same time that he met with pierson,he had independently determined that the return address on the package did not match pierson.around june,casady contacted kinko and learned that it had videotape surveillance for the day the package was sent,which it could only release in response to a subpoena.on june,the company commenced a lawsuit on behalf of gaffka and pierson,charging john doe with defamation and tortious interference with their employment by sending the package.on august,after the company obtained a subpoena,casady viewed the tape,determined that ahern had sent the package,and decided to discharge ahern.although casady testified that he recognized that it was not improper for an employee to send an anonymous letter criticizing a supervisor,the board determined that casady reasons for the discharge were ahern false designation of pierson as the sender of the package and false allegations against gaffka on august,casady met with ahern.when ahern denied sending the package,casady informed him that he had been seen on the kinko tape and that his deceptive acts warranted termination under the company rule of conduct casady august letter to ahern confirmed his termination and included a rules of conduct violation form,which noted violations of rules,and and that the rule violation was the most severe.
after the union and ahern filed separate charges with the board,the board general counsel issued a complaint alleging,inter alia,that the company had violated section a,and of the act,a,and.the consolidated cases were heard before an alj,who decided that,inter alia,the company discharge of ahern had violated section a,and of the act the board reversed the alj decision with respect to these three allegations,each of which the board dismissed.the board decision is before the court.

petitioners first argue that the board erred in determining that ahern lost protection of the act by falsifying the sender name on the package.section a of the act establishes that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with an employee section rights,which include the right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.here,the board assumed arguendo that ahern complaints regarding gaffka were protected but determined that ahern lost the protection of the act as a result of his intentional falsification.
the board has held that where an employee is discharged for conduct that is part of the res gestae of protected activities,the relevant question is whether the conduct is so egregious as to take it outside the protection of the act,or of such character as to render the employee unfit for service.guardian indus,quoting consumers power.although some leeway is permitted for impulsive behavior,this must be balanced against an employer right to maintain order and respect.initially,the responsibility to draw the line between these conflicting rights rests with the board,and its determination,unless illogical or arbitrary,ought not be disturbed.ohio power nlrb,cir citing nlrb hartmann luggage,cir.
the board provided two reasons for determining that ahern actions had lost the protection of the act.first,relying on guardian industries,at,the board explained that a deliberate falsity could cause an employee to lose the protection of the act.second,relying on reg,the board noted that activity designed to destroy the reputation and end the employment of another employee could also cause an employee to lose the act protection.the board found that ahern use of pierson name on the package was a deliberate falsity and that this falsity had the potential of harming pierson reputation and jeopardizing his employment.the board explained that when ahern sent the package,
he feared that the company would retaliate against the sender of the package.nevertheless,ahern engaged in a deliberate deception by listing pierson as the sender of the package,even though ahern knew that pierson had not authorized the use of his name.ahern thereby implicated pierson in activity that ahern himself believed would anger the company.that ahern may not have affirmatively intended to harm pierson,and may have believed that the use of a fictitious address would ultimately absolve pierson of any actual repercussions from the sending of the package is not determinative.the fact remains that ahern deliberate falsification posed a substantial risk to pierson reputation and employment status.
consequently,the board found that ahern misconduct was sufficiently egregious to cause him to lose protection of the act.
petitioners essentially claim that the board erred by misrepresenting the evidence and by determining that ahern deliberate falsity was egregious enough to cause him to lose protection of the act.
petitioners claim the board misrepresented the evidence in two ways.first,petitioners contend that the board erred by finding that when ahern used pierson name on the package,he feared the company would retaliate against the sender of the package.petitioners assert that ahern only feared retaliation against himself based on his union participation.but substantial evidence supports the board factual finding.both griswold and simmons testified that the three technicians had sent the package anonymously based on their fear of repercussions.moreover,simmons acknowledged that these repercussions might exist for whoever put their names on the package.
petitioners also challenge the board determination that ahern falsification had the potential to harm pierson reputation and employment status.yet substantial evidence supports the board determination on this point as well.although ahern inclusion of a false address and telephone number may have reduced the risk that pierson would be implicated,the board reasonably determined that ahern implicated pierson in activity that ahern himself believed would anger the company.that ahern falsification did not actually harm pierson does not mean that it did not still pose a substantial risk at the time 
petitioners stronger argument is that ahern falsification was not sufficiently egregious to cause him to lose protection of the act.specifically,petitioners contend that an employee falsification must be deliberate and malicious to lose protection of the act and that ahern falsification should remain protected because it was not malicious.
the narrow question of whether prior board decisions have established that a deliberate falsification must be malicious to lose protection of the act is a pure question of law that the court reviews de novo,see harborside healthcare,at,subject to whatever deference is required by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.however,if there is no such legal requirement,then the board application of the law to the whether ahern conduct was sufficiently egregious to cause him to lose protection of the a exercise,in which the board line should not be disturbed unless it is illogical or arbitrary.see ohio power,at.
although the board has consistently provided that a deliberate falsification may lose the protection of the act,it has not clarified whether malice must accompany the deliberate falsification.see,puerto rico sheraton hotel,enforcement denied on other grounds by sheraton puerto rico,cir noting that disqualifying conduct might include,inter alia,malice,deliberate intention to falsify or deliberate and malicious falsehood.emphasis added am.hosp,listing malice or deliberate intention to falsify and deliberately and maliciously false as conduct that could lose protection of the act emphasis added am.shuffleboard,employee remained protected where his statements were not deliberately or maliciously false emphasis added.
in finding that deliberate falsity could be disqualifying,the board cited guardian industries,at.in that case,an employee criticized his employer for requiring a to submit to drug testing without cause at all.id.at.the employee statement was inaccurate in that the eventually failed the drug test.id.at.but the board held that protection is not denied to an employee regardless of the inaccuracy or lack of merit of employee statements absent deliberate falsity or maliciousness id.emphasis added.taken out of context,this statement might suggest that a deliberate falsity alone could be of whether malice was present.but the board emphasized that the employee statements were not maliciously calculated or uttered in anything but a belief in the cause.id.
consistent with guardian industries,the board has found that deliberate falsifications remain protected by the act when the falsifications have been made in good faith.for example,in roadmaster,the board determined that an employee acting as grievance committeeman remained protected despite forging the names of other employees on grievance forms in an effort to preserve their grievances before an impending deadline,finding employee actions were reasonable responses to the situation.enforcing the board order,the seventh circuit further emphasized that the employer had not tried to deceive his employer.roadmaster nlrb,cir.likewise,in opw fueling components,where a union steward signed the names of two employees on a formal grievance,this court,in upholding the board determination that the steward did not lose the protection of the act,emphasized that the steward had acted in good faith and for legitimate reasons and did not have an intent to deceive his employer,cir.

reading these board decisions together,we think the determinative question is whether an employee cond
