the following facts are not in dispute.mark was born on december.by age three,mark exhibited interfering behaviors that impacted his ability to benefit from a normal educational program.the interfering behaviors included great difficulty attending to a task,the inability to focus,squirming,kicking,hitting,moving away and otherwise not cooperating with learning strategies.mark problems led his parents to seek idea services for him from the school district.as a result,on february,an individualized education program iep team met regarding mark at this meeting,all agreed that mark should be considered a student with a disability who requires special education services in order to receive a fape.thus,on february,mark began an interim placement at buckingham elementary school in the language stimulation program for three year olds,pending another meeting of mark iep team mark iep team.
mark disability is classified as pervasive developmental disorder pdd,and it is suspected that he may also have neurofibromatosis.his pdd was diagnosed by expert physicians at the dupont hospital for children in march.the dupont physicians determined that mark has a rather significant disability with language and also problems with auditory processing that were causing some behavioral problems.the dupont physicians also determined that mark disability required that he receive therapy and occupational therapy.
from february,until march,mark made remarkable progress in his stimulation program at buckingham elementary school,such that he became able to accompany his family to restaurants.after completion of an educational assessment by holly hermstedt,mark classroom teacher at buckingham elementary school,mark iep team met again on march,the march,iep meeting in order to prepare a formal iep.at this meeting,mark iep team considered a and occupational therapy assessment conducted by easter seals in november,as well as the educational assessment conducted by holly hermstedt.based upon this information,mark iep team concluded that mark interfering behaviors and educational needs required therapy and occupational therapy.thus,at the march,iep meeting,the school district members of mark iep team proposed an iep for him the proposed iep,which contained specific objectives to address mark weaknesses in order to meet these specific objectives,the proposed iep provided that mark should participate twelve hours per week in the buckingham language stimulation program receive one hour per week of therapy and receive one hour per week of occupational therapy.
mark parents,for their part,agreed with the proposed iep as far as it went,but expressed their strong feelings that mark should receive esy services during the summer of.in support of their position,mark parents produced written evaluations from the following professionals stephen falchek,falchek dated december,march,and march,susan stine,stine dated march,and jill linden,in psychology,linden undated in one of his evaluations,falchek stated that he feared that mark would lose significant ground if he did not receive esy services during the summer of.in another of falchek evaluations,he opined that mark should receive esy services for the summer of because mark was quite tenuous in his development.stine recommended that mark be considered for esy services during the summer of.linden opined that it is important that mark continue in a school program that includes classroom time plus speech and occupational therapies all year round,with no summer break.
the school district members of mark iep team staunchly refused to read or review any of these professional evaluations submitted by mark parents.according to kathy simon,a representative of the worcester county school system who was present at the march,iep meeting,the school district members of mark iep team refused to consider the evaluations because they believed that mark was simply not eligible for esy services.
mark parents refused to sign the proposed iep because it did not include esy services for the summer of.nevertheless,with the consent of his parents,mark continued to receive interim services for the remainder of the regular school year that were basically consistent with those contained in the proposed iep.then,at their own expense,mark parents obtained therapy and occupational therapy for mark through easter seals during the summer of 
on october,the dibuos requested a due process hearing before an administrative law judge the alj to consider their claim that the school district must reimburse them for the esy services therapy and occupational therapy that they privately obtained for mark during the summer of on november,the school district responded with a motion to dismiss and an alternative motion for a summary decision.the dibuos opposed these motions and on november,filed their own motion for summary decision.
on december,the alj denied the parties respective motions and set the case for a full hearing on the merits.at the hearing,which was conducted on december and,the alj heard testimony and received exhibits on behalf of the respective parties.
on january,the alj issued a final decision.of relevance in the present appeal,the alj found that the staunch refusal of the school district members of mark iep team to consider the dibuos esy services evaluations at the march,iep meeting,violated the idea related mandates that the parents of a child under review be afforded the opportunity to participate in all iep team meetings and that the iep team review all evaluations and information provided by parents of a child under review.c a,b see also c.then,citing our decision in gadsby grasmick,cir,for the proposition that not every procedural violation of the idea warrants granting the relief requested,the alj also found that mark was not denied a fape as a result,because the evidence did not establish that esy s ervices were warranted under the legal standard.the alj made this finding after considering and analyzing the expert written opinions and testimony offered by the dibuos during the hearing which included the dibuos iep services evaluations and the expert testimony offered by the school district at the hearing.near the end of the alj final decision,she formally concludes that the proposed iep offered mark a fape.accordingly,the alj declined to grant the dibuos the reimbursement they were seeking.
as parties aggrieved by the alj final decision,the dibuos filed the present civil action against the school district,pursuant to i a,in the united states district court for the district of maryland.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted the dibuos motion for summary judgment and denied the school district motion for summary judgment.thus,the district court ordered the school district to pay the dibuos the reimbursement they were seeking,and also awarded the dibuos in attorneys fees and other costs pursuant to the idea provision.
in granting summary judgment for the dibuos,the district court concluded that the refusal of the school district members of mark iep team to consider the dibuos esy services evaluations seriously infringed the parents opportunity to participate in the iep formulation process,and ipso facto,mark and his parents suffered substantive harm.based upon this conclusion and notably without addressing whether the alj erred in finding that the proposed iep would have provided mark with a fape,despite its lack of any provision for esy services for the summer of,the district court ordered the school district to reimburse the dibuos for the esy services therapy and occupational therapy that mark received during the summer of 
on appeal,the school district does not challenge the district court determination that it violated certain procedural requirements of the idea by failing to consider the dibuos esy services evaluations at the march,iep meeting in determining whether mark should receive esy services for the summer of.rather,the school district vigorously challenges the district court entry of judgment in favor of the dibuos without determining whether the alj erred in finding that such procedural violations did not actually interfere with the provision of a fape to mark.according to the school district,a procedural violation of the idea can not support a finding that a school district failed to provide a disabled child a fape unless the procedural violation actually interfered with the provision of a fape to that child.the school district then goes on to contend that we should review the alj finding on this point in the first instance and uphold it.on this basis,the school district seeks reversal of the judgment entered by the district court and vacature of its award of attorneys fees and other costs.alternatively,the school district seeks the same ultimate outcome on the basis that because mark did not already have an approved iep in place when his iep team considered whether he should also be provided esy services for the summer of,he was ineligible for such services.in the event we affirm the judgment of the district court,the school district also makes numerous challenges to the award of attorneys fees and other costs,including a challenge to the district court award of expert witness fees as part of costs.
on appeal,the dibuos seek affirmance of the judgment entered by the district court and its award of attorneys fees and other costs in their favor.however,if we address the issue of whether the alj erred in finding that the proposed iep provided mark a fape,despite its lack of any provision for esy services for the summer of,the dibuos contend that the alj did so err.
before delving into the legal issues presented in this appeal,we believe it helpful to further elucidate the statutory backdrop that we encounter in this case.congress enacted the idea,in part,to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.d a see also gadsby,at.another purpose of the idea is to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.d b.in order to achieve these and other stated purposes,the idea requires all states receiving federal funds for education to provide each child,between the ages of three and,who has a disability,a fape that is designed specifically to meet that child needs.a a.
congress saw parental participation in the process of developing an iep as integral to achieving the noble purposes of the idea.as the supreme court stated in board of education of hendrick hudson central school district rowley,d 
it seems to us no exaggeration to say that congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process as it did upon the measurement of the resulting iep against a substantive standard.
id.at.notably,although the idea requires that s tates must provide specialized instruction and related services sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child,it does not require the furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child potential.hartmann loudoun county bd.of,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
of particular relevance in the present appeal,in mm school district of greenville county,cir,we recently articulated,for the first time,a formal standard for determining when esy services are appropriate under the idea esy services are only necessary to a fape when the benefits a disabled child gains during a regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is not provided with an educational program during the summer months.id.at.in mm,we carefully emphasized that,under this standard,the mere fact of likely regression is not a sufficient basis,because all students,disabled or not,may regress to some extent during lengthy breaks from school.id.
we now turn to the threshold question presented in this appeal whether a procedural violation of the idea can support a finding that a school district failed to provide a disabled child with a fape when the procedural violation did not actually interfere with the provision of a fape to that child.the answer to this question,under circuit precedent,is no.
most recently,in mm,we relied upon our decision in gadsby grasmick,cir to reiterate that w hen a procedural violation of the idea exists,we are obliged to assess whether it resulted in the loss of an educational opportunity for the disabled child,or whether,on the other hand,it was a mere technical contravention of the idea.mm,at.in gadsby,the parents of a disabled child contended that maryland state board of education violated a particular notice provision of the idea when it failed to notify them before effectively denying the application for reimbursement for private school tuition that had been submitted to the board by their local education agency on behalf of their son.gadsby,at.according to the parents,this violation constituted an independent denial of a fape to their son,giving rise to an obligation to reimburse them for the remaining portion of their son private school tuition for the school year.id.
in addressing this latter contention,we acknowledged in gadsby that,in hall vance county board of education,cir,we held that the failure to comply with the idea procedural requirements,such as the parental notice provision,can be a sufficient basis for holding that a government entity has failed to provide a free appropriate public education.gadsby,at.but our holding in hall does not mean that violation of a procedural requirement of the idea or one of its implementing regulations,in the absence of a showing that the violation actually interfered with the provision of a fape to the disabled child,constitutes a sufficient basis for holding that a government entity failed to provide that child a fape.we took the opportunity in gadsby to clarify our holding in hall as follows however,to the extent that the procedural violations did not actually interfere with the provision of a free appropriate public education,these violations are not sufficient to support a finding that an agency failed to provide a free appropriate public education.tice botetourt county sch,cir no relief granted where the procedural violations complained of had no impact on whether iep adequately assured him of a fape burke county bd.of educ.denton,cir the procedural faults committed by the board in this case did not cause chris to lose any educational opportunity.thus,under our circuit precedent,a violation of a procedural requirement of the idea or one of its implementing regulations must actually interfere with the provision of a fape before the child his parents would be entitled to reimbursement relief of the type sought by the dibuos.
succinctly stated,the dibuos principal argument in response to the circuit precedent just set forth is that the actual interference requirement of gadsby is always satisfied when a procedural violation of the idea or one of its implementing regulations causes interference with the parents ability to participate in the iep process.in other words,the dibuos propose a broad legal rule to the effect that a procedural violation of the idea or one of its implementing regulations that causes interference with the pare
