as a result of the company response to a union organizing campaign,the united auto workers international union filed an unfair labor practices charge against holsum de puerto rico.general counsel for the national labor relations board then commenced a regulatory enforcement action.after extensive testimony,an administrative law judge determined that holsum had engaged in unfair labor practices and had terminated employees illegally.see a.with a slight exception not important here,the board adopted the judge findings and conclusions as its own.before us,holsum does not contest most of the board findings.however,it does petition for review of the board conclusion that josé torres,a leader of the unionization effort,was fired as a sanction for his protected activity,and the board related order that torres be reinstated to his job at holsum.the board for enforcement of its entire order.we reject holsum petition and grant the board.
we review the background facts as the board found them,focusing on the facts involving torres.most of these facts are not disputed here holsum is a commercial bakery,selling bread and other products to retailers in puerto rico.torres and josé santiago were salesmen for holsum.their duties included driving company trucks and delivering baked goods to clients.in the summer of,torres,santiago,and some other holsum salespeople began to talk about forming a union.from the beginning,santiago took the lead in scheduling meetings,and torres led the drive to recruit other salespeople to join the union.initially,torres recruited other employees informally.by the fall of,however,torres had begun handing out union authorization cards and telling his coworkers that the union could better represent their interests.
holsum had a union avoidance policy,and its management quickly began observing and discouraging the salespeople unionization campaign.private investigators working for the company observed one of the early organizational meetings.then,in september,holsum president,ramón calderón,sent a letter to his employees stating that a group of dissatisfied employees had attacked the company,creating a serious threat to your job,your future and the future of your family.the the board did not find was improper in and of itself but which surely shows the company feelings about the unionization by instructing employees to read and abide by the company union avoidance policy,and to say no to the union agitators.
shortly after this letter was sent,holsum supervisors confronted torres,santiago,and several other employees to ask them what they thought about the letter.these inquiries,in combination with other facts,led the board to conclude that the company had illegally interrogated its workers.when torres was interrogated about the letter,the conversation quickly became antagonistic.torres refused to tell his supervisor what he thought of the letter,the supervisor persisted in his questioning,and ultimately torres told the supervisor that he could not answer without compromis ing himself.the acrimonious interrogation did not stop torres efforts on behalf of the nascent union.until his discharge in the spring of,torres spent almost every afternoon in the company parking lot,soliciting his fellow employees to sign union authorization cards.
in april,torres was fired.holsum maintains that it terminated torres because he violated the company rule against letting ride in company trucks.crediting torres uncontradicted account,the board found that one day in late april a man jumped into torres truck while torres was waiting for a traffic light to change.torres told the stranger to get out of the truck.the passenger refused to leave and demanded a ride to the next traffic light in the direction torres was traveling.torres insisted that the person leave the truck and told him that he was prohibited by company policy from transporting passengers.still,the passenger would not get out,and torres would not have been able to remove him without resorting to physical force.the light changed,and cars behind the truck started honking.torres decided that it would be better to transport his unwanted passenger a short distance than to have a physical fight with him in the middle of an intersection.the passenger jumped out of the truck when he reached his intended destination,and torres continued on his route.
a holsum supervisor observed the unwanted passenger brief ride on torres truck.when torres returned to holsum warehouse,another supervisor told him that he had been seen with an unauthorized passenger.the supervisor asked torres to fill out a written report describing the incident.torres did as he was asked.when torres arrived at work the next day,two supervisors confronted him and told him that he was suspended without wages or health benefits.the supervisors also instructed torres to return to the plant the following week for a hearing.
the next week,torres arrived at the plant at the time he had been told to come,bringing with him a man whom he introduced as his union representative.while torres had been scheduled to meet with holsum human resources director,he was told upon arriving with his union representative that the director was unavailable and that he would have to meet with a junior supervisor.he also was told that he would not be allowed to bring the union representative with him.the meeting was short.the supervisor simply told torres that he had been fired,and then said,well,that all.while torres asked for a letter explaining the reasons for his discharge,holsum personnel neither furnished such a letter nor explained to torres why he had been fired.
a few days after torres was fired,a holsum supervisor confronted santiago as he was loading his truck.the supervisor asked santiago if he knew that torres had been fired.when santiago nodded,the supervisor said that santiago should be careful and take care of his job because he was going to be next.a few days after this conversation,calderón sent another letter to holsum employees.this letter stated that the company had learned in the past several days that a union continued to threaten the future and security of the holsum families.again,the company interrogated its employees about their reactions to the letter.
later that month,holsum fired santiago.before the board,holsum argued that it had terminated santiago for his unauthorized distribution of six cups of hot coffee to a group of,including torres,who were soliciting for the union outside the plant.the board concluded that the real reason santiago was discharged was that he gave coffee to persons who were distributing union propaganda against the company.
under the national labor relations act,it is illegal to fire an employee to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.a.when the nlrb general counsel brings regulatory enforcement proceedings to contest an employee termination for union activity,the general counsel bears the initial burden of showing that the employee protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the employee discharge.nlrb transportation management,d abrogated in part and clarified by director,office of workers compensation programs maher terminals,d.the general counsel satisfies this burden by showing that the employee engaged in protected activity that the employer was aware of the employee protected activity that the employer had animus against such activity and a causal connection between the employer animus and the employee termination.see id.at.waste,nlrb,cir.the general counsel does not have to show that the employee protected union activity was the sole factor for the discharge.nlrb hospital san pablo,cir.
if the general counsel meets this by so doing establishes a prima facie case that the employee was fired employer can defeat liability only by proving that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity.waste,at.but the board does not have to accept even a seemingly plausible explanation from the employer.id.if the board supportably finds that the reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or pretextual,the violation is deeme
