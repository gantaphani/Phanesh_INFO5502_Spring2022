maria belbruno,her husband,juan belbruno,and their four children,maria belem maria belem,juan francisco juan francisco,juan fernando juan fernando,and maria isabel maria isabel entered the united states from guatemala during december.maria belbruno and the four children are natives and citizens of guatemala.juan belbruno is a native and citizen of argentina.the family initially entered legally on visas,but overstayed their visas by approximately eighteen months before juan belbruno filed an application for political asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins on december,
on june,the ins charged the belbrunos with removability for remaining longer than permitted after admission as visitors in violation of the immigration and nationality act ina.see ina a b codified at a b.on november,the ins also charged maria belbruno and maria belem with removability as immigrants not in possession of valid entry documents at the time of their application for admission,because they had returned to guatemala in march and subsequently reentered the united states without valid visas.see ina a a i i codified at a a i i.
all six members of the belbruno family conceded that they were removable as charged.after juan belbruno withdrew his application for asylum,maria belbruno filed for political asylum in her own name,and the claims of juan belbruno and their four children became derivative to her application.see b a.
in her application,maria belbruno stated that she was seeking asylum on behalf of her family due to numerous threats that they had received from the guerrilla s and the government because of her husband participation in a human rights advocacy group.juan belbruno testified at their asylum hearing that he had joined a group called pro human rights in and explained that it was against the government,the army and the guerillas.he claimed that he had provided the group financial support and participated in its activities by distributing flyers,attending meetings,and organizing rallies.he testified that he belonged to the group from until december,and explained that his family began to experience problems as a result of his participation in late.he claimed that the family received seven or eight threatening phone calls.one of the belbrunos children,juan francisco,testified that he answered the phone on one occasion and a man voice said,w e going to kill someone from your family.
additionally,on december,unknown gunmen assertedly fired shots at the belbruno home at in the morning.juan belbruno testified that he did not know who fired the shots,but assumed that it was members of the police department,members of the government,or any members that do want us to be in public acts and say the truth.several members of the family testified that they heard loud sounds or gun shots the night of shooting and that they were scared and crying.the family abandoned their house that evening and stayed with maria belbruno relatives.juan belbruno testified that he fled to el salvador for two or three days,returned to guatemala for his family,and then brought them to the united states.he stated that he was afraid of returning with his family to guatemala,but when asked who he feared,he stated,i t hard to say a specific person.
maria belbruno and her oldest daughter,maria belem,returned to guatemala in march,so that maria belbruno could have cancer surgery.although belbruno had already undergone two operations in the united states,she decided to return to guatemala to take advantage of reduced medical costs for surgery that she could have received in the united states.maria belem testified that she was scared to return and that she stayed in guatemala for days without going out anywhere.she conceded that she and her mother did not experience any problems during their stay,but maintained that she was afraid of everything.
belbruno also called alfredo forte,an expert on human rights in guatemala.he testified that he had served on a united nations mission that investigated compliance with a human rights accord that had been signed in guatemala.forte stated that the individuals currently facing harassment in guatemala are those involved in investigating human rights abuses.
at the conclusion of the asylum hearing,the immigration judge denied maria belbruno application for asylum and withholding of removal.in denying asylum,the immigration judge found that maria belbruno failed to establish past persecution based on claims of anonymous telephone threats and a single shooting incident by unknown individuals at her house in.the immigration judge held belbruno could not show that these incidents were on account of her husband activities with the human rights organization.the judge also found that belbruno failed to establish a fear of future persecution.she noted that belbruno indicated her willingness to return to guatemala by returning there for days in to secure cheaper medical treatment and that belbruno and her daughter experienced no problems during their return and thus could not be considered refugees.
the judge did agree with belbruno own expert that the people experiencing some difficulties in guatemala are those involved with investigation of the prior human rights abuses.because neither juan belbruno nor his wife had ever investigated human rights abuses,however,the judge found that maria belbruno did not have a basis to fear harm at this time.finally,the judge noted that a state department report indicated there had been a significant improvement in the overall human rights situation and that the government of guatemala has generally cooperated with united nations investigations into human rights violations.the judge concluded that conditions have greatly improved in this area since the time that the belbrunos entered the united states in.the bia affirmed without opinion the immigration judge order denying maria belbruno applications for asylum and for withholding of removal.belbruno appealed to this court to review the bia decision.see b.
this court reviews legal issues,including claims of due process violations,de novo.see nwolise ins,cir.bia determinations concerning asylum eligibility or withholding of removal are conclusive if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal citation omitted see also gonahasa ins,cir.if an alien seeks to obtain judicial reversal of the bia determination,he must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,at.see also rusu ins,cir chen zhou chai carroll,cir.this narrow standard of review recognizes the respect we must accord both the bia expertise in immigration matters and its status as the attorney general designee in deportation decisions.bia,cir.
belbruno raises a number of procedural challenges to the decisions of the immigration judge and bia.first,she claims that the regulations promulgated by the attorney general are inconsistent with the ina.see a.second,belbruno claims the application of these regulations to her case violated her due process rights.third,she claims that application of the streamlining regulations to her pending appeal had a constitutionally impermissible retroactive effect.lastly,she raises the substantive claim that the bia erred in finding that she had not demonstrated past persecution or a fear of future persecution if forced to return to guatemala.we shall address these arguments in turn.
belbruno first contends that the streamlining regulations for asylum appeals to the bia are inconsistent with the ina.to determine whether an agency has properly construed the statute which it administers,we apply the familiar principles of chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in considering the attorney general interpretation of the ina,we are mindful of the fact that the power to expel or include aliens is a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments largely immune from judicial control.fiallo bell,d quoting shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.the attorney general enjoys broad powers with respect to the administration and enforcement of the ina and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.a.the ina empowers the attorney general to establish such regulations issue such instructions and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his authority under the immigration laws.a.the attorney general may provide by regulation for any other conditions or limitations on the consideration of an application for asylum not inconsistent with the ina.d b.
pursuant to his powers under the ina,the attorney general issued regulations creating the bia as the administrative appellate body for asylum cases.see a.for most of the bia history,panels heard immigration appeals and issued written opinions explaining their rationale or adopting the immigration judge opinion.see charles gordon,stanley mailman,stephen,immigration law and procedure ed.however,in the attorney general adopted a set of streamlining regulations in order to address a backlog of cases that numbered in the tens of thousands.see executive office of immigration review board of immigration appeals streamlining,codified at pt.these regulations allowed adjudication of appeals by single bia members and affirmance of immigration judges decisions without opinion under specified circumstances.see a 
the streamlining regulations set forth clear conditions that must be satisfied for a single bia judge to summarily affirm.the bia member had to determine 
that the result reached in the decision under review was correct that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial and that 
a the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by existing board or federal court precedent and does not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation or 
b the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that review is not warranted.
a ii.if the bia reviewer found these conditions were satisfied,he would issue an order that t he board affirms,without opinion,the result of the decision below.the decision below is,therefore,the final agency determination.see a.a iii.the regulations not only mandated this language,but also specifically prohibited a bia member from offering any additional explanation or reasoning in a summary affirmance case.a ii.
congress has not addressed the precise question of procedures for administrative appeals of asylum claims,so the first prong of chevron is inapplicable.at.the attorney general interpretation of the ina satisfies the second prong of chevron,however,as the regulations are based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.one section of the ina refers to the existence of the bia,see a b,and other sections refer to an administrative appeal for asylum seekers,see,d a iii iv.but the ina is simply silent as to what procedures should apply to that appeal.as the third circuit put it t he ina says nothing whatsoever regarding the procedures of an administrative appeal,or,for that matter,any other procedures employed by the bia.dia ashcroft,cir en banc.this fact suggests that the ina vests broad discretion in the attorney general to fashion the procedures of the bia.
absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances,the administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d internal quotations omitted.the attorney general is charged with balancing the need for adequate protections for asylum seekers against a backlog of tens of thousands of cases that leave many asylum seekers in limbo.the agency operates in an environment of limited resources,and how it allocates those resources to address the burden of increasing claims is a calculation that courts should be loathe to second guess.here the agency adopted regulations that would allow it to focus a greater measure of its resources on more complicated cases.this is the type of decision that agencies are the most informed to make,and enjoy the discretion to resolve.we,therefore,hold that the streamlining regulations are a permissible construction of the ina and permit the attorney general to fulfill his legislatively delegated functions.
we next consider belbruno claim that the streamlining regulations deprived her of the right to due process of law under the fifth amendment.to begin with,aliens have only those rights congress sees fit to provide.aliens have no independent constitutional rights in an asylum procedure.selgeka carroll,cir citing landon plasencia,d.aliens possess,for example,no constitutional right to an administrative appeal.see albathani ins,cir an alien has no constitutional right to any administrative appeal at all.see also abney united states,d t here is no constitutional right to an appeal even in criminal cases.
the attorney general,however,has exercised his powers under the ina to issue regulations allowing aliens to appeal decisions of immigration judges in asylum and removal proceedings.see b,b.although the federal government had no obligation to create an administrative right to appeal or to establish a specific set of procedures,w hen congress directs an agency to establish a procedure it can be assumed that congress intends that procedure to be a fair one.selgeka,at quoting marincas lewis,cir.
belbruno argues that an affirmance of an immigration judge without opinion violates her due process rights because the bia has failed to produce a final decision that provides this court a meaningful basis for review.the basis for an administrative action must of course be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable,as we must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.sec chenery.the familiar chenery directive,however,provides no basis for finding the summary affirmance procedure here defective.belbruno overlooks the fact that the immigration judge opinion provides the reasoned basis on which the bia and the ins as an agency relied,and which we review here.in fact,the summary affirmance regulations specifically establish that the immigration judge decision serves as the final agency action.a iii.this satisfies the requirements of chenery the proper emphasis is on whether there are reasoned bases for the actions of the agency as a whole,and the immigration judge opinion serves that purpose.see albathani,at.
here belbruno received an extensive hearing before an immigration judge,which included hours of testimony by members of the belbruno family,testimony by an expert on human rights in guatemala,and the introduction of documentary evidence.the immigration judge issued a opinion that found that belbruno was ineligible for asylum because she failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.this opinion clearly laid out the reasoning for the agency decision,which we can meaningfully review.
belbruno correctly notes that the affirmance without opinion procedure allows the bia to affirm an immigration judge decision even when the bia panel member may disagree with the decision in part.see a iii.this fact,however,is ameliorated by the requirement that in such cases the bia reviewer must determine that any
