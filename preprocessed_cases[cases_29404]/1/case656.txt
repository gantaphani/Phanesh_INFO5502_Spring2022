plaintiffs appellants appeal the judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york marrero,dismissing their complaint for failure to state a claim.plaintiffs appellants argue that the child status protection act,and in particular h,entitles duo cen,an alien who aged out of eligibility for an immigrant visa as a derivative beneficiary to his grandfather petition,to retain the priority date for his mother petition for duo cen.we disagree.section h does not entitle an alien to retain the priority date of an family preference petition if the family preference petition can not be converted to an appropriate category.because plaintiffs appellants have specified no appropriate category to which duo cen grandfather petition could be converted,section h does not entitle him to retain the priority date from his grandfather petition.
in,congress enacted the immigration and nationality act ina,establishing the basic structure of today immigration laws,stat.three main features are relevant here.the act set a limit on the total number of immigrant visas available continued and codified the national origins quota system established by the immigration act of,stat,which set maximum quotas for immigrant visas based on the nation of the immigrant birth or,if the immigrant was part of the asia pacific triangle,based on the immigrant race and established a family preference system that applied to each national origins quota category of each quota category was set aside for parents of united states citizens and an additional of each quota category was set aside for spouses or children of lawfully admitted permanent residents of the united states lprs,stat.although brothers,sisters,sons,and daughters of united states citizens were not guaranteed quota slots,they did receive a preference for any unused quotas.id.a,stat.at.
in,concerned about discrimination on the basis of race,sex,nationality,place of birth,or place of residence,congress repealed the national origins quota system.act of,stat.instead,congress substituted a generally uniform limit of immigrants per year from any one country.id.
today,the ina specifies a worldwide limitation on the total number of immigrant visas issued each year,c preference categories for certain types of family members of citizens and lprs,id.a numerical limitations on the number of immigrant visas in each family preference category,and a generally uniform limitation that natives of any single foreign state not constitute more than of the visas granted to immigrants,id.a.unlike other types of immigrants,immediate relatives of united states citizens are not subject to either the numerical limitations per country or the worldwide level of total visas granted per year.id.b.moreover,additional visas are available for immigrants of countries that recently have sent few immigrants to the united states.id.c b.
at all times relevant to this appeal,the ina provided the following family preference categories 
unmarried son or daughter of citizen 
spouses or children of lpr,where a child is an unmarried person under with some exceptions 
unmarried son or daughter of lpr 
married son or daughter of citizen 
brother or sister of citizen 
under the ina,a citizen or lpr who desires that a family member receive an immigrant visa must file a petition with the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis.id.a.the citizen or lpr who files the petition is the petitioner and the sponsored immigrant is the primary beneficiary.generally,an immigrant can not but must be sponsored by a family member who is a citizen or lpr.if the sponsored immigrant the primary beneficiary has a spouse or child accompanying or following to join,that spouse or child is eligible to receive,as a derivative beneficiary,the same status as the primary beneficiary when the primary beneficiary receives her visa.id.d.
when a citizen or lpr files a petition on behalf of an immigrant,uscis determines whether the immigrant is qualified to be a beneficiary.id.b.once the beneficiary is deemed qualified,uscis approves the petition.see drax reno,f d,cir accord bolvito mukasey,cir.
uscis approval of a petition does not automatically cause the agency to issue a visa or grant permanent lawful resident status to the beneficiary instead,the beneficiary receives a place in line to wait for a visa.bolvito,at.within preference categories,immigrant visas are issued to beneficiaries on a basis,in order of the date the petition was filed the petition priority date.given the annual limitations on the total number of visas that may be granted for a particular family preference category and on the number of natives of a single country who may receive visas the waiting line to receive a visa often is long.the number of family preference petitions each year for visas for chinese immigrants,for example,far exceeds the numerical limitations for each family preference category.it is not uncommon for such immigrants to wait a decade or more after uscis granted the petition to receive a visa.
this regime,however,could have anomalous results.eligibility was determined on the date a visa became available,not when a petition was filed or approved.thus,before august,an immigrant might have waited in line for a visa for years only to lose his or her spot.the reason was that at the time a visa became available,an immigrant sponsored by a family member may no longer have been the spouse,child,or unmarried son or daughter of the petitioner.if so,the immigrant was no longer eligible for a visa.
child beneficiaries were especially affected by the long delays before a visa became available.many children of their status as a child that is,after waiting years to receive a visa,they were no longer under years of age,and thus were not eligible to receive a visa as a child of the petitioner.see b defining child.
on august,congress passed the child status protection act cspa to provide protection to child beneficiaries,stat.codified at f,h,a d,k,c,b.as is relevant here,congress focused on two separate periods of delay the time between when a citizen or lpr sponsor filed a petition and uscis granted the petition uscis processing delay and the time between uscis grant of the petition and the availability of a visa waiting time because of ina numerical limits per year.for the first delay,congress provided that the age of the immigrant on the date a visa became available would be reduced by the number of days the petition was pending before uscis,before the petition was granted or denied.h.thus,if uscis took three years to grant a family petition filed when the child beneficiary was and a visa became available one year later,the beneficiary would be able to receive the visa as a child beneficiary,despite the beneficiary age at the time the visa became available.for the second delay,congress allowed immigrants whose age remained above years old after subtracting the period of uscis processing delay to receive the benefit of other preference categories for which they were eligible,while retaining their spot in line their priority date.congress provided that for such beneficiaries 
the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.
this appeal turns on the interpretation of this provision.
on june,yong guang li,a lawful permanent resident of the united states,filed a family preference petition naming his unmarried adult daughter feimei li as the primary beneficiary.feimei li year old child,duo cen cen,qualified as a derivative beneficiary of yong guang li petition.
on april,the ins approved the petition for feimei li,its primary beneficiary.the ins set a priority date of june.at the time the petition was approved,cen was years old and thus remained a child for purposes of the ina.
because of a significant waiting line for those in the family preference category,feimei li did not receive a visa until march.at that time,cen was years old.id.because he was no longer a child under the ina,he could not derive beneficiary status from the petition.thus,cen had aged out of derivative beneficiary status before he could be granted a visa on that ground.
three years later,on april,feimei li,a lawful permanent resident,filed a family preference petition naming cen,her unmarried adult son,as the primary beneficiary.in a cover letter that accompanied the petition,feimei li requested a priority date of june.feimei li argued that cen was entitled to the priority date of her father petition,under which cen was a derivative beneficiary before aging out.
uscis approved feimei li petition on august.however,uscis established the priority date as april,rather than the date requested by feimei li.if uscis had given the petition a priority date,cen would have received a visa immediately.however,because the petition was given a priority date,the department of state estimates that based on current processing times cen will have to wait until for a visa.
on september,feimei li and cen filed suit,alleging that uscis misinterpreted a provision of the child status protection act,codified at h,in setting the priority date for li petition.feimei li and cen sued the director of uscis vermont service center,the acting director of uscis,the attorney general,and the secretary of department of homeland security dhs collectively,defendants.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,arguing that neither feimei li nor cen had a statutory right to have feimei li petition receive a priority date.
on april,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.applying the framework articulated by chevron,natural res.def.council,the district court first found that section h was ambiguous because it does not explicitly articulate which petitions qualify for automatic conversion and priority date retention.feimei li renaud,d.the district court then deferred to the bia interpretation of section h in matter of wang,bia,because it found such interpretation reasonable.feimei li,d at.
in wang,the bia held that automatic conversion,as the term is used in section h,means an automatic change in beneficiary classification without the need to file a new visa petition.wang,at.the bia relied on the relevant provisions of i,which have been in effect since,and which provide for the automatic conversion of preference classification from one preference category to another upon the occurrence of certain events.id.at.similarly,and based on a,the bia construed the word retention to apply only to visa petitions filed by the same family member.id.at.accordingly,the bia held that the automatic conversion and priority date retention provisions of section h do not apply to an alien who ages out of eligibility for an immigrant visa as a derivative beneficiary,and on whose behalf a second family preference petition is later filed by a different petitioner.id.at.
feimei li and cen timely appealed the district court dismissal of their complaint.because cen does not challenge the district court dismissal of his complaint for lack of standing,the argument is waived and his appeal is dismissed on that issue.see,in re wireless data,cir argument not raised on appeal is waived.
feimei li argues that her son cen should have been assigned a priority date of rather than under the child status protection act.as relevant here,the cspa provides partial relief for child beneficiaries from both uscis processing delay and the time they must wait to receive a visa.for the first such delay,h subtracts from a child beneficiary age the time during which the applicable petition was pending 
for the purposes of subsections a a spouses and children of lawful permanent residents and d derivative beneficiaries of this section,a determination of whether an alien satisfies the age requirement as a child shall be made using 
a the age of the alien on the date on which an immigrant visa number becomes available for such alien or,in the case of subsection d of this section,the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien parent,reduced by 
b the number of days in the period during which the applicable petition described in paragraph was pending.
id.h.as specified by section h,this calculation applies to certain types of pending petitions 
a with respect to a relationship described in subsection a a of this section spouses and children of lawful permanent residents,a petition filed under section of this title for classification of an alien child under subsection a a of this section or 
b with respect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary under subsection d of this section,a petition filed under section of this title for classification of the alien parent 
this calculation applies to cen,who was a derivative beneficiary of his grandfather petition for classification of cen mother,feimei li.however,the parties agree that because the petition was pending before uscis for less than one year,and a visa became available only when cen was,cen age for purposes of section remains over years old despite the calculation.
therefore,feimei li appeal centers on section h,which allows certain beneficiaries to retain the priority date of a petition of which they have aged out while waiting for a visa to become available.in particular,section h provides that 
if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.
feimei li principally argues that the petition by her father,yong guang li,of which her son cen was the derivative beneficiary,should automatically convert to a different petition the petition by feimei li for cen as an unmarried son and that cen should be allowed to retain the original priority date of her father petition.feimei li acknowledges that cen was not eligible as a beneficiary under another category of her father petition because the ina lacks a family preference category for grandchildren.however,feimei li argues that this provision,like many other sections of immigration law,permit s conversion and retention of a priority date where the petitioner is not the same.
amici curiae american immigration council aic and the american immigration lawyers association aila offer a second interpretation of section h that would allow cen to retain the petition priority date.aic and aila argue that automatic conversion and retention of priority dates are distinct and independent benefits.therefore,because cen was a derivative beneficiary to yong guang li petition,but then,cen can retain that priority date to use for a future petition listing him as a beneficiary.
the government disputes both feimei li and amici curiae interpretations.instead,the government argues that section h is ambiguous and this court should defer to the bia interpretation of the provision in matter of wang,bia.
we first consider what weight to accord the bia interpretation of section h in wang.pursuant to its delegated authority,the bia interpreted the ina in a formal adjudication.see ins aguirre aguirre,congress delegated the bia the authority to interpret the ina.therefore,we evaluate the bia interpretation according to chevron natural res.def.council.see united states mead,specifying when chevron deference is appropriate.
pursuant to chevron,we first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if so,that is the end of the matter because this court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.in evaluating whether congress has directly spoken to the issue,a reviewing court must first exhaust the traditional tools of statutory construction.id.at.if,in light of its text,legislative history,structure,and purpose,a statute is found to be plain in its meaning,then congress has expressed its intention as to the question,and deference is not appropriate.arizona pub.serv.epa,internal quotation marks omitted see also dynamics land,cline,u,chevron deference to an agency statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have
