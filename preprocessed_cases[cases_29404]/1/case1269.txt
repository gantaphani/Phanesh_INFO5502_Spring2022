michael willner an attorney and marguerite willner appeal the district court dismissal of their pro se complaint wherein they seek,inter alia,a declaration that jp morgan chase bank chase and bank can not foreclose on their home.the district court dismissed certain counts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of and other counts for failure to state a claim.as we explain below,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over most of the counts that the willners appeal because they did not first submit the claims underlying those counts to administrative review.the other counts relevant here fail to state a claim.accordingly,we affirm.
when reviewing a district court grant of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b or b in response to a defendant facial challenge to a complaint,we accept as true all factual allegations set forth in the complaint.kerns united states,cir.applying that standard to the willners complaint,we assume the following facts.
the willners purchased as tenants by the entirety property the property in lorton,virginia,in and built a house thereupon.in august,the willners considered selling the property but instead decided to refinance after speaking with an agent from washington mutual bank,fa wmbfa.the wmbfa agent told willner to contact a washington mutual bank wmb agent to fill out a loan application.willner did so,and told the wmb agent that he expected to earn about in.the wmbfa agent also told the willners that the property was worth in excess of million.the same agent led the willners to believe that wmbfa would foreclose on the property in the event of a missed payment.
in september,the willners closed on a million loan the loan from wmbfa.willner signed a note the note willner did not.willner had previously told the wmbfa agent that she did want to put her ownership interest in the property at risk,and said the same to a title agent at the closing.based upon each agent response,willner believed that her interest in the property would remain unencumbered.however,both and willner signed a deed of trust the deed of trust,which secured the loan and for which wmbfa was the beneficiary.
the deed of trust provided that any borrower who this security instrument but does not execute the note is this security instrument only to mortgage,grant and convey the interest in the property and is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this security instrument.willner also signed an affiliated business arrangement disclosure statement notice which indicated that wmbfa and wmb existed concurrently as separate and distinct entities.
less than two months after the closing,wmb sold the note to wamu asset acceptance corporation,which securitized the note by depositing it into the wamu mortgage certificates series the trust,a special purpose entity controlled by wmb.wmb was the sponsor and servicer of the trust and note,while lasalle bank was the trustee.wmbfa remained the beneficiary under the deed of trust.
on september,the office of thrift supervision declared wmb insolvent and appointed the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic as receiver.on that same day,chase entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic,whereby chase purchased substantially all of wmb assets and assumed substantially all of its liabilities.under the purchase and assumption agreement,chase did not assume any liability for wmb acts or omissions.chase purchased the right to service the loan,but allegedly did not purchase the note or deed of trust because wmb sold the note and deed of trust on or before october of.
in october,the willners received notice that the office of thrift supervision had closed wmb and appointed the fdic as receiver.also in october,lasalle bank merged into bank of america,which became the trustee for the trust.at some later point,bank became the trustee for the trust as successor in interest to bank of america,and it remains so today.
in july,the willners attempted to refinance the property through chase.a chase agent told the willners that their income was sufficient to qualify for a loan.willner spoke with chase representatives,who directed him to chase website.one suggestion on the chase website was to list the home for sale,which willner did to no avail.in april,chase ceo james dimon signed a consent order with the office of the comptroller of the currency,in which chase agreed to correct problems with its servicing and foreclosure practices.in may,the willners defaulted.
in june,willner applied for a loan modification from chase through the making home affordable program.in august,chase identified the note for collection through foreclosure,and willner tried to call dimon to discuss the foreclosure process but was only able to speak with one of his assistants.
in september,willner came upon wmb documents from which showed that his financial status had not qualified him for the loan which he had ultimately received.one of those documents listed his annual income for at.in march,willner discovered other information,including a wmb document which showed that wmb had conducted another appraisal in prior to the closing,and that the property was appraised for only million a wmb document from the closing which listed his income at per month and securities and exchange commission filings which showed that as of april,wmbfa allegedly ceased to exist.
in may,chase informed willner that he was not eligible for a modification under the making home affordable program.that program allegedly only applied to loans for or less,and allegedly required that eligibility determinations be made within days.on november,chase informed the willners that it intended to foreclose on the property and auction it on december.on december,willner but not willner filed for chapter bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia.bank then filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court claiming the right to foreclose on the property.
in may,bank chase as the master servicer of the trust,and in august,chase appointed select portfolio servicing as the.bank moved for relief from stay in the bankruptcy court in september.
and willner filed a pro se complaint against chase,chase ceo james dimon,bank,and select portfolio servicing.of those counts,only the following are relevant to this appeal 
count against chase and bank for a declaratory judgment that there is no right to foreclose under the deed of trust 
count against chase and bank for breach of contract based on absence of right to foreclose because the note is defective 
count against chase and bank for negligence based on breach of duty to willner to seek the aid and direction of a court of equity before foreclosing

count against chase and bank for a declaratory judgment that the note is not secured by willner ownership interest in the property 
count against bank for fraudulent concealment in the loan origination 
count against chase,bank,and select portfolio servicing for a declaratory judgment that the deed of trust is void based on lack of meeting of the minds

count against all defendants for conspiracy to commit fraudulent concealment in the loan origination,securitization,servicing,and foreclosure and 
count against all defendants for conspiracy to commit fraud in the loan origination,securitization,servicing,and foreclosure.
the parties engaged in motions practice,and in the conclusions of three oppositions to motions to dismiss and one surreply,the willners move d for leave to amend the ir c omplaint in the event that the district court found it deficien t,dkt.the district court dismissed the complaint without addressing the willners requests to amend.
the court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counts and encompassing all of the counts relevant here except counts and because those counts were based on wmb alleged misconduct and thus subject to an administrative remedies exhaustion requirement in the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of firrea which the willners had not satisfied to make sense of this part of the district court decision,we first outline firrea relevant provisions.
firrea establishes an administrative process that allows the fdic,acting as receiver for a failed institution,to settle claims against that institution and liquidate its assets.elmco,second fed.sav.ass n,cir.citing d.to effectuate that process,firrea requires that claimants submit all of their claims against a failed institution to the fdic before a certain date the bar date.id.citing d b i.firrea allows claimants either to obtain administrative review,followed by judicial review,of any disallowed claim against a depository institution for which the fdic is receiver,or to file suit for de novo consideration of the disallowed claim in a district court.am.ins,cir.citing d.
but,e xcept as otherwise provided in the act,a court may not exercise jurisdiction over 
i any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver,including assets which the fdic may acquire from itself as such receiver or 
ii any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the fdic as receiver.
these provisions combine to create an exhaustion requirement that,we have concluded,is absolute and unwaivable.elmco,at quoting brady dev.resolution tr,cir.put another way,firrea operates as a jurisdictional bar to claims that parties did not submit to the fdic administrative process.am,at.
the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over these counts pursuant to d d i because the willners had not exhausted their administrative remedies against wmb with respect to their claims arising out of the note and deed of trust,including the alleged misconduct by wmb.as to counts and,the court dismissed them for failure to state a claim.
this appeal followed.
the willners jointly appeal the dismissal of counts,and,and also argue that the district court erred by dismissing their complaint without first providing an opportunity to amend.willner,who appears pro se,appeals the dismissal of counts,and we proceed in three parts.first,we consider the joint appeal of the dismissal of counts,and,which is a challenge to the district court decision on subject matter jurisdiction.in so doing,we also resolve the portion of willner pro se appeal which concerns the district court decision on subject matter jurisdiction.second,we address the remaining issues from willner pro se appeal.finally,we turn to the question of whether the district court erred by not addressing the willners requests to amend their complaint.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b de novo.sucampo,astellas pharma,cir.w e may affirm on any grounds supported by the record,notwithstanding the reasoning of the district court.kerr marshall.bd.of governors,cir.while generally we liberally construe a pro se complaint,we have not determined whether a pro se plaintiff who is also an attorney receives the benefit of this liberal construction.id.at.we do not decide that issue because,liberally construed or not,the willners complaint fails for the reasons discussed below.nevertheless,o ut of an abundance of caution and in accordance with the liberal construction we afford a pro se complainant,we construe the willners complaint as best we can.id.
the willners jointly make four principal arguments for why the district court erred in dismissing counts,and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.each is an attempt to exclude some or all of the counts from firrea exhaustion requirement.we address them in turn.
we first consider the willners argument that counts and are claims about independent misconduct by chase and bank which fall outside of firrea exhaustion requirement.but before we address that argument,we must decide which of firrea two exhaustion requirements governs our analysis.
as an initial matter,the district court erred by applying d d i rather than analyzing the counts under d d ii.subsection i bars any unexhausted claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver.d d i.but the willners are not pursuing recovery under this theory.rather,their action seeks a determination of rights with respect to the assets of a that purchased the assets in question from the fdic.westberg,cir.see also rosa resolution tr,cir.refusing to apply d d i to claims against an institution which the office of thrift supervision had not placed into receivership.thus,if firrea jurisdictional bar applies,it because the willners claims fall within firrea other exhaustion requirement for any claim relating to any act or omission of an institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver or the corporation as receiver.d d ii.
section d d ii bars unexhausted claims against an assuming bank that relate to an act or omission of an institution for which the office of thrift supervision appointed the fdic as receiver,but a suit against a bank for its own wrongdoing is not barred by d d ii.am,at.where a claim is functionally,albeit not formally,against a depository institution for which the fdic is receiver,it is a claim within the meaning of firrea administrative claims process.id.at.
though counts and are formally asserted against chase and bank,they are functionally pleaded against wmb acts and omissions.the allegations underlying counts and are that wmb made misrepresentations and that the note and deed of trust are defective.in particular,the willners allege that wmb agreed not to foreclose on the property,that the note does not exist because willner never signed it,and that the deed of trust can not be used to foreclose on the property because the note to which it refers does not exist.because these unexhausted claims are functionally pleaded against the acts and omissions of wmb rather than against independent misconduct by chase and bank,d d ii operates as a jurisdictional bar.compare rundgren washington mut.bank,fa,cir.holding under nearly identical facts that plaintiffs claims were related to wmb acts and omissions,and that a claimant can not circumvent firrea exhaustion requirement by suing the purchasing bank based on the conduct of the failed institution,and tellado indymac mortg,cir.holding that d d ii barred plaintiffs claims against assuming bank,where assuming bank refused to cancel a loan after being informed that the failed bank improperly originated it,with am,at holding that d d ii did not bar judicial review of unexhausted claim against chase where plaintiffs alleged that chase improperly pressured the federal government to seize wmb and then profited by purchasing wmb assets at a low price.
we also reject the willners tangentially related argument that firrea exhaustion requirement does apply to counts,and against bank because bank allegedly never acquired an asset that passed through the fdic receivership estate.the willners state that wamu asset acceptance corporation securitized the note by depositing it into the trust prior to wmb failure,and that bank became trustee for the trust as successor in interest to bank of america bank of america became trustee after merging with lasalle bank,which was the trustee when wmb failed.accordingly,the willners argue,bank status as trustee came free and clear of the receivership estate.
the problem with this argument is that it irrelevant.firrea requires exhaustion of any claim relating to any act or omission of any depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver.d d ii.as described above,counts and are functionally pleaded against wmb conduct.so is count,which is based entirely upon allegations that wmbfa did not exist when the willners closed on the loan.firrea required that the willners exhaust these claims.
next,we consider the willners argument that counts,and could not be resolved through firrea administrative process and thus were not subject to firrea exhaustion requirement.the only reason the willners offer for why count,a claim for breach of contract with a request for damages,could not be resolved through firrea administrative process is that it a claim for relief against chase and bank for their own wrongdoing.having already rejected this argument,we turn to counts and each a request for a declaratory judgment that,inter alia,the deed of trust ca be used to foreclose on the willners house.
the willners make two arguments for why those counts could be resolved through firrea administrative process a d administrative claims process does not accommodate requests for declaratory judgments,and b the fdic could not have adjudicated count because it can not order a remedy against solvent institutions.we address them in turn.
firrea does not define the word claim,elmco,at,and we have not done so.the willners rely on that ambiguity to say that for the purposes of firrea a claim is only a request for payment from the assets of a failed bank,and thus their requests for declaratory judgments could not be resolved through firrea claims process.we do not agree.
courts interpreting d d ii have universally concluded that it bars only claims that could be brought under the administrative procedures of d,not any claim at all involving the fdic.bank of new york first millennium,cir.we join those courts,and conclude that i n firrea,the word claim is a that refers only to claims that are resolvable through the firrea administrative process.am,at.to hold otherwise would risk making d d an independent and outright bar of jurisdiction rather than a mere exhaustion requirement.hudson united bank chase manhattan bank of connecticut,cir.quotation marks omitted.armed with a working definition of the word claim,we proceed to the question of whether d administrative claims process accommodates declaratory judgment actions.firrea vast grant of authority to the fdic convinces us that it does.
the fdic,as conservator or receiver,and by operation of law,succeed s to all rights,titles,powers,and privileges of the insured depository institution.d a i.in that position,the fdic may take over the assets of and operate the insured depository institution with all the powers of the members or shareholders,the directors,and the officers of the institution and conduct all business of the institution.id.d b i.the fdic may also exercise such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry out the powers and authorities otherwise granted to it under firrea.id.d j i.courts have interpreted the scope of this broad language in applying firrea provision,which states that e xcept as provided in this section,no court may take any action,except at the request of the board of directors by regulation or order,to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the corporation as a conservator or a receiver.id.j.
in dittmer properties,plaintiffs sued a bank and sought a declaratory judgment that a loan was void,cir.subsequently,the fdic became receiver for that bank,and substituted itself as defendant.id.at.the fdic then sold the note to a bank,and moved to substitute the bank for itself in the suit.id.at.the district court dismissed the claims for declaratory relief against the bank under j.id.at.the eighth circuit affirmed,employing a test that asked whether the challenged action is within the receiver power or function,and whether the action requested would restrain or affect those powers.id.at.the court answered each question in the affirmative,noting that the challenged actions enforcing the note against the signers and the ability to sell the mortgaged property were unquestionably within the receiver duties and powers.id.at emphasis added tillman resolution tr,cir.holding that firrea provision precluded court enjoining foreclosure proceedings initiated by the resolution trust corporation because i t is abundantly clear that the resolution trust corporation is authorized to pursue foreclosure.the fdic power to enforce a note,of course,implies the power to declare that it will not do so.
accordingly,we hold that a request for a declaratory judgment is a claim within the meaning of firrea because the fdic can provide declaratory relief.accord rundgren,at stating that a request for a declaratory judgment is susceptible of resolution through firrea claims procedure westberg,at d eclaratory relief against the fdic is obtainable through the administrative process.dittmer,at fdic reviewed and denied administrative claim for declaratory and injunctive relief.thus,d d ii reference to any claim includes a request for declaratory relief.westberg,at see also hotels,cir.d eclaratory judgment actions are covered by firrea.brown resolution tr,wl,at cir.july,firrea exhaustion requirement applies to declaratory judgment actions.
our decision in elmco properties is not to the contrary.there,we considered whether the resolution trust corporation failure to mail notice of a bank receivership to the plaintiff violated that plaintiff rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.elmco,at.in a footnote,we approved the district court conclusion that although plaintiff complaint technically requested a declaratory judgment that it owned the funds and an order requiring the resolution trust corporation to refund them,it was in essence a claim for monetary relief.id.at.accordingly,we wrote,we have no trouble treating plaintiff facially declaratory and injunctive action as what it genuinely is,a claim against the assets of a failed bank.id.we did not elaborate on our conclusion beyond referencing,but not adopting the reasoning of,a third circuit case which defined claim as an action asserting a right to payment,in contrast to a mere request for declaratory judgment.id.emphasis omitted quoting union fire ins.of pittsburgh,city,cir.
to the extent that the footnote in elmco properties suggests that a claim can only be a request for payment,we view it as dicta.and,in any event,national union fire insurance company does not stand for the proposition that firrea administrative process can not resolve requests for declaratory judgments.the third circuit held there that d d was a jurisdictional bar and that the term any action seeking a determination of rights in subsection i included declaratory judgment actions,but le ft for another day the question of whether firrea requires or permits the fdic to consider claims not asserting a right to payment,such as a request for a declaratory judgment.union fire,at.in other words,the third circuit left open the question of whether d d was an independent and outright bar of jurisdiction rather than a mere exhaustion requirement.hudson united bank,at quotation marks omitted explaining national union fire insurance company.then,in hudson united bank,the third circuit held that the administrative claims procedures and the jurisdictional bar have concurrent scope,id.at,which suggests that declaratory judgment actions could be raised in the administrative forum,hotels,at explaining hudson united bank 
finally,our decision creates no conflict between the meaning of the word claim in subsections i and ii of d d.westberg,at.subsection i refers specifically to any claim or action for payment.subsection ii use of claim,however,refers broadly to any claim relating to any act or omission of the failed institution or the fdic.id.it is true that firrea is awkwardly written,hudson united bank,at,but we do not speculate on why congress chose to qualify the word claim the way it did in subsection i and then complement that subsection reach by expanding it to any action seeking a determination of rights,d d i.it suffices to say that the meaning of the word claim remains the same across the subsections a that refers only to claims that are resolvable through the firrea administrative process and that subsection ii does not include language that limits its scope to a subset of claims the way that subsection i does.
as for the willners argument that the fdic could not have adjudicated count because it can not order a remedy against solvent institutions,we have already addressed it to the extent we held above that count is functionally,if not formally,asserted against wmb rather than chase and bank.that would be the end of the story if count,like count,were a request for damages.it is undisputed that upon receiving a timely and meritorious claim for damages,the fdic can resolve it by making a payment to the claimant.but there an argument to be made that the fdic could not have adjudicated count request for a declaratory judgment,even if the willners had timely submitted it.
that argument,which the willners only partially develop,goes as follows.the willners never had a chance to seek administrative relief while the fdic held their loan,because the fdic became wmb receiver and subsequently executed the purchase and assumption agreement with chase on the same day in september.though count is based on wmb conduct,the declaration that the willners seek through it that there no right to foreclose under the deed of trust nevertheless affects chase and bank.
thus,assuming that the willners had submitted a timely and meritorious claim for the relief that count requests,the argument concludes,the fdic would have been able to resolve it because the fdic declaration as to an asset can not bind a bank after that bank has acquired the asset from the fdic.see westberg,at acknowledging but declining to resolve the issue of whether fdic declaration would bind a acquiring bank,because fdic did assign its interest in plaintiffs loan until eight months after plaintiffs filed an unrelated claim through firrea claims process and five months after plaintiffs filed suit against fdic for declaratory judgment that they had no obligation to make loan payments.
we decline to decide whether the fdic declaration would bind chase and bank.to do so,we would first have to blindly speculate about how the fdic would have resolved the willners request.we note that under the purchase and assumption agreement between the fdic and chase,liability for wmb acts and omissions stayed with the fdic.by retaining liability for the acts upon which count is based,we assume without deciding that the fdic could have resolved the willners claim in a number of different ways.
instead,we hold that by not timely submitting what is on its face a claim to the firrea claims process,the willners waived their argument about how the fdic would have resolved it.rundgren,at concluding that plaintiffs claim against chase for a declaratory judgment voiding a loan plaintiffs received from wmb,and which chase later acquired from the fdic through the purchase and assumption agreement,was susceptible of resolution through firrea administrative procedure.to hold otherwise would allow plaintiffs to circumvent firrea exhaustion requirement by declining to pursue the remedies available to them and later arguing that such remedies are ineffective.westberg,at.
we next consider the willners argument that counts and are affirmative defenses and thus fall outside the ambit of firrea exhaustion requirement.in so doing,we resolve the portion of willner pro se appeal which challenges the district court decision on subject matter jurisdiction,as willner argument hinges on characterizing counts,and as affirmative defenses.
we have acknowledged in an unpublished opinion,and reiterate now,that firrea exhaustion requirement does not encompass affirmative defenses,fed.fin.knott,wl,at cir.july,accord rundgren,at bolduc beal bank,ssb,cir.hotels,at,but we have not weighed in on what constitutes an affirmative defense for the purpose of avoiding firrea exhaustion requirement.while there is a general consensus that,by its plain terms,d d applies to claims and actions but not defenses,the circuits differ as to what counts as a defense.
the willners ask us to follow the first circuit reasoning from bolduc.there,plaintiffs sued a solvent bank which had acquired a failed bank assets from the fdic,seeking to enjoin the solvent bank from foreclosing on their property.bolduc,at.the district court affirmed a magistrate judge preliminary injunction on grounds that plaintiffs had a likelihood of prevailing at trial on claims that the failed bank obtained plaintiff signature on mortgage notes in violation of federal law,and that mutual mistake invalidated contracts made between plaintiffs and the failed bank.id.at.the solvent bank appealed,arguing that firrea required exhaustion of claims.id.at.
the first circuit rejected the bank argument and adopted an expansive definition of what counts as an affirmative defense for the purpose of avoiding firrea exhaustion requirement 
w ho happens to be the plaintiff is not controlling.the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to make persons with claims against bank funds or property submit them promptly in a single administrative forum.one alleged merely to owe the bank money is not in this class,whether the debtor asks a court for a preemptive declaration or injunction against the bank claim or merely awaits suit by the bank and then defends.
id.at.applying that rationale,the first circuit held that the plaintiffs did not need to satisfy firrea exhaustion requirement because they sought neither payment from a bank nor a determination of rights with respect to a bank asset.id.at.
we decline to follow bolduc because its reasoning is neither clear nor persuasive.rundgren,at.though firrea contains two exhaustion requirements,subsections i and ii of d d,bolduc considered only subsection i,even though the plaintiffs suit was seemingly based upon the insolvent bank acts and omissions and thus within the ambit of subsection ii.moreover,the first circuit recognized,but did nothing to resolve,the fact that a successful injunction suit by the plaintiffs could be viewed as cutting off the bank rights to property currently in the bank possession,thereby depriving the suit of its characterization as an affirmative defense.bolduc,at.
we are more persuaded by the ninth circuit approach to this issue.in rundgren,the plaintiffs argued that their lawsuit for a declaration against chase voiding a loan that they had received from wmb and which chase later acquired from the fdic under the purchase and assumption agreement was actually an affirmative defense to chase foreclosure efforts.at explaining that plaintiffs sought to void the loan based on wmb fraudulent acts.
the ninth circuit rejected that argument by construing the lawsuit as what it appeared to be on its face an independent action raising claims that provide a legal basis for enjoining a nonjudicial foreclosure.id.at.the court refused to recharacterize the plaintiffs lawsuit for legal and equitable relief and damages as one raising affirmative defenses.id.at see also am.first,lake forest park,cir.defining an affirmative defense as a response to a plaintiff claim and urging courts to look beyond the nomenclature of a request for relief to ascertain whether the remedy sought by a party is encompassed by d d.
we hold that a purported affirmative defense does not qualify as one for the purpose of avoiding firrea exhaustion requirement if,after looking beyond the nomenclature of the request for relief,the remedy sought is actually a claim within the meaning of firrea.our holding fits with and facilitates firrea requirement that a claimant submit all claims against a failed institution to the fdic before the bar date.see elmco,at.the first circuit approach in bolduc,by contrast,risks vastly expanding the universe of claims exempt from firrea exhaustion requirement,thereby undermining firrea purpose of establish ing a comprehensive scheme for efficiently administering all claims resulting from failed savings and loan institutions.brady,at.
applying this
