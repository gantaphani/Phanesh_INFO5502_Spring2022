background 
shunfu li entered the united states without documentation in june.in response to removal proceedings initiated by the immigration and naturalization service li applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.li based her claim of a fear of future persecution if returned to china on her alleged past persecution for practicing falun gong 
li application claim of past persecution 
in her initial application for relief from removal,li stated that she began practicing falun gong in in response to various health problems.by,li was gathering people to practice falun gong in a public park,and she was appointed director of a local falun gong practice station.after chinese authorities declared falun gong illegal in,li continued to practice its exercises in her home.she was doing so together with four other persons on december,when police raided her home and arrested all five persons.li asserts that she was detained for three months,during which time she claims to have been tortured.to secure li release,her husband paid yuan.upon li return to work,her employer demoted her from a managerial position to a janitorial one.a few months later,li fled to canada and then to the united states.
li hearing testimony 
an evidentiary hearing on li claims for relief from removal was held before an ij on april.as in her application,li cited her past arrest for practicing falun gong as the basis for her fear of future persecution.her testimony about this arrest was not,however,always consistent with her application account.for example,on direct examination li,who was represented by counsel,testified that when police raided her home she was practicing falun gong with more than people,tr.of hr g at,not four as reported in her application.li further testified that only three persons,including herself,were arrested.she explained that the remaining seven persons received only warnings because they were ordinary people.id.at.
on,li stated that a total of sixteen falun gong practitioners were present in her home at the time of the raid,of which three were arrested.asked to explain the apparent inconsistency with her written application,which indicated that a total of five persons counting li were practicing falun gong in petitioner home at the time of the raid,all of whom were arrested,li insisted that her application referenced sixteen practitioners and that her account was consistent 
on further,li initially hesitated when asked to explain why she did not obtain an affidavit from her husband,who remains in china,corroborating her arrest and the yuan fine paid to secure her release.eventually,she stated that her husband would submit such an affidavit if she so requested.
asked on to describe falun gong organizational structure,li testified that there were no physical headquarters,that she was assigned to her unpaid position as a station director,and that she reported to a specific individual.with the consent of the parties,the ij put into the record a dozen pages about falun gong that she had downloaded from an internet site,www.religious tolerance.org.these pages stated,inter alia,that falun gong denies being a religion,cult,or sect.certified administrative record in car,at emphasis omitted.one of falun gong spokespersons is quoted as saying the group is not involved with politics or against any government.id.at.more to the organizational point,the website reported that t here is no leader there is no paid staff or clergy.all work is done by volunteers.they do not maintain a list of members names.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
documentary evidence 
to corroborate her persecution claim,li submitted documentary evidence,including copies of warrants authorizing her arrest and the search of her home on the day of the alleged raid,a receipt for items seized in the course of the search,and a second arrest warrant purportedly issued after she fled china.this second warrant,dated june,states in part 
to all provinces,districts,directly governed municipal public security departments and bureaus.
through investigation,it been verified that li shun fu is a falungong general station as director of qingnianbu practice station.she had been vigorously involved in the activities of spreading and propagating the cult falungong she has now escaped to abroad to avoid punishment.as a result please be notified that as soon as you discover the aforesaid person,hold in custody immediately and report without any delay.
denial of relief 
the ij ruling 
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij denied li application for relief from removal,finding that she had not credibly established past persecution or feared future persecution.six factors influenced the ij adverse credibility finding inconsistencies between li sworn relief application and sworn testimony regarding the number of persons present in her home at the time of her arrest,li failure to adduce reasonably available corroborative evidence from her husband,li halting and hesitant demeanor during her hearing testimony,the vagueness of li testimony,the inconsistency between li description of falun gong organization and that reported at www.religious tolerance.org,and the lack of authentication for the corroborative official documents submitted by li.
the bia affirmance 
li appealed the ij adverse credibility finding to the bia.the brief submitted by counsel to the board on li behalf contains just over two pages of argument.nowhere therein does li mention,much less challenge,the identified inconsistencies between her relief application and her hearing testimony regarding the circumstances of her past arrest.nor does the brief fault the ij for rejecting li credibility based on her unconvincing demeanor and failure to adduce reasonably available corroborative evidence from her husband.instead,li administrative appeal argued that the ij erred in finding her not to be credible based on the vagueness of her testimony,contradictory website information about falun gong,and the lack of authentication for corroborative documentary evidence.
the bia summarily rejected these arguments,prompting this petition for review.
