background 
we recount the relevant facts from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,franceschi.see hodgens dynamics,cir.franceschi,a medical doctor,was the associate chief of staff in the ambulatory care service of the san juan va medical center vamc.in,he was passed over for promotion to the position of vamc chief of staff by sandra,a colleague who had been associate chief of staff in another department.
gracia soon discovered that the vamc had numerous performance deficiencies and that many of the problems fell within franceschi area of responsibility.over the course of and,gracia engaged in a continuous dialogue with franceschi about how to remedy these problems.she repeatedly warned him that if he failed to improve his unit,his own job performance ratings might suffer.gracia also drew franceschi attention to his many alleged violations of hospital unexcused absences,the failure to follow established procedures,and the use of foul language in meetings and in the admonished him to correct his behavior or suffer the consequences.
there were also suspicions that franceschi was unfairly favoring a female staff member with whom he was involved romantically.the vamc equal employment opportunity eeo officer,marta vázquez,met with franceschi on april,to discuss this relationship franceschi asserts that he took this opportunity to complain to vázquez that gracia had subjected him to harassment through her abusive critiques of his performance.franceschi sent a memo to the vamc director on august,complaining that gracia had created an intolerable work atmosphere with her style and that he felt harassed,pursued and frustrated.on march,franceschi was given a low satisfactory overall job performance rating in an evaluation report covering the period from january,to january,this rating differed sharply from his prior evaluation of high satisfactory.
franceschi filed a formal administrative charge with the eeoc on march,alleging that he had been the victim of constant harassment,including unfavorable evaluations,at the hands of gracia the eeoc organized the complaint into two separate claims first,that gracia had subjected franceschi to a pattern of harassment motivated by his male gender claim a and second,that gracia had accorded him unfavorable treatment by rating his performance lower than it had been rated in previous years claim b.on june,the eeoc sent franceschi a letter informing him that it had dismissed claim a because he had failed to respond to the eeoc requests that he specify the dates on which the alleged instances of harassment occurred.it accepted claim b,however,and informed franceschi that someone would be assigned to investigate this claim an investigator was assigned on july.
in the meantime,gracia sent several memos to franceschi between april and june,telling him that his performance was still too low and needed to improve.franceschi was again evaluated on july,and this time received a lower overall score of unsatisfactory.gracia informed franceschi that,as a result of the poor score and in accordance with va regulations,he would be demoted to the position of staff physician.the demotion took effect on july.
franceschi chose not to wait for the eeoc process to run its course.on july,he filed suit in federal district court and informed the eeoc that he had done so in a letter dated july.in his complaint and arguments before the district court,franceschi made three claims the first two were largely parallel to claims a and b,respectively,of his eeoc complaint his third claim was that the poor performance evaluation of march,and the even poorer evaluation of july,and consequent demotion,constituted retaliation for having made contact with the eeoc in january and for filing the formal administrative charge on march.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of franceschi claims.with respect to the hostile work environment and discrimination claims,it found that franceschi had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that these claims failed on the merits in any event.on the retaliation claim,the district court found that franceschi had failed to establish a causal connection between his filing of the eeoc charge and the poor evaluations.franceschi appealed.

title vii and exhaustion of administrative remedies 
title vii is a vehicle through which an individual may seek recovery for employment discrimination on the grounds of race,color,religion,gender,or national origin.see jorge rumsfeld,cir.nevertheless,j udicial recourse under title vii is not a remedy of first resort.id.quoting potter,cir.before an employee may sue in federal court on a title vii claim,he must first exhaust administrative remedies.see love pullman,d.
the title vii administrative process begins with the filing of an administrative charge before the eeoc.see jorge,at citing c the employee may sue in federal court only if the eeoc dismisses the administrative charge,or if it does not bring civil suit or enter into a conciliation agreement within days of the filing of the administrative charge.f.in either case,the eeoc must send the employee notice,in the form of what is known as a letter see jorge,at citing f clockedile dep t of,cir see also equal employment opportunity comm holmes,cir right to sue letter refers to the notification required by f as a necessary condition for a private suit.upon receiving such notice,the employee has ninety days to sue in federal court.f see also williams little rock mun.water works,cir.with limited exceptions,such as that described below regarding claims of retaliation for filing an administrative charge,the failure to exhaust this administrative process bars the courthouse door.bonilla muebles álvarez,cir.
franceschi filed his formal administrative charge on march,he filed his complaint in the district court days later on july.administrative remedies could not be considered to have been exhausted,however,until the eeoc issued franceschi a letter.see f.the eeoc sent him a letter on june,stating that it had dismissed one of the claims in the administrative a,which alleged that it had accepted claim b,which alleged discrimination through poor job performance ratings.in accordance with applicable federal regulations,the eeoc informed franceschi that,because claim b had been accepted for processing and investigation,the dismissal of claim a did not constitute final action on the administrative charge as a whole,and that he could not avail himself of the agency appeal procedures until final action had been taken.see b.the eeoc letter does not explicitly tell franceschi that he was prohibited from suing in federal court on claim a until final action had been taken on the whole complaint,but such a prohibition is clearly contemplated in the applicable regulations.see id.a,b.
the eeoc was not given the opportunity to take final action on the administrative charge.it had only just started to investigate claim b when franceschi jumped the gun by filing suit.a
