petitioner,senly sugiarto,a practicing christian of indonesian nationality,seeks review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the denial by the immigration judge ij of her applications for asylum,withholding of removal under b of the immigration and nationality act ina,and relief under the convention against torture cat.sugiarto advances no argument on appeal with respect to her withholding of removal or cat claims,and as a result,these claims are waived.see united states zannino,cir.sugiarto does argue that the bia denial of her asylum claim,which was based on past persecution and a fear of future persecution on account of her christian religion,was not supported by substantial evidence.after careful consideration,finding the bia decision adequately supported,we deny the instant petition for review.
background 
petitioner,sugiarto,is a native and citizen of indonesia,as is her husband,jemmy korompis,and their daughter,jeisy sugiarto,was raised as a protestant christian in tinoor,manado,where she was a member of the local church and the treasurer of the church women group.she reports that the demographics of manado have shifted in recent years while the majority used to be christian,of residents are now muslim.sugiarto asserted that she had problems in indonesia on account of her identity as a christian,and attributed the following incidents to her religious status.
first,sugiarto describes an incident that occurred on september,while she was employed as the treasurer of a company called pi pelni.sugiarto was traveling with a security guard and a driver to a bank to pick up money for her company.at the bank,sugiarto withdrew,which she held in her lap while returning to the office.while en route to her office,two men on a motorcycle blocked the road and broke the back window of the car,attempting to force open the back door near where sugiarto was sitting.although the men were unable to steal the money,sugiarto arms were cut from the broken glass,causing her to seek medical treatment at the hospital.the petitioner asserts that these men were members of a muslim terrorist group because that was the kind of behavior these groups engaged in.although sugiarto had a current visitor visa when this incident occurred,she decided to remain in indonesia because she had a good job.
second,sugiarto recounts an incident that took place on december.on that day sugiarto and her family were forced to rush out of a mall in manado when a bomb threat warning was issued.she reports that it was very difficult to breathe amidst the fleeing crowds.neither sugiarto nor her husband or daughter required medical treatment after the incident.sugiarto did not know specifically who caused the bomb threat,but reasoned that,because manado is muslim and this event took place shortly before christmas,those responsible were likely muslim.
sugiarto reported that she felt threatened as a christian minority living in manado due to both of these events and also because of bombings of houses,churches and various public places that were taking place in her surrounding area.she explained that these attacks often targeted church leaders and others with special duties in the church.her fear of religious violence sometimes prevented her from attending church.sugiarto also explained that her daughter,jeisy,who was born with a leg condition that causes her to limp,suffered ridicule and harassment by her classmates in indonesia because of her condition.
sugiarto and jeisy arrived in the united states on january,on a visitor visa.sugiarto husband,korompis,arrived in june of that year,also on a visitor visa.the petitioner explains that her daughter has felt more comfortable with herself since coming to the united states.doctors in both indonesia and the united states have indicated that jeisy can undergo surgery once her bones develop further,which will enable her to walk normally.since arriving in the united states,petitioner family has joined and regularly attended services at the naturia presbyterian church in rochester,new hampshire,where,in march,sugiarto was elected deacon.the record contains evidence documenting her active participation in the church.
sugiarto reported that she could not go back to indonesia out of fear of religious violence.she explained that since her departure from indonesia,two of her siblings have also left indonesia and moved to korea out of fear of religious persecution.some of her family members who remain in indonesia no longer attend church because they are afraid.she has submitted,on the record,country reports and articles,including state department religious freedom reports,documenting violence in indonesia and acts of terrorism against christians by extremist groups.
procedural history 
petitioner and her family remained in the united states without legal status after the expiration of their visitor visas.on january,sugiarto filed a timely form application for asylum,accompanied by applications for withholding of removal,protection under the cat,and voluntary departure.sugiarto listed korompis and jeisy as beneficiaries on her application.the department of homeland security dhs placed the petitioner and her family in removal proceedings on february.petitioner conceded removability.
on may,the ij held a hearing on the merits of sugiarto application.in an oral decision issued that day,the ij found that petitioner testified credibly but that her testimony as to the attempted robbery and the bomb threat in indonesia failed to establish harm sufficiently severe as to rise to the level of past persecution.moreover,the ij found that nothing in the record established a nexus between these incidents and petitioner status as a christian.the ij further found that petitioner failed to show a fear of future persecution in that petitioner has not shown that she and her family were specifically singled out on account of their religion,nor that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against christians in indonesia.the ij thus denied the petitioner applications for asylum,withholding,and cat relief,but granted voluntary departure to sugiarto and jeisy 
sugiarto timely appealed to the bia,which,in an order issued october,affirmed the ij reasoning and decision,and dismissed the appeal.this petition for review followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court has appellate jurisdiction over petitions for judicial review from the bia under.review of legal rulings is de novo but is deferential as to findings of fact and the determination as to whether the facts support a claim of persecution.jorgji mukasey,cir.we review determinations under a substantial evidence standard,which requires that we must affirm provided that the bia decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.bocova gonzáles,cir quoting ins,d see also b b.unless the record compels a contrary conclusion,evidence in the record supporting a conclusion contrary to that reached by the bia is not enough to upset the agency determination.see sompotan mukasey,cir quoting lópez de hincapié gonzáles,cir.in other words,we must uphold the bia determination unless the record points unerringly in the opposite direction.hincapié,at quoting laurent ashcroft,cir.
usually,this court confines its review to the bia order that is being challenged by the petitioner.lumataw holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,when as here,the bia adopts the decision of the ij,and provides some analysis of its own,the court reviews both decisions.id.
applicable law 
to establish eligibility for asylum,an alien must prove either past persecution,which gives rise to an inference of future persecution,or establish a well founded fear of future persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.lumataw,at internal quotation marks omitted see also a a,b b i b.
if an applicant establishes past persecution,there is a presumption of a fear of future persecution,and the burden shifts to the government to rebut this presumption.b see also jorgji,at.but even if the applicant can not establish past persecution,she can nevertheless establish eligibility for asylum based on a fear of future persecution based on a protected ground.b.an applicant has a fear of persecution in her country if she can establish that her fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable,meaning that a reasonable person in the applicant circumstances would fear persecution.holder,cir see also b.the regulations further provide that 
i n evaluating whether the applicant has sustained the burden of proving that he or she has a fear of persecution,the ij shall not require the applicant to provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution if t he applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion and the applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in,and identification with,such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is reasonable.
finally,to establish a fear of future persecution an asylum applicant need not show that return to his home country will probably or more likely than not result in persecution.ins,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.it is enough that persecution on account of one of the five aforementioned protected grounds is a reasonable possibility.id.at.see also pan gonzáles,cir.reasonable possibility has been defined to include,in some circumstances,even a ten percent possibility of future persecution.see,at.
petition for review 
past persecution 
sugiarto argues that the record compels the conclusion that she suffered past persecution in indonesia on account of her christian religion,and is thus entitled to a presumption of well founded fear of future persecution.as evidence of past persecution,sugiarto points to her credible testimony regarding the attempted robbery and the bomb threat at the mall in manado,both of which she claims were directed against her by extremist groups.the ij and bia found that these experiences did not amount to past persecution both because the harm she experienced did not rise to the level of persecution as that term is defined for immigration purposes and because sugiarto failed to establish that these incidents bore a nexus to a protected ground.
in order to establish past persecution,sugiarto must produce convincing evidence of a causal connection between the harm she endured and a statutorily protected ground,in this case,her religion.amouri holder,cir see also,at.she must show that her protected religious status was at least one central reason for why she was harmed.b b i.based on our review of the record,we conclude that the bia finding that sugiarto failed to establish the requisite nexus between the obviously traumatic incidents she recounts and her status as a christian was supported by substantial evidence on the record.
as for the robbery,sugiarto admits not knowing who attacked the car.although we have held that a petitioner who was attacked was not required to identify her antagonists with absolute certainty,in order to establish nexus,she was required,in the absence of a positive identification,to furnish some credible evidence of the motivation underlying the threats.hincapié,at denying petition for review where petitioner,a colombian woman,had not proffered sufficient evidence that the threats she received from men she assumed to be paramilitaries were actually paramilitaries rather than common criminals.sugiarto sole basis for concluding that the perpetrators of the attack were islamic terrorists,rather than common thieves,was her belief that christians would have done such a thing and that,based on her internet research,an terrorist group was present in the area.these statements reflect little more than petitioner conjecture about the identity of her attackers,which,even if established rather than assumed,would not compel a conclusion that the attack was religiously motivated.see amouri,at concluding that the mere fact that extortionists were associated with an extremist group does not compel a conclusion that extortion was politically motivated,as fanaticism and a love of money are not mutually exclusive.sugiarto testimony was thus reasonably found insufficient to meet petitioner burden of establishing a causal nexus between the robbery and her religion.
as for the incident involving the bomb threat in the mall in manado,petitioner argues that her credible testimony that extremist groups were responsible for the attack compels a finding of past persecution.but no matter how credible a belief petitioner may hold about the perpetrator motives,she must nevertheless provide some objective basis for that belief in order to meet her burden.see akinfolarin gonzáles,cir see also hincapié,at explaining that an alien must do more than merely express a belief that incidents were due to a statutorily protected ground in order to establish a proper nexus.beyond noting that the incident occurred a few weeks prior to christmas,sugiarto offered no objective support for her belief that the bomb threat was perpetuated by terrorists targeting christians.moreover,as the bia pointed out,given sugiarto testimony that the mall was located in a town that is muslim,the contention that this bomb threat in a public place was motivated by a desire to target christians is even less persuasive.
we thus find that the bia conclusion that sugiarto failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the incidents she relies on to establish past persecution bore a nexus to a protected ground is amply supported by the record 
fear of future persecution 
even absent past persecution,sugiarto contends that the record compels the conclusion that she is entitled to asylum based on a fear of future persecution.as part of her argument,she urges us to analyze her fear claim through the lens of the ninth circuit disfavored group analysis.see,sael ashcroft,cir explaining that an asylum applicant can establish fear of future persecution by prov ing she is a member of a disfavored group coupled with a showing that she,in particular,is likely to be targeted as a member of that group.in doing so,petitioner asks us to revisit our decision in kho keisler,cir,rejecting the ninth circuit approach,in light of the ninth circuit recent clarification of that standard.see wakkary holder,cir.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the agency decision denying sugiarto claim for asylum on the basis of fear of future persecution was supported by substantial evidence,and thus,we do not disturb that decision.
as explained infra,fear has both a subjective and an objective component.the objective component is an inquiry into whether a reasonable person in the applicant circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground,at quoting romilus ashcroft,cir,which rests on whether persecution on such ground is a reasonable possibility.see,at.
to this effect,the regulations provide that an applicant need not provide evidence of a reasonable possibility of being singled out individually for persecution in the event that the applicant establishes a pattern or practice in her country of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of a protected ground.b iii a see also pieterson ashcroft,cir.our case law has narrowly defined pattern or practice to encompass only the systematic or pervasive persecution of a particular group based on a protected ground,rather than generalized civil conflict or a pattern of discrimination.see,banturino holder,cir see also in re,i,bia quoting lie ashcroft,cir for the proposition that pattern or practice means persecution of a group that is systemic,pervasive,or organized.the idea behind the pattern or practice exception to the individualized proof requirement is that,where the persecution of a group on the basis of a protected ground is sufficiently widespread,a reasonable possibility of persecution is evident and evidence
