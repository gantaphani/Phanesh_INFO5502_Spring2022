this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of joanne barnhart,commissioner of the social security administration ssa,and against peter clifford clifford on his employment discrimination claims.clifford contests the district court determination that he failed to generate a triable issue that ssa decision not to hire him for certain positions was motivated by discriminatory animus.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
from july to december,clifford worked for ssa as a social insurance representative,a quality review specialist,a supervisory quality review specialist,a manager of quality assurance,and a field representative.in december,however,clifford left ssa on disability retirement due to a neurological disease that limited his ability to perform repetitive hand functions,such as computer keyboarding.
despite his retirement,in and,clifford applied for three positions within public affairs specialist mpas,management support specialist mss,and social insurance specialist sis.however,he was not selected for any of these positions.believing that his was due to either age or disability discrimination,clifford filed a number of administrative equal employment opportunity eeo claims with ssa.these claims were denied.
on november,clifford filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine,alleging discrimination based on age and disability pursuant to the age discrimination and employment act of,and the rehabilitation act of,specifically,clifford alleged that those who were selected for the three jobs he desired were substantially younger than him and not disabled.clifford alleged that ssa selecting officials made their decisions because the selectees had current,knowledge or experience.however,according to clifford,current knowledge or experience was not included as a condition or criterion in the vacancy announcements for the positions.clifford alleged that the only reason he lacked current knowledge and experience was his disability retirement from ssa in december.however,given his long history of ssa employment,clifford asserted that the agency could have provided him with training to accommodate his lack of current knowledge and experience.on that basis,clifford claimed that his amounted to age and disability discrimination.
on january,ssa filed an answer that denied clifford discrimination allegations.the same day,the agency filed a motion for summary judgment based on the affidavits generated in the eeo administrative process from the two officials at ssa who were responsible for hiring employees for the positions clifford desired,patricia biggers biggers and lawrence dubois dubois collectively selecting officials the eeo affidavits detailed the selection process for the three positions for which clifford applied.dubois and biggers discussed the factors they were looking for in selecting people for the example,an awareness of current programs and policies,previous service,technical qualifications,the neatness and accuracy of application packages,and reasons for applying for the job.they also discussed the number of applicants and the selection process as a whole.
on february,clifford opposed ssa motion for summary judgment on the grounds that discovery was necessary to determine whether ssa decisions were motivated by discriminatory animus.pursuant to.f,clifford attorney proffered an affidavit that discovery was needed regarding whether ssa procedures,policies,and programs changed dramatically between the time clifford left ssa and applied for the three positions what,if any,training clifford would need to assume any of the positions and the credibility of the selecting officials.clifford also included excerpts from the eeo investigative report,including an unsworn letter from current ssa employee norman linden linden regarding his view that ssa should have hired clifford.
on august,the district court entered an order denying ssa motion for summary judgment without prejudice to its being refiled after discovery.the court concluded that clifford affidavit satisfied the requirements of.f and that the court would be acting too hastily if it were to rule on summary judgment without the benefit of discovery.
both parties thereupon continued with discovery,during which a number of additional depositions were taken including those of clifford,biggers,dubois,and linden.in these depositions,three important facts relevant to this appeal were revealed.first,with limited exception,ssa had a practice of using internal merit promotions to fill higher level positions.second,selecting officials were supposed to choose a candidate from the best qualified list,made up by human resources specialists using a scoring system.scores,however,were not provided to the selecting officials and were not used to make hiring decisions.third,selecting officials valued current knowledge and experience in potential employees,because things are changing regularly at ssa.during the course of these additional depositions,clifford abandoned his age discrimination claim.
on march,after the close of discovery,ssa again moved for summary judgment,based on the same eeo affidavits from dubois and biggers that formed the basis of its summary judgment motion.ssa explained in its motion 
the complaint asserts discrimination complaint.in this case,however,the social security administration has proffered legitimate,reasons for clifford in each of the three positions at issue.with respect to all three positions,the social security administration was seeking to hire someone with current experience who could begin the job immediately without the need for training or preparation.those criteria were important because the social security administration systems and procedures had changed significantly since the time clifford was last employed in.the selecting officials exercised their judgment and decided that the other applicants were superior to clifford.
on april,clifford opposed this summary judgment motion with three primary arguments.first,he the first ssa was liable for disparate impact discrimination on the grounds that ssa relied on a facially neutral employment practice that resulted in a disproportionately negative impact on a protected group.according to clifford,b ecause the ssa virtually always fills such higher grade positions through internal promotion,it systematically excludes qualified employees,such as the plaintiff,from employment opportunities for which they are qualified.second,clifford for the first ssa was liable for making prohibited inquiries and disclosures regarding his disability,contrary to d.although clifford had affirmatively applied for the ssa positions under the permissive hiring authority for disabled individuals known as schedule a,he nevertheless argued that ssa violated by informing the selecting officials that he was eligible for hire under schedule third,clifford argued that ssa selecting officials improperly relied on his lack of current ssa experience and ignored the fact that he received high scores in the round that was used to generate the best qualified list.
on may,ssa replied to each argument.first,ssa argued that clifford new disparate impact allegation was procedurally barred because clifford failed to assert it at the eeo level,in his federal court complaint,or in response to ssa motion for summary judgment.second,ssa argued that clifford new statutory claim was not only procedurally barred,but that it misconstrued the meaning of d b,which actually authorizes federal agencies such as ssa to inform selecting officials that a candidate is eligible for hire under schedule third,ssa pointed out that clifford had still failed to offer any evidence of discriminatory animus on account of disability.
on june,the magistrate judge to whom the case had been referred issued a decision recommending summary judgment in favor of ssa because clifford failed to exhaust his administrative remedies or otherwise give notice of any disparate impact claim clifford likewise failed to properly raise any d claim,but even if he had,there was no evidence to support a violation and ssa hiring decisions were based on legitimate reasons about which clifford failed to generate a triable issue of discriminatory animus,clifford failed to show that he was the victim of disparate treatment.
on august,the district court affirmed the magistrate judge recommended decision and granted ssa motion for summary judgment.on august,the district court entered final judgment in favor of ssa.
in this appeal,clifford is not contesting the district court rejection of his claims of disability discrimination based on disparate impact or prohibited inquiries and disclosures.clifford limits his appeal to his claim of disability discrimination based on disparate treatment.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews the decision of the district court to grant summary judgment de novo,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a factual issue is genuine if it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party and,therefore,requires the finder of fact to make a choice between the parties differing versions of the truth at trial.material facts are those that possess the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.depoutot raffaelly,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d.in determining whether that burden is met,a court must view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences in its favor.nicolo philip morris,cir.once the moving party has made a preliminary showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists,the nonmovant must produce specific facts,in suitable evidentiary form,to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.triangle trading robroy,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also.e.a s to any essential factual element of its claim on which the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial,its failure to come forward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment to the moving party.in re spigel,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in a recent case,quiñones buick,cir,we discussed the framework applicable to this case 
e mployment discrimination cases alleging disparate treatment ordinarily proceed under the,framework outlined in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and further explained in texas dep t of community affairs burdine,d,mary honor ctr.hicks,d,and reeves sanderson plumbing,d.first,the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case of discrimination.the burden then shifts to the defendant to present a legitimate,reason,sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it discriminated against the employee,for the employment decision.finally,the burden is placed on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the reason is mere pretext and that the real reason was discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at,d see also mary honor,at,d.
quiñones,at.
in this case,ssa motion for summary judgment did not specifically challenge clifford ability to establish the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination regarding his.those elements are that clifford is a member of a protected class that clifford applied for an open position with ssa that clifford was not selected and that the employer hired another individual with similar qualifications.see gu boston police dep t,cir.ssa motion argued instead that its hiring decisions were based on legitimate,reasons.with this argument,any presumption of discrimination was dispelled,and the burden was on clifford to generate a material issue that disability discrimination was a determinative factor in the hiring decisions.the district court,however,found that clifford failed to generate a triable issue that his was motivated by discriminatory animus.as a result,it granted summary judgment in favor of ssa.in this appeal,clifford contests this decision by the district court,contending that he did in fact generate a genuine issue of material fact that disability discrimination was a determinative factor in ssa hiring decisions.he offers before us six separate arguments as to how he satisfied his burden.we address each in turn.
the use of an illegitimate rationale 
clifford first argument relates to one of the reasons proffered by ssa for his,the fact that he did not have current knowledge or experience.he contends that ssa use of such a reason is illegitimate.he states that current knowledge and experience were not necessary for performing the jobs at issue,and it is unlawful for a federal agency to use standards or criteria which are not and consistent with business necessity and which have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability.see.that current knowledge and experience were not and consistent with business necessity is evident from the fact that such criteria were not included in ssa vacancy announcements.
we reject this argument.we think that the requirements of current knowledge and experience were included in the vacancy announcements,albeit implicitly.each vacancy announcement expressly limited the area of consideration to ssa employees regionwide and those already serving under schedule a,which by definition limited consideration to current employees.such employees,simply by virtue of their current positions at ssa,had the required current knowledge and experience.thus,there was no need to explicitly list current knowledge and experience in the vacancy announcements.by limiting the open positions to current employees,ssa in effect made current knowledge and experience requirements for the jobs.it was entirely proper then for biggers and dubois,the two selecting officials for the positions clifford desired,to consider whether clifford did in fact possess the necessary current knowledge and experience.
even if current knowledge or experience were not included in the vacancy announcements,ssa selecting officials were not bound to make hiring decisions based on the criteria and qualifications set forth in those announcements.the selecting officials were permitted to take into account other factors that they thought would be relevant to the advertised positions.indeed,we think it would be nonsensical to conceive of the vacancy announcements as an exhaustive list of each and every factor that the selecting officials would take into consideration.if the selecting officials were presented with two applicants who both met all of the listed criteria for a given position,the selecting officials would still have to make a decision in the end by relying on other,unspecified criteria.that selecting officials rely on such unspecified criteria does not mean that they are discriminating against the applicant who ultimately proves unsuccessful.thus,in this case,biggers and dubois would have been entirely within their rights had they evaluated applicants current knowledge and experience despite the absence of such requirements in the vacancy announcements.
moreover,the consideration of applicants current knowledge and experience was not something that biggers and dubois snatched out of thin air.such criteria were clearly and consistent with business necessity.both biggers and dubois noted that social security programs change often.as a result,they wanted to ensure that the applicants they selected were aware of current programs,policies,systems,and services,and not programs,policies,systems,and services that had been in effect in years past.they also wanted to make sure that the selectees had current knowledge and experience because no training programs would be provided,and little preparation time would be provided to the selectees to help them become accustomed to their new positions.
this is not a case in which,for example,ssa told clifford that he was not hired because he did not wear a purple sweater to the interview.such a proffered reason by ssa could certainly be seen as pretext masking discrimination,as such a requirement would have no obvious connection to clifford ability to do his job or to ssa ability to function as an effective organization.clifford current knowledge and experience,by contrast,are clearly relevant to his ability to work in the positions he desired,and we do not see how the use of such factors in determining clifford constitutes an attempt by ssa to disguise discrimination.
scope of clifford current knowledge and experience 
clifford second argument is related to his first.he contends that if current knowledge and experience were indeed requirements for the positions he sought,the knowledge and experience that he possessed were more than sufficient.to demonstrate that he did possess the necessary current knowledge and experience,clifford points to his high scores in the scheme utilized by human resource specialists at ssa to numerically rank applicants for a place on ssa best qualified list.
we,however,think that these scores are of limited utility.the scores were compiled by human resources specialists solely to compile the best qualified list and were based solely on the representations contained in each applicant application papers.
in macdonald cohen,cir,we held that t here is nothing suspicious about a selecting official deciding that although a plaintiff was qualified at the screening stage,a close look at his qualifications at the selection stage did not justify his promotion.id.at.dubois himself noted that his own closer look at clifford qualifications,going beyond the numbers to which,in any event,he was not privy,was a decisive factor in his decision to bypass clifford in the selection process.he explained 
i believed that clifford lacked the current knowledge and experience needed.i do not recall if it was on his application or not,but i was aware that clifford has been representing ssa claimants at hearings.however,this is an activity with limited scope and does not entail knowledge of the full range of operations in ssa field offices.the mpas position requires knowledge of the disability,retirement and supplemental security income programs our service delivery methodologies,our systems issues.clifford advocacy activity had a much narrower focus.
thus,the high scores assigned to clifford during the initial screening process do little to show that clifford possessed the current knowledge and experience required of applicants.accordingly,clifford has failed to show that ssa disregard of these scores mandates an inference of discrimination.
relative qualifications 
third,clifford argues that he was more qualified than the selectees in many significant ways.this argument likewise proves unavailing.even if clifford was more qualified than the selectees in certain ways,ssa was entitled to assess each applicant and decide which applicant presented the best application as a whole.although one applicant may have had impressive credentials in one specific area,he may have turned out to be deficient in another area.it was ssa prerogative to hire the applicant who presented the best combination of skills.in the past,we have held that it is not the role of the court to the business decisions of an employer,imposing our subjective judgments of which person would best fulfill the responsibilities of a certain job.rossy roche,cir.
in the comments of dubois,we see that it was the hope of finding the candidate that guided him during the selection process.after mentioning the particular deficiencies of clifford application,cited above,dubois goes on to state the following about robert clark,his selectee for the mpas position 
clark,the selectee,has had primary responsibility for the public affairs program in the portland service area for many years.he is an extraordinarily astute technician who was often called upon by his peers and by management as a technical resource for policy and systems issues.he is a former supervisor who brings the management point of view and flexibility to this position.in short,i considered him the perfect candidate.
in other words,clark presented a combination of skills that was attractive to dubois.clark had technical ability,supervisory experience,and an extensive background in the subject area.thus,the fact that clifford may have excelled in certain areas is insufficient to compel us to find that he was entitled to the job,especially when there were other candidates such as clark,who presented a more extensive set of credentials.
biggers explanations 
in his fourth argument,clifford focuses on the particular explanations proffered by biggers as to why she did not select clifford for the sis position.he argues that she was inconsistent in a number of ways.first,he points to her testimony in her eeo declaration and her deposition.in the former,she stated that clifford did not have the requisite experience with current automated and programmatic systems.in the latter,however,when asked if she eliminated clifford from consideration because of his lack of current knowledge and experience,she replied,not true entirely.he was eliminated before we got to that point.as a result,clifford states that biggers was inconsistent in considering his knowledge and experience.
we,however,do not find any inconsistency.although she had said in her eeo declaration that clifford did not have current knowledge and experience,she did not indicate that that particular deficiency was the decisive factor that eliminated him from her consideration.in her deposition testimony,she indicated that clifford lack of current knowledge and experience had nothing to do with her rejection of clifford application.she noted that clifford had been eliminated from consideration before any consideration had been given to clifford current knowledge and experience.
second,clifford argues that biggers exalted form over substance when considering his application.in making this argument,clifford is referring to biggers statement that one of the reasons she did not select clifford for the sis position was the fact that his application was messy and filled with.clifford contends that to biggers,the appearance of the clifford eyes,a matter of form was an essential factor in selecting an employee,even more so than one past experience working for ssa.he also argues that when evaluating his form,biggers did not make any allowance for the fact that clifford disability affected his handwriting.
we reject both of these claims.regarding clifford argument about biggers elevating form over substance,we think that the appearance of one application is as much about substance as form.the neat appearance of an application reflects the substantive ability of a potential employee to put his best foot forward on behalf of an organization.clifford other argument is likewise without merit.clifford argues that a lthough biggers was aware of clifford disability,she did not make any accommodation for the fact that clifford disability affected his handwriting.we do not see,however,how biggers could have made any such accommodation,as we can find no evidence that biggers knew that clifford had a disability that affected his handwriting in particular.see assocs.of,cir noting that a n employer need not provide accommodations where it does not know an employee has a disability.
third,clifford contests biggers ability to accurately assess what experience was needed for the job,as she did not have the technical background necessary to properly assess applicants for the position.regardless of whether biggers did in fact have the technical background clifford claims was required,she was the one assigned by ssa officials to evaluate the applicants for the sis position.if she was in fact deficient in certain technical proposition we are not at all certain she was unable to assess the applicants respective technical abilities in the evaluation process,this was likely true of her evaluation of all applicants,and not just clifford.thus,we fail to see how clifford can prove discrimination by pointing to potential deficiencies in biggers background.
in his final iteration of this particular argument,clifford contends that in biggers eyes,there was just one factor that distinguished him from the other applicants his disability.he states that beca
