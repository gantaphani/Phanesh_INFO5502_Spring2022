shell offshore,shell sued the department of the interior interior under the citizen suit provisions of the outer continental shelf lands act,et b ocsla,the administrative procedure act,et.apa,and the declaratory judgment act,challenging interior denial of shell request to use its federal energy regulatory commission ferc tariff rate as the cost of transporting crude oil produced from certain of shell offshore oil and gas leases for purposes of calculating shell royalty payments due interior.the district court granted shell summary judgment motion in part,holding that interior decision denying the use of the tariff rate was arbitrary and capricious,and was a new substantive rule that required notice and comment under the apa.we agree with the district court that interior decision was in essence the application of a new substantive rule that required notice and comment before implementation.we hold that shell was entitled to use the ferc tariff rate to calculate transportation costs for all of the oil at issue in this case which it transported through the auger pipeline,and was therefore entitled to have its motion for summary judgment granted in full.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for entry of appropriate judgment consistent herewith.
facts and proceedings below 
shell is the lessee in numerous federal leases for the production of crude oil and gas located offshore louisiana within the auger unit on the outer continental shelf ocs these leases were issued by interior through its,the minerals management service mms,under the authority of the ocsla,et.this dispute involves shell royalty payments on crude oil produced from offshore leases comprising shell auger unit.under the ocsla and the terms of the leases,shell is required to pay royalties as a specified percentage of the value of the production saved,removed,or sold from the lease.a a.interior is responsible for administering leases on the ocs,and promulgates regulations governing royalty collection and establishing the value of production on which lessees pay royalties.
under the regulations in effect at the time,interior allowed lessees to deduct transportation costs from the value on which they calculated royalty payments.those regulations distinguished between transportation costs incurred under agreements with common carriers and transportation costs,such as when a lessee transports the oil itself or via a pipeline owned by an affiliate of the lessee.see a b.
shell began producing from the auger unit in april.the auger pipeline transports crude oil from the auger unit to a series of other pipelines that begins on the ocs,crosses onshore into louisiana,and eventually reaches other states.the district court found,and interior does not dispute,that some a substantial the oil produced in the auger unit travels in a continuous stream to illinois for refining.the oil that reaches illinois travels first through the auger pipeline and then,via several pipeline systems,to james,louisiana,and from there through the pipeline system to the wood river refinery in illinois.the auger pipeline is owned by a shell affiliate.the parties agree that the transport of shell oil through the auger pipeline was a transaction,and that therefore the calculation of auger pipeline transport costs shell could permissibly deduct from its royalty payments was governed by b.under section b,lessees must demonstrate their actual costs of transport for deduction from their royalty payments due interior,and the regulation provides detailed instructions for such calculations.under section b,however,lessees are granted an exception from the requirement of showing actual costs of transport if the lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved by the ferc.id.under this exception,the lessee can use the ferc tariff rate to calculate their transportation cost deductions from royalty payments if that tariff has been approved by the ferc.id 
interior points to several recent ferc opinions,commencing in,that,it argues,cast ferc jurisdiction over pipelines on the ocs into some doubt it is and was ferc practice to automatically accept all filed tariffs unless a timely protest is filed.prior to,mms the of interior responsible for administering the ocs leases accepted tariffs that were filed with ferc in determining whether a lessee qualified for an exception under b.from until some point in or mms accepted as approved by ferc most tariffs that were simply filed with ferc,and did not require producers to petition ferc for a determination of jurisdiction.by,however,interior was disallowing use of the tariff exception for ocs lessees that it felt might no longer be within ferc jurisdiction.
shell filed a tariff with ferc on march,which was unprotested,and was accepted and published by ferc on april.in a letter dated july,shell requested that the mms confirm that,in valuing shell auger unit crude oil production for royalty purposes,shell was entitled to deduct as transportation costs the tariff rate accepted by ferc for the auger pipeline.in an order dated november,the mms denied shell request,and shell appealed the order.several administrative appeals followed,but in its final decision on august,interior stated that shell request was being denied because shell had failed to petition ferc and receive from ferc a determination affirmatively stating that ferc possessed jurisdiction over the auger pipeline.
shell then filed the instant lawsuit.thereafter,on december,mms sent a dear payor letter to shell stating that due to uncertainty concerning ferc jurisdiction over pipelines on the ocs,lessees must petition ferc and receive from ferc a determination affirmatively stating that it has jurisdiction before mms will allow the lessee to use the ferc tariff to calculate transportation costs for the purposes of royalty calculations.similar letters were sent to other ocs lessees.
in the district court,shell claimed that its ferc tariff established the rate shell could permissibly deduct from its royalty payments for transporting oil through the auger pipeline.interior argued that ferc jurisdiction had not been clearly established and that if ferc did not have jurisdiction,then ferc could not establish the appropriate rate and approve the tariff within the meaning of b.
both shell and interior moved for summary judgment in the district court.the district court denied interior motion and partially granted shell motion.the district court found that there was no rational connection between the ferc decisions in ultramar and oxy and interior decision to wholly deny shell request.see shell offshore,babbitt,d.the court held that interior had failed to adequately consider the evidence of interstate transportation of the oil submitted by shell,and that interior decision was therefore arbitrary and capricious.id.
the district court also held that the notice and comment provisions of the apa were applicable to interior change in policy.the district court applied the test set out by this court in phillips petroleum johnson,cir that dictates when exemption from apa notice and comment is proper for rules that govern rules of agency organization,procedure,or practice.id.at.see also b a.despite its holding that interior new policy required notice and comment under the apa,the district court only partially granted shell summary judgment motion.the court reasoned that t ransporting the crude oil to a refinery in louisiana is not interstate and the holding in ultramar is applicable to crude transported from the ocs to louisiana,and held that shell tariff was not applicable to the portion of the auger crude oil that did not leave louisiana unrefined.shell offshore,d at.both shell and interior timely appealed.
discussion 
this case involves two basic issues.the first is whether interior policy ocs lessees to petition ferc for an affirmation of a new rule that triggers the notice and comment provisions of the apa.if interior had,from the beginning,interpreted their regulation as requiring an affirmation of ferc jurisdiction,their interpretation of their own regulation would be entitled to substantial deference.however,interior changed their began to require lessees and required shell in this case to petition ferc for an affirmation of jurisdiction whereas from to their established procedure was to treat tariffs that were simply filed with the ferc as approved under b.a party may not lawfully be adversely affected by a rule promulgated in violation of the requirements of the apa.see a.interior new policy was never submitted for notice and comment.if interior change in policy is a new substantive rule for apa purposes the rule is invalid.
the second issue need be reached only if interior policy change was not a new rule for apa purposes.if the change was not such a rule,then interior decision must still satisfy the apa standard of not being arbitrary and capricious.see acadian gas pipeline ferc,cir if interior new policy was a rule for apa purposes,we need not reach the arbitrary and capricious issue.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hernandez reno,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the underlying agency decision denying shell request,the general standard under the apa is whether the agency final decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a avoyelles sportsmen league,marsh,cir.determining whether interior policy change was a rule for apa purposes is purely a matter of construction of the apa and we review this issue de novo.phillips,at t he label that the particular agency puts on upon its given exercise of administrative power is not,for our purposes,conclusive rather,it is what the agency does in fact.we review this legal issue de novo.citations omitted quoting brown express,united states,cir.interior is not charged with administering the apa its conclusions of law regarding whether its policy change is a rule for apa purposes are not given deference and are also reviewed de novo.see institute for technology development brown,cir.
the rulemaking requirements of the apa 
interior argues that the district court erred when it ruled that interior new policy was a legislative rule subject to the notice and comment requirements of the apa.interior claims,initially,that the decision in this case was an adjudication and was therefore exempt from the rulemaking requirements of.in the alternative,interior argues that even if the new policy is a rule it is an interpretive rule rather than a substantive one,and is thus exempt from the apa notice and comment requirements under d.
the apa defines a rule as an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization,procedure,or practice requirements of an agency and includes practices bearing on any of the foregoing.rulemaking is the agency process for formulating,amending,or repealing a rule.id.at.in contrast,the apa defines an adjudication as an agency process for the formulation of an order,and defines order as the whole or part of a final disposition of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licencing.id.at.there is no notice and comment requirement for an agency adjudication.id.at.similarly exempted from the notice and comment requirements are interpretive rules.id.at d.
interior argues that this case merely involves an adjudication exempt from the rulemaking requirements of the apa,and,in the alternative,that the new rule is merely interpretive.shell response to the first part of interior argument is that the decision in the adjudication in this case was wholly predicated upon a new requirement that is,in effect,a new substantive rule.we conclude that shell argument is the more persuasive.it is clear from interior internal memoranda and correspondence with shell that interior denial of shell request was the result of a departure from interior previous practice of treating as approved all filed ferc tariffs.it is similarly clear that interior new policy was the basis for the adjudication rather than the facts of the particular adjudication causing interior to modify or its rule.interior did not apply a general regulation to the specific facts of shell case.rather,it established a new policy and then applied that new policy to several ocs producers,including shell.if shell had submitted its tariff early in instead of,interior would have accepted shell tariff as approved by ferc and shell would not have been required to petition would have been no adjudication prior to.the adjudication resulted because interior changed its policy,and the district court did not err in reaching the policy change that controlled the adjudicative process.
interior also argues that their new policy should be considered an interpretive rule,and should therefore be exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the apa.in brown express united states,cir,we repeated with approval the district of columbia circuit distinction between interpretive and substantive rules generally speaking,it seems to be established that regulations,substantive rules,or legislative rules are those which create law whereas interpretive rules are statements as to what the administrative officer thinks the statute or regulation means.id.at.quoting gibson wine snyder.legislative or substantive rules are those which affect individual rights and obligations.see chrysler brown,d citations omitted.we now review some of our prior cases on this topic.
in phillips petroleum johnson,cir,mms issued an unpublished internal agency paper that changed the procedure for determining oil and gas royalties.the original regulation directed mms to consider a variety of factors in valuing offshore production,including the highest prices for such production in the area,the price paid by the lessee,posted prices,regulated prices,and other factors.id.at.mms new policy under the agency paper was to focus only on the spot price instead of the enumerated factors in the regulation.unlike the present case,mms admitted in phillips that the procedure paper was a new rule.just as interior asserts now,however,in phillips mms asserted that the paper merely interpreted the existing regulation and was therefore a clarification of existing regulations rather than a substantive modification.we held that the procedure paper was not an interpretive rule and was subject to the notice and comment requirements of the apa.phillips,at.however,unlike the present case,in phillips the procedure paper directly contradicted the text of the regulation at issue.
in davidson glickman,cir,we held that a provision of a farm services agency fsa handbook was a substantive rule that required notice and comment under the apa.the provision prohibited revision of acreage reports if the producer would benefit from the revision.the regulation in question did not mention this condition on revision of acreage reports.we held that the provision was indeed a legislative or substantive rule that required notice and comment under the apa,and invalidated the application of the handbook provision.id.at.
in the present case,the new rule that shell asserts violates the apa is not a change from a written policy statement or regulation.rather,it is an alteration of an existing practice.from through,interior treated all filed tariffs as approved by the ferc now it requires lessees in shell position to as stated in the dear payor letter,see note supra petition ferc and receive from ferc a determination affirmatively stating that it has jurisdiction over the pipelines in question.this case is somewhat different from glickman and phillips in that the new interpretation of approved by ferc does not directly and expressly contradict the regulation itself.instead,it contradicts interior prior consistent interpretation of the regulation.a further complication is that each of interior interpretations of b the new interpretation as well as the perhaps,independently,qualify as an interpretive rule that is exempt from notice and comment under the apa,in that each interprets an argu
