after an administrative law judge found that mammoth coal company had systematically discriminated against union members,the national labor relations board sought injunctive relief in federal district court pursuant to j of the national labor relations act.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court issued a detailed written opinion,explaining its order granting this relief in part and denying it in part.the court ordered mammoth to offer employment to persons that it had refused to hire because of union affiliation but denied substantial additional injunctive relief sought by the board.mammoth appeals,and the board.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in october,massey coal company acquired in bankruptcy the coal mining assets of cannelton industries,and dunn coal and dock.massey assigned these assets to its subsidiary,spartan mining company,which does business as mammoth coal company mammoth.mammoth then took over operation of the coal mining facilities located on the property.
in december,mammoth began hiring production and maintenance workers for this property.prior to resuming mining operations,mammoth offered employment interviews to,and eventually hired,most of the unit employees who had worked at.mammoth largely refused,however,to extend employment or even interviews to laborers who were members of the united mine workers of america umwa.instead,mammoth filled vacant positions with inexperienced trainees and nonunion employees from its own nearby facilities,even though those facilities themselves were experiencing labor shortages.
on june,in reaction to this apparent illegal activity,the umwa filed an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board.the general counsel for the board investigated the matter and filed a complaint with the board against mammoth on august,alleging multiple violations of the national labor relations act nlra.over a period,commencing on january,and ending on march,an administrative law judge alj conducted a evidentiary proceeding regarding this complaint.on november,in an exhaustively detailed opinion,the alj found that mammoth had violated the nlra.
the alj first held that mammoth violated a and a of the nlra,a,by discriminatorily refusing to hire union employees of in order to avoid an obligation to recognize and bargain with the union.the alj found abundant support for a prima facie case of discrimination,including not just circumstantial evidence but also overt statements made by mammoth officials.in reaching its conclusion,the alj considered,analyzed,and then rejected each of mammoth proffered reasons for its hiring decisions,noting that these justifications were contradictory and had shift ed over the course of litigation.moreover,the alj also found that mammoth,as a legal successor to the operation that had failed to recognize and bargain collectively with the predecessor union,had violated a of the nlra.id.a.
based on these findings,the alj recommended order called for broad relief,including immediate employment offers and back pay for listed discriminatees,forced recognition and bargaining with the union,rescission of any unilateral changes to employment terms and conditions,and remission of all wages and benefits that mammoth would have paid absent discrimination.both sides filed exceptions to the alj proposed order the matter remains pending before the board.
in order to preserve the board remedial power during the pendency of administrative proceedings,the board regional director petitioned the federal district court for temporary injunctive relief under j of the nlra.section j provides a means for the board to seek an order from the court temporarily enjoining asserted unfair labor practices.see j kinney pioneer press,cir.in december,due to anticipated reductions from its full complement,which would take the board below its quorum of three members,and pursuant to d,the board delegated its j powers to its general counsel.the general counsel,in turn,recused himself because of personal ties to the case and delegated this power in the case at hand to the deputy general counsel.
shortly after the general counsel delegated this authority to him,the deputy general counsel authorized the regional director to petition the district court for temporary injunctive relief under j.mammoth moved to dismiss the petition,arguing that the board lacked authority to delegate its j powers.in a written opinion,the district court denied this motion.muffley massey energy,d.
the district court then held an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the board petition,at which the court heard testimony from a number of witnesses.during that hearing,mammoth conceded that the board had demonstrated reasonable cause to believe that mammoth violated the nlra.after consideration of both the evidence offered by the parties and their oral and written arguments,the district court issued a thorough and opinion.muffley massey energy,wl.august.the court found that limited injunctive mammoth to offer employment to the alleged discriminatee just and proper under j to preserve the effectiveness of any ultimate board order.id.at.but the court refused to grant the other injunctive relief that the board requested.specifically,the court declined to order mammoth to recognize and bargain with the union,post notices of the district court order throughout its workplace,or rescind any unilaterally imposed employment conditions,finding those measures unnecessary to preserve the board remedial powers in this case.id.at.both mammoth and the board noted timely appeals.
while those appeals were pending before us,mammoth moved in this court for a stay of the district court order that it offer employment to the alleged discriminatee employees.the order,mammoth claimed,would result in irreparable harm to the company because it might have to displace some of its current employees to accommodate the hiring of discriminatees.before we could act on mammoth motion,however,the company withdrew the motion,acknowledging that,after it offered positions to all of the discriminatees,it had been able to hire all who sought employment without laying off any employees.see mammoth mot.to withdraw mot.for stay of inj.pending appeal at,cir.
as a preliminary matter,mammoth argues that neither this court nor the district court can consider this case because the board improperly delegated the power to seek j relief to its general counsel the district court held,and we agree,that the nlra expressly authorizes this delegation.
congress vested the power to seek j relief with the board.see j the board shall have power to petition any united states district court for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.however,when it created the office of the general counsel,congress also provided in d of the nlra that the general counsel shall have final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under of the nlra and shall have such other duties as the board may prescribe.id.d emphasis added.as mammoth acknowledges,every court that has addressed this issue has found that d permits the board to delegate to the general counsel its power to seek j relief.see,kentov point blank body armor,d,penello int l union,umwa,evans int l typographical union.
nevertheless,mammoth contends that d only provides for delegation of certain duties and that the decision to seek j relief constitutes a fundamental power that the board can not delegate.mammoth attempts to distinguish the two terms,equating duties with prosecutorial functions and power with adjudicative functions,and then relies on the general rule that although the board may delegate prosecutorial functions to the general counsel,it may not assign away its core adjudicative functions.see,nlrb,cir kfc mgmt.nlrb,cir.
the central question,then,is whether the ability to seek j relief is prosecutorial or adjudicative in nature.this ability seems to us,as it has to all other courts,clearly prosecutorial seeking j relief from a district court adjudicates nothing.whether the board or the general counsel petitions a district court for relief,the adjudicative ultimate decision to grant with the district court.see kentov,d at.delegation of the prosecutorial decision to request relief does not interfere with the structure of the nlra nor divest the board of its adjudicative power.the board may therefore lawfully delegate j authority to the general counsel pursuant to d of the nlra 
mammoth next poses essentially two arguments with respect to the merits of the district court limited j injunction.first,mammoth insists that the district court committed reversible error in applying an improper standard in deciding whether to grant the j injunction.second,mammoth contends that even if the district court selection of a standard does not require reversal,the district court abused its discretion in granting the board injunctive relief.we consider each argument in turn.
section j provides that a district court shall award temporary injunctive relief as it deems just and proper.j.the meaning of this simple language,which the supreme court has never directly addressed,has vexed the courts and spawned three competing standards for judging the propriety of j relief.
likening j injunctions to relief pursuant to l of the nlra,many circuits have held that j requires a district court to follow a approach,determining whether reasonable cause exists to believe a violation of the nlra has occurred,and injunctive relief is just and proper.see ahearn jackson hosp,cir sharp webco,cir hirsch dorsey trailers,cir arlook lichtenberg,cir boire pilot freight carriers,cir.although these courts differ on precisely how strong the evidence must be to establish reasonable cause,see webco,at,they essentially agree that the just and proper inquiry turns on whether temporary injunctive relief is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of the remedy that the board may ultimately order.see,ahearn,at.
other circuits have rejected this standard.see sharp parents in cmty.action,cir miller cal.pac.med,cir en banc kinney,at.these courts note that j,unlike l,does not explicitly require a separate reasonable cause step and interpret j just and proper clause to embody the established standard applicable to any preliminary injunction requested pursuant to.a.see,kinney,at.under this traditional equitable standard,a district court determines whether to grant j relief by weighing the following four factors the possibility of irreparable injury to the moving party if relief is not granted the possible harm to the nonmoving party if relief is granted the likelihood of the moving party success on the merits and the public interest.see blackwelder furniture seilig,cir.
finally,the first and second circuits have developed a hybrid standard.these courts incorporate the traditional equitable standard into the just and proper analysis,yet retain a separate reasonable cause step.see,hoffman inn credible caterers,cir pye sullivan.printers,cir.
this circuit has never directly addressed the issue that has divided our sister circuits.in nlrb aerovox,cir,on which the board principally relies,we did look to authority applying the standard in j cases,but aerovox itself arose under e of the nlrb.moreover,nothing in aerovox indicates that the standard as to the grant of injunctive relief was at issue rather,the parties simply disputed the application of that standard to the facts of the case.in johnston stevens,cir,a brief per curiam opinion,we did review a j injunction,but simply mentioned,without any analysis,the just and proper standard.notably,the parties here place little reliance on johnston,citing it only briefly and in passing.
whatever the precedential force of aerovox or johnston,the supreme court more recent analysis in weinberger,d,provides compelling guidance as to the appropriate j standard.in that case,the supreme court stated that,unless directed otherwise by congress,courts should exercise their traditional equitable discretion.the court explained that if congress intends to depart from this established of course it may must do so in a clear manner 
w e do not lightly assume that congress has intended to depart from established principles 
unless a statute in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.
id.at.quoting porter warner holding.citation omitted.
in light of,we believe that,in determining if a j injunction should issue,the traditional equitable test should govern what relief is just and proper.therefore,district courts are to utilize the blackwelder factors in conducting the just and proper analysis and need not undertake a separate reasonable cause inquiry to determine whether to issue a j injunction.
in reaching this conclusion,we note that j includes no explicit reference to reasonable cause.rather,the plain language of the statute requires only that the district court find injunctive relief just and proper.see j.certainly,the phrase just and proper does not evince a necessary and inescapable congressional intent to depart from traditional equitable standards,at.to the contrary,just and proper is another way of saying appropriate or equitable.miller,at.thus no language in j compels departure from the traditional test for equitable relief in such circumstances,indicates that courts should apply that test.at.
those courts that have refused to follow the interpretative guidance set forth in,and have read an additional reasonable cause requirement into j,do so only by analogizing to l,which does explicitly require reasonable cause.l.not only does this ignore the fact that j contains no such language,but it also overlooks important differences between j and l relief.
section l is mandatory upon a showing of reasonable cause that specific types of unfair practices have occurred,the general counsel must seek injunctive relief in the district court.id.in this context,once the board discovers enough evidence to establish reasonable cause,it is required to act.see kinney,at.
section j,in contrast,is discretionary,allowing the board to seek injunctive relief only after the general counsel has filed a complaint with the board.j.because by that time the general counsel will have conducted thorough investigation and made a considered judgment about the merits of the case,the district court need not duplicate those efforts to ensure that reasonable cause exists.see kinney,at.
accordingly,district courts in this circuit are to utilize the traditional equitable test in determining whether it is just and proper to grant or deny j injunctions no further just and proper analysis is necessary or appropriate.but,of course,district courts should apply this test in light of the underlying purpose of j preserving the board remedial power pending the outcome of its administrative proceedings.see miller,at.
here,the district court did not apply this precise standard instead,it added to it the reasonable cause analysis that we now hold unnecessary.but mammoth does not allege any harm from the district court addition of a reasonable cause step,and we can see none.as other courts have recognized,whether a court makes a separate reasonable cause inquiry is nearly always immaterial to the outcome.see kinney,at w e did not find a ny case in which the presence or absence of reasonable cause made a difference.pye excel case ready,cir.this is so because,under the traditional standard,the court must still determine the board likelihood of success on the merits,an inquiry that essentially parallels the reasonable cause step.kinney,at.moreover,in this case,mammoth expressly conceded that reasonable cause existed.the district court recognition of that concession surely does not constitute reversible error.
mammoth,however,does allege that reversible error occurred because the court failed to consider the balance of harms and other equitable factors,thus assertedly failing to follow the traditional equitable test.some courts applying the standard have focused the just and proper step almost entirely on whether an injunction is necessary to preserve the board remedial power.see,hirsch,at.we agree with mammoth
