partners,asks us to interpret the interplay between the limitation provisions of internal revenue code irc a and irc a.specifically,we are asked to determine whether irc a provides an independent limitations period for commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner issuance of a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa.the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner,holding that irc a does not provide a separate statute of limitations for partnership items and that the relevant limitations periods are those of each individual three years after the date of filing the individual set forth in irc a the tax court reasoned that the limitations period of irc a can can never period within which the commissioner may assess individual tax liabilities attributable to partnership items.although this issue of statutory interpretation is res nova in this circuit,the tax court sitting as an en court the circuit and the federal have each resolved it in favor of the commissioner.affirming the tax court decision,we now join these other courts and hold that irc a does not establish an independent statute of limitations for issuing fpaas.
facts and proceedings 
on october,the partnership,filed a form,partnership return of income,for the taxable year.more than four years later,on october,the commissioner issued an fpaa determining that the partnership was a sham,as a result,all transactions in which it engaged would be treated as engaged in by the individual partners directly,all income,deductions,gains,and losses reported by the partnership would be disallowed,and the partners would be treated as having no basis in their respective partnership interests.timely filed a petition in the tax court seeking review of the commissioner determination.then filed motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and to strike,and for summary judgment,contending,inter alia,that because the fpaa was issued more than three years after both the due date of the partnership return and the date on which it was filed,the period of limitations for assessing tax attributable to partnership items had expired.based its argument on its interpretation of irc a as an independent statute of limitations subject to specific extensions for issuing an fpaa.
the commissioner responded that at least three partners had claimed net operating loss carryforwards of a partnership item on their respective individual and returns.the commissioner proposed to assess tax based on the claimed carryforwards on these partners and returns,under the theory that the fpaa was issued less than three years after the partners had filed their respective individual tax returns for those tax years,within the statute of limitations for individual returns as set forth in irc a.
the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner,emphasizing that the internal revenue code prescribes no period during which proceedings,which begin with the mailing of an fpaa,must be commenced.the court held that irc a does not provide an assessment period independent of the individual limitations period of irc a that instead irc a provides a minimum,which can extend irc a period,but can not curtail it.
this timely appeal followed,in which challenges only the timeliness of the fpaa 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a tax court decision the same way that we would review a district court decision in the instant case,presents purely an issue of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo 
statutory framework 
tefra prescribes the administrative and litigation procedures for addressing partnership tax issues.it requires partnerships to file informational returns reflecting the distributive shares of income,gains,deductions,and credits attributable to its partners.accordingly,the individual partners are responsible for reporting their pro rata share of tax on their income tax returns.items more appropriate for determination at the partnership level are designated partnership items,which are to be treated at the partnership level other items are designated nonpartnership items,which are to be treated at the individual partner level 
when the irs proposes an adjustment of taxes at the partnership level,it issues a notice of adjustment,the fpaa,which is analogous to the statutory notice of deficiency furnished to individuals after the fpaa becomes final,the commissioner may assess tax to the individual partners whose tax returns for the year or years in question remain open under irc a,for those partners distributive shares of the adjusted partnership items 
irc a is the statute of limitations which is generally applicable to the commissioner assessment of tax that section states 
general as otherwise provided in this section,the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within years after the return was filed,and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun after the expiration of such period 
irc a,which contends is a statute of limitations for issuing an which,in the commissioner and the tax court views,can only extend but not shorten the irc a 
general as otherwise provided in this section,the period for assessing any tax imposed by subtitle a with respect to any person which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year shall not expire before the date which is years after the later of 
the date on which the partnership return for such taxable year was filed,or 
the last day for filing such return for such year determined without regard to extensions 
irc a does not establish an independent statute of limitations for the issuance of an fpaa 
jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,contends that in a partnership proceeding,courts have no jurisdiction to consider the filing date of a partner individual return because that is not a partnership item but rather a nonpartnership item the scope of the tax court jurisdiction in partnership proceedings,argues,is limited to determination of all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the fpaa relates,the proper allocation of such items among partners,and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.yet,congress has made clear that any partner shall be permitted to participate in litigation solely for the purpose of asserting that the period of limitations for assessing any tax attributable to partnership items has expired with respect to such person,and the court having jurisdiction of such action shall have jurisdiction to consider such assertion.armed with congress express blessing,the tax court does not exceed its jurisdiction when it considers the filing date of a partner individual return 
asserts that even if the tax court is not jurisdictionally barred from referencing the filing date of a partner individual return,a plain reading of irc and irc in pari materia yields desired result,that irc a is an independent limitations period for the issuance of an fpaa,which period begins to run on the later of the date that the partnership files its informational return or the date that it is due.in view,the tefra partnership procedures establish a time line governing when an fpaa may be issued,which is entirely independent of and distinct which general time line specified by irc.the commissioner counters that irc a,by its terms,sets no limitation period for the issuance of an fpaa.the commissioner argues partnership a works to extend the irc a limitations periods of the individual partners under circumstances when those periods would otherwise expire less than three years following the later of the filing date or due date for the filing of the partnership return,disregarding extensions.
when the plain language of a statute is unambiguous and does not lead to an absurd result,our inquiry begins and ends with the plain meaning of that language.the unambiguous language of irc a and irc a mandates our conclusion that irc a creates a limitations period within which the commissioner must assess any tax on individual period which irc a can never shorten,regardless of the length of time that might have elapsed between the filing of the partnership informational return and the commissioner issuance of an fpaa.rather,irc a establishes only the minimum time period that,when necessary,extends,supercedes,the general limitations period of irc a.for partnership items,the otherwise applicable limitations period of irc a shall not expire before the date which is years after the later of the date on which the partnership return was filed or the date on which it was due in reaching this conclusion,we find persuasive the tax court en banc decision in surfactants specialties,commissioner the circuit opinion in andantech commissioner and the federal circuit opinion in ad global fund,llc ex rel.north hills holding,united states 
in,the tax court said 
section unequivocally provides the period of limitations within which the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed.generally,the period of limitations so provided is years from the date the taxpayer return was filed but varies in the case of certain enumerated exceptions.the pertinent language of section is t he period for assessing any tax imposed by subtitle a with respect to any person which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year shall not expire before the date which is years after the later of the filing or due date of the partnership return.section provides a minimum period of time for the assessment of any tax attributable to partnership items or affected items notwithstanding the period provided for in section,which is ordinarily the maximum period for the assessment of any tax.the section minimum period may expire before or after the section maximum period.indeed,section n section by providing for extension of period in the case of partnership items as defined in section a,see section.
in andantech,the circuit,quoted the foregoing language,and determined that nothing in the tax court reasoning gave it pause that court thus concluded that irc a statute of limitations is applicable to all assessments made under the chapter and that irc a can only extend,not cut short,the irc a period for partnership items the andantech court further stated that the language of,rather than simply stating a statute of limitations,indicates by the use of the term shall not expire that the provision is intended to dictate a minimum period,but not an absolute restriction.
the federal circuit,in ad global fund,reached the same result as had the circuit and the en banc tax court before it.the court in ad global fund emphasized that 
irc a unambiguously sets forth a minimum period for assessments of partnership items that may extend the regular statute of limitations in.section explicitly provides that it applies to any tax imposed by the title,which would include tax imposed for partnership items,and n o exception is provided for assessment of taxes for partnership items 
additionally,that court found it significant irc a irc is couched in mandatory terms setting forth the maximum period within which tax assessments must be made shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed.in contrast,irc a employs the term shall not expire before,which creates a minimum period during which the period for tax assessments for partnership items may not end.and,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.the federal circuit viewed the use of shall not expire before in irc a as significant.that court described its result as consistent with the tefra scheme,which generally requires determination of the tax treatment of partnership items at the partnership level before they are assessed at the partner level first,the commissioner ascertains all partnership items in a consolidated determination then irc controls,separately as to each individual partner,the tax consequences of that initial determination irc a may extend the regular statute of limitations in a for assessments to individual partners,but it does not alter the statutory scheme of determining partnership items in one proceeding.
we perceive no flaw in the interpretations of those courts,which reached the instant issue before we did,and we adopt their analyses we emphasize,however,that once a partner individual statute of limitations under irc a for any given tax year has run without that period having been extended under irc or any other statute the commissioner has no authority to assess tax based on any partnership items against that partner for that closed tax year,even if the commissioner subsequently issues an fpaa for that year.the plain language of irc a guarantees as much.as counsel for the commissioner represented at oral argument,i f one partner carried partnership losses over ten years,but the others did not and used it all in,the commissioner would be able to assess against them it only to the extent that a partner individual statute of limitations is still open that we could do an assessment.
the practical result of our holding today is that the commissioner may issue an fpaa at any time,subject only to the practical limitation that the fpaa may affect only those partners whose individual returns remain open under irc a or some extension thereto,such as the minimum period of irc a,before which the statute of limitations may not expire.stated differently,the commissioner is free to assess tax on any taxpayer who,on his individual tax return,has taken advantage of the partnership items within the preceding three years or,in the event of an extension,within the extended statute of limitations.even though our holding will permit assessments against some partners and not against others,depending on their respective limitations periods under irc a,this interpretation is consistent with the other portions of irc,which explicitly contemplate distinct treatment of different partners if congress intended a different result,it is for this the statutory language 
we continue briefly to explain that our decision today does not contradict this circuit precedent.on at least two weiner united and in re we have referred to irc a as a statute of limitations.yet,those descriptions were mere dicta and they did not address the relationship of irc a to irc a.they thus do not constrain today decision.weiner involved multiple partners who had commenced refund suits,arguing that irc a statutorily barred an fpaa there we had no need to consider the merits of the taxpayers argument because we determined that irc h deprived us of jurisdiction irc h provides that n o action may be brought for a refund attributable to partnership items.and,because we held that the irc a period is a partnership item,the district courts lack jurisdiction to decide the fpaa statute of limitations issue.the jurisdictional issue was dispositive in weiner to the extent we discussed irc as a strict statute of limitations for the issuance of an fpaa,it was mere dicta.
in in re martinez,the issue was the extent to which a partnership conflicted partner could bind the other partners to an agreement into which he and the commissioner had entered to extend the irc a period under irc b b,such agreements usually bind all partners the in re martinez taxpayer who was not the partner argued that the partner conflict of interest nullified his actions with respect to the partnership.we acknowledged that there may be times when a tax matters partner actions beneficial to himself are so contrary to the interests of the partnership that they are rendered null with respect to the partners.we concluded,however,that in re martinez was not such a case,and that the extension granted to the commissioner applied to all partners as in weiner,the interplay of irc a and irc a was not at issue,and our reference to irc a as a statute of limitations was dicta.we thus have not previously had occasion to address squarely the instant issue,and our decision today is not in conflict with our precedent 
iii.conclusion 
we hold that the tax court correct
