invention submission corporation commenced this action under the administrative procedure act apa against james rogan in his official capacity as under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the united states patent and trademark office pto,alleging that the pto advertising campaign to alert the public about invention promotion scams was aimed at invention submission to penalize it and ultimately put it out of business.invention submission alleged that the advertising campaign was an illegal final agency action that was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded any statutory authority conferred on the pto.
on the pto motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,based on the ground that the pto advertising campaign was not a final agency action and therefore that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,the district court dismissed the action.see invention submission rogan,d.the district court,however,acted under federal rule of civil procedure b,concluding that under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the complaint allegations,no relief could be granted to invention submission.
reviewing the district court order de novo,we agree that the complaint must be dismissed,but not under rule b.as we explain below,we conclude that because the pto advertising campaign was not a final agency conclusion that the district court also reached in its district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to review it.see.we must therefore vacate the district court order of october,as well as the supporting opinion,and remand with instructions to dismiss invention submission complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
congress enacted the inventors rights act of,to protect inventors from invention promotion scams and the deceptive advertising related to them by authorizing the pto to publicize complaints that it receives against invention promoters.see cong.rec.the act and the regulations adopted under it impose a duty on the pto to provide a forum for the publication of complaints concerning invention promoters.see also d.the act and regulations do not,however,authorize the pto to conduct any independent investigations of invention promoters,authorizing instead enforcement by injured persons through civil actions.see b,d.
in connection with its duty to publicize complaints concerning invention promoters,the pto initiated an advertising campaign in january to alert the public to invention promotion scams,and its advertisements stated,make sure your your t wash away.to learn more,call the patent and trademark office.in launching the media campaign,the pto stated in a press release 
this week,the united states patent and trademark office uspto unveils a television and radio campaign in five media markets to counter the flood of deceptive advertising aimed at america independent inventors the agency also will be placing print ads 
uspto ads caution inventors that if it sounds too good to be true,it is,said james rogan,under secretary of commerce for intellectual property.our ads offer practical information,guiding inventors to uspto office of independent inventor programs,where they can get real help with patenting and marketing their inventions.
every year invention promotion scams cost inventors an estimated million.the spots feature an actual inventor,edward lewis,who lost several thousand dollars.
in the print advertising published by the pto,edward lewis is quoted as saying,i spent and three years spinning my wheels with a company that promised my idea would make lots of money.they were right.it made lots of money for them.i have seen a penny.
a journalist for a cable television network,who saw the pto advertising campaign,contacted the pto and requested contact information for lewis.after the pto provided the information,the cable television network interviewed lewis and published a story that revealed that,in the quotation of lewis,lewis was referring to his relationship with invention submission corporation,an invention promoter.the article revealed that lewis had filed a complaint with the pto in august that was being processed.the article also revealed that invention submission was one of several companies investigated by the ftc in the for misrepresentation in patent marketing schemes.it stated that in,without admitting or denying guilt,the company agreed to pay a million settlement for refunds in the case,as well as change its business practices.the article included invention submission response to lewis accusations that it did nothing wrong,that neither its representatives nor commercials misled lewis or any other inventor.
edward lewis,from sicklerville,new jersey,who invented bodyguard to shield automobile paint while tough products do their work,had indeed filed a complaint with the pto against invention submission on august,and the pto sent a copy of the complaint for response to invention submission on march.sometime before march,invention submission and lewis resolved lewis complaint,and,on that date,lewis withdrew his complaint from the pto.accordingly,invention submission advised the pto that it was not submitting a response to the complaint,and the pto did not post lewis complaint on the agency web site.
a few months after lewis withdrew his complaint from the pto,invention submission commenced this action against the pto under the apa,alleging that because the pto was authorized only to receive customer complaints,provide invention promoters with notice and reasonable opportunity to respond,and provide a forum to publicize complaints and responses,the pto exceeded its authority in publicizing lewis complaint in its media advertising and illegally used the public media to single out invention submission to penalize it.as it alleged 
t he pto intentionally publicized isc invention submission as the invention company which was the subject of the lewis complaint,for the purpose of stigmatizing isc.
the pto knew that,if the lewis complaint was not withdrawn,and was subsequently made publicly available on the pto web site under the inventors rights act,isc would be further identified with the pto unfair and untrue television and print advertisements,and an additional link would be established between isc and the pto statements about scams and false promises of money to lewis.
the pto thereby knowingly violated the inventors rights act requirement that it make the lewis complaint publicly available only in a neutral forum,without comment or judgment,together with isc response.
in addition,invention submission complaint alleged that john calvert,the acting director of the office of independent inventor programs at the pto,demonstrated an animus of the pto against isc when he stated an intention to solicit and investigate customer complaints despite the pto lack of authority to do this.invention submission complaint described a meeting of inventors at which calvert was alleged to have said 
the only way that we do not post it a customer complaint is if you withdraw it,and we have one company that bob and i were talking about that has a tendency to settle quickly but we going to get them up there yet.we got to find somebody that does want to settle and get their name on our internet,on the internet site,and we will have them up eventually.we have one up there now,and you can look at it.
the complaint concluded with allegations that in pursuing these actions directed against invention submission,the pto has taken final agency actions in the nature of imposing sanctions failing to act in accordance with the inventors rights act and the regulations,and therefore,under the apa,the actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,contrary to constitutional right,in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or short of statutory right.invention submission sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as attorneys fees.
the pto filed a motion to dismiss invention submission complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that the federal courts could review only final agency actions and that the pto alleged conduct did not qualify as a final agen
