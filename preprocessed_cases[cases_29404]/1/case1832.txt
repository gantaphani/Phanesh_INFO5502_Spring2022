in the consent agreement signed by gibson in the underlying federal court proceedings,gibson acknowledged that the court entry of a permanent injunction may have collateral consequences and agreed that i n any disciplinary proceeding before the commission based on the entry of the injunction in this action,he shall not be permitted to contest the factual allegations of the complaint filed in district court in this action.joint appendix at.as a result,we will take the facts alleged in the aforementioned district court complaint the complaint as true for purposes of our review.
the complaint alleged that gibson,a resident of tennessee,was a certified financial planner,a registered representative of a,and part owner of ipm,a limited liability company.in november,gibson formed american car wash fund,lp acw to buy and manage operations in northern georgia.through ipm,gibson sold interests in acw,raising approximately.approximately of the limited partners were also clients of gibson advisory business.
gibson provided a private placement memorandum ppm to prospective investors which stated that after organizational expenses were satisfied,investors funds would be invested in money market funds or government securities until the funds could be invested in projects.according to the complaint,however,almost as soon as gibson began selling interests in acw,he began misappropriating investor funds for his own use.gibson wrote checks payable to cash on acw bank accounts,misappropriating approximately.the complaint stated that gibson actions were contrary to representations made by gibson and exceeded any payments to which gibson and ipm may have been entitled under the ppm.the ppm was never amended to reflect the actual use of the funds.
the complaint alleged that the misappropriations continued up to the time the complaint was filed.the complaint also alleged that subsequent to selling the partnership interests in acw,gibson and ipm sought to lull investors into believing that their investments were profitable and to conceal the misappropriation of funds by sending letters to the investors describing annualized rates of return,dividends and purchases of various properties,without disclosing the ongoing misuse of proceeds by gibson and ipm.at.
after gibson executed a consent agreement,the district court permanently enjoined gibson from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws,ordered him to pay a civil penalty of and to disgorge in misappropriated funds,and enjoined gibson and ipm from serving as a general partner or otherwise controlling acw.gibson subsequently liquidated assets purchased with the misappropriated investors funds and used the proceeds to pay the civil penalty and disgorgement.
on june,the division initiated a administrative proceeding before the securities and exchange commission pursuant to exchange act b and advisers act f.after two conferences,the division moved for summary disposition pursuant to commission rule of practice,relying on the allegations of the aforementioned district court complaint.gibson filed a response,attaching his own declaration and declarations from acw investors.gibson declaration stated that he had a clean disciplinary record,that he cooperated with the commission investigation,and that he paid the fine and disgorgement ordered by the district court.in each individual investor declaration,the investor indicated that he or she had reviewed gibson answer to the complaint,agreed to approve and ratify all of gibson actions with respect to acw,and wanted gibson to continue to act on his or her behalf as investment adviser.at.these declarations appear to be preprinted forms that allow only for the investors initials and signatures.
the alj granted the division motion for summary disposition,finding that gibson had failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact.after concluding that gibson misappropriation of investor funds demonstrated a lack of honesty and judgment which made him unsuited to function in the securities industry,the alj held that the public interest required that gibson be barred.
gibson appealed the alj decision to a panel of the securities and exchange commission the commission.after discussing the uncontested factual allegations in the complaint which were in turn,taken as true by the alj and the commission and the relevant statutory provisions,the commission concluded that there were significant doubts about gibson fitness to remain in the securities industry.the commission held that the alj correctly concluded that there was no issue with regard to any material fact and that imposing a lifetime bar against gibson would serve the public interest.the commission therefore affirmed the alj issuance of a lifetime bar precluding gibson from associating with any securities broker,dealer,or investment adviser pursuant to b of the exchange act and f of the advisers act.gibson now seeks our review of the commission order.
