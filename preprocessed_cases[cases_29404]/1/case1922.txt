meijer,petitions for review of an order by the national labor relations board nlrb or the board that it cease and desist from enforcing its policies against union solicitation by employees,found by the board to constitute unfair labor practices.the board petitions for enforcement of the order.we grant in part meijer petition for review and reverse a portion of the board opinion.we also grant in part the board for enforcement and affirm its final order,vacating only that portion of the order that sanctions meijer for punishing an employee for conducting union solicitation when it had no knowledge of the protected nature of the conduct.
meijer operates hypermarkets.each of their single stores includes a supermarket,a general merchandise store,a pharmacy,and a restaurant,open hours a day,seven days a week.in,robert caldwell was a warehouse clerk for meijer at its tipp city,ohio location.that facility includes a hypermarket in addition to warehouses supporting meijer other locations.it has several parking areas,one near the retail center the retail lot,primarily for customers and retail employees,and another,gated,lot for employees of the distribution center the distribution lot.the retail lot occupies about ten acres and has approximately parking spaces.clerks from the retail operation collect shopping carts from the retail lot,do some landscaping work,and shovel snow in limited areas.occasionally,outside vendors or organizations,such as nascar or,use the retail lot for promotional events.meijer also uses some of the retail lot to sell seasonal or bulky products like lawnmowers and pools.
caldwell drove a standup reach fork in the general merchandise warehouse.workers at the facility,as a condition of employment,are members of the united food and commercial workers local the union.caldwell was unsatisfied with his union representation and endeavored to replace the current union with a new one,an organization he called real union.to promote this effort,caldwell talked to his coworkers and distributed literature urging that they join.
on october,caldwell finished his shift early and parked in the distribution lot in time for a shift change.as employees of the warehouses arrived and departed,caldwell distributed membership cards for real union.this activity was interrupted when chris cullen,a union steward in the warehouse,became agitated with caldwell,complaining loudly and with vulgarity that the employees were already represented by a labor union.cullen told caldwell to leave because he did belong there.when he would not,cullen said,i take care of this,and placed a call to jack evans of meijer security on his mobile phone.cullen told evans that someone was bothering people in the distribution lot.by the time evans arrived,caldwell had started to leave,stopping only to distribute a real union card to employee lisa patton on his way out.this last stop was impromptu,and therefore caldwell truck was not parked in a marked space.
when evans arrived he did not see any disturbance.however,he noticed caldwell truck,recognized caldwell,and approached him.evans asked whether he was on the clock and what he was doing.caldwell testified that he told evans that he was soliciting for real union,but the administrative law judge alj credited evans conflicting testimony that caldwell never answered his question concerning what he was doing.evans told caldwell to leave the parking lot.caldwell said we see about that,and left.it was only after caldwell had left that evans asked patton to see the literature she had received from caldwell and learned that he had been soliciting for real union.
on october,evans reported the incident to matthew jamrog,a meijer executive with labor relations responsibility.as a result of that conversation,evans distributed a memo to the security staff informing them that union solicitation was allowed during nonworktime in nonwork areas.this definition included caldwell activity in the distribution lot.jamrog also sent a letter that day to caldwell informing him that,according to published company policy,the retail lot was considered to be a working area,where he could not solicit for real union.according to jamrog the company considers our store parking lots to be a work area since we have team members that work in this outside area of the store.meijer,wl,nlrb,slip op.at june,hereinafter meijer.soon after receiving the october letter,caldwell asked evans to clarify the company policy.he was referred to mike sullivan,meijer building manager.sullivan explained to caldwell that he could distribute literature in the distribution lot during nonworktime to nonworking employees,but that he could not do the same in the retail lot.
meijer company policy on solicitation is included in a team member handbook,a publication distributed to all employees.it states that no solicitation is allowed on worktime and that no solicitation is allowed in any work area.in contravention to this policy,and pursuant to its collective bargaining agreement with the union,meijer does allow solicitation on worktime to raise money for the union political active ballot club.
on october,and again on january,caldwell filed charges against meijer with the nlrb.caldwell alleged that meijer had prevented him from distributing union literature and that it maintained a rule prohibiting distribution in its retail lot.this interference,alleged caldwell,violated his rights under the national labor relations act.hereinafter the act.the case was tried before the alj on may.the court heard testimony from caldwell,evans,patton,sullivan,jamrog,and a meijer building manager,ken barclay.a videotape of activity in the retail lot was also submitted.
in an august,opinion,the alj held that meijer had not violated the act when it stopped caldwell from soliciting in the distribution lot because the nlrb general counsel had failed to meet his burden of proving that evans knew caldwell was engaged in concerted protected activity when he asked him to leave the parking lot on october.meijer,at emphasis added.alternately,the alj held that even if evans conduct had violated the act,jamrog letter of october repudiated that illegal conduct because it assured caldwell that,in the future,he would be permitted to distribute literature in the distribution facility parking lot.ibid.
after viewing a videotape that depicted two and hours of activity in the retail lot,the alj found that work in the retail lot was periodic or sporadic,and that the functions performed in the retail lot were incidental to meijer core business,selling merchandise inside its stores.id.at.accordingly,the alj held that meijer policy of prohibiting union solicitation in its retail lot was an unfair labor practice.additionally,the alj held that meijer had engaged in an unfair labor practice by allowing fundraising on working time for the union active ballot club,prohibiting employees from soliciting during working time,while simultaneously permitting employees to engage in a specific type of solicitation on behalf of the union during working time.id.at.the alj ordered that meijer cease and desist from prohibiting union activity by employees in its retail lot and promulgating an inconsistent rule of solicitation as evidenced by the active ballot club.id.at.
the board general counsel and meijer both filed exceptions to the decision of the alj and the case was considered by a panel of three board members who issued their decision and order on june.id.at.the board reversed two of the alj holdings.first,it found that the alj erred in imposing a burden upon the general counsel to show that evans had knowledge of caldwell protected activity when he directed caldwell to leave.id.at.the board held that the correct test was an objective one whether the respondent conduct would reasonably tend to interfere with,threaten,or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights.ibid.second,the board held that jamrog october letter to caldwell did not repudiate any illegal conduct because it contained an unlawful prohibition on solicitation and distribution in the retail lot.ibid.the board held that,since there was insufficient evidence that the retail lot was a work area,the prohibition contained in the letter constituted independent unlawful conduct and could not serve as a repudiation.ibid.the board upheld the other portions of the alj decision and issued an order consistent with its findings.id.at.

section seven of the act grants employees the right to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.it is unlawful,under of the act,and an unfair labor practice,to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in their exercise of these rights.a.the board is empowered,through its orders,to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice.a.
recent nlrb case law holds that evidence of employer knowledge is not a necessary element of a a violation t he test is whether the employer conduct would reasonably tend to interfere with,threaten,or coerce employees in the exercise of their section rights.alliance steel,nlrb.the board,in the case at bar,relied on alliance steel products and its interpretation of the act when it held that meijer interference with caldwell real union solicitation on october,was an unfair labor practice.meijer,at.meijer objects to the board construction of the act.it contends that knowledge of the protected nature of the conduct is an essential and requisite element of a a violation.we agree.
contrary to the position of the board,the test must have a subjective element in these cases since t he only restriction that the act places upon an employer right to discharge employees,is that it not be because of union activity or affiliation,nlrb of ohio,cir emphasis added.this proposition has been firmly established since the supreme court seminal interpretation of the act appeared in nlrb jones laughlin steel.
the act does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the employer to select its employees or to discharge them.the employer may not,under cover of that right,intimidate or coerce its employees with respect to their and representation,and,on the other hand,the board is not entitled to make its authority a pretext for interference with the right of discharge when that right is exercised for other reasons than such intimidation and coercion.
similarly,the supreme court decision in nlrb burnup sims,d,supports our holding that a violation of a requires knowledge on the part of an employer.in burnup sims,two employees were dismissed while soliciting for their union because a third employee informed management that the union organizers were prepared to use dynamite to get in if the union drive failed.ibid.the charges turned out to be unfounded,but the employer dismissed the employees because of the alleged statements.id.at.the employer defended itself from the employee unfair labor practices charge by claiming a belief in the veracity of the accusations threatening violence.the supreme court held that the act was violated whatever the employer motive and that honest belief in the truth of the statement was not a defense id.at.the court strongly defended the rights of the employees to participate in protected activities,no matter what their employer believed to be their motive for it.
otherwise the protected activity would lose some of its immunity,since the example of employees who are discharged on false charges would or might have a deterrent effect on other employees.union activity often engenders strong emotions and gives rise to active rumors.a protected activity acquires a precarious status if innocent employees can be discharged while engaging in it,even though the employer acts in good faith.
id.at.important to our analysis today,the court concluded that,so long as an employer knows an employee is engaged in protected activity,the reasons given after the fact are no defense to an unfair labor practices charge 
in sum,a is violated if it is shown that the discharged employee was at the time engaged in a protected activity,that the employer knew it was such,that the basis of the discharge was an alleged act of misconduct in the course of that activity,and that the employee was not,in fact,guilty of that misconduct.
ibid.emphasis added.
our precedents also establish that a a violation contains a knowledge requirement.in air surrey nlrb,cir per curiam,an employer paychecks had recently been returned for insufficient funds.a group of concerned employees then visited the employer bank to determine if their paychecks would be honored.ibid.one of the employees entered the bank to inquire,while the others stayed in the car.ibid.he was informed that,no,there were not enough funds to cover the entire payroll.ibid.a company official later learned of the bank visit and confronted the employee group.ibid.only one admitted to the allegation and he was fired.in vacating the decision of the board finding a violation,we held that an employer must be aware that employees participate in concerted activity under the act 
it has long been the law in our circuit that an employer can not be held in violation of a of the act when it discharges an employee for activity which may in fact be protected under the act but the employer lacks knowledge of its protected character.it is the employer knowledge of an employee protected activity and his subsequent discharge of the employee for engaging in such activity which violates the act.

in nlrb westinghouse electric,cir per curiam,we considered another case of concerted activity.there,one fouty,an employee engaged in war production,became concerned that the wage at his plant,where most of the workers were women,was lower than the wage at a similar plant staffed by men.id.at.fouty was dismissed for agitation.ibid.although there was evidence that fouty had engaged in concerted activity on the wage issue,there was no evidence that westinghouse knew of it.on this evidence,the board found that westinghouse either knew or should have known of fouty connection with the organizational activities,and held that his discharge was an unfair labor practice.ibid.we denied enforcement of the board order 
the inescapable effect of using an objective test is to place upon the employer the duty of ascertaining the existence of union activity and the participation of specific employees in it we think no such duty rested upon the employer or its supervisory employees.we think the record fully discloses that fouty was not discharged for union activities the board also found that fouty discharge violated the act because it interfered with the employees concerted activity without reference to union activity.the evidence does not disclose any knowledge on the part of the employer or its supervisors of any concerted activity or of fouty participation in such activity.
id.at formatting altered.
the board attempts to distinguish air surrey and westinghouse from the facts at bar by noting that the employees in both those cases were discharged for their actions,whereas caldwell was only reprimanded.see br.of resp t at.this argument does not explain why the difference between discharge and discipline should alter any rule.we agree with meijer that it would be an absurd result for us to determine that caldwell may be discharged but not reprimanded where his employer lacks knowledge that his activity was.br.of pet r at.
the board next argues that the correct interpretation of the act is to be found in united parcel service nlrb,cir.it argues from that case that t he test for determining whether an employer has violated section a is whether the employer conduct tends to be coercive or tends to interfere with the employees exercise of their rights.ibid.out of context,this statement appears to support the board position.however,as applied to the case at bar,it is obiter dictum.
in united parcel,the test quoted by the board was utilized to balance the respective rights of the employer and its union employees.ups knew its actions,banning the display of certain union insignia on its uniforms,affected union members rights under the act to some became the role of the court to balance the parties opposing interests and determine if ups actions amounted to a violation of the act.had ups banned pins in general,not knowing that they might contain union content or that their display was concerted activity,and had the alj and the board credited this position,only then would its facts be analogous and its holding applicable here.
the employer motivation was simply not an issue in united parcel.where motivation is an issue,our cases hold that t he board general counsel has the burden of proving that the discharge was impelled by a discriminatory or motive.propak nlrb,cir.see also nlrb howell automatic mach,cir the question as to the company motivation in firing is a factual one to be determined primarily by the trial examiner and the board nlrb,cir the motivation was a question of fact to be determined by the board from consideration of all the evidence.this determination is necessary if we are to comply with jones laughlin command that 
the act does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the employer to discharge its employees the board is not entitled to make its authority a pretext for interference with the right of discharge when that right is exercised for other reasons than violations of the act.
since the act does not interfere with an employer rights to discipline its employees,the board interpretation is inconsistent with the act and in error.if the test were whether the respondent conduct would reasonably tend to interfere with,threaten,or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights,an employer recognized rights would be infringed.for example,if caldwell had been loitering in the retail lot while,evans would clearly have had the authority to ask him to leave,or to discharge him.we hold that where an activity can be either conduct protected by the act or conduct that may be prohibited by an employer,depending upon its relation to concerted or union activity,an employer knowledge is an element of a a violation.in situations identical to the one at bar,caldwell must tell evans that he is distributing union literature and his statements to this effect must be credited at trial.
for these reasons,we deny the board request to enforce and vacate that portion of the order relating to caldwell ejection from the distribution lot on october.
the supreme court has held that the board,in light of its experience,may fashion general rules for application to generic labor disputes.beth israel,at.a bsent special circumstances,certain employer restrictions are presumptive violations of employee rights and unfair labor practices under a.ibid.thus,regarding distribution of union literature by employees r estrictions on employee solicitation during nonworking time,and on distribution during nonworking time in nonworking areas,are violative of a unless the employer justifies them by a showing of special circumstances which make the rule necessary to maintain production or discipline.id.at.footnote omitted.in united parcel,we summarized these rules.
if an area is a work area,the employer may prohibit the distribution of union literature.if it is a area and the union literature is dispersed during time,the employer may not stop the distribution.if the area is a mixed area,meaning that,while some people may use the area for work,most of the employees use it for as a lunch area or a break area the employer still may not prohibit the distribution of union literature.
union access to parking lots has previously been evaluated in this circuit in nlrb ohio masonic home where we adopted language used by the board in medical center,wl.
in,the medical center promulgated a rule prohibiting employees from distributing union literature in the employees parking lot.in holding the rule invalid,the nlrb concluded 
such a rule is valid only if it limits access solely with respect to the interior of the plant and other working areas is clearly disseminated to all employees and applies to employees seeking access to the plant for any purpose and not just to those employees engaging in union activity.

the alj and both parties agree with the rule stated in santa fe hotel,nlrb,that s ome work tasks are performed at some time in almost every area of every company,so i n order to constitute a work area,an area must be integral not merely incidental,to the employer main function.meijer,at.
the alj held,and the board affirmed,that meijer retail lot was not a working area 
the primary purpose of the respondent retail store parking lots is to provide customer and employee parking.they are also places where employees perform a variety of periodic or sporadic work activities.utility clerks periodically retrieve shopping carts and,as necessary,assist customers load purchases.sporadically,the respondent employees display merchandise or conduct sidewalk sales and other promotional events.unlike the stores,there are no employees permanently stationed in the parking lots,there are no cash registers and no constant interaction.there are also occasions when other companies are permitted to hold promotional events,like nascar racing,united way fundraisers,and coca children activities.however,these functions are merely incidental to the respondent primary business of selling merchandise inside its stores.indeed,the respondent treats its parking lots as an incidental function by permitting its employees to flout the directive to park on the outer portions,thereby preventing customers from parking closer to the store.
as depicted in videotape of store parking lot,there is a continuous,albeit dispersed,flow of pedestrian and vehicular activity throughout the park
