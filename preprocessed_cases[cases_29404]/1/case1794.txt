on february,longaberger filed a complaint commencing suit against kolt and samuel billiter alleging causes of action for constructive trust,equitable lien,and unjust enrichment longaberger also sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent kolt from disbursing,commingling,or transferring settlement funds that were in kolt iolta.the district court granted a limited temporary restraining order preventing kolt and samuel billiter from disbursing any further funds and requiring the preservation of the identifiable settlement funds paid on claims arising out of the june,automobile accident involving samuel billiter.following a february,evidentiary hearing on longaberger motion for preliminary injunction,the district court also enjoined kolt from dissipating the he was still holding in his iolta.
on february,longaberger amended its complaint to name kolt as a defendant in his capacities as an individual and as a trustee,and theresa billiter as a defendant.the amended complaint alleged claims against all named defendants for constructive trust,equitable lien,unjust enrichment,an accounting,equitable estoppel,and conversion,and against kolt only for tortious interference with contract and breach of constructive trust.thereafter,kolt filed an april,motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that an attorney retained by an erisa plan beneficiary who receives settlement funds from a third party does not have any duty under erisa to account to the erisa plan for the proceeds received and can not be held liable.the district court issued a june,decision in which it dismissed a number of longaberger claims,but allowed the erisa claims for constructive trust,equitable lien,and unjust enrichment to proceed.
on november,longaberger filed its second amended complaint,adding the longaberger family of companies group health plan as an additional plaintiff and dropping theresa billiter as a named defendant.in addition,longaberger clarified its position seeking equitable lien by agreement in light of the supreme court holding in sereboff mid atl.med,d,which altered the controlling law in the present case.
in june,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted longaberger motion for summary judgment and denied kolt summary judgment motion.specifically,the district held that 
longaberger automatically acquired a valid lien on the tort recovery fund when the funds became identifiable.in addition,longaberger seeks equitable rather than legal restitution because the plan specifies a particular amount and a particular fund from which restitution should be paid.
accordingly,the district court ruled in favor of longaberger and against kolt in the amount of and against samuel billiter in the amount of.
kolt timely appealed samuel billiter did not appeal.
kolt argues that the district court erred by awarding longaberger equitable restitution against him.he maintains that because the majority of the settlement funds in his iolta had already been disbursed before longaberger initiated its suit,longaberger was pursuing a claim for money damages rather than equitable relief against him,and such claims are outside the scope of erisa permissible remedies.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.williamson aetna life ins,cir.summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the moving party bears the burden of proving the absence of genuine issues of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.

in sereboff,the supreme court discussed the validity of equitable liens created by provisions similar to those in this case and held that erisa plans can enforce complete reimbursement of their equitable liens.marlene sereboff and her husband,joel,were injured in a car accident in california.at.through marlene employer,the sereboffs received health insurance benefits related to the car accident,which were administered by mid atlantic medical services,mid atlantic,pursuant to erisa.id.the plan act of third parties provision provided that if the sereboffs received benefits for an injury or illness and later recovered damages related to a tort claim against a third party for that injury or illness,the sereboffs,as beneficiaries,would reimburse mid atlantic for the benefits they received.id.at.the sereboffs sued several third parties seeking damages for their injuries,and eventually settled their claims for,but they did not reimburse mid atlantic.id.at.
mid atlantic sued to enforce its lien under a of erisa,arguing that it was entitled to reimbursement as a matter of equity.id.in finding for mid atlantic,the sereboff court relied on justice holmes reasoning in barnes alexander,in which an attorney promised other attorneys of a contingent fee for their assistance in a case.sereboff,at.in barnes,justice holmes stated for the court 
the familiar rul e of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.on the basis of this rule,he concluded that the lead attorney undertaking create d a lien upon the portion of the monetary recovery due to the lead attorney from the client,which the assisting attorneys could follow into the hands of the lead attorney,as soon as the fund was identified.
id.at.quoting barnes,at.first,third,and seventh alterations in original internal citations omitted.the sereboff court found that the terms of mid atlantic plan created a lien similar to the one in barnes because the plan terms specifically identified a particular fund,distinct from the sereboffs general assets a ll recoveries from a third party and a particular share of that fund to which mid atlantic was entitled that portion of the total recovery which is due mid atlantic for benefits paid.id.at.alterations in original internal citations and quotations marks omitted.accordingly,the supreme court held that mid atlantic could pursue an action for appropriate equitable relief and because the lien by agreement attached when the fund was identified,mid atlantic was free to follow a portion of the recovery into the sereboffs hands.id.quoting barnes,at.first alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
kolt argues that b ecause of longaberger delay and inaction,there is no longer any specifically identifiable fund in kolt possession on which longaberger lien can be imposed.yet,an equitable lien by agreement does not require tracing or maintenance of a fund in order for equity to allow repayment.in sereboff,the supreme court stated 
barnes confirms that no tracing requirement of the sort asserted by the sereboffs applies to equitable liens by agreement or assignment the plaintiffs in barnes could not identify an asset they originally possessed,which was improperly acquired and converted into property the defendant held,yet that did not preclude them from securing an equitable lien.
id.at.the court also noted that the fund over which a lien is asserted need not be in existence when the contract containing the lien provision is executed.id.at.what is required,however,is that the agreement specifically identify a particular fund distinct from the defendant general assets and a particular share of that fund to which the plan was entitled.gilchrest unum life ins.of,cir unpublished citing sereboff,at.see also gutta standard select trust ins.plans,cir allowing a claim under a even if the benefits it paid the beneficiary are not specifically traceable to the beneficiary current assets because of commingling or dissipation.bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot wansbrough,cir allowing an erisa plan to recover the settlement proceeds that the plan beneficiary law firm had deposited into its trust account.but knudson,at.defendant never had collected a tort recovery because it was held by a california trustee,not by defendant.
here,the plan contains clear and unambiguous reimbursement provisions,indicating that its rights of reimbursement and subrogation are reserved whether the liability of a third party arises in tort,contract or otherwise and attach to any full or partial judgment,settlement or other recovery.moreover,the explicit terms of the plan state that it shall automatically have a first priority lien upon the proceeds of any recovery by you or your dependent s from such party to the extent of any benefits provided to you or your dependent s by the plan.the plan language thus identifies a fund distinct from the beneficiary general assets the proceeds of any recovery by you or your dependents s from a third party,and identifies a particular share of that fund to which the plan is entitled the extent of any benefits provided to you or your dependent s by the plan.accordingly,longaberger equitable lien attached to the settlement fund when it was identified and received in july.indeed,kolt conceded at the district court february,hearing that he probably was aware at the time he wrote his august,letter to longaberger,stating that billiter would like to try to amicabl y satisfy his subrogation obligation to longaberger,that the plan contained language that indicates the plan has a first priority lien and first priority claim over funds recovered from third parties 
kolt argues,however,that sereboff and gilchrest do not apply to him because he was neither a plan fiduciary nor a beneficiary of the plan.in ward wal mart stores,wl,at cir,unpublished table decision,this court upheld a district court decision to award reimbursement to an erisa plan,but reversed the district court decision to deduct a pro rata share of attorney fees from the amount of the reimbursement.the ward panel also stated that t he plan may then file suit against the attorneys to recover the remaining of the amount it is due.id.at.longaberger contends that ward is established precedent that allows an erisa plan to seek reimbursement from an attorney for taking a fee on funds which belong to an erisa plan.kolt counters that this single sentence in the ward opinion is dicta and has no precedential effect.see johnson city of cincinnati,cir stockler garratt,cir.moreover,because ward is an unpublished decision,it is not precedentially binding on this panel,but may be considered for its persuasive value.thompson am.stainless,lp,cir en banc citing united states sanford,cir.
in mertens,the supreme court ruled that damages,or legal remedies,were not recoverable under of erisa,which allows only for equitable relief.at.see also varity howe,d.thus,the issue that the ward panel did not address is whether an erisa plan suit to recover plan funds from a beneficiary attorney,who is neither a fiduciary nor beneficiary himself of the plan,is within the scope of appropriate equitable relief allowed by a.if such a suit is not equitable in nature,the district court must be reversed.
to be sure,a limits the universe of potential plaintiffs who may bring a civil action for equitable relief to a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary of an erisa plan.the act,however,does not contain a similar provision limiting the class of defendants in a a action.the supreme court recognized this in harris trust sav.bank salomon smith barney,d in which it noted that a admits of no limit aside from the appropriate equitable relief caveat on the universe of possible defendants.indeed,while other provisions of erisa expressly identify the individuals or entities subject to suit,a makes no mention at all of which parties may be proper defendants.id.accordingly,there is no statutory barrier that prevents kolt from being a defendant in a suit brought pursuant to a of erisa,provided that the relief sought lies in equity.
here,longaberger asserted an action for equitable in rem relief under a in which it sought to recover its assets through use of a constructive trust and reimbursement lien.longaberger properly identified a specific fund,that portion of the settlement funds equaling the amount longaberger paid to cover samuel billiter medical expenses that was in the possession and legal control of kolt,but belonged in good conscience to the plan.the fact that kolt chose to disregard longaberger first priority lien and commingle the settlement funds does not defeat longaberger claim for equitable relief,because under sereboff,longaberger was free to follow a portion of the settlement funds into kolt hands.we therefore hold that the plan sought and was awarded appropriate equitable relief from kolt 
in its motion for injunctive relief,longaberger stated that if kolt disburses or otherwise commingles or uses the settlement funds which he holds in constructive trust for the benefit of the plan,the plan will forever lose the ability to recover its property.moreover,longaberger represented that it was not seeking to enforce its contractual right to reimbursement from billiter.instead,longaberger,on behalf of the plan,sought title to or a security interest in a particular,identifiable account namely,the settlement funds in kolt iolta account.longaberger argued that it would be irreparably harmed if an injunction were not granted because i f the money leaves the iolta,longaberger would be left without recourse and would be unable to enforce the terms of the plan.apparently persuaded by longaberger arguments,the district court granted a preliminary injunction on february,which required kolt to maintain any remaining settlement funds in his iolta during the pendency of this litigation.
on may,the supreme court issued its decision in sereboff which held that funds no longer had to be traceable or maintained in order for relief to qualify as equitable under erisa.because of sereboff,longaberger filed a second amended complaint on november,which clarified its position seeking equitable lien by agreement in light of the supreme court decision and ruling.longaberger also argued in its summary judgment briefing that repayment of funds that have already been disbursed from kolt iolta was an available remedy under erisa.
kolt argues on appeal that longaberger claims for monetary relief should be barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel because arguments longaberger made in its initial pleadings,and on which the district court relied in issuing a preliminary injunction,were in conflict with those arguments longaberger later presented in its motion for summary judgment.judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that preserves the integrity of the courts by preventing a party from abusing the judicial process through cynical gamesmanship,achieving success on one position,then arguing the opposite to suit an exigency of the moment.teledyne,nlrb,cir see also new hampshire maine,d.the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars a party from asserting a position that is contrary to one that the party has asserted under oath in a prior proceeding,where the prior court adopted the contrary position either as a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition.browning levy,cir quoting teledyne,at.the doctrine of judicial estoppel,however,is applied with caution to avoid impinging on the function of the court because the doctrine precludes a contradictory position without examining the truth of either statement.teledyne,at footnote omitted.moreover,a court should consider whether a party has gained an unfair advantage from the court adoption of its earlier inconsistent statement.new hampshire,at.
the issue of judicial estoppel combined with a change in law appears to be an issue of first impression in our circuit.in such cases,this court routinely looks to our sister circuits for guidance.united states houston,cir clay,dissenting.several of our sister circuits have held that judicial estoppel is inappropriate when a party is merely changing its position in response to a change in the law.see jarrard cdi,cir judicial estoppel should not be used to work an injustice,particularly when the defendants change in position resulted from circumstances outside their control namely,a change in controlling state law.internal citation omitted folio city of clarksburg,cir judicial estoppel not invoked where second position was based upon a change in the law united states vastola,cir same maui land pineapple occidental chem,d,explaining that the application of judicial estoppel is inappropriate when a party is merely changing its position in response to a change in the law.citing arizona shamrock foods,cir finding no judicial estoppel when a party altered its theory of recovery in response to a change in law seneca nation of indians new york,d,aff,cir.moreover,other courts have found that judicial estoppel bars changes in factual positions and does not extend to inconsistent opinions or legal positions.okland oil conoco,cir,appeal after remand,cir unpublished table decision ottema state ex rel.wyomin
