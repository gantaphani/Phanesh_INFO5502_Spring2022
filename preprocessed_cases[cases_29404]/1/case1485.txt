simmon menghesha fled his native country of ethiopia on july,the day he learned that government officials had discovered his role in thwarting the arrest of protestors.the following day,menghesha arrived in the united states and sought asylum under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.menghesha maintained that if returned to ethiopia,he would suffer arrest,imprisonment,and torture on account of the political opinion he expressed through verbal critiques of the government and by his actions to frustrate the arrest of nonviolent protestors.the immigration judge ij denied menghesha asylum request based on a belief that the ethiopian government desired to prosecute menghesha for obstruction of justice.the ij failed,however,to consider whether the government possessed coexisting illicit motives for taking action against menghesha.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij determination,rendering menghesha removable to ethiopia.because we find that the ij misapplied the law in denying menghesha request for asylum,we grant menghesha petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings.
following is a recitation of undisputed facts adduced in menghesha asylum application and hearing testimony.in the absence of contrary evidence or an adverse credibility determination,we accept menghesha uncontested account as true.menghesha was born in addis ababa,ethiopia on may.after graduating from high school,he became actively involved in the ethiopian people revolutionary democratic front and tigray people liberation front,the political party presently in power.in november,having been identified as a committed member,menghesha was offered a position with the government security services.after six months of training,menghesha was assigned to a government security detail.
as a member of the security detail,menghesha was directed to spy on meetings of groups opposed to the government.menghesha first carried out this task in september,when,undercover,he attended a meeting of the all amhara people organization on the occasion of the death of that organization leader.during the meeting,the leader of the undercover team summoned the riot police to suppress the allegedly unruly crowd.on their arrival,the riot police began to beat and arrest attendees who refused to disperse.those who were arrested were detained for two days without bathroom access.menghesha expressed his discontent about how the attendees were treated in a subsequent security meeting.at that time,his superiors warned him not to criticize the government and told him that such conduct would harm him.
in april,menghesha was assigned to a team to identify behavior at a meeting organized by the head of the ethiopian human rights council.because menghesha did not observe any illegal conduct,he did not furnish any information leading to arrests.consequently,government officials accused him and his colleague yohannes assefa of being in sympathy with the opposition,threatened them with arrest,and told them they would be watched closely.
about a week later,menghesha undercover team attended a meeting of disgruntled addis ababa university students.while a security officer negotiated with students regarding their demands for increased freedom,menghesha and his colleagues interacted with other students and collected information on student leaders.when negotiations failed,the security team received orders to arrest five students identified as opposition leaders.the team was directed to use any means necessary to effectuate the arrests,including deadly force.menghesha was disturbed by the order to use deadly force.id.at.he felt the students were asking the right questions and could not comprehend why the government was behaving this way.id.
menghesha discussed the arrest orders with assefa.disgusted by what was transpiring,they resolved to warn the five students in question.having seen others beaten and killed upon arrest,menghesha feared that the students would meet the same fate unless he intervened.further,he sympathized with the students because their request was right and peaceful.id.at.when the security officers arrived on campus to make arrests,the five students were gone,although other security teams arrested those students they were assigned to locate.word of the arrests spread,and students mobilized to resist and protest.troops moved in to control the students and a deadly riot ensued.
thereafter,the security department began to investigate who had warned the five students.menghesha and assefa came under suspicion when security department officials learned that they had been at the university on the afternoon before the arrests,a fact they had failed to report.as there was no proof of wrongdoing,the security department modified the men duties pending further investigation,but took no other action.
on july,menghesha and assefa learned that their role in thwarting the arrests had been discovered by government officials.that same day,menghesha and assefa boarded a plane bound for the united states.with that,menghesha fled the country,without saying goodbye or retrieving any belongings,and despite his apparent plans to marry.on arrival the next day,the two surrendered to immigration authorities and told their story.
at his asylum hearing,menghesha introduced documentary evidence,including the state department country report on ethiopia,to substantiate his testimony.although assefa was available to testify,the parties simply stipulated to his corroborative testimony.the immigration and naturalization service ins did not introduce evidence at the hearing,offering only opening and closing remarks 
after reviewing the evidence,the ij denied menghesha requests for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij expressed the view that as a sworn law enforcement official it was not for menghesha to pick and choose among which of the persons he was directed to arrest.he stated,if menghesha took exception to any action that the government might engage,including the arrest of students who were expressing their opposition to the government of ethiopia,menghesha had it within his ability to resign from his position as a law enforcement official.id.at.the ij concluded that menghesha fears prosecution for his criminal act of obstruction of justice,and that this may not form the rational basis upon which the court can conclude that he would be persecuted on account of his political opinion or any of the four remaining bases upon which asylum may be granted.id.at.the ij thus denied menghesha asylum request without making additional factual findings that might undermine menghesha entitlement to asylum.
on may,the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.menghesha timely appealed the bia order,challenging only the denial of his petition for asylum.
section b of the ina,b,gives the attorney general authority to grant asylum to an alien meeting the statutory definition of a refugee.under the ina,a refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country due to a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.to satisfy this test,an asylum applicant must demonstrate the presence of a protected ground and he must link the feared persecution,at least in part,to it.saldarriaga gonzales,cir,petition for cert.filed.
where,as here,the bia engages in the streamlined review process set forth in e by simply adopting the ij conclusion without opinion,the ij decision becomes the final agency decision subject to our review.see camara ashcroft,cir see also,when the bia summarily affirms the ij decision,the immigration judge decision becomes the decision reviewed.accordingly,the ij findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.we review the ij legal conclusions de novo,giving appropriate deference to its interpretations of the ina.nwolise ins,cir citing chevron,nrdc,d.the ij ultimate decision with regard to menghesha eligibility for asylum must be upheld unless it is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d see also li gonzales,cir saldarriaga,at ngarurih ashcroft,cir blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir.an ij abuses its discretion in making an error of law.see united states pearce,cir citing koon united states,d.
thus,where,as here,the ij misapplies the law in evaluating a request for asylum,the appropriate remedy is to remand so that the agency may apply the correct legal standard in the first instance.see ins ventura,d per curiam stating that remand is required where the agency has yet to address a legal question pertinent to the asylum determination.see also phommasoukha gonzales,cir when the bia applies an incorrect legal standard,the proper remedy typically is to remand the case to the agency for further consideration in light of the correct standard.accord qiu ashcroft,cir griffiths ins,cir asani ins,cir ins,cir.
in denying menghesha request for asylum,the ij committed legal,if not factual,error.in this respect,this case must be distinguished from the many instances in which we have considered whether the bia factual findings justified a denial of asylum.see,saldarriaga,at ngarurih,at blanco de belbruno,at.we resolved those cases under the extremely deferential standard of review applicable to factual determinations.in this instance,however,we are concerned with the ij legal conclusions,not factual findings.we find that the ij erred as a matter of law in holding menghesha to an overly stringent legal standard proving that political persecution was the government sole motive.
specifically,the ij erred in discontinuing his inquiry after identifying the ethiopian government arguably legitimate motive to prosecute menghesha under the ina standard,an asylum applicant need only show that the alleged persecutor is motivated in part to persecute him on account of a protected trait recognizing that persecutors often have multiple motives for punishing an asylum applicant,the ina requires only that an applicant prove that one of those motives is prohibited under the ina.see,mohideen gonzales,cir the ina reference to persecution on account of one of the specified grounds does not mean persecution solely on account of one of those grounds.accord lukwago ashcroft,cir citing chang ins,cir girma ins,cir borja ins,cir en banc osorio ins,cir in re,bia.
thus,even assuming that the ethiopian government had a lawful motive for prosecuting menghesha,the ij had an obligation to consider the evidence of political motive.in other words,an ij may not treat the presence of a nonpolitical motive as evidence of the absence of a political motive.tarubac ins,cir.indeed,in in re nagy,the bia did not dismiss the possibility of an impermissible motive purely because there was a valid basis for prosecuting the applicant,namely her violation of the time limits placed on her travel abroad.at.rather,the bia searched the record for evidence of an unlawful persecutory motive.id.at.finding no evidence of impermissible motive,the bia denied the relief sought.id.at.
unlike the bia in in re nagy,the ij here did not consider the uncontested evidence of political motive.for instance,the ij did not address the fact that menghesha was threatened with harm if he continued to criticize the government handling of dissidents he was accused of being in sympathy with the student protestors and he was subjected to close scrutiny and threatened with arrest for sympathizing with the students.in this respect,the ij failed to comply with in re nagy,and effectively held menghesha to a more onerous standard than is required under the ina.we conclude that the ij analysis of menghesha asylum claim was incomplete.accordingly,we set aside the ij determination,which was manifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion,and remand so that the agency may evaluate menghesha entitlement to asylum according to the correct legal standard 
for the reasons stated above,we grant the petition for review and vacate the bia denial of asylum.we,however,do not decide whether,applying the correct standard,menghesha is entitled to asylum.instead,we remand that such a determination may be made in the first instance.
petition for review granted vacated and remanded.
i would deny menghesha petition for review and affirm the bia.while i agree with the majority that the ina contains a standard and that we must remand the case if the ij misapplied the law,ante at,i believe the ij properly applied the ina in determining that menghesha failed to qualify for asylum.i view this as a typical asylum case,where the ij factual determinations should be given great deference.for the reasons explained herein,i would respect congress will,follow supreme court precedent,and deny the petition for review.see b a west placing asylum decisions within the purview of the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general ins,d recognizing that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context.
my colleagues decision is based on their conclusion that the ij failed to apply the correct standard.ante at.respectfully,i disagree.in order to qualify as a refugee,menghesha must show a well founded fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a west emphasis added.in this case,menghesha argues that he fears persecution on account of his political opinion.the phrase on account of requires that menghesha show that persecution because of his political opinion was a motivating force on the ethiopian government,although not necessarily the sole motivating force.thus,my colleagues are correct that menghesha need only show that the ethiopian government was motivated to persecute him in part because of his political opinion.
where i part ways with the majority,however,is with its unsupported statement that the ij required menghesha to show that the government planned to persecute menghesha based solely on his political opinion.ante at.the ij oral opinion never stated that menghesha must show that he fears persecution based solely on his political opinion.the ij never stated that he was rejecting menghesha mixed motive argument as a matter of law.menghesha,in fact,did not specifically make a mixed motive argument below.
as the majority properly recognizes,however,a petitioner need not make a mixed motive argument because the legal standard articulated in the statute itself allows for the possibility of multiple motives.thus,as was pointed out at oral argument,there is no other kind of case than a mixed motive case.accordingly,menghesha only needed to argue that he fell within the ambit of the statute,which is understood to mean that he was required to show,inter alia,that the government sought to persecute him at least in part because of a protected ground.of course,in recognizing that menghesha did not have to argue this point below because it is merely the proper legal standard,ante at,it seems odd to require more of the ij who elucidated the proper legal standard but simply did not expressly use the term mixed motive if menghesha need only argue that he falls within the ina ambit,we should not require the ij to say anymore than that menghesha falls outside of that ambit.indeed,the ij correctly stated the applicable law.see at menghesha must meet the definition of a refugee which requires him to show that a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution on account of one or more of the five protected enumerated grounds.
moreover,the ij found that menghesha failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on account of his political opinion.the ij made a specific finding of fact that menghesha failed to sustain his burden of proof and persuasion that there is a reasonable possibility of his persecution in the future on account of one or more of the five protected enumerated grounds.at emphasis added.see,ins,d gao ashcroft,cir whether an asylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution or a fear of future persecution is a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.jahed ins,cir kozinski,dissenting whether persecution is on account of a petiti
