summary calendar 
startran,challenging its five hundred dollar fine for its violation of regulations under the occupational safety and health act of osha or the act,appeals the determination by the occupational safety and health commission the commission that startran is not exempt from the act under the provision of stating that for purposes of the act employer does not include any political subdivision of a state.on startran previous appeal from the commission september,decision rejecting startran said claim and affirming the decision of the commission administrative law judge following an evidentiary hearing,we remanded to the commission for reconsideration.startran,occupational safety and health commission,fed.appx.cir startran i.the commission thereafter remanded the case to the commission administrative law judge alj.the alj subsequently issued his ruling without taking any further evidence holding that startran was not exempt as a political subdivision under section.although startran petitioned the commission for discretionary review of that decision,the commission did not direct review.thus the alj decision on remand became the final order of the commission under j.startran has timely petitioned this court for review under a.
context facts and legal background 
the words political subdivision appearing in section are not defined in the act.similarly,the national labor relations act nlra,which likewise covers employers and provides that the term employer shall not include any state or political subdivision thereof,contains no definition of political subdivision.in natural gas util.dist.of hawkins county,the supreme court considered whether the nlrb had correctly held that the utility district was not a political subdivision so as to be exempt from the nlra under section.the court noted that 
the board has limited the exemption for political subdivisions to entities that are either created directly by the state,so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government,or administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate.
id.at in holding that the nlrb had erred in determining in light of the board own test that utility district was not a political subdivision,id.at,the court went on to say 
the board found that the employer in this case is neither created directly by the state,nor administered by or elected officials,at footnotes omitted.but the board test is not whether the entity is administered by or elected officials.rather,alternative of the test is whether the entity is administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate emphasis added,and the tennessee statute makes crystal clear that respondent the district is administered by a board of commissioners appointed by an elected county judge,and subject to removal proceedings at the instance of the governor,the county prosecutor,or private citizens.
about seven months after the supreme court decision in the hawkins county case,the secretary of labor promulgated,a new regulation interpreting,for the first time,the political subdivision exemption of section,at,january.that regulation has not since been amended.as the secretary brief herein correctly states 
the regulation sets out the following two tests for a state political subdivision,which ask whether the entity has been created directly by the state so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the state government or administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate.b.
the secretary and startran treat the foregoing two alternative tests as being essentially the same as the above quoted test set out in the hawkins county case.at,for the nlra political subdivision exemption.in what appears to be the first reported judicial decision construing the section,the seventh circuit in brock chicago zoological,cir,stated 
the secretary of labor regulations set forth a test for determining whether an entity is a state or political subdivision.under this test,any entity that is created directly by the state,so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the government,or administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general public will be deemed to be a state or political subdivision under.b.this test is identical to the formula the national labor relations board has long used to determine whether an entity is a political subdivision exempt from the board jurisdiction under.id.at citing hawkins county 
startran claim of exemption as a political subdivision relies on the second alternative test of section b namely that it is administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate is grounded on its relationship to capital metropolitan transit capital metro in austin,texas.
capital metro was established in under texas law then.stat.it assumed the assets of the former city of austin transit system.capital metro operates under chapter of the texas transportation code.see.transportation code a,and is a public political entity and corporate body that exercises public and essential governmental functions.its board of directors is responsible for its management,operations and control,and employs a general manager or chief executive officer administering its daily operations see id.the undisputed and unchallenged evidence is that capital metro board of directors consists of seven members,five of whom are elected public officials.it is indisputably a political subdivision of the state of texas,and its officers and directors are indisputably public officials.
prior to the creation of startran and its contract with capital metro effective january,capital metro and before it,the city of austin contracted with management labor services mls,an outside contractor,for labor and possible other services for operation of the austin transit system.with the ending of capital metro relationship with mls the reasons for which are not reflected in the record,in order to continue to be eligible for federal financial assistance of certain kinds provided under the federal transit act it was apparently necessary,inter alia,to preserve the collective bargaining rights of the mls employees covered by the then collective bargaining agreement between mls and amalgamated transit union local who had been servicing the capital metro operations.see b however,capital metro,as a political subdivision of the state of texas,is prohibited by texas law from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor union or recognizing a union as the bargaining agent for its employees.see texas government code in an effort to qualify for federal financial assistance under the federal transit act,while not violating those prohibitions of texas law,capital metro,by resolution of its board of directors in november formed startran as a nonprofit corporation under the texas nonprofit corporation act,on december.
thereafter,on december,effective january,startran and capital metro entered into a contract by which startran generally agreed to employ and provide to capital metro the services of drivers and mechanics and others in capital metro mass transit operations and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the existing collective agreements with unions.the december,capital contract recites that 
whereas,to ensure compliance with both state and federal law,it is necessary for capital metro to obtain certain services from an independent entity which can recognize the collective bargaining rights of those persons who provide mass transit service for capital metro 
the contract between capital metro and startran,as amended in,rewrites the original contract article ii status of startran to add,among other things,a provision,that 
capital metro shall have no right to supervise or control the duties and activities of startran so as to cause a violation of the provisions of chapter of the texas government code or section.it is the intent of the parties that,for purposes of collective bargaining,startran is an independent corporate entity which shall in no way be deemed to be an affiliate,partner,subsidiary,joint venturer,or otherwise under the control of capital metro.
the testimony of the president of the local union representing the startran bus drivers and mechanics,called as a witness by the secretary,was that capital metro had to approve any proposed collective bargaining agreement.there was no evidence contrary to this testimony or to the witness assertion that capital metro had never refused such approval.the union president likewise testified that he had discussed many personnel and collective bargaining issues of concern to him as union president with gilliam the general manager of capital metro or his predecessor at capital metro,and that in the last three years he had had several meetings with gilliam and also the board of directions of capital metro relating to the issues we had to deal with.he further explained w hen we ca get something done by working at startran,we go on to the next step or we go to gilliam.and then if we ca get it done there,we go to the capital metro board and we go public.again,this testimony was not controverted 
there is no evidence of any or any official or agency under the nlra,or by any court,that startran is or is not an employer covered by the nlra or is or is not a political subdivision under section.however,startran does not,and apparently has never,taken the position that it is not covered by the nlra.there does not appear to be any ruling by any texas court or agency,or by the texas attorney general,respecting whether or not startran is a political subdivision of the state of texas within the meaning of section of the texas government code see note,supra.startran has claimed it is entitled to governmental immunity under the texas tort claims act see.civ.prac,ch,b and apparently one or two trial courts have agreed in unpublished orders and it is insured through the texas municipal league intergovernmental risk pool,which insures only governmental entities.
as amended in the capital agreement provided that startran would p rovide safety and other training the original agreement included safety and other training among the matters to be provided by capital metro.the undisputed evidence is that an employee of capital metro,its safety director who reported to capital metro risk manager also a capital metro employee,established and from time to time amended the safety program and the safety training program which were applicable and applied to startran and capital metro and their employees,and conducted and supervised training exercises thereunder.however,discipline of bargaining unit employees for safety violations,or otherwise,was handled by startran and the union under the collective bargaining agreement.the evidence also established that startran and capital metro are both subject to and in compliance with the federal transit administration requirement to have a safety program which that agency reviews every three years,as well as to state law safety program requirements.
the capital agreement has always contained the provision that the services to be provided by capital metro shall be ministerial only,and that startran shall retain absolute and real control over all matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment,supervision,and control of its employees.the undisputed evidence is that at all times capital metro has furnished all the buses which are all marked as being capital metro buses the drivers wear startran or startran in service to capital metro uniform shirts,and other equipment,facilities and office space,and has determined the fares,routes and schedules for the bus service,as well as furnished all insurance and all clerical,budgeting and accounting services,and all funds to startran.startran has no source of funds or revenue other than capital metro.any startran expenditure must be approved by capital metro.startran has at no time had any assets other than its employees 
the capital contract has never had any fixed term and has always been expressly terminable by either party giving days written notice of its intent to do so.
startran does not have,and has never had,any business relationship with any other party other than capital metro or the union and does not,and has never,furnished employees or services to any entity other than capital metro.it does not and could not exist or function apart from its relationship with capital metro.
the startran board of directors consists of the five persons who hold specified executive positions with startran director of transportation,superintendent of maintenance,director of maintenance,director of special transit services,and manager of labor relations.the persons holding those positions are each startran employees who are selected by the president and general manager of capital metro fred gilliam,elected to that position by the capital metro board.if and when any such startran employee ceases to hold such specified startran executive position,he or she ceases to be a member of the startran board of directors,and his or her successor in that executive position assumes that place on the startran board.the president of capital metro hires these startran executives,fixes their compensation which is funded by capital metro and has the power to transfer them to other startran positions and hence to remove them from the startran board and to appoint another startran employee to that specified executive position and hence to that place on the startran board.those startran executives are at will employees who may be terminated by the president of capital metro.all this is according to the of startran,as testified to without objection by its president and manager of labor relations,ken mcculloch who had the startran with him while testifying and is unquestioned further,mcculloch testified that gilliam,as ceo of capital metro,is his mcculloch boss as president and labor relations manager of startran.similarly,dan peabody,startran board member and director of transportation,testified that his boss as director of transportation is fred gilliam,the ceo of capital metro.peabody,as startran director of transportation,and steve herrera,the startran director of maintenance,each have scheduled biweekly meetings with gilliam,capital metro ceo,as transportation and maintenance are the two largest components of startran.peabody further testified 
and then on a monthly basis gilliam meets with the startran board of directors.and then for me,i usually have a phone conversation with gilliam on a daily basis or i have scheduled meetings with him to where i bring him up to speed on some of the things that we doing.
again,he is your boss is that correct 
that correct.he works on developing my pmp,which is your evaluation system,through which we receive our raises on an annual basis.
peabody specifically testified that mcculloch startran president and director of labor relations was not his boss and that he did not report to mcculloch at all.finally,peabody explained that when an ice storm hit the area he made recommendations to gilliam,and gilliam made the final decision,as to what levels of bus service,if any,would be provided throughout that day.
discussion 
in our prior opinion we vacated the commission decision and remanded for reconsideration because the commission had failed to properly acknowledge the actual evidence regarding control of startran board.we also noted that the secretary in her brief does not appear to find the commission public control factor significant or determinative and that the secretary in her brief emphasizes startran day to day control of its employees instead of capital metro control of startran board.we stated that b ecause the commission and the secretary appear to set forth somewhat different interpretations of the regulation at issue section,on remand the commission should defer to the secretary interpretation,to the extent that it is reasonable,citing martin occupational safety and health review commission.
on remand,the alj became the decision of the startran was not a political subdivision under section basically rested on the alj determination,based on the original hearing record,that capital metro might ultimately have the authority to dismiss a member of startran board or its president does not nullify the fact that it is startran that controls the day to day working conditions of its employees and that those factors that relate to the control of employees,including employee health and safety,demonstrate that such controls sic lies almost exclusively with startran.therefore,for purposes of the act,startran is not a political subdivision of the state of texas.
the undisputed evidence is that startran entire board of directors,and each of its executives,all of whom are at will employees,are appointed and subject to removal by capital metro board of directors its ceo who are public officials,acting in their sole discretion and without any requirement of cause,their compensation is fixed by capital metro ceo who may terminate or transfer them at will and is wholly funded by capital metro,and the startran executives heading its departments report to the capital metro ceo not to the startran president and regard him as their boss.under any reasonable reading of the language of section b,one can only conclude that startran is administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials,as stated therein 
the secretary contends that the decisions in brock chicago zoological society,cir,and tricil resources brock,cir,the only reported circuit court decisions addressing section,support the decision on remand.in chicago zoological society,the issue was whether the society,a private,nonprofit corporation created in,came within the second alternative test under section b by reason of its relationship with the local illinois forest preserve district the district,a local governmental entity,by reason of the society contract with the district under which the society was given the entire control and management of the zoo,located on land owned by the district.in holding that the society was not a political subdivision under section b,the court noted that under the society charter and it is managed by its person board of trustees,of whom only one is a public official the president of the district board.the society board of trustees is elected by its governing members,of whom only four are public officials.id.at.the court went on to say 
the society board of trustees is responsible for developing zoo policies and electing officers,including the president,who oversees the operations of the zoo.the district has no appointment and removal power and no direct role in the zoo operation and maintenance.
the society private,nonprofit corporate structure effectively insulates its officers from district control over management decisions.the officers,who handle the zoo operations,owe their positions to the trustees and,indirectly,to the governing members.among these latter two groups the district enjoys only nominal representation.over of the trustees and over of the governing members are private citizens unbeholden to the district or any other state agency.considering in addition that the district possesses no power to appoint or remove the society managerial officers,those officers clearly do not owe the sort of direct personal accountability to public officials or to the general public that would entitle the society to a political subdivision exemption,at emphasis added.
the present case is the polar opposite of chicago zoological society.moreover,the foregoing language from that opinion is clear that what is relevant for purposes of the section b alternative test is whether a governmental entity capital metro public officer capital metro ceo has the power to appoint and remove the board the managerial officers of the putative political subdivision startran 
the sixth circuit decision in tricil resource,followed and relied on the seventh circuit decision in chicago zoological society.in tricil the issue was whether tricil resources tricil fell within the political subdivision test under section b.the sixth circuit held it did not.tricil was a private for profit corporation which,under contract with the city,for some three and a half years,ran the daily operations of the city owned plant which converted garbage to energy sold by the city.under the contract,the city paid tricil an annual minimum fee,and reimbursed it all costs and expenses it incurred while managing the plant,and also would pay tricil a bonus if the net plant operating income exceeded what had been projected.during the three and a half years tricil managed the plant it received more than million in operating fees.id.at.the contract required tricil to maintain safety logs to comply with the occupational safety and health act and to employ sufficient qualified operating personnel to accomplish its duties under the contract.tricil hired all plant employees,determined their pay and issued their paychecks,and covered them under its employee benefit plans it paid state,local and federal income taxes as well as social security taxes for its employees.id.it is obvious that the city did not create tricil,was not a tricil stockholder,and had no power to appoint or remove any member of tricil board of directors or any of its executive officers or managerial officers.nothing in the opinion remotely suggests otherwise.in that context,the court held that the substantial fiscal control the city exercised over the plant operation,id.at together with other miscellaneous factors such as tricil use of the city sales tax exemption number to purchase plant materials and supplies,and its lack of eminent domain power did not alone suffice to bring tricil within the political subdivision exemption under section b when none of its board of directors or executive officers were selected or removable by the city or other public official or authority.again,tricil resources is the polar opposite of the present case.
no case under section b has been cited to us in which the political subdivision exception thereunder has been denied where a majority here all of the board of directors and the managerial officers of the assertedly exempt political subdivision,were selected or removable by public officials here they are both.this is likewise true of cases construing the analogous nlra exemption under a 
the cases in this area have generally held that if a majority of the board of directors of the claimed political subdivision is not subject to selection or removal by public officials or the general electorate,then the entity for that reason fails the second alternative test for being apolitical subdivision under section.thus,in jefferson county community center nlrb,cir overruled in other respects,aramack nlrb,ns.cir,the court held that the center was not exempt as a political subdivision under section,stating 
the record demonstrates that although seven directors are appointed by public agencies under the center,a majority of the board is neither appointed by nor subject to removal by public officials or the general electorate and has no official connection to any governmental body.under these circumstances,the center is not administered by individuals who are accountable to public officials or the general electorate.truman medical center,cir at medical center held not political subdivision where of directors neither appointed by nor subject to removal by public officials or general public.
similarly,in nlrb natchez trace power ass n,cir,we held that the association was not a political subdivision under section,stating that 
it was organized by private citizens acting pursuant to the appropriate enabling statute,and in this respect its formation was no different from that of any private corporation organized under mississippi law.
the directors are initially those named by the citizens filing the certificate of incorporation they serve a term without compensation.their successors are elected by the corporation members and also serve for three years.the directors are empowered to do all things necessary or convenient in conducting the business of a corporation its directors are elected by its members and apparently are accountable only to them.the general public exercises no control over them.not being created directly by the state and not being administered by individuals responsible to the public,natchez trace fails to meet either of the criteria one of which the board requires of an entity before it can qualify for the political subdivision exemption.id.at footnotes omitted.
there are simply no section cases of which we are aware that have held an entity a majority of whose board of directors is selected and removable by public officials and whose principle executive officers are likewise selected and removable by public officials,is not one administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate and is not a political subdivision for purposes of section.
conclusion 
we recognize that we owe deference to the secretary interpretation of her own interpretive regulations,and that we may not prefer another reasonable interpretation over the reasonable interpretation of the secretary.martin oshrc.however,as the court said in martin,we emphasize that the reviewing court should defer to the secretary only if the secretary interpretation is reasonable.id.at emphasis added.we further emphasize that we are not construing the exact boundaries of section or the scope of the secretary power to promulgate regulations defining political subdivision of a state as used therein.rather,as in hawkins county,we simply determine whether the secretary interpretation of section,as applied here,is reasonable.we hold it is not.
the second alternative test of section b is whether startran is administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials.under any reasonable interpretation of those words,startran fits that definition its board of directors is selected and removable by the ceo of capital metro,a public official capital metro being a public political entity,five of the seven members of whose board of directors are officials elected by the general electorate and startran principle executive officers are all at will employees hired and subject to termination or transfer and to having their pay set by by capital metro ceo startran has no assets except its employees,and in substance has no existence independent of capital metro its creator and no relationship with any other party apart from the union.and,we are unaware of any court decision holding that an entity a majority of whose board of directors,and whose principle executive officers,are subject to selection and removal by one or more public officials or public entities does not meet the above quoted second alternative test of section b so as to be a political subdivision under section.
we hold that the alj decision on remand,relying on the secretary contention that,despite capital metro control of the startran board and executives,startran controls the day to day working conditions of its employees or has day to day control of its employees and hence fails to meet the section b test,is an unreasonable interpretation of section.the matters of control of day to day working conditions of employees or control of employees,or the equivalent thereof,are not mentioned anywhere in section.the factors mentioned in section c as examples of those which may be taken into account in regard to whether either of the tests of section b is met,overwhelmingly point to startran satisfaction of the section b criteria.while it is true that section d does state that the section c list of factors is not exclusive,that,in our view,is simply not a sufficient basis on which to reasonably construe section b which states one of the two alternative tests for meeting the being subject to a requirement nowhere mentioned in the entire regulation and which seems strongly contrary to any reasonable understanding of the wording of section b as written.moreover,the jurisprudence above cited clearly reflects that section b concerns itself with whether the board of directors the managerial officers of the asserted political subdivision not its foremen or lower level supervisors are controlled by public officials and responsible to them or to the general electorate.to allow the secretary to add,on an ad hoc individual case by case basis,controlling requirements for meeting the political subdivision test of section b that are nowhere mentioned in section,is to in effect render the regulation meaningless,and essentially say that a political subdivision is whatever the secretary thinks it is in each or any particular case.that is simply not reasonable.see,acadian gas pipeline system ferc,cir while an agency interpretation of a regulation is entitled to due deference,the interpretation must rationally flow from the language of the regulation.
we reverse the decision of the commission and render judgment dismissing the citation against startran.
reversed and rendered.
