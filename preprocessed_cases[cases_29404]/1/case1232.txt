opinion of the court 
appellants usx corporation usx and steel mining company,ussm plaintiffs below,challenge several decisions by the district court granting summary judgment for the commissioner on the majority of appellants claims.we will affirm.
in,usx purchased the assets of the grapevine mine,the last significant coal mine owned by crystal block,which ceased to operate coal mines after that sale.in,usx in turn sold those same assets to old ben coal company,which was still operating when appellants filed their complaint.pursuant to the coal industry retiree health benefit act of,the coal act on september and october and,the social security administration ssa assigned usx health benefit premium responsibility for retired miners and their dependents who had been employed by crystal block.in the letters notifying appellants of the assignments,ssa informed them that they had the right to request the miners earning records and bases for the assignments within thirty days,and then to seek administrative review within thirty days of receipt of that information.
on june,the commissioner assigned additional miners employed by crystal block to usx on the ground that usx was related to the signatory operator.by letter dated august,usx requested the earnings records of those miners,as well as the bases for the assignments.on september,ssa denied usx request for information on the ground that the request was untimely.despite denying this request,ssa nevertheless provided usx with the crystal block miners earnings records.on may,usx requested additional information and a extension of time to appeal the assignments.
by letter dated june,ssa supplied usx with the names of the originally assigned coal operators.in a separate letter on that same day,however,it informed usx that it had erroneously provided the information regarding the beneficiaries assigned on june,and that it could not review those assignments because usx request had been untimely.on august,usx requested that ssa revoke the crystal block beneficiary assignments because they were improper.ssa denied review of the june,assignments on september,informing usx on september,that its decision was final.
appellants commenced this action on july,alleging that the commissioner had improperly assigned to appellants the health benefit premium responsibilities for a significant number of coal miners.appellants also claimed that the commissioner had refused to provide the earnings records upon request,as required by the coal act,and that the commissioner had improperly refused to review many of the allegedly erroneous assignments.appellants second amended complaint contained thirteen counts,which the district court disposed of on summary judgment in a series of opinions and orders.the district court entered a final judgment on november.the court then denied appellants motion to amend the judgment on january,and appellants timely appealed.
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.see fed.home loan mortgage scottsdale ins,cir.we assess the record using the same summary judgment standard that guides district courts.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the coal act directs the commissioner to assign health benefit premium responsibilities to a related person where the beneficiary pertinent signatory operator is no longer in business.c,a.the commissioner initially construed this provision as authorizing assignments to the direct of the employing,signatory operator when the signatory operator was no longer in business.appellants claimed below that the commissioner lacked statutory authority to make assignments under this successorship theory.
the district court initially rejected this contention and granted partial summary judgment to the commissioner.appellants moved for reconsideration and,while that motion was pending,the supreme court held in barnhart sigmon coal,d,that the commissioner lacked statutory authority to assign miners to the direct successor of a signatory operator.appellants in this case then argued that sigmon coal compelled the court to grant their pending motion for reconsideration and grant them judgment on their challenges to the successorship theory in counts i and ii of their second amended complaint.appellants also argued that they should be permitted to amend their complaint for the third time so as to challenge additional miner assignments that,though not identified in any of the prior complaints,were also allegedly based on the successorship theory rejected by sigmon coal.
the district court reversed its holding and granted summary judgment for appellants with respect to the miner assignments identified in the second amended complaint.however,it denied appellants leave to file a third amended complaint insofar as the amendment would add a challenge to miner assignments appellants had not previously identified.
appellants first argue that the district court violated federal rule of civil procedure c when it refused to order the commissioner to rescind all of the assignments she had made under the successorship theory invalidated in sigmon coal,including those assignments not identified in counts i and ii of the second amended complaint.the argument is meritless.
rule c provides,in pertinent part,that every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings.c.this rule requires that a court ascertain whether the plaintiffs are entitled to any remedy.as long as the plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief,it is the court obligation to grant the relief to which the prevailing party is entitled whether it has been specifically demanded or not.kirby united states gov t,cir emphasis omitted.
appellants misconstrue the benefit afforded plaintiffs by rule c.the rule was meant to protect a plaintiff from clumsy pleading,which,through technical oversight,might deprive it of a deserved recovery.the rule most common usage is when the amount of the award varies from the demand for relief.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the rule has also been used to allow for the award of attorney fees and costs even though none was demanded,or for recovering interest on a claim as damages.id.at.as the advisory committee explains,it makes clear that a judgment should give the relief to which a party is entitled,regardless of whether it is legal or equitable or both.advisory committee note to adoption.in other words,rule c addresses and cures a limited formal problem.it is not designed to allow plaintiffs to recover for claims they never alleged.
here,by contrast,appellants are not seeking to vary relief but to add judgments based on new claims of additional improper beneficiary assignments.by trying to invoke rule c,appellants confuse the demand for relief with the claims on which that demand is based.while i nasmuch as the demand for relief does not constitute part of the pleader claim for relief,a failure to demand the appropriate relief will not result in a dismissal,the converse is not true.wright et,supra,at.that is,the court can not provide a remedy,even if one is demanded,when plaintiff has failed to set out a claim for relief.id.at see also james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed.the rule permits relief not demanded only when the party affirmatively shows an entitlement to the relief and is inapplicable when the pleader fails to demonstrate the proper substantive grounds for relief.that is precisely what appellants seek here.
moreover,simply entering judgment against the commissioner on numerous additional assignments of unidentified miners would prejudice the ssa.there may be other issues that need to be litigated to determine whether an assignment was improper.had the district court simply granted judgment for appellants on the unspecified assignments,the commissioner would be foreclosed from litigating those issues.under any reading of rule c,it can not be deployed to pretermit the commissioner from raising additional defenses to hitherto unlitigated claims.wright et,supra,at noting that relief should not be amended under rule c if failure to include in the demand has prejudiced adversary.for these reasons,the district court did not err.
as an alternative,appellants also moved in the district court to file a third amended complaint listing the additional miners that had allegedly been improperly assigned in light of sigmon coal.the district court denied leave on two grounds that amendment would be futile as the new claims were barred by the statute of limitations,and unreasonable delay.we will uphold the district court decision on the ground of unreasonable delay.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides,in pertinent part,that after a responsive pleading,a party may amend its pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.in the absence of substantial or undue prejudice to the nonmoving is the touchstone for the denial of an amendment denial instead must be based on bad faith or dilatory motives,truly undue or unexplained delay,repeated failures to cure the deficiency by amendments previously allowed,or futility of amendment.lorenz csx,cir quotation marks omitted citing foman davis,d.
turning first to futility of amendment,a statute of limitations applies to civil actions brought against the united states for review of decisions by administrative agencies.a.appellants concede that the proposed amendment would be outside this limitations period.however,they argue that the amendment would not be futile because it would relate back to the date of the original complaint,which was within the limitations period.
federal rule of civil procedure c provides,in relevant part,an amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading 
a mendments that restate the original claim with greater particularity or amplify the factual circumstances surrounding the pertinent conduct,transaction or occurrence in the preceding pleading fall within rule c.in essence,application of rule c involves a search for a common core of operative facts in the two pleadings.as such,the court looks to whether the opposing party has had fair notice of the general fact situation and legal theory upon which the amending party proceeds.

appellants argue that the language of the original,that t he commissioner can not,as a matter of law,assign miners to successors under section a of the coal act app.see also app.same is broad enough for rule c purposes to capture the listing of additional miners.appellants cite fdic conner,cir.there,the fdic filed suit against the directors of a failed bank,alleging that they had acted negligently in approving specified loans to specified borrowers.id.at.the fdic later sought leave to amend its complaint to add several more loans that had not been identified in the original complaint.id.at.the fifth circuit held that the amendment related back to the date of the original complaint because it simply identified additional sources of damages that were caused by the same pattern of conduct identified in the original complaint.id.at.
the commissioner responds that appellants fail to account for factual and procedural issues that may bear on the validity of each individual assignment,such as whether the successorship theory was actually the basis for the assignment,whether appellants exhausted administrative remedies,and whether a miner work history affords a basis for sustaining the assignment on other grounds.these meritorious in rebuffing appellants effort to invoke rule c are misplaced in the context of a request to amend a pleading.the commissioner is not foreclosed from defending the assignments once the complaint is amended.
while the assignment of each miner was itself a separate transaction or occurrence,the conduct of the commissioner in relying on the successorship doctrine was common to all of the assignments.in this way,the commissioner had notice of the problem in its assignments and had notice that any assignments based on that theory were in jeopardy.furthermore,the commissioner could still argue that some or all of the added assignments were not based on the successorship doctrine and that those specific assignments should not relate back.she would also have various substantive and procedural arguments at her disposal to defend the assignments that do relate back.allowing relation back under rule c also comports with the general presumption in favor of allowing a party to amend pleadings.boileau bethlehem steel,cir per curiam citing foman,at.
that being said,however,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend based on appellants undue delay.foman,at.we have held that t he mere passage of time does not require that a motion to amend a complaint be denied on grounds of delay delay alone is an insufficient ground to deny leave to amend.cureton ncaa,cir.at some point,however,delay will become undue,placing an unwarranted burden on the court,or will become prejudicial,placing an unfair burden on the opposing party.id.quotation marks omitted.significantly,d elay may become undue when a movant has had previous opportunities to amend a complaint.id.interests in judicial economy and finality of litigation become particularly compelling when a party delays making a motion to amend until after summary judgment has been granted to the adverse party.id.we must therefore focus on the movant reasons for not amending sooner in analyzing the question of undue delay.id.
appellants originally explained their delay in seeking an amendment or challenging the additional assignments at all on the ground that they did not have notice of these assignments when they filed their original complaint.in support of that explanation,they submitted the affidavit of a vice president of ussm stating that when he assumed responsibility for the coal act assignments in december,he did not have personal knowledge of the assignments now sought to be included because the letters were not in the files he received when he took charge.he first learned of these assignments when he reviewed the administrative record sometime after may.
as that administrative record reflects,ssa sent assignment letters to appellants on september,and june.the district court correctly concluded that,based on these letters to appellant corporations,the vice president personal knowledge was irrelevant.appellants had notice and in fact belatedly challenged the june,assignments on august.appellants plea that one of a large not have personal notice is therefore no justification.
appellants offer no other excuse for failing to include these assignments in their original complaint.rather,the thrust of their argument is as follows the district court originally denied their successorship argument.until the supreme court decided sigmon coal,they had no reason to believe that amending their complaint to include the additional assignments would have been worthwhile.therefore,that delay,and the failure to list the additional assignments in their first and second amendments,should not be held against them.boileau,at not charging plaintiff with delay where district court proceedings had been stayed.
even accepting the legal premise,appellants argument is belied by the facts.the magistrate judge issued her report recommending summary judgment for the commissioner on counts i and the successorship august.the district court adopted that report on september.appellants first amended complaint,however,was filed on november,therefore,at the time of their first for almost a year had no reason to believe that listing the additional assignments would be futile.
finally,appellants assert that between september,and february,they did not have
