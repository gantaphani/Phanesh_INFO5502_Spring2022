opinion of the court 
before us is an appeal by charles haws,assistant counsel for the pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep,from the order of the district court denying his motion for summary judgment on the ground of absolute prosecutorial immunity in this action brought pursuant to the civil rights act.light haws,wl.plaintiff,john light,is a former farmer and businessman who owns and operates almost apartment units throughout pennsylvania.
the dispute arises out of actions taken by the dep following complaints by neighbors and reports from its own investigators with respect to light maintenance of a large variety of assorted material and furnishings within and outside the garage and barn of his farm in lebanon county.the district court noted that the material observed on the property included trucks,tractors,log skidders,and farming equipment,as well as c onstruction waste,farming supplies,several thousand stacked tires,and piles of scrap metal overgrown with brush.id.at.
following discovery,haws and the other defendants,robert belfonti,tony rathfon,and steve bartus all of whom are employees of the dep,the secretary of the dep,and the governor of pennsylvania,filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion in favor of defendants on light claims that the pennsylvania solid waste management act.stat.ann.et,is unconstitutionally vague and that the actions of the governor and the secretary of the dep violated the state constitution.the district court denied the remainder of the defendants motion for summary judgment.only haws appeals,as the denial of a claim of absolute immunity,to the extent it raises questions of law,may be the subject of an interlocutory appeal.see mitchell forsyth,d.on a denial of immunity,we review the legal issues in light of the facts that the district court determined had sufficient evidentiary support for summary judgment purposes.hamilton leavy,cir.
in this case,consideration of the facts is difficult because they have not been presented by the parties in a coherent manner and because some of the relevant facts are contested.it is apparent,however,that following the complaints about material on light property,dep investigator robert belfonti inspected the property and issued a compliance order on november,for violations found on the property.light administrative appeal of that order was dismissed for failure to comply with discovery orders during his prosecution of the appeal.because light never sought a supersedeas,haws began enforcement proceedings against light by filing a petition to enforce the november,order in the commonwealth court.
following a hearing,that court found light in violation of the november,order and,by order dated april,directed that he comply with the november,order within ninety days.light failed to comply with the april,order and haws filed a petition for contempt.on september,the commonwealth court held a hearing on the contempt petition and deferred ruling on the condition that light comply with the april,order.in an order issued that same day,the court directed the dep to monitor light compliance,and apply forthwith to the court for an order of contempt if light failed to comply with the order.app.at.
light alleges that after the end of the hearing,his counsel showed haws a copy of a federal civil rights complaint that light was prepared to file that afternoon.according to light,haws angrily told him in response that w hat goes around comes around.i f you think you been harassed before,you wait to see what we do now.app.at.light further asserts that when he and his counsel complained that this was a threat and that it was unlawful for dep to threaten retaliation in this manner,haws aggressively offered that it is a a promise.id.at.light alleges he was extremely frightened by this encounter,and deferred filing the complaint in an attempt to avoid conflict with the dep.id.at.
light also alleges that on two separate occasions following the september,hearing,haws and belfonti visited his property.the record does not establish either when these visits took place or their purpose although light asserts in the amended complaint that the only purpose of one of the alleged visits was to display haws power and to intimidate light.id.at.light affidavit discusses an undated walk through of his property that occurred at some point with judge pellegrini,at which haws was present.app.at.haws declaration states that he has entered light property solely for the purpose of preparing for commonwealth court hearings or when accompanied by the judge presiding over those hearings.app.at.
on march,haws filed a second petition for contempt regarding light failure to comply with the april,and september,orders.between august and january,the court found light in contempt of its orders multiple times on the basis of several certifications haws filed with the court based on inspection of the property by dep personnel.the court found that light had failed to purge his contempt and directed that light be confined nightly in lebanon county prison between january and april.on january,following a status conference,haws filed a certificate of compliance in the commonwealth court and requested that the matter be marked closed on that date.
light filed his action in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania in april.in his amended complaint he charges that haws violated his fourth amendment right to be free from warrantless searches and retaliated against him in violation of the first amendment when he issued the courtroom threat in response to light federal civil rights complaint.see app.at.light also claims that haws selectively enforced the commonwealth environmental laws against him,set perjury traps for him,sought harsher penalties,and manipulated and misled the commonwealth court.app.at.as noted earlier,the only issue before us is whether haws is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity.
most public officials are entitled only to qualified immunity from section actions.yarris county of delaware,cir buckley fitzsimmons,d ordinarily,q ualified immunity represents the norm internal quotation marks and citations omitted.nonetheless,in imbler pachtman,d,the supreme court held that,in light of the immunity historically accorded prosecutors at common law,state prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability under for actions performed in a role.id.at.this protection is not grounded in any special esteem for those who perform these functions,and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office,but because any lesser degree of immunity could impair the judicial process itself.kalina fletcher,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
this court has since amplified that participation in court proceedings and other conduct intimately associated with the judicial phases of litigation are actions performed in a role.carter city of philadelphia,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we have given as other examples of prosecutorial actions that warrant absolute immunity,acts undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial,and which occur in the course of his role as an advocate for the state.yarris,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted mcardle tronetti,cir holding that prison physician and prison counselor were absolutely immune as to their testimony in court and psychiatric reports to the judge,as that was an integral part of the judicial process.
the burden to establish prosecutorial immunity is on the prosecutor.haws argues that the district court erred by focusing solely on his alleged courtroom threat to light rather than considering separately each of haws actions as a prosecutor.appellant br.at.moreover,haws asserts that his comments to light in the courtroom also fall within the scope of prosecutorial immunity.
both parties treat haws,an assistant dep counsel,as a prosecutor in the classic sense.although haws,as counsel to an administrative agency,is not in precisely the same position as a district attorney,his authority includes,inter alia,filing actions to e
