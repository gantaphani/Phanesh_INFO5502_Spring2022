the department of homeland security dhs ordered fatiha elgharib removed in absentia in june when she failed to appear for her removal hearing.elgharib failed to appeal,later filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings,and then did not appeal the denial of that motion.in october,elgharib filed a petition for a writ of prohibition under in the district court to review her order of removal,alleging the removal order was granted without notice or an opportunity to be heard in violation of the due process clause.the district court dismissed elgharib petition based on lack of jurisdiction under a g.elgharib timely appeals the district court dismissal of her petition for a writ of prohibition,arguing that does not apply in this case because she has no other remedy available as a noncitizen,that the district court should not be foreclosed from adjudicating her constitutional claim,and that her action is not against the attorney general under the literal terms of g.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that elgharib arguments are without merit and that the district court correctly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
factual and procedural background 
elgharib was served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings on a date to be set and at a time to be set.she filed a motion with the immigration court in detroit,michigan,on may,to terminate removal proceedings,and she alleges that dhs responded that she was not in removal proceedings as of may,elgharib claims that she never received further notice of a hearing date.when elgharib subsequently failed to appear for her removal hearing on june,she was ordered removed in absentia.on september,the immigration court denied her motion to reopen,and she did not appeal.
on october,elgharib filed a petition for a writ of prohibition under the all writs act,and a motion for a temporary restraining order in the district court for the southern district of ohio,asserting that the district court had jurisdiction under and to review her petition because the removal order was imposed in violation of the due process clause.the district court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order,and it ordered the parties to file memoranda addressing the court jurisdiction.both parties timely responded,and the district court,on december,sua sponte dismissed elgharib petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction under.elgharib appealed the denial of jurisdiction to this court.both the district court and a separate panel of this court denied a motion for a stay of removal pending this appeal.in a separate appeal,a panel of this court dismissed elgharib petition for review of the immigration court final order of removal.elgharib holder,cir.on april,dhs,through the immigration and customs enforcement agency ice,stayed elgharib removal for one year.
ii.analysis 
this appeal raises only the question of whether the district court had jurisdiction over elgharib petition for a writ of prohibition,and we do not address the merits of the claims that elgharib raised in her petition or the immigration court denial of her motion to reopen.elgharib has bifurcated her appeal into two novel arguments.she claims that also referred to as the real id act does not preclude the district court jurisdiction over her petition because her action is an original action arising under the constitution,and the constitution is not a provision of law statutory or nonstatutory within the meaning of a g clauses limiting jurisdiction and she challenges an action by the secretary of dhs and not the attorney general,so her claim is outside the literal language of g.

a.the district court lacks jurisdiction to review elgharib constitutional claim 
any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory includes the constitution 
in the real id act,congress sought to channel judicial review of an alien claims related to his or her final order of removal through a petition for review at the court of appeals congress provided in a,exclusive means of review,that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter,except as provided in subsection e of this section.for purposes of this chapter,in every provision that limits or eliminates judicial review or jurisdiction to review,the terms judicial review and jurisdiction to review include habeas corpus review pursuant to section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,sections and of such title,and review pursuant to any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory.
a.and in g,exclusive jurisdiction,congress provided that 
except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the attorney general to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.g.in this case,we must determine whether these provisions preclude jurisdiction over a cause of action challenging a final order of removal based on an alleged violation of rights under the constitution that was not brought pursuant to the prescribed procedures for judicial review of a final order of removal contained within.elgharib argues that these provisions do not preclude the district court from exercising jurisdiction over her constitutional claims because the language any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory can not be fairly read to include the constitution.

although there is no precedent directly on point,in reno committee,the supreme court held that a prior version of g precluded jurisdiction over resident aliens claims under the first amendment because the claims attacked a discretionary action by the attorney general that clearly fell within the jurisdictional bar in g.reno comm.aadc,d.at that time,g prevented judicial review e xcept as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law,and the court interpreted this language as precluding a constitutional claim.the fact that the resident aliens alleged a violation of the constitution did not necessitate immediate judicial consideration prior to a final order of removal.id.at.ginsburg,concurring in part and concurring in judgment see also humphries various fed.usins employees,cir holding g barred a first amendment claim challenging a discretionary decision zundel gonzales,cir unpublished opinion holding g barred a first amendment challenge to a decision to commence removal proceedings,cert.denied,d see also sissoko rocha,cir finding humphries instructive and consistent with aadc,and concluding that g barred a fourth amendment bivens claim.
we apply the same interpretation to the current language of both a and g the addition of the any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory introductory language does not alter the interpretation that the supreme court applied in aadc.contrary to elgharib contention,a natural reading of any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory includes the constitution see black law dictionary ed defining constitution as t he fundamental and organic law of a nation or state that establishes the institutions and apparatus of government and t he written instrument embodying this fundamental law,together with any formal amendments emphases added black law dictionary ed including in definition of constitution t he fundamental and organic law of a nation or state emphasis added.
this interpretation is also clear from a reading of the remainder of the statute.section a sets forth the applicable provisions to guide the procedures for judicial review of removal orders and indicates that the procedures contained therein are the only procedures under which a noncitizen may challenge constitutional questions related to his or her removal.within this section,subsection two removes certain matters from judicial review,including certain denials of discretionary relief in a b and final orders of removal entered against an alien who has committed certain criminal offenses in a c.both sections also contain the same notwithstanding language that elgharib argues does not preclude jurisdiction over her claim,but we know that congress viewed this language as incorporating constitutional claims because in a d congress specifically reinstated judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law that are otherwise wholly insulated from judicial review under a b c.see almuhtaseb gonzales,cir explaining interaction of a a d elia gonzales,cir citing a d,a,e to restrict review to stated petitions only,cert.denied,d see also hussain keisler,cir explaining that a d did not preserve constitutional claim otherwise barred by g mcallister attorney of,cir.explaining a a d interaction,cert.denied,d nerghes mukasey,cir unpublished opinion same.indeed,a d allows review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section,a d emphases added,which requires compliance with a statement that the courts of appeals are the exclusive means of review for final orders of removal and any constitutional questions related thereto.the same jurisdictional bar to judicial review of an alien removal order is also present in b the provision consolidating judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien into the court of appeals review of a final order of removal.b see singh gonzales,cir through this section b,congress made clear that review of a final removal order is the only mechanism for reviewing any issue raised in a removal proceeding.quoting,at,as reprinted in.if elgharib were correct that the repeated any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory language in subsections did not include the constitution,then congress further inclusion of reinstating or reserving language in a d and b,among others,would be rendered meaningless and congress purpose to streamline judicial review would be frustrated.see kucana holder,d determining the scope of agency decisions precluded from judicial review under a b ii and emphasizing that the aggressive amendments to were intended to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal basis to remain in the united states.
definitions of the laws also undercut elgharib claim that any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory does not include the constitution.see,const.art.vi,cl.this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made,or which shall be made,under the authority of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land gibbons ogden,wheat.t he constitution is the supreme law.united states fisher,cranch.the constitution is the supreme law of the land marbury madison,cranch.it is also not entirely unworthy of observation,that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land,the constitution itself is first mentioned see also alden maine,d noting the ex parte young exception is necessary if the constitution is to remain the supreme law of the land harry jones,the common law in the united states english themes and american variations,in political separation and legal continuity harry jones,noting that constitution provisions are part of the supreme law of the land,as quoted in seminole tribe of florida,d souter,dissenting discussing common law integration into the constitution.thus,the constitution is clearly a nonstatutory law under.
furthermore,contrary to elgharib novel position,congress may withdraw constitutional questions from the district court jurisdiction once jurisdiction has been conferred under.in aadc,the supreme court upheld congress withdrawal of jurisdiction from all federal courts under an earlier version of g that did not include the additional statutory or nonstatutory explanation regarding which laws could not provide an avenue for judicial review.aadc,at.holding that g applies to bar jurisdiction to review only three discrete actions that the attorney general may take her decision or action to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders ene phillips,cir unpublished opinion congress enacted g to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts which are not courts of general jurisdiction they have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress quoting bender williamsport area sch,d.elgharib argument ignores the court early statements that the lower federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction that congress has the power to control 
the judicial power of the united states,although it has its origin in the constitution,is except in enumerated instances,applicable exclusively to the supreme court dependent for its distribution and organization,and for the modes of its exercise,entirely upon the action of congress,who possess the sole power of creating the tribunals inferior to the supreme court for the exercise of the judicial power,and of investing them with jurisdiction either limited,concurrent,or exclusive,and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact degrees and character which to congress may seem proper for the public good.
cary curtis,how.see also kontrick ryan,d only congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction.citing const.art.iii,dalton specter,d the judicial power of the united states conferred by article iii of the constitution is upheld just as surely by withholding judicial relief where congress has permissibly foreclosed it,as it is by granting such relief where authorized by the constitution or by statute.charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,richard freer,federal practice procedure ed citing cases.congress acted within its constitutional powers to limit judicial review of constitutional questions under,and we conclude that a g both preclude jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to final orders of removal.
section explicitly prohibits actions under the all writs act 
elgharib also may not obtain review by captioning her challenge as an original action under the all writs act because her due process clause claim directly targets her order of removal,see dist.doc.doc.at pe
