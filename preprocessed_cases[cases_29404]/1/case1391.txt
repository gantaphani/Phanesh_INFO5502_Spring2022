in,the occupational safety and health administration osha issued new safety standards applying to the construction,alteration,and repair of steel buildings,bridges,and other structures.see.shortly thereafter,osha issued a directive stating that violations of certain standards would be considered de would therefore carry no employers took different precautionary measures.see osha directive cpl,directive see also b c.
in april,osha repealed that blanket rule,announcing that it would instead use its statutory authority to determine on a basis whether violations of those standards were de minimis.see osha directive c pl,directive see also a.the steel erectors association of america seaa,a trade association,challenges the directive,arguing that it is an invalid occupational safety and health standard under because it was promulgated without notice and comment and was unsupported by substantial record evidence.
we can not address the merits of seaa challenge because we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this case.f the jurisdictional provision allegedly authorizing seaa provides for judicial review of challenges to a standard.so our ability to hear this case turns on whether the directive is actually a standard or is instead some other form of agency action.because we conclude that the directive is more accurately viewed as a description of the agency new enforcement policy,seaa challenge must be dismissed.
the directive is the product of a complex statutory scheme as well as a lengthy rulemaking process,and it is necessary to set out both in some detail in order to properly understand this case.in,congress enacted the occupational safety and health act osh act to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions.b.to that end,the osh act authorizes the secretary of labor to promulgate and enforce mandatory occupational safety and health standards.see.under the act,an occupational safety and health standard is defined as a standard which requires conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices,means,methods,operations,or processes,reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.the secretary also has the authority to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out his responsibilities.g.
in the immediate aftermath of the passage of the osh act,the secretary of labor used his authority under to adopt the construction safety standards passed under the construction safety more targeted predecessor to the osh act.see,may,see also.those standards,eventually codified in subpart r of,were designed to ensure the safety of construction workers at federal or federally assisted construction projects.see.at.among other things,the standards required employers engaging in the construction or repair of multifloor steel buildings to build tight and substantial temporary floors within two stories or feet below any floor on which bolting,riveting,welding,or painting is being done.b see,july.to the extent that constructing such floors proved impractical,employers could install safety nets at similar intervals.b ii see.at.either way,the upshot of the standards was to force employers to take measures to protect their workers from injurious and potentially deadly falls.
osha slightly amended these standards in,changing the distance requirement for temporary flooring from feet to feet,see.at,but nevertheless continued to receive requests for clarification of the fall protection provisions.see.at.accordingly,in,osha announced that it would devise a new set of steel erection safety standards.see.four years later,osha formed the steel erection negotiated rulemaking advisory committee senrac a committee comprised of representatives from industry,labor,and develop those standards.see.may.
the committee worked for eighteen months and met eleven times.in july,senrac reached consensus around a set of standards,signed a binding consensus agreement,and then submitted its proposed regulatory text to osha.the next year,osha issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,intending to codify senrac text as the new subpart r of.see.at.as pertinent here,the proposed standards preserved the requirement of flooring every two stories or thirty feet below ongoing steel erection work,but permitted employers to substitute safety nets without any showing that flooring was impracticable.see.at.the proposed standards also contained a new provision prohibiting the installation of shear are steel bars and studs fastened to steel beams that allow concrete to be poured between the after the employer constructed a separate walking and working surface.see.at.this measure was designed to minimize the risk of workers tripping on the shear connectors.
between august,and november,osha solicited public comments on the standards.afterwards,osha held an informal public hearing on the proposed scheme.while osha received over responses in the form of comments,testimony,and documentary evidence,the temporary flooring requirement did not generate any,it generated no comments at all.see,summarizing history of the safety standards at issue.the shear connector rule,by contrast,had its opponents they argued that requiring workers to attach shear connectors in the field would increase the risk of back injuries and falls as well as the costs of construction.id.at.despite these objections,osha concluded that the use of preinstalled shear connectors would pose a significant safety hazard and decided not to make any substantive changes to the proposed rule.id.at.thus,with respect to these two provisions,osha final proposal reflected senrac consensus.
the final step in the approval process was a public meeting with senrac to obtain comments and feedback on osha proposed revisions to senrac work.id.at.the meeting was not a renegotiation,as senrac members had already bound themselves to a written consensus agreement back in july.at the meeting,none of the senrac members discussed abandoning the floor construction or shear connector requirements everyone agreed that those standards should be adopted as applied.however,shortly after the meeting,rockwell member of senrac who is also a member of a letter to osha requesting clarification of whether the use of personal fall protection systems harnesses designed to prevent workers from suffering deadly falls would be an adequate substitute for the flooring requirements.osha replied with a letter indicating that it would consider the failure to set up floors or nets to be a de minimis violation under a so long as the employer installed personal fall protection systems as a substitute.but osha did not indicate that the underlying standard requiring such floors and nets had changed in any way.moreover,turner letter did not address the shear connector standard at all.
in january,osha promulgated the current version of the safety standards the standards.see.at.the standards codified the flooring and netting requirements at b and codified the shear connector policy at c.but the standards themselves did not contain any provision declaring that an employer could install fall protection systems as a substitute for either requirement,or that the use of such systems would render a violation of the standards de minimis.
one year after promulgating the final standards,osha issued directive cpl,directive.as relevant here,the directive contained a series of questions and answers designed to clarify the recently adopted standards.question and answer stated that w here an employer establishes,communicates and enforces a requirement to be protected by fall arrest equipment at all times above feet or less,the failure to comply with b is considered a de minimis violation and will not be cited.in other words,the directive established that violations of the temporary flooring requirements would not be met with penalties if the employer installed fall arrest equipment such as harnesses to protect workers.in the same vein,question and answer set forth a similar enforcement policy with respect to the shear connector prohibition,stating that i f an employer requires that all workers,including those engaged in connecting and in decking be protected from falls by conventional fall protection,then the failure to meet the requirements of c would be considered de minimis and no citation would be issued.
in,however,osha issued directive cpl,directive.according to osha,the directive sought to clarify osha enforcement policy with respect to the flooring and netting requirements,see b,and the shear connector prohibition,see c.noting that the provisions were both designed to prevent or at least minimize injuries from falls,and that f alls continue to be the leading cause of fatalities among construction workers,including workers engaged in steel erection,osha concluded that it is ordinarily inappropriate to consider the violation of these provisions to be de minimis on the basis that personal protective systems are in use.accordingly,osha revised and rescinded questions and answers and in the directive.in their place,osha reaffirmed that compliance staff retain their normal discretion to determine,on a case by case basis,that violations are de minimis where there is no direct or immediate relationship to safety or health,and the employer use of personal fall protection systems at all times may be a factor in such a determination.
that provision is what gives rise to this litigation.seaa challenges the directive,arguing that it is a standard subject to immediate judicial review under f.on seaa theory,the directive is a standard either because it directly modifies b c or because it rescinds the directive,which was itself a standard.according to seaa,this means that the directive must be vacated because it did not comply with the requirement of b and because it is not justified by substantial record evidence.osha,by contrast,argues that we lack jurisdiction over this challenge because the directive is not a standard.in osha view,the directive is instead a general statement of enforcement policy and thus constitutes a regulation under g.
in order to consider seaa arguments,we must examine the difference between a standard,see,and a rule or regulation under the osh act,g.after all,our jurisdiction turns on precisely that distinction.that is because standards are subject to immediate judicial review in the courts of appeals on petition of a ny person who may be adversely affected by them.f see workplace health safety council reich.chem.ass bingham,cir.unit a.by contrast,rules and regulations under g are not subject to immediate appellate review.see reich,at bingham,f d at same,see also ne.erectors ass of the btea sec y of labor,cir challenges to osha enforcement actions must be raised in the first instance in administrative proceedings,not in the federal courts.
the osh act,however,provides only modest clarification of the distinction between standards and rules and regulations.while the act declares that standards require conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices,means,methods,operations,or processes,reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment,it says comparably little about what constitutes a rule or regulation,g.indeed,with respect to the latter category,the act merely states that the secretary shall prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the act,including rules and regulations dealing with the inspection of an employer establishment.id.likewise,while the act sets forth procedures for both the promulgation of standards,see b imposing,among other things,a notice and comment requirement,and judicial review of them once enacted,see u.f standards must be supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,it says very little about how rules and regulations are created or reviewed.
other courts have helped to illuminate the differences between the two categories.the fifth circuit opinion in louisiana chemical ass bingham sets forth the generally accepted basic function test for determining if an agency pronouncement is a standard or is instead a rule or regulation.bingham,at.if the basic function of the pronouncement is to address a specific and already identified hazard,rather than to serve as a purely administrative effort designed to uncover violations of the act and discover unknown dangers,it is a standard.id.at see also chamber of commerce of the u.dep t of labor,reich,at.
for example,in chamber of commerce,the circuit concluded that an osha directive requiring workplaces to choose between acceding to comprehensive inspection s and participating in a cooperative compliance program imposing numerous safety requirements over and above existing statutory and regulatory requirements was a standard.at.as the court reasoned,the directive effectively obligate d employers,under penalty of certain inspection,to adopt a comprehensive safety and health program and thus impose d on employers new safety standards more demanding than those required by the act or by any preexisting regulation implementing the act.id.at.
by contrast,if the agency action is merely an enforcement or detection procedure designed to further the goals of the act generally,it is a rule or regulation.bingham,at see chamber of commerce,at reich,at.thus,a records access rule requiring employers to make existing chemical exposure records available to employees,employee representatives,and osha authorities constitutes a rule or regulation under g,see bingham,at,as does a requirement that employers report to osha information regarding accidents causing the death or hospitalization of three or more employees,see reich,at.
more recently,the circuit has further clarified that in order for an agency directive to be a standard,it must be new.edison inst.osha,eei.put differently,an agency directive merely reiterating the requirements of an existing standard for enforcement purposes constitutes a rule or regulation.see id.at.in eei,the court confronted a directive rejecting eei proposed construction of the underlying standard at issue and affirming osha prior interpretation of how the standard should be enforced.id.at.the court concluded that the directive was a rule or regulation because it is not a new standard,but rather merely restate s in an abstract the umteenth time osha longstanding interpretation of the underlying standard.id.at quoting indep.equip.dealers ass epa.
this approach makes good sense.as the eei court pointed out,it would be a stretch to say that a rule that merely restates an existing standard requires conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices,insofar as it is the existing standard,not the reiteration,that compels employer practices.id.at quoting.after all,such a rule would not promulgate a standard,f,but would instead merely restate it,meaning it should fall outside the jurisdictional scope of f.what is more,labeling as a standard a rule that merely restates an existing standard would allow parties to circumvent f review period limitation by giving them a second bite at the apple.see eei,at.
eei,chamber of commerce,reich,and bingham are thus helpful in explaining the difference between standards and regulations.but they also help shed light on a broader principle why the line between the two categories is a jurisdictional one.as the above examples show,the difference is roughly between substance and procedure.for the most part,standards impose substantive legal obligations on all regulated entities that often give rise to hefty compliance costs.rules and regulations,by contrast,tend to cover such matters as enforcement and that do not change employers actual legal obligations so much as the enforcement of them.
thus,while it may be true that standards,in the mine run,are more likely to engender substantial expense,the test for determining whether a directive constitutes a standard or a rule is not based ultimately on cost.rather,the statutory definition of standards as requir ing conditions,or the adoption or use of one or more practices,means,methods,operations,or processes,simply posits a distinction between new legal obligations and enforcement of obligations th
