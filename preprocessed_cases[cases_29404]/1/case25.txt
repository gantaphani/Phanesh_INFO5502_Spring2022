d the contention that chevron deference is not appropriate here because the fcc asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and local concern is meritless.these cases have nothing to do with federalism the statute explicitly supplants state authority,so the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will draw the lines to which the states must hew.

justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of its regulatory authority that is,its jurisdiction is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council.
wireless telecommunications networks require towers and antennas proposed sites for those towers and antennas must be approved by local zoning authorities.in the telecommunications act of,congress impose d specific limitations on the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location,construction,and modification of such facilities,rancho palos verdes abrams,and incorporated those limitations into the communications act of,see stat.section b of that act empowers the federal communications commission to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out its provisions.ch,stat,codified at b.of course,that rulemaking authority extends to the subsequently added portions of the act.see iowa utilities.
the act imposes five substantive limitations,which are codified in c b only one of them,c b ii,is at issue here.that provision requires state or local governments to act on wireless siting applications within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.two other features of c are relevant.first,subparagraph a,known as the saving clause,provides that nothing in the act,except those limitations provided in c b,shall limit or affect the authority of a state or local government over siting decisions.second,c b v authorizes a person who believes a state or local government decision to be inconsistent with any of the limitations in c b to commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
in theory,c b ii requires state and local zoning authorities to take prompt action on siting applications for wireless facilities.but in practice,wireless providers often faced long delays.in july,ctia the wireless association which represents wireless service providers,petitioned the fcc to clarify the meaning of c b ii requirement that zoning authorities act on siting requests within a reasonable period of time.in november,the commission,relying on its broad statutory authority to implement the provisions of the communications act,issued a declaratory ruling responding to ctia petition.in re petition for declaratory ruling,fcc rcd.the commission found that the record evidence demonstrates that unreasonable delays in the personal wireless service facility siting process have obstructed the provision of wireless services and that such delays impede the promotion of advanced services and competition that congress deemed critical in the telecommunications act of.at.a reasonable period of time under c b ii,the commission determined,is presumptively but rebuttably days to process a collocation application that is,an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and days to process all other applications,at.
some state and local governments opposed adoption of the declaratory ruling on the ground that the commission lacked authority to interpret ambiguous provisions of section c.at.specifically,they argued that the saving clause,c a,and the judicial review provision,c b v,together display a congressional intent to withhold from the commission authority to interpret the limitations in c b.asserting that ground of objection,the cities of arlington and san antonio,texas,petitioned for review of the declaratory ruling in the court of appeals for the fifth circuit.
relying on circuit precedent,the court of appeals held that the chevron framework applied to the threshold question whether the fcc possessed statutory authority to adopt the and timeframes,citing texas united states.applying chevron,the court of appeals found c a effect on the fcc authority to administer c b limitations ambiguous,at,and held that the fcc interpretation of its statutory authority was a permissible construction of the statute,at.on the merits,the court upheld the presumptive and deadlines as a permissible construction of c b ii and v entitled to chevron deference.at.
we granted certiorari,limited to the first question presented whether a court should apply chevron to an agency determination of its own jurisdiction.pet.for cert.in,
as this case turns on the scope of the doctrine enshrined in chevron,we begin with a description of that case formulation.when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.at.first,applying the ordinary tools of statutory construction,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.at.
chevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional intent namely,that congress,when it left ambiguity in a statute administered by an agency,understood that the ambiguity would be resolved,first and foremost,by the agency,and desired the agency rather than the courts to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.smiley citibank south dakota.chevron thus provides a stable background rule against which congress can legislate statutory ambiguities will be resolved,within the bounds of reasonable interpretation,not by the courts but by the administering agency.see iowa utilities,at.congress knows to speak in plain terms when it wishes to circumscribe,and in capacious terms when it wishes to enlarge,agency discretion.
the question here is whether a court must defer under chevron to an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency statutory authority that is,its jurisdiction.the argument against deference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations some interpretations the big,important ones,presumably define the agency jurisdiction.others humdrum,stuff are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.that premise is false,because the distinction between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional interpretations is a mirage.no matter how it is framed,the question a court faces when confronted with an agency interpretation of a statute it administers is always,simply,whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.
the misconception that there are,for chevron purposes,separate jurisdictional questions on which no deference is due derives,perhaps,from a reflexive extension to agencies of the very real division between the jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts.in the judicial context,there is a meaningful line whether the court decided correctly is a question that has different consequences from the question whether it had the power to decide at all.congress has the power within limits to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide,see trainmen toledo,lauf shinner,but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide those cases,see plaut spendthrift farm.a court power to decide a case is independent of whether its decision is correct,which is why even an erroneous judgment is entitled to res judicata effect.put differently,a jurisdictionally proper but substantively incorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.
that is not so for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes.both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by congress,so that when they act improperly,no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction,what they do is ultra vires.because the question whether framed as an incorrect application of agency authority or an assertion of authority not conferred is always whether the agency has gone beyond what congress has permitted it to do,there is no principled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of such claims as jurisdictional.
an example will illustrate just how illusory the proposed line between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional agency interpretations is.imagine the following statute 
common carrier act 
section.the agency shall have jurisdiction to prohibit any common carrier from imposing an unreasonable condition upon access to its facilities.
there is no question that this provision including the terms common carrier and unreasonable condition defines the agency jurisdiction.surely,the argument goes,a court must determine de novo the scope of that jurisdiction.
consider,however,this alternative formulation of the statute 
common carrier act 
section.no common carrier shall impose an unreasonable condition upon access to its facilities.
section.the agency may prescribe rules and regulations necessary in the public interest to effectuate section of this act.
now imagine that the agency,invoking its section authority,promulgates this rule the term common carrier in section includes internet service providers.the term unreasonable condition in section includes unreasonably high prices.a monthly fee greater than is an unreasonable condition on access to internet service.by this rule,the agency has claimed for itself jurisdiction that is doubly questionable does its authority extend to internet service providers and does it extend to setting prices yet section makes clear that congress,in petitioners words,conferred interpretive power on the agency with respect to section.brief for petitioners in.even under petitioners theory,then,a court should defer to the agency interpretation of the terms common carrier and unreasonable condition that is to say,its assertion that its jurisdiction extends to regulating internet service providers and setting prices.
in the first case,by contrast,petitioners theory would accord the agency no deference.the trouble with this is that in both cases,the underlying question is exactly the same does the statute give the agency authority to regulate internet service providers and cap prices,or not the reality,laid bare,is that there is no difference,insofar as the validity of agency action is concerned,between an agency exceeding the scope of its authority its jurisdiction and its exceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has.to exceed authorized application is to exceed authority.virtually any administrative action can be characterized as either the one or the other,depending on how generally one wishes to describe the authority.mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore,scalia,concurring in judgment see also monaghan,marbury and the administrative state,colum,administrative application of law is administrative formulation of law whenever it involves elaboration of the statutory norm.
this point is nicely illustrated by our decision in national cable telecommunications,gulf power.that case considered whether the fcc jurisdiction to regulate the rents owners charge for pole attachments defined as attachments by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service extended to attachments that provided both cable television and internet access attachments for commingled services at.we held,sensibly,that chevron applied,at.whether framed as going to the scope of the fcc delegated authority or the fcc application of its delegated authority,the underlying question was the same did the fcc exceed the bounds of its statutory authority to regulate rents for pole attachments when it sought to regulate rents for pole attachments providing commingled services 
the label is an empty distraction because every new application of a broad statutory term can be reframed as a questionable extension of the agency jurisdiction.one of the briefs in support of petitioners explains,helpfully,that j urisdictional questions concern the who,what,where,and when of regulatory power which subject matters may an agency regulate and under what conditions.brief for imla respondents.but an agency application of its authority pursuant to statutory text answers the same questions.who is an outside salesman what is a pole attachment where do the waters of the united states end when must a medicare provider challenge a reimbursement determination in order to be entitled to an administrative appeal these can all be reframed as questions about the scope of agencies regulatory they are all questions to which the chevron framework applies.see christopher smithkline beecham,slip,at,national cable telecommunications,supra,at,united states riverside bayview homes,sebelius auburn regional medical center,slip,at.
in sum,judges should not waste their time in the mental acrobatics needed to decide whether an agency interpretation of a statutory provision is jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional.once those labels are sheared away,it becomes clear that the question in every case is,simply,whether the statutory text forecloses the agency assertion of authority,or not.see edwards elliott,federal standards of review in practice,it does not appear to matter whether delegated authority is viewed as a threshold inquiry.the federal judge as haruspex,sifting the entrails of vast statutory schemes to divine whether a particular agency interpretation qualifies as jurisdictional,is not engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.
fortunately,then,we have consistently held that chevron applies to cases in which an agency adopts a construction of a jurisdictional provision of a statute it administers.pierce,administrative law treatise.one of our opinions explicitly says that no exception exists to the normal deferential standard of review for jurisdictional or legal question s concerning the coverage of an act.nlrb city disposal systems.a prime example of deferential review for questions of jurisdiction is commodity futures trading comm schor.that case involved a cftc interpretation of c,which provides that before the commission takes action on a complaint,the complainant must file a bond to cover any reparation award that may be issued by the commission against the complainant on any counterclaim by respondent.emphasis added.the cftc,pursuant to its broad rulemaking authority,see,interpreted that oblique reference to counterclaims as granting it the power to take jurisdiction over not just counterclaims,but counterclaims as well.schor,supra,at.we not only deferred under chevron to the commission eminently reasonable interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer,but also chided the court of appeals for declining to afford deference because of the putatively statutory nature of the question at issue.at.
similar examples abound.we have afforded chevron deference to the commerce department determination that its authority to seek antidumping duties extended to uranium imported under contracts for enrichment services,united states eurodif,to the interstate commerce commission view that courts,not the commission,possessed initial jurisdiction with respect to the award of reparations for unreasonable shipping charges,reiter cooper,internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted and to the army corps of engineers assertion that its permitting authority over discharges into waters of the united states extended to freshwater wetlands adjacent to covered waters,riverside bayview homes,supra,at.we have even deferred to the fcc assertion that its broad regulatory authority extends to conflicting state rules.city of new york fcc,capital cities cable,crisp,
our cases hold that chevron applies equally to statutes designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion.for instance,in chemical mfrs.natural resources defense council,we considered a statute prohibiting the environmental protection agency from modify ing any requirement of this section as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on the toxic pollutant list.the epa construed the statute as not precluding it from granting variances with respect to certain toxic pollutants.finding no clear congressional intent to forbid epa sensible variance mechanism,at,we deferred to the epa construction of this express limitation on its own regulatory authority,at citing chevron,see also,japan whaling american cetacean.
the reports are shot through with applications of chevron to agencies constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction.and we have applied chevron where concerns about agency are at their apogee in cases where an agency expansive construction of the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental change in the regulatory scheme.in fda brown williamson tobacco,the threshold question was the appropriate framework for analyzing the fda assertion of jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products,at,a question of vast economic and political magnitude,at.because this case involves an administrative agency construction of a statute that it administers,we held,chevron applied,at.similarly,in mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph,we applied the chevron framework to the fcc assertion that the statutory phrase modify any requirement gave it authority to eliminate requirements,the essential characteristic of a industry,for telephone carriers.
the false dichotomy between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional agency interpretations may be no more than a bogeyman,but it is dangerous all the same.like the hound of the baskervilles,it is conjured by those with greater quarry in sight make no mistake the ultimate target here is chevron itself.savvy challengers of agency action would play the jurisdictional card in every case.see,cellco partnership fcc,cadc.some judges would be deceived by the specious,but,jurisdictional nonjurisdictional line others tempted by the prospect of making public policy by prescribing the meaning of ambiguous statutory commands.the effect would be to transfer any number of interpretive decisions archetypal chevron questions,about how best to construe an ambiguous term in light of competing policy interests from the agencies that administer the statutes to federal courts we have cautioned that judges ought to refrain from substituting their own interstitial lawmaking for that of an agency.ford motor credit milhollin.that is precisely what chevron prevents.
one group of respondents contends that chevron deference is inappropriate here because the fcc has assert ed jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and local concern.brief for imla respondents.but this case has nothing to do with federalism.section c b ii explicitly supplants state authority by requiring zoning authorities to render a decision within a reasonable period of time,and the meaning of that phrase is indisputably a question of federal law.we rejected a similar argument in the iowa utilities board case,in terms that apply equally here this is,at bottom,a debate not about whether the states will be allowed to do their own thing,but about whether it will be the fcc or the federal courts that draw the lines to which they must hew.at.these lines will be drawn either by unelected federal bureaucrats,or by unelected and even less politically accountable federal judges.i t is hard to spark a passionate states rights debate over that detail.ibid.
a few words in response to the dissent.the question on which we granted certiorari was whether a court should apply chevron to review an agency determination of its own jurisdiction.pet.for cert.perhaps sensing the incoherence of the line,the dissent does not even attempt to defend it,see post,at,but proposes a much broader scope for de novo judicial review jurisdictional or not,and even where a rule is at issue and the statute contains a broad grant of rulemaking authority,the dissent would have a court search to determine whether that delegation covers the specific provision and particular question before the court.post,at.
the dissent is correct that united states mead,requires that,for chevron deference to apply,the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted.no one disputes that.but mead denied chevron deference to action,by an agency with rulemaking authority,that was not rulemaking.what the dissent needs,and fails to produce,is a single case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency substantive field.there is no such case,and what the dissent proposes is a massive revision of our chevron jurisprudence.
where we differ from the dissent is in its apparent rejection of the theorem that the whole includes all of its parts its view that a general conferral of rulemaking authority does not validate rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.rather,the dissent proposes that even when general rulemaking authority is clear,every agency rule must be subjected to a de novo judicial determination of whether the particular issue was committed to agency discretion.it offers no standards at all to guide this hunt for congressional intent that is to say,for evidence of congressional intent more specific than the conferral of general rulemaking authority.it would simply punt that question back to the court of appeals,presumably for application of some sort of test which is really,of course,not a test at all but an invitation to make an ad hoc judgment regarding congressional intent.thirteen courts of appeals applying a test would render the binding effect of agency rules unpredictable and destroy the whole stabilizing purpose of chevron.the excessive agency power that the dissent fears would be replaced by chaos.there is no need to wade into these murky waters.it suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under chevron are satisfied because congress has unambiguously vested the fcc with general authority to administer the communications act through rulemaking and adjudication,and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
those who assert that applying chevron to jurisdictional interpretations leaves the fox in charge of the henhouse overlook the reality that a separate category of jurisdictional interpretations does not exist.the syndrome is to be avoided not by establishing an arbitrary and undefinable category of agency decisionmaking that is accorded no deference,but by taking seriously,and applying rigorously,in all cases,statutory limits on agencies authority.where congress has established a clear line,the agency can not go beyond it and where congress has established an ambiguous line,the agency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow.but in rigorously applying the latter rule,a court need not pause to puzzle over whether the interpretive question presented is jurisdictional.if the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,that is the end of the matter.chevron,at.
the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.
opinion of breyer,
on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i agree with the court that normally the question a court faces when confronted with an agency interpretation of a statute it administers is,simply,whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.ante,at.in this context,the distinction between jurisdictional and interpretations is a mirage.ante,at.
deciding just what those statutory bounds are,however,is not always an easy matter,and the court case law abounds with discussion of the subject.a reviewing judge,for example,will have to decide independently whether congress delegated authority to the agency to provide interpretations of,or to enact rules pursuant to,the statute at issue interpretations or rules that carry with them the force of law.united states mead.if so,the reviewing court must give special leeway or deference to the agency interpretation.see,at.
we have added that,if e mploying traditional tools of statutory construction,ins,the court determines that congress has spoken clearly on the disputed question,then that is the end of the matter,chevron natural resources defense council.the agency is due no deference,for congress has left no gap for the agency to fill,at.if,on the other hand,congress has not spoken clearly,if,for example it has written ambiguously,then that ambiguity is a sign but not always a conclusive sign that congress intends a reviewing court to pay particular attention to,to give a degree of deference to the agency interpretation.see gonzales oregon,mead,supra,at.
i say that the existence of statutory ambiguity is sometimes not enough to warrant the conclusion that congress has left a gap for the agency to fill because our cases make clear that other,sometimes,factors will on occasion prove relevant.and,given the vast number of government statutes,regulatory programs,and underlying circumstances,that variety is hardly surprising.in mead,for example,we looked to several factors other than simple ambiguity to help determine whether congress left a statutory gap,thus delegating to the agency the authority to fill that gap with an interpretation that would carry the force of law.at.elsewhere,we have assessed 
the interstitial nature of the legal question,the related expertise of the agency,the importance of the question to administration of the statute,the complexity of that administration,and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period of time.barnhart walton.
the subject matter of the relevant provision for instance,its distance from the agency ordinary statutory duties or its falling within the scope of another agency authority has also proved relevant.see gonzalez,supra,at.see also gellhorn verkuil,controlling delegations,cardozo.
moreover,the statute text,its context,the structure of the statutory scheme,and canons of textual construction are relevant in determining whether the statute is ambiguous and can be equally helpful in determining whether such ambiguity comes accompanied with agency authority to fill a gap with an interpretation that carries the force of law.see household credit services,pfennig,zuni public school dist.department of education,fda brown williamson tobacco,dole steelworkers.statutory purposes,including those revealed in part by legislative and regulatory history,can be similarly relevant.see brown williamson tobacco,supra,at pension benefit guaranty corporation ltv,global crossing telecommunications,metrophones telecommunications.see also iowa utilities,breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
although seemingly complex in abstract description,in practice this framework has proved a workable way to approximate how congress would likely have meant to allocate interpretive authority between reviewing court and agency.the question whether congress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide an interpretation that carries the force of law is for the judge to answer independently.the judge,considering traditional tools of statutory construction,supra,at,will ask whether congress has spoken unambiguously.if so,the text controls.if not,the judge will ask whether congress would have intended the agency to resolve the resulting ambiguity.if so,deference is warranted.see mead,supra,at.even if not,however,sometimes an agency interpretation,in light of the agency special expertise,will still have the power to persuade,if lacking power to control,skidmore swift.
the case before us offers an example.the relevant statutory provision requires state or local governments to act on wireless siting applications within a reasonable period of time after a wireless service provider files such a request.c b ii.the federal communications commission fcc argued that this provision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the amount of time that is reasonable.many factors favor the agency view the language of the telecommunications act grants the fcc broad authority including rulemaking authority to administer the act the words are ambiguous the provision concerns an interstitial administrative matter,in respect to which the agency expertise could have an important role to play and the matter,in context,is complex,likely making the agency expertise useful in helping to answer the reasonableness question that the statute poses.see creating the fcc b providing rulemaking authority national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,acknowledging the fcc authority to administer the act.
on the other side of the coin,petitioners point to two statutory provisions which,they believe,require a different conclusion namely,that the fcc lacked authority altogether to interpret c b ii.first,a nearby saving clause says except as provided in this paragraph,nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a state or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities.c a.second,a judicial review provision,says any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may,within days after such action or failure to act,commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.c b v.
in my view,however,these two provisions can not provide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by petitioners.the first provision begins with an exception,stating that it does not apply to among other things the reasonableness provision here at issue.the second simply sets forth a procedure for judicial review,a review that applies to most government actions.both are consistent with a statutory scheme that gives states,localities,the fcc,and reviewing courts each some role to play in the location of wireless service facilities.and neither expressly describ es an exception to the fcc plenary authority to interpret the act.american hospital nlrb.
for these reasons,i would reject petitioners argument and conclude that c b ii the reasonableness statute leaves a gap for the fcc to fill.i would hold that the fcc lawful efforts to do so carry the force of law.mead,at.the court of appeals ultimately reached the same conclusion though for somewhat different reasons,and the majority affirms the lower court.i consequently join the majority judgment and such portions of its opinion as are consistent with what i have written here.

chief justice roberts,with whom justice kennedy and justice alito join,dissenting.
my disagreement with the court is fundamental.it is also easily expressed a court should not defer to an agency until the court decides,on its own,that the agency is entitled to deference.courts defer to an agency interpretation of law when and because congress has conferred on the agency interpretive authority over the question at issue.an agency can not exercise interpretive authority until it has it the question whether an agency enjoys that authority must be decided by a court,without deference to the agency.
one of the principal authors of the constitution famously wrote that the accumulation of all powers,legislative,executive,and judiciary,in the same hands,may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.the federalist,cooke ed.madison.although modern administrative agencies fit most comfortably within the executive branch,as a practical matter they exercise legislative power,by promulgating regulations with the force of law executive power,by policing compliance with those regulations and judicial power,by adjudicating enforcement actions and imposing sanctions on those found to have violated their rules.the accumulation of these powers in the same hands is not an occasional or isolated exception to the constitutional plan it is a central feature of modern american government.
the administrative state wields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life.free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,slip,at.the framers could hardly have envisioned today vast and varied federal bureaucracy and the authority administrative agencies now hold over our economic,social,and political activities.ibid.t he administrative state with its reams of regulations would leave them rubbing their eyes.alden maine,souter,dissenting,quoted in federal maritime comm south carolina ports authority.and the federal bureaucracy continues to grow in the last years,congress has launched more than new agencies.compare office of the federal register,united states government manual,with office of the federal register,united states government manual.and more are on the way.see,congressional research service,copeland,new entities created pursuant to the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca creates,requires others to create,or authorizes dozens of new entities to implement the legislation 
although the constitution empowers the president to keep federal officers accountable,administrative agencies enjoy in practice a significant degree of independence.as scholars have noted,no president or his executive office staff could,and presumably none would wish to,supervise so broad a swath of regulatory activity.kagan,presidential administration,harv,see also breyer,making our democracy work the president may not have the time or willingness to review agency decisions president truman colorfully described his power over the administrative state by complaining,i thought i was the president,but when it comes to these bureaucrats,i ca do a damn thing.see nathan,the administrative presidency.president kennedy once told a constituent,i agree with you,but i do know if the government will.see,at.the collection of agencies housed outside the traditional executive departments,including the federal communications commission,is routinely described as the headless fourth branch of government,reflecting not only the scope of their authority but their practical independence.see,administrative conference of united states,lewis selin,sourcebook of united states executive agencies.
as for judicial oversight,agencies enjoy broad power to construe statutory provisions over which they have been given interpretive authority.in chevron natural resources defense council,we established a test for reviewing an agency construction of the statute which it administers.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we said,that is the end of the matter.ibid.a contrary agency interpretation must give way.but if congress has not expressed a specific intent,a court is bound to defer to any permissible construction of the statute,even if that is not the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.at,and.
when it applies,chevron is a powerful weapon in an agency regulatory arsenal.congressional delegations to agencies are often ambiguous expressing a mood rather than a message.friendly,the federal administrative agencies the need for better definition of standards,harv.by design or default,congress often fails to speak to the precise question before an agency.in the absence of such an answer,an agency interpretation has the full force and effect of law,unless it exceeds the bounds of the permissible.barnhart walton.
it would be a bit much to describe the result as the very definition of tyranny,but the danger posed by the growing power of the administrative state can not be dismissed.see,talk america,michigan bell telephone,scalia,concurring slip,at noting that the fcc has repeatedly been rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its text,and has repeatedly sought new means to the same ends sackett epa,slip,at rejecting agency argument that would enable the of regulated parties into voluntary compliance without the opportunity for judicial review 
what the court says in footnote of its opinion is good,and true except of course for the dissent overstates part.ante,at.the framers did divide governmental power in the manner the court describes,for the purpose of safeguarding liberty.and yet the citizen confronting thousands of pages of regulations promulgated by an agency directed by congress to regulate,say,in the public interest can perhaps be excused for thinking that it is the agency really doing the legislating.and with hundreds of federal agencies poking into every nook and cranny of daily life,that citizen might also understandably question whether presidential oversight a critical part of the constitutional plan is always an effective safeguard against agency overreaching.
it is against this background that we consider whether the authority of administrative agencies should be augmented even further,to include not only broad power to give definitive answers to questions left to them by congress,but also the same power to decide when congress has given them that power.
before proceeding to answer that question,however,it is necessary to sort through some confusion over what this litigation is about.the source of the confusion is a familiar culprit the concept of jurisdiction,which we have repeatedly described as a word with many,too many,meanings.union pacific locomotive engineers.
the court states that the question is whether a court must defer under chevron to an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency statutory authority that is,its jurisdiction.ante,at.that is fine until the parenthetical.the parties,amici,and court below too often use the term jurisdiction imprecisely,which leads the court to misunderstand the argument it must confront.that argument is not that there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,some big,important ones that define the agency jurisdiction,and other humdrum,ones that are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.ibid.the argument is instead that a court should not defer to an agency on whether congress has granted the agency interpretive authority over the statutory ambiguity at issue.
you can call that jurisdiction if you like,as petitioners do in the question presented.but given that the term is ambiguous,more is required to understand its use in that question than simply having read it.ante,at.it is important to keep in mind that the term,in the present context,has the more precise meaning noted above,encompassing congressionally delegated authority to issue interpretations with the force and effect of law.see,case below the issue in the instant case is whether the fcc possessed statutory authority to administer c b ii and v by adopting the and time frames and that has nothing do with whether the statutory provisions at issue are big or small.
it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.marbury madison,cranch.the rise of the modern administrative state has not changed that duty.indeed,the administrative procedure act,governing judicial review of most agency action,instructs reviewing courts to decide all relevant questions of law.
we do not ignore that command when we afford an agency statutory interpretation chevron deference we respect it.we give binding deference to permissible agency interpretations of statutory ambiguities because congress has delegated to the agency the authority to interpret those ambiguities with the force of law.united states mead,see also monaghan,marbury and the administrative state,colum,the court is not abdicating its constitutional duty to say what the law is by deferring to agency interpretations of law it is simply applying the law as made by the authorized entity 
but before a court may grant such deference,it must on its own decide whether congress the branch vested with lawmaking authority under the constitution has in fact delegated to the agency lawmaking power over the ambiguity at issue.see ante,at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in judgment the question whether congress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide an interpretation that carries the force of law is for the judge to answer independently.agencies are creatures of congress an agency literally has no power to act unless and until congress confers power upon it.louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc.whether congress has conferred such power is the relevant question of law that must be answered before affording chevron deference.
our precedents confirm this conclusion beginning with chevron itself.in chevron,the epa promulgated a regulation interpreting the term stationary sources in the clean air act,at quoting b ed.an environmental group petitioned for review of the rule,challenging it as an impermissible interpretation of the act,at.finding the statutory text not dispositive and the legislative history silent on the precise issue,we upheld the rule,at.
in our view,the challenge to the agency interpretation center ed on the wisdom of the agency policy,rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by congress.at.judges,we said,are not experts in the field,and are not part of either political branch of the government.at.thus,because congress had not answered the specific question at issue,judges had no business providing their own resolution on the basis of their personal policy preferences.ibid.instead,the agency to which congress ha d delegated policymaking responsibilities was the appropriate political actor to resolve the competing interests at stake,within the limits of that delegation.ibid.
chevron rule of deference was based on and limited by this congressional delegation.and the court did not ask simply whether congress had delegated to the epa the authority to administer the clean air act generally.we asked whether congress had delegat ed authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.at emphasis added see,at discussing the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question emphasis added.we deferred to the epa interpretation of stationary sources based on our conclusion that the agency had been charged with responsibility for administering the provision.at emphasis added.
we have never faltered in our understanding of this straightforward principle,that whether a particular agency interpretation warrants chevron deference turns on the court determination whether congress has delegated to the agency the authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity at issue.
we made the point perhaps most clearly in adams fruit barrett.in that case,the department of labor contended the court should defer to its interpretation of the scope of the private right of action provided by the migrant and seasonal agriculture worker protection act awpa,against employers who intentionally violated the act motor vehicle safety provisions.we refused to do so.although as an initial matter we rejected the idea that congress left a statutory gap for the agency to fill,we reasoned that if the awpa language establishing a private right of action is ambiguous,the secretary of labor interpretation of its scope did not warrant chevron deference,at.
in language directly applicable to the question before us,we explained that a precondition to deference under chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.ibid.although congress clearly envisioned,indeed expressly mandated,a role for the department of labor in administering the statute by requiring the secretary to promulgate standards implementing awpa motor vehicle provisions,we found n o such delegation regarding awpa enforcement provisions.at emphasis added.it would therefore be inappropriate,we said,to consult executive interpretations of the enforcement provisions to resolve ambiguities surrounding the scope of awpa judicially enforceable remedy.ibid.without questioning the principle that agency determinations within the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference,we explained that it is fundamental that an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.ibid.quoting federal maritime comm seatrain lines.
our subsequent cases follow the same approach.in united states mead,supra,for example,chevron deference turned on whether congress had delegated to the agency authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity by a particular means.the customs service had issued a classification ruling,interpreting the term diaries in a tariff schedule to include day planners of the type mead imported,and on that basis subjected the planners to a tariff.mead protested the imposition of the tariff,the customs service claimed chevron deference for its interpretation,and the controversy made its way to our court,at.
in mead,we again made clear that the category of interpretative choices to which chevron deference applies is defined by congressional intent,at.chevron deference,we said,rests on a recognition that congress has delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to implement a particular provision or answer a particular question.ibid.quoting chevron,at.an agency interpretation of a particular statutory provision thus qualifies for chevron deference only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was in the exercise of that authority.at.
the court did not defer to the agency views but instead determined that congress had not delegated interpretive authority to the customs service to definitively construe the tariff schedule through classification rulings.neither the statutory authorization for the classification rulings,nor the customs service practice in issuing such rulings,reasonably suggest ed that congress ever thought of such classification rulings as deserving the deference claimed for them.at.and in the absence of such a delegation,we concluded the interpretations adopted in those rulings were beyond the chevron pale.at.
gonzales oregon,is in the same line of precedent.in that case,as here,deference turned on whether a congressional delegation of interpretive authority reached a particular statutory ambiguity.the attorney general claimed chevron deference for his interpretation of the phrase legitimate medical purpose in the controlled substances act csa to exclude the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisting suicide,at.no one disputed that legitimate medical purpose was ambiguous in the relevant sense.at.nor did any justice dispute that the attorney general had been granted the power in the csa to promulgate rules with the force of law.see,at scalia,dissenting.nevertheless,the court explained,chevron deference is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.at.the regulation advancing the interpretation,we said,must be promulgated pursuant to authority congress has delegated to the official.ibid.citing mead,supra,at.
in the csa,congress delegated to the attorney general the authority to promulgate regulations relating to the registration and control of the manufacture,distribution,and dispensing of controlled substances,or for the efficient execution of his functions under the csa,b.after considering the text,structure,and purpose of the act,the court concluded on its own that interpreting legitimate medical purpose fell under neither delegation.gonzales,at.because the regulation was not promulgated pursuant to the attorney general authority,its interpretation of legitimate medical purpose d id not receive chevron deference.at.
adams fruit,mead,and gonzales thus confirm that chevron deference is based on,and finds legitimacy as,a congressional delegation of interpretive authority.an agency interpretation warrants such deference only if congress has delegated authority to definitively interpret a particular ambiguity in a particular manner.whether congress has done so must be determined by the court on its own before chevron can apply.see edwards,elliot,levy,federal courts standards of review ed.a court decides de novo whether an agency has acted within the bounds of congressionally delegated authority citing mead,supra,at,and gonzales,supra,at sales adler,the rest is silence chevron deference,agency jurisdiction,and statutory silences,if delegation really is antecedent to deference,as mead insists,it can not be that courts should defer to an agency views on whether a delegation has taken place 
in other words,we do not defer to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous provision unless congress wants us to,and whether congress wants us to is a question that courts,not agencies,must decide.simply put,that question is beyond the chevron pale.mead,supra,at.
despite these precedents,the fcc argues that a court need only locate an agency and a grant of general rulemaking authority over a statute.chevron deference then applies,it contends,to the agency interpretation of any ambiguity in the act,including ambiguity in a provision said to carve out specific provisions from the agency general rulemaking authority.if congress intends to exempt part of the statute from the agency interpretive authority,the fcc says,congress can ordinarily be expected to state that intent explicitly.brief for federal respondents citing american hospital nlrb.
if a congressional delegation of interpretive authority is to support chevron deference,however,that delegation must extend to the specific statutory ambiguity at issue.the appropriate question is whether the delegation covers the specific provision and particular question before the court.chevron,at.a congressional grant of authority over some portion of a statute does not necessarily mean that congress granted the agency interpretive authority over all its provisions.see adams fruit,at.
an example that might highlight the point concerns statutes that parcel out authority to multiple agencies,which may be the norm,rather than an exception.gersen,overlapping and underlapping jurisdiction in administrative law,see,gonzales,s,at describing shared over the csa between the attorney general and the secretary of health and human services sutton united air lines,authority to issue regulations implementing the americans with disabilities act is split primarily among three government agencies the wall street reform and consumer protection act,for example,authorizes rulemaking by at least eight different agencies.see research service,copeland,rulemaking requirements and authorities in the wall street reform and consumer protection act.when presented with an agency interpretation of such a statute,a court can not simply ask whether the statute is one that the agency administers the question is whether authority over the particular ambiguity at issue has been delegated to the particular agency.
by the same logic,even when congress provides interpretive authority to a single agency,a court must decide if the ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with the force of law is one to which the congressional delegation extends.a general delegation to the agency to administer the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that congress has delegated interpretive authority over the ambiguity at issue.but if congress has exempted particular provisions from that authority,that exemption must be respected,and the determination whether congress has done so is for the courts alone.
the fcc argument that congress can ordinarily be expected to state that intent explicitly,brief for federal respondents citing american hospital,supra,goes to the merits of that
