young hee kwak petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an order of the immigration judge ij denying kwak application for a continuance of proceedings and entering an order of removal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the bia decision and deny kwak petition for review.
young hee kwak,a native and citizen of south korea,was detained upon reentry to the united states on april.five days prior,kwak had married a naturalized united states citizen of south korean birth.according to kwak,before visiting south korea for the marriage,he had been a student in new york and had moved to cleveland with his fianc√©e shortly before the wedding trip.upon entry,immigration officials determined that kwak possessed an expired visa that had been modified to appear current.kwak confessed that he and a friend altered the document and assured officials that he had a valid visa in cleveland that he had forgot to bring with him to south korea.the immigration and naturalization service ins charged kwak with procuring a visa or other documentation by fraud and seeking to procure entry into the united states by fraud and with appearing not to be in possession of a valid visa in violation of a c i and a a i i.
the ins granted kwak a visa to attend deferred exclusion proceedings against him in may.after a continuance to permit a change of venue,a second hearing was held in detroit,michigan,on january.at that point,the ij issued a second continuance to await the outcome of kwak wife petition to establish relative status,which kwak intended to use to apply for an adjustment of status.the was later approved.kwak was granted a third continuance in august but failed to appear at the next scheduled appearance on september,at which point the ij continued proceedings until february.
on april,the ij granted kwak motion to close his case administratively in order to permit the adjudication of his applications for a waiver of grounds of excludability petition and an adjustment of status petition.the ins denied both applications on january,and the government subsequently moved to reopen and recalendar kwak case.exclusion proceedings were reopened,and the ij issued a continuance at the first hearing on april,because kwak had only retained counsel the preceding day.in the meantime,kwak appealed the denial of his to the administrative appeals unit aau of the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis,which had since succeeded the ins.consequently,kwak requested another continuance at his june,exclusion hearing.the government agreed,and the ij continued proceedings until november.at that hearing,kwak counsel requested one more continuance on the ground that kwak was awaiting the outcome of his appeal to the aau of a denial of an petition for permanent status as an alien worker.the government did not object but noted that by the next hearing we require r elief or some sort of forward progress on the case.the ij granted the continuance but noted that i t the last continuance,even if the government wants to give another continuance.on march,the government again did not object to another motion for continuance because an aau decision on the denied was expected within several months.the ij granted the continuance but warned that this really is the final continuance and i wish that both sides would know that.
at the subsequent july,exclusion hearing,kwak again requested a continuance pending the aau determination.the government opposed,and the ij stated that he was going to review the case further and he would either send kwak a hearing notice or a final order in the case in a few days.the ij continued the proceedings,but the aau appeal was still pending at the next scheduled hearing on september.the ij again stated that he would review the case before issuing either a continuance or a final order.the government registered its objection to what would be the tenth continuance in the case and the sixth since reopening the case.
on september,the ij denied kwak request for a continuance and issued an order of removal.the ij noted that kwak case had been administratively closed pending adjudication by the uscis,that the department of homeland security dhs had finally denied kwak applications in,and that kwak had received numerous continuances since the case was reopened to permit adjudication by the aau.the ij further recognized that i t is not an abuse of discretion for the ij to deny a motion for a continuance after repeated continuances have been granted,based on the possibility that the proper documentation may be approved in the future,and that the respondent at some point may be eligible for adjustment of status.
the bia affirmed the ij denial of the continuance.pointing out the lengthy procedural history of the case and the number of prior granted continuances,the bia agreed that kwak failed to show good cause for yet another.citing matter of hashmi,which was handed down after the ij issued his order,the bia found that kwak had not demonstrated that he was likely to succeed on the merits of his aau appeal and had not even set out the grounds for his appeal.the bia also relied on the dhs opposition to this continuance as an additional ground for the ij denial.kwak timely petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal subject to the limitations of a.a.subsection b ii of that provision states that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general in gonzales,cir,we held that although the grant of a motion for a continuance is at the discretion of the ij pursuant to,we have jurisdiction to review an ij denial of such a motion.however,the supreme court recent decision in kucana holder,calls into question the reasoning underpinning that holding and compels us to reconsider whether we have jurisdiction to review denials of a motion for a continuance.we conclude that we do.
our determination in rested in part on a distinction that we drew between a determination at the discretion of the ij and one at the discretion of the attorney general,the former not being precluded by a b ii.see,at.in kucana,however,the supreme court found no such distinction and held that the adjudicator in immigration cases exercises authority delegated by the attorney general.at.kucana further held that a b precludes judicial review of determinations of the attorney of the discretionary by statute,but does not preclude review of those determinations made discretionary by regulation.id.at.an ij discretion to grant a motion for a continuance derives not from statute but from,and,therefore,we hold that the denial of such a motion is subject to review by this court.thimran holder,cir holding that kucana compelled the conclusion that appellate courts have jurisdiction to review denials of motions for a continuance juarez holder,cir finding that kucana foreclosed the government argument that a b precludes review of motions for a continuance by a federal appellate court.consequently,we will next address the merits of kwak claim.
because the bia did not summarily affirm or adopt the ij reasoning and provided an explanation for its decision,we review the bia decision as the final agency determination.mukasey,cir citations omitted.we review the bia affirmance under an standard.id.citing,at.in determining whether the board abused its discretion,we must decide whether the denial was made without rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination abu khaliel,at quoting balani ins,cir omissions in original.
an ij may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.finding good cause is crucial since a continuance,in effect,allows an alien to remain in the united states for a period of time without any defined legal immigration status.an unreasonable continuance would thwart the operation of the statutes providing for removal of inadmissible and deportable aliens.ukpabi mukasey,c
