medicare is a federal program providing subsidized health insurance for the aged and disabled.see et.the secretary of health and human services the secretary,kathleen sebelius,is charged by congress with administering the medicare statute.id.a.
part b of the medicare act extends coverage to certain types of durable medical equipment dme for qualified recipients.a id.s.not all dme is guaranteed coverage under medicare part b,however.the medicare statute explicitly provides that no payment may be made under part b of this subchapter for any expenses incurred for items which are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.id.a a.
acting through her operating components,the secretary can elect to determine the coverage of dme in one of three ways.first,she can make a national coverage determination ncd binding throughout the medicare system and not subject to review by administrative law judges.id.f b.second,one of the private insurance carriers with whom the secretary contracts to administer claims under part b,see id.a,can issue a local coverage determination lcd respecting whether or not a particular item or service is covered on an intermediary or basis.id.f b.finally,if no ncd or lcd is in place,contractors may make individual claim determinations,including whether a particular dme meets the statutory requirement of being reasonable and necessary.
the secretary has also developed guidance in the medicare program integrity manual mpim for medicare contractors applying the reasonable and necessary standard.rather than create distinct criteria for individual claim determinations and lcds,the secretary has directed contractors to apply a uniform set of standards,providing that w hen making individual claim determinations,a service may be covered by a contractor if it meets all of the conditions listed in mpim,reasonable and necessary provisions in lcds below.mpim,individual claim determinations.for a device to be considered reasonable and necessary,contractors must determine that the item is safe and effective not experimental or investigational and appropriate in terms of both accepted medical practice and the patient medical need.mpim,reasonable and necessary provisions in lcds.
the secretary has also instructed contractors as to the type of evidence to be used in making these technical determinations.such decisions should be based on either published authoritative evidence such as definitive randomized clinical trials or general acceptance by the medical community,with the caveat that a cceptance by individual health care providers and limited case studies distributed by sponsors with a financial interest in the outcome are not sufficient evidence of general acceptance by the medical community.mpim,evidence supporting lcds.

the dme at issue in this case is the bionicare stimulator system,model bio,a medical device used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee by delivering electrical pulses to the joint.the device was originally developed by murray electronics,which sought approval from the food and drug administration fda under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act to market the device.the bio was originally submitted for pre market approval pma,the most stringent review under the act,which requires sophisticated proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device.see et.in,however,murray electronics notified the fda of its intent to market the bio pursuant to a provision of the statute,known as the k process.see f a ii.
section k allows a device to be marketed based not on independent clinical trials of the device itself,but instead because the device is substantially equivalent to another device that is already on the market.id.fda regulations require that for a device to receive k approval,the device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and the sponsor must demonstrate that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device.b ii b.in july,the fda issued approval under k for the bio to be marketed,finding that it was substantially equivalent to the transcutaneous electric nerve stimulator tens device that was already on the market.
since that time,bionicare has distributed the bio to thousands of patients and submitted numerous medicare claims.while some contractors have provided medicare coverage for the bio,others have frequently refused to cover the device.at issue in this appeal are eight groups of claims denying coverage,which were appealed through the entire administrative process to the mac.in seven of those cases,the secretary,through the mac,determined that the bio was not reasonable and necessary and was therefore excluded from the statutory coverage of medicare part all seven cases relied on bionicare failure to provide evidence in accordance with mpim that demonstrated that the device was safe and effective.appellant br.at describing the,and decisions.in the eighth case,bionicare did not appeal the alj determination that the device was reasonable and necessary,and so the mac did not address that question.instead,the mac merely affirmed a payment calculation based on a local fee schedule that was unfavorable to bionicare.appellant br.at describing decision.
plaintiff monique almy,the chapter trustee for the bankruptcy estate of bionicare,filed this lawsuit in may,seeking a reversal of the mac decisions.both almy and the secretary moved for summary judgment,and on september,the district court granted the secretary motion in full.this appeal followed.
a brief discussion of the standard of review of the secretary decision is necessary at the outset.
with respect to factual determinations,the medicare statute specifies that the findings of the secretary as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.g.the supreme court has defined substantial evidence as more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consolidated edison nlrb.our review is therefore necessarily a limited one.w e do not undertake to conflicting evidence,make credibility determinations,or substitute our judgment for that of the secretary.where conflicting evidence allows reasonable minds to differ,the responsibility for that decision falls on the secretary.craig chater,cir.
quite apart from matters of fact,the secretary decisions are governed by the administrative procedure act apa,which requires courts to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,otherwise not in accordance with law,or without observance of procedure required by law.our court has been clear that r eview under this standard is highly deferential,with a presumption in favor of finding the agency action valid.ohio vall.envt l coalition aracoma coal,cir.in practice,an action will not be considered arbitrary and capricious so long as the agency has examined the relevant data and provided an explanation of its decision that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.at quoting motor veh.mfrs.ass state farm mut.ins,d.
in addition to these statutory directives,a variety of judicial doctrines require that courts not casually overturn the secretary decisions.first,it is well recognized that the secretary interpretation of what is reasonable and necessary under the medicare act is entitled to judicial deference pursuant to chevron,natural res.def.council,d.b ecause the secretary is charged with administering the medicare act,we substantially defer to the secretary construction of any ambiguous language in the act,if the secretary construction is based on a permissible construction of the statute.mackenzie medical supply,leavitt,cir quoting id.at.
second,the secretary is also entitled to deference under bowles seminole rock sand,for her interpretation of the regulations that implement the medicare act reasonable and necessary standard.this principle requires courts to give an agency view of its own regulations controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.at.the supreme court has emphasized the importance of careful adherence to this standard in the medicare context,which deals with a complex and highly technical regulatory program,in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.th.jefferson shalala,d 
thus the very nature of the medicare program suggests that the secretary determinations are entitled to deference from this court.the parties agree that medicare regulation is technical and complex and that the secretary has longstanding expertise in the area,circumstances under which principles of deference have particular force.alum.of amer.cent.lincoln peoples util,d.because the determination of what is reasonable and necessary also requires a significant degree of medical judgment,we must be mindful that w hen examining this kind of scientific determination,as opposed to simple findings of fact,a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential.balt.gas natural res.def.council,d.
with these limitations in mind,we consider in turn bionicare three challenges to the mac decisions affirmed by the district court.first,bionicare disputes the secretary use of the individual adjudication process at all,arguing that she should instead have issued an ncd or lcd for the bio.second,even if adjudication was the correct process,bionicare asserts that the mac decisions were not supported by substantial evidence.finally,bionicare alleges a variety of procedural errors at the various rungs of the administrative ladder that it claims infect the mac ultimate decisions.
bionicare contends that because the mac decisions were based on the safety and effectiveness of the bio generally,rather than the medical necessity of the device for any particular patient,the secretary erred by proceeding through individual adjudications,and she should instead have issued an ncd or lcd to implement a prospective coverage policy.but bionicare ignores directly applicable supreme court precedent,which makes clear that the secretary enjoys full discretion to choose to proceed by adjudication rather than by rulemaking.
one of the earliest principles developed in american administrative law was the idea that the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual,ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.sec chenery.the medicare statute preserves this discretion for the secretary,leaving it to her judgment whether to proceed by implementing an ncd,by allowing regional contractors to adopt an lcd,or by deciding individual cases through the adjudicative process.indeed,in heckler ringer,d,the supreme court expressly foreclosed the argument that bionicare now presses,holding that t he secretary decision as to whether a particular medical service is reasonable and necessary and the means by which she implements her decision,whether by promulgating a generally applicable rule or by allowing individual adjudication,are clearly discretionary decisions.id.at.
not only does the secretary have the discretion to choose which route to take in assessing the part b coverage for a device,but bionicare asserted concern that the secretary is improperly implement ing a coverage policy,appellant br.at,is simply illusory.the secretary own regulations make clear that any policy implications in an adjudication do not have precedential effect.see,if an alj or mac declines to follow a policy in a particular case,the decision to disregard such policy applies only to the specific claim being considered and does not have precedential effect.the purported policy in this case is nothing more than the accretion of individual decisions finding that the bio does not meet the statutory requirements for coverage.
our court has previously refused to constrict the flexibility of the secretary in implementing the reasonable and necessary standard,mackenzie medical supply,at,but that is precisely what bionicare asks us to do.as the district court correctly recognized,the result of bionicare theory would be to effectively requir e the secretary to issue coverage rules for each and every item of dme before issuing case adjudications.almy sebelius,d.but congress has clearly left it to the discretion of the secretary to decide how to deal with hundreds of millions of part b claims for coverage of thousands of devices every year.the medicare act has produced a complex and highly technical regulatory program,the administration of which turns on t he identification and classification of medical eligibility criteria that necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.pauley bethenergy mines,d.these are the hallmarks of agency discretion,and bionicare points to no statutory text or other legal basis that would allow the courts to inject themselves into the administration of the part b claims process.congress has not seen fit to set mandatory conditions for the use of ncds or lcds,and we refuse to craft such requirements out of whole cloth.
the supreme court has long warned about the unsuitability of precisely the kind of rule bionicare urges us to adopt to hold that the secretary had no alternative in this proceeding but to approve the proposed transaction,while formulating any general rules it might desire for use in future cases of this nature,would be to stultify the administrative process.chenery,at.and like the supreme court,t hat we refuse to do.id.
bionicare next major claim is that the secretary decisions were not supported by substantial evidence as required by both the medicare statute and the apa.this allegation comes in three parts.first,bionicare asserts that the secretary applied the wrong standard in assessing the relevant evidence.second,it claims that the secretary has a heightened burden of proof.bionicare asserts that it made a prima facie case for coverage,which requires the secretary to produce affirmative evidence in rebuttal in order for the mac denial of coverage to be supported by substantial evidence.finally,bionicare claims that it did in fact produce adequate evidence to justify coverage of the bio,and that the mac critique of that proof is inadequate to support a denial of such coverage.we disagree with bionicare on all three fronts.
bionicare first contends that the mac decisions applied the wrong standard for individual claim determinations,arguing that the mac erroneously relied on standards only applicable to lcds.the secretary has,however,made clear that the same criteria that govern lcds should also govern individual adjudications.mpim,individual claim determinations,specifically provides that for individual adjudications,contractors should use the standards set out for lcds in mpim.it is that section,entitled reasonable and necessary provisions in lcds,that sets out the substantive criteria that a device must meet in order to receive coverage.specifically,in order to be considered reasonable and necessary,see a a,a device must be safe and effective not experimental or investigational and appropriate,mpim,and bionicare does not dispute that a device must meet those requirements in order to receive part b coverage.
bionicare contends,however,that the secretary erred by using the guidelines of mpfm,evidence supporting lcds,to evaluate the studies it offered to show that the bio was safe and effective.bionicare argues that these standards apply only to lcds,and not to individual adjudications.as we have explained,however,the secretary has adopted a single set of standards that governs both lcds and individual adjudications.the mpfm section on individual adjudications,indisputably incorporates by reference the substantive criteria applicable to lcds in,and mpfm does no more than explicate the type of evidence that may demonstrate a device compliance with the conjunctive standards of.specifically,mpim requires a claimant to show that a device is safe and effective through published authoritative evidence such as definitive randomized clinical trials or general acceptance by the medical community,with the qualification that a cceptance by individual health care providers and limited case studies distributed by sponsors with a financial interest in the outcome are not sufficient evidence of general acceptance by the medical community.mpim,evidence supporting lcds.far from being arbitrary or capricious,the secretary has directed contractors to use uniform criteria in assessing part b coverage,supported by uniform types of evidence,and it was not erroneous or inconsistent for the mac to have applied the requirements of mpim.
second,bionicare disputes the appropriate burden of proof that governs a reasonable and necessary determination by the mac.it claims that,having made a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the secretary to rebut that evidence with her own offer of proof,and that it is insufficient for the mac to provide merely a critique of bionicare showing.but there is no basis in law for this assertion.it is well established that a claimant has the burden of proving entitlement to medicare benefits,friedman sec y of of health and hum,cir.
even the case bionicare cites in support of its conclusion,off.of workers comp.progs.greenwich collieries,d,does not point to a different result.while it is doubtful that the standards for formal adjudication at issue in that case even apply to these informal proceedings under the medicare act,the most that the greenwich collieries court concluded was that when the party with the burden of persuasion establishes a prima facie case supported by credible and credited evidence,it must either be rebutted or accepted as true.id.at.here,the mac conclusion was that bionicare had failed to satisfy the critical first step,because it did not provide credible and credited evidence,as measured against the standards set out in mpim.
using the appropriate standard of review and burden of proof,the secretary determination that bionicare did not establish that the bio was safe and effective and not experimental or investigational was in fact supported by substantial evidence.it is not our office to tender an independent judgment on the value and validity of the various scientific studies submitted.we ask only whether the secretary assessment was a reasonable one,and we are satisfied that it was.
the mac reviewed the studies submitted by bionicare in support of the bio and identified numerous deficiencies that deprived them of persuasive value.bionicare submitted separate studies.five of these included no analysis and were merely conclusory.eight did not discuss the type of electrical stimulation treatment for which the bio was ostensibly prescribed.one referred to a device other than the bio.and three tested electrical stimulation treatments in animals.
the mac identified additional methodological errors in the four remaining studies that did actually address the bio safety and effectiveness in humans and that could potentially offer credible evidence.all four studies failed to isolate the effect of concurrent drug therapy.in other words,they failed to exclude the possibility that other drugs or regimens besides the bio accounted for any patient improvement.two studies had small sample sizes,one of only subjects and another with subjects.two others had experimental design problems one study was not randomized or,and the other lacked a proper control group.
in addition,the mac discounted these four studies because the authors all had financial ties to either bionicare or the bio original developer murray electronics.the regulations pertaining to acceptable evidence in the mpim explicitly provide that limited case studies distributed by sponsors with a financial interest in the outcome are not sufficient evidence of general acceptance by the medical community.mpim,evidence supporting lcds.
bionicare asserts that because its studies were independently published,they were not distributed by sponsors,and therefore not within this rule.given the substantial deference that we owe the secretary reasonable interpretations of her own regulations,however,we can not conclude that her actions were unreasonable.see seminole rock,at.it is a maxim of evidence that a party interest in a potential outcome can affect his objectivity,and the mpim regulation is clearly directed at ensuring that coverage decisions rest on an objective and disinterested foundation.the financial interest of those conducting studies goes to the credibility of the supporting evidence,and this court has been clear that absent extraordinary circumstances,we will not disturb an agency credibility determinations.transpersonnel,cir 
while the record is more than sufficient to justify the secretary factual conclusion that bionicare had not carried its burden of showing that the bio was safe and effective,our analysis is not scientifically detailed.nor would such an assessment be permitted.the supreme court has warned time and again that a technical factual dispute simply underscores the appropriateness of deferring to agency decisions.talk america.bell,d.properly mindful of this fact,bionicare brief does not explore the substance of the science.for we as a court are confronted with a problem in administrative law,not in chemistry,biology,medicine,or ecology.it is the administrative agency which has been called upon to hear and evaluate testimony relevant to its ultimate question.envt l def.fund epa.the mac has greater expertise and stands in a better position than this court to make the technical and policy judgments necessary to administer the complex regulatory program at issue.talk america.at.the court role is to perform the narrowly defined duty of holding agencies to certain minimal standards of rationality.ethyl epa.there can be little doubt that the secretary decisions surpass that threshold and are supported by substantial evidence.
even though the secretary exercised her statutory discretion to proceed through adjudication,and her decisions were supported by substantial evidence,bionicare nevertheless contends that the secretary committed a variety of procedural errors that fatally undermine the mac decisions.these claims are rooted in the familiar standards of the apa,a,which permits a court to set aside agency actions,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.this is a demanding burden for bionicare to carry.as this court has noted,w hen the question before the court is whether an agency has properly interpreted and applied its own regulation,the reviewing court must give the agency interpretation substantial deference,thompson,cir quoting th.jefferson,at.bionicare has failed to demonstrate that the mac application of the relevant standards was plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations,seminole rock,at,and these claims therefore have no merit.
bionicare contends that the secretary failed to give adequate consideration to the fda clearance of the bio for marketing under the k process.it argues that fda clearance per se satisfies the requirement of mpim that,in order to be considered reasonable and necessary,a supplier must establish that a device is safe and effective and not experimental or investigational.this argument misapprehends,however,both the separate statutory allocations of interpretive authority to the secretary and to the fda and the relative import of the fda k clearance.
the medicare statute clearly vests the secretary with the authority to interpret when a device is reasonable and necessary,and therefore eligible for coverage under part b.the statute contemplates no role for the fda,which is charged with applying the standards of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,not the medicare statute.the fda examines the labeled use of a device only,concentrating its review on the safety of a device,whereas medicare review focus es on a device under average conditions of use to determine whether the device meets the broader requirement of the medicare statute that a device be reasonable and necessary.the secretary has underscored this difference,noting that medicare contractors make coverage determinations and the fda conducts premarket review of products under different statutory standards and different delegated authority.the statement proceeds to make clear that while fda approval has been adopted as a prerequisite to medicare coverage,fda alone does not generally entitle that device to coverage.id.while fda approval may thus inform the secretary decision as to whether a device is reasonable and necessary,it can not tie the secretary hands.
this holds especially true for a device such as the bio,which was only cleared by the fda under the abbreviated k process.the secretary has long noted the significance of the type of clearance a device receives fda approval will not necessarily lead to a favorable coverage recommendation,particularly if fda requirements have been met by means of a notice issued under section k this is because a section k notice generally does not involve clinical data showing safety and effectiveness.section k approval requires only that a device be substantially equivalent to another device that the fda has already approved for marketing,and not that the device have been clinically examined for safety and effectiveness.the supreme court has emphasized this distinction,noting that a device approved under k has never been formally reviewed for safety or efficacy.medtronic,lohr,d.in the face of such consistent statements that fda approval alone is not enough,and that k clearance is especially deficient,we can not say that it was arbitrary or capricious of the secretary to require additional proof of the bio safety and effectiveness.
not only was the bio not subject to the more demanding safety review of the pre market approval pma process,neither was the tens device that served as the predicate for the k clearance.because the tens device was marketed prior to the medical device amendments to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,its market approval was grandfathered rather than the result of satisfying the requirements of the pma regime.in short,the fda clearance of the bio was based on its equivalence to a device that was never itself tested for safety and effectiveness.it was therefore surely reasonable for the secretary to require evidence in addition to the mere fact of k approval to demonstrate the bio safety and effectiveness.
bionicare further undercut the already limited significance of the substantially equivalent k clearance in the medicare administrative proceedings by highlighting differences between the bio and the tens device.the tens device seeks to mask pain in nerve tissue by sending high voltage electrical impulses that interrupt pain signals to the brain.the bio,by contrast,operates on cartilage tissue,using smaller impulses intended to actually improve the condition of knee joints rather than merely hide the discomfort of the underlying condition.bionicare also charges significantly more for the bio than medicare allows providers to charge for the tens device.it was reasonable of the secretary to conclude that bionicare representations showed that the bio average conditions of use were quite different from the uses of the tens device that served as the predicate to the fda k clearance,and that the fda clearance was therefore not adequate proof of the device safety and effectiveness.
bionicare attempts to claim credit for having initially submitted the bio under the pma process,under which t he fda evaluates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label.riegel medtronic,d.we need not consider here whether pma approval would per se satisfy the requirements of mpim,because although the bio was submitted for pma approval,it only received approval under section k.it is immaterial that the fda suggested that bionicare withdraw its request for pma review and accept a k approval as a result of increasing congressional pressure to clear out its backlog.appellant br.at.bionicare clearly had the choice to remain in the pma pipeline.had it done so,it could at least now argue to us the greater significance of the more rigorous approval process.instead,it opted for the likely more profitable course of getting the device to market faster.bionicare chose the speedier and route of k clearance,and it can not now claim the legal benefit of a more exacting review process it ultimately elected not to undertake.
bionicare next asserts that the intermediate review by a qualified independent contractor qic failed to comply with regulations requiring input from a panel of physicians or other appropriate health care professionals.a.bionicare is correct that such input was required,both because the initial determination involve d a finding on whether an item or service is reasonable and necessary,and because the claim pertains to the provision of items or services by a physician,id.c.but bionicare only evidence that this requirement was not satisfied is its assertion that the record does not document compliant participation by a physician.as the district court properly found,this allegation does not satisfy bionicare burden to substantiate its claim.see almy,d at.
the regulation imposes no obligation on the qic to document the physician review,and bionicare does not assert that the decisions failed to adequately explain the scientific or medical basis for the qic decision.the presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers,and,in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.united states chem.respect for an administrative agency implementation of its own regulations requires clear evidence to surmount the hurdle of arbitrary and capricious review.bionicare provides no affirmative proof of failure to comply with the regulation,and we have no reason to displace the presumption of regularity that attaches to the actions of government agencies.postal serv.gregory,d.
bionicare last argues that the secretary decisions were arbitrary and capricious because the mac decisions at issue here reach a different result from other decisions at the alj and contractor levels of t
